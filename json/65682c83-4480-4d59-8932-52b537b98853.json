But it was high time someone in this miserable family righted a terrible wrong, high time indeed.</p><p>While he waited for the equipment to be set up, he cleared the clutter from his desk. His gnarled fingers stroked the smooth wood with as much tenderness and care as he had once given his mistresses when he touched them. The desk was old and scarred and as worn out as he was. He had made his fortune in this very room. With his phone glued to his ear, he had worked one lucrative deal after another. How many companies had he purchased in the past thirty years? How many more had he destroyed?</p> <p>He stopped himself from daydreaming about his many victories. Now wasn\u2019t the time. He crossed the room to the bar and poured himself a glass of water from the crystal decanter one of his business associates had given him years ago. After he took a sip, he carried the glass to the desk and placed it on a coaster near the corner. He looked around the paneled library and decided it was too dark for the cameras, so he rushed to turn on all the table lights.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked, impatience brimming in his tone. Pulling the chair out, he sat down, smoothed his hair, and adjusted his suit jacket so the collar wouldn\u2019t stand up. He tugged on his tie as if that would loosen the tightness in his throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare my thoughts now,\u201d he said, his voice raspy from years of barking orders and smoking his cherished Cuban cigars.</p><p>He wanted a cigar now. There weren\u2019t any in the house, though. He\u2019d given up the habit ten years ago, but every once in a while when he was nervous he would get a sudden longing for one.</p><p>At the moment he was not only nervous but also a little fearful, which was an odd, almost unfamiliar, feeling for him. He was desperate to do the right thing before he died, which would be soon now, very soon. He owed at least that much to the MacKenna name.</p><p>The old-fashioned video camera with a VHS tape was positioned on a tripod facing the old man. The digital camera was being held up directly behind the video camera, and the eye was also focused on him.</p> <p>He looked beyond the cameras. \u201cI know you think digital is enough, and you\u2019re probably right, but I still like the old way with the videotape. I don\u2019t trust those discs, and so the videotape will be my backup. You nod,\u201d he instructed, \u201cwhen everything\u2019s turned on, and I\u2019ll begin.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his glass, took a drink, and put it down. The pills those aggravating doctors forced on him made his mouth dry.</p><p>A few seconds later, all was ready, and he began.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Compton Thomas MacKenna. This is not my last will and testament because I\u2019ve already taken care of all that. I changed my will some time ago. The original is in my safe-deposit box; a copy is in my file at the law firm I employ, and there is also another copy, which I assure you will rear its ugly head if for any reason the original and the attorney\u2019s copy are misplaced or destroyed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell any of you about the new will or about the changes I made because I didn\u2019t want to spend my last months being harassed, but now that the doctors have assured me the end is approaching and there is nothing more they can do, I want . . . no, I need,\u201d he corrected, \u201cto explain why I have done what I\u2019ve done . . . though I\u2019m not sure any of you will understand or care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to start my explanation with a brief history of the MacKenna family. My parents were born, raised, and buried in the Highlands of Scotland. My father owned quite a bit of land . . . quite a bit,\u201d he repeated. He paused to clear his throat and take another drink of water before continuing. \u201cWhen he died, the land came to my older brother, Robert Duncan the second, and to me equally. Robert and I traveled to the United States to complete our education, and both of us decided to stay. Years later Robert sold me his share of the land. With his inheritance, that made him a very wealthy man, and it made me the sole heir to the property called Glen MacKenna.</p> <p>\u201cI never married. I had neither the time nor the inclination. Robert married a woman I didn\u2019t approve of, but unlike my brother, I didn\u2019t threaten or carry on because he chose someone I didn\u2019t like. Her name was Caroline . . . a social climber. She obviously married Robert for his money. She certainly never loved him. She did do her duty though and gave him two sons, Robert Duncan the third and Conal Thomas.</p><p>\u201cAnd now to the heart of this history lesson. When my nephew Conal chose to marry a woman without social standing, his father disowned him. Robert had chosen someone else\u2014a woman from an influential family\u2014and he was outraged that his wishes were being ignored. Conal\u2019s wife, Leah, was no better than a street beggar, but Conal didn\u2019t seem to care about the money he would lose.\u201d He let out a huff of disgust and said, \u201cAll Robert had left was his firstborn, a real yes-man who did whatever he was told to do.</p><p>\u201cOver the years I lost track of Conal,\u201d he continued. \u201cToo busy,\u201d he added as an excuse. \u201cAll I knew was that he\u2019d moved to Silver Springs just outside of Charleston. But then I got word that he\u2019d been killed in a car accident. I knew my brother wouldn\u2019t go to the funeral . . . but I went. Not so much from a sense of obligation, I admit. I guess I was curious to see how Conal made out. I didn\u2019t tell Leah or anyone I was there. Kept my distance. The church was packed with mourners. I even went to the cemetery and saw Leah with her three little girls, the youngest no more than a baby.\u201d He stopped as though envisioning the scene. Not wanting to betray any hint of emotion that might cross his faded eyes, he looked away from the camera for a second. He straightened in his chair and resumed. \u201cI saw what I went there to see. The MacKenna line would continue through Conal\u2019s children . . . though it was a pity there weren\u2019t any boys.</p><p>\u201cAs for my brother\u2019s other son . . . Robert the third . . . he indulged him . . . taught him to be useless. He didn\u2019t allow him to have ambition, and in return my brother lived long enough to watch his firstborn drink himself into an early grave.</p><p>\u201cThe sin of excess has been passed down to the next generation. I have watched Robert\u2019s grandsons squander their inheritance and, even worse, defile the MacKenna name. Bryce, the oldest, is following in his father\u2019s footsteps. He married a good woman, Vanessa, but she couldn\u2019t save him from his vices. Like his father, he\u2019s a drunk. He has sold all of his stocks and cashed in his bonds and has gone through every dollar. He spent a good deal on alcohol and women, and only God knows what he did with the rest.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s Roger. He\u2019s been the most elusive\u2014disappearing for weeks at a time\u2014but it didn\u2019t take my sources long to track him down and find out what he\u2019s been up to. It appears Roger has turned to gambling for his amusement. According to the reports, last year alone he lost over four hundred thousand. Four hundred thousand.\u201d The old man shook his head and continued as though the words left a foul taste. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, he\u2019s been dealing with mobsters like Johnny Jackman. Just having the MacKenna name associated with a thug like Jackman makes my stomach turn.</p><p>\u201cEwan, the youngest, can\u2019t or won\u2019t control his temper. If it were not for his high-priced and very clever attorneys, he would be in prison now. Two years ago he nearly beat a man to death.</p><p>\u201cI am disgusted with all of them. They are useless men who have contributed nothing to this world.\u201d The old man pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed at his brow.</p> <p>\u201cWhen those worthless doctors told me I would be here for only a few more months, I decided to take stock.\u201d He turned and opened the side drawer and withdrew a thick black folder. He opened it in the center of the desk and stacked his hands on top of it. \u201cI\u2019ve had an investigator do some checking for me. I wanted to know how Conal\u2019s children turned out. I must admit I had low expectations. I assumed, after Conal\u2019s death, Leah and her girls would have been living hand to mouth. I also assumed none of them would have gone beyond high school . . . if that. I was wrong on both counts. There was enough of a settlement from the insurance company after Conal\u2019s accident that Leah could stay in their house with the children. She took a secretarial position at a girls\u2019 private school. The pay was meager\u2014I don\u2019t suppose Leah was capable of much more\u2014but there was a trade-off. All three of her daughters attended the private lower school and upper school, their tuition waived.\u201d He nodded approval and said, \u201cConal evidently had taught her the value of a proper education.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over the report in the folder. \u201cIt seems that all three of them are hard workers. Not a slacker among them,\u201d he added with emphasis. \u201cThe oldest, Kiera, received a full scholarship to a good university and graduated with honors. She received another scholarship to medical school and is doing exceptionally well. The middle girl, Kate, is the entrepreneur in the family. She, too, received a full scholarship to one of the finest universities in the east and also graduated with honors. She started a business while she was still in school, and today her company is growing and on its way to being very successful.\u201d He looked back at the camera. \u201cIt appears she is most like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel, the youngest, is certainly intelligent as well, but her true talent is her voice. I understand she is quite gifted.\u201d He tapped the report with his index finger. \u201cIsabel plans to study music and history at the university, and it is her desire to one day go to Scotland to meet her distant relatives.\u201d He nodded. \u201cThis news pleases me considerably.</p><p>\u201cAnd now to the changes in my will.\u201d The corners of his mouth lifted slightly in an almost imperceptible, devious smile. It faded as he continued. \u201cBryce and Roger and Ewan will each receive one hundred thousand dollars in cash immediately. It is my hope that the money will be spent on rehabilitation, but I doubt that will happen. Vanessa will also receive one hundred thousand, and she will get this house. She deserves at least that much for having put up with Bryce these past years. She has brought respect to the MacKenna name through her work with various charities and in the community, so I don\u2019t see any sense in punishing her for her choice of husbands.</p><p>\u201cNow to the other MacKennas. I\u2019ve signed over all my treasury bonds to Kiera. The maturity dates are outlined in the will. Isabel, a history buff like me, will receive Glen MacKenna. There are stipulations that go along with it, of course, and she will be apprised of these in due time. This is all they are to receive from me, but I believe I have been more than generous.\u201d</p><p>His breathing became labored and he stopped to take another drink of water, emptying the glass before he finished speaking.</p><p>\u201cFinally, to the bulk of my estate, my assets calculated to be worth eighty million dollars. This is the accumulation of my life\u2019s work and it will be passed on to my blood relations, but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll just hand it over to my depraved nephews, and so it will go to Kate MacKenna. She is the most driven of the whole lot and, like me, knows the value of money. If she chooses this legacy, it\u2019s all hers.</p><p>\u201cI trust that she will not squander it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Kate Mackenna\u2019s Wonderbra saved her life.</p><p>Five minutes after she\u2019d put the thing on, she wanted to take it off. She never should have let her sister Kiera talk her into wearing it. Yes, it did make her look voluptuous and sexy, but was that the message she wanted to send tonight? She was a businesswoman, for Pete\u2019s sake, not a p**n star. Besides, without the push-\u2019em-up-and-out bra she was already sufficiently endowed.</p><p>And why was Kiera so hell-bent on \u201csexing her up\u201d\u2014as she so eloquently put it? Was Kate\u2019s social life that much of a dud? Apparently her sisters thought so.</p><p>Of the three sisters Kiera was the oldest and the bossiest. She had vowed she\u2019d get Kate to wear the little, black, way-too-snug cocktail dress or die trying. Isabel, the youngest, had sided with Kiera, but then she always did, and Kate had finally given in and put on the silk dress just to get them to stop nagging her. When the two of them ganged up on her, they were a force to be reckoned with\u2014a loud, unrelenting force.</p><p>Kate stood in front of the mirror in the foyer tugging on the bra in an attempt to get it to stop digging into her ribs, but her efforts were useless. She checked the time and decided if she hurried she could change, but when she turned to go back up to her room, Kiera walked down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Kiera said after giving her sister the once-over.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired.\u201d Kate was stating the obvious. There were dark circles under Kiera\u2019s eyes. She\u2019d just gotten out of the shower, and her blond hair was dripping on her shoulders. Kate didn\u2019t think she\u2019d even bothered to towel it dry. Her sister wasn\u2019t wearing an ounce of makeup, but she still looked beautiful. She was a natural beauty, like their mother had been.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a medical student. I\u2019m supposed to look sleep-deprived. It\u2019s a requirement. I\u2019d get tossed out if I looked rested.\u201d</p><p>Despite their pestering, Kate was happy to be with her two sisters again, even if it was for only a couple of weeks. They had had little time together after their mother died. Kate had returned to Boston to finish her graduate degree, and Kiera had gone back to medical school at Duke while Isabel remained at home with their aunt Nora.</p><p>Kate was now home permanently, but Kiera, after two weeks off, would be returning to Duke again, and Isabel would be heading to her first year of college. The changes were inevitable, Kate presumed. Life should move forward.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re home you ought to take a day and go to the beach . . . you know, relax. Take Isabel with you,\u201d Kate urged.</p><p>Kiera laughed. \u201cNice try. You\u2019re not going to unload her on me, even if it\u2019s just for a day. I\u2019d spend the entire time fighting off the boys chasing after her. No, thank you. It\u2019s bad enough right here with the phone calls. There\u2019s some guy named Reece in particular. He seems to think he\u2019s Isabel\u2019s boyfriend. Isabel said she worked at a couple of concerts with him, and they went out a few times, but it was nothing serious. She stopped seeing him when he wanted to be more than friends. Now he\u2019s calling here nonstop wanting to talk to her, and because Isabel refuses to take his calls, he\u2019s becoming more and more belligerent. I love Isabel dearly, but sometimes I think she can make life just a little too complicated. So, thanks for the suggestion about the beach, but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>Kate tugged on her bra again.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s lovely,\u201d Kiera said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis contraption is killing me. I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous, and isn\u2019t that more important than breathing?\u201d she teased. \u201cSuck it up. It\u2019s for a good cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the cause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. You\u2019re my cause these days. Isabel\u2019s, too. We\u2019re determined to lighten you up. You\u2019re way too serious for your own good. I personally think you suffer from middle-child syndrome. You know, you\u2019re filled with insecurities and phobias, and you have this need to constantly prove yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Kate decided to ignore her. She put her small clutch bag down on the table and went to the closet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re textbook material,\u201d Kiera continued.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not listening to me, are you?\u201d</p><p>Kate was saved from responding when the phone rang. While Kiera hurried into the den to answer it, she opened the closet door and began to search for her raincoat. The television was blaring away in the kitchen, and she could hear the obscenely cheerful weatherman gleefully remind his audience that Charleston was still in the throes of a heat wave unlike anything the city had seen in thirty years. If the temperature remained in the high nineties for just two more days, a new record would be set. The possibility made the weatherman sound giddy with excitement.</p> <p>The humidity was the real killer, though. The air was heavy, stagnant, and as thick as glue. The steam curling up from the sidewalks and streets mingled with the pollution hanging like a hazy specter over the airless city. One strong gust of wind would help clear the sky, but neither wind nor rain was predicted anytime soon. Unless one was acclimated, taking a deep breath required concentration. The muggy air drained the young and the old, and left everyone lethargic. Swatting a mosquito away required more energy than most people were willing to exert.</p><p>Yet as horribly hot as it was, the party Kate had promised to attend was still being held outside on the grounds of a privately owned art gallery. The event had been planned weeks ago, and the white tent had been erected before the weather turned so oppressive. Only one wing of the newly constructed gallery was completed, and Kate knew it wasn\u2019t large enough to accommodate the expected crowd.</p><p>There was no getting out of it. The owner, Carl Bertolli, was a friend of Kate\u2019s. She knew it would hurt his feelings if she didn\u2019t show up. Because of the traffic, the drive from Silver Springs, where she lived, to the other side of Charleston would take over an hour, but she didn\u2019t plan on staying long. She would help with any last-minute details and then, when the party was in full swing, she\u2019d bolt. Carl would be too busy to notice her departure.</p><p>A controversial artist from Houston was showing her work, and there had already been protests and threatening phone calls. Carl couldn\u2019t have been happier. He believed that any publicity, good or bad, was good for his gallery\u2019s business. The artist, a woman who was calling herself Cinnamon, had quite a following\u2014though, for the life of her, Kate couldn\u2019t understand why. As an artist Cinnamon was mediocre at best. She was, however, excellent at drawing attention to herself. She was constantly in the news and would do anything to get noticed. Currently she was against anything organized. When she wasn\u2019t throwing paint on her canvases, she was halfheartedly trying to overthrow the government. Cinnamon believed in free love, free expression, and a free ride through life. Her paintings weren\u2019t free, however. They were outrageously expensive.</p><p>Kiera came back into the hall saying, \u201cThat was Reece calling again. He\u2019s beginning to give me the creeps.\u201d She stopped when she saw Kate. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to get rain tonight. How come you\u2019re all buttoned up in your raincoat? It\u2019s like a hundred and twenty outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can\u2019t be too cautious. I wouldn\u2019t want the dress to get wet.\u201d</p> <p>Kiera laughed. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t want Aunt Nora to see you in that dress. Admit it, Katie. You\u2019re afraid of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of her. I\u2019m just trying to avoid a long lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dress isn\u2019t indecent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll think it is,\u201d Kate said as she slipped the coat over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be odd not having her here to boss us around. I\u2019m going to miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Kate whispered.</p><p>Nora was moving back to St. Louis. She had come to Silver Springs when her sister had taken ill, and she had stayed on to keep the household running until Isabel graduated from high school. Now that Kate was back and Isabel was going away to college, Nora was ready to go home. She missed being close to her daughter and her grandchildren.</p><p>Nora had been a godsend and had taken good care of all of them, especially when they needed her most. However, she was set in her ways, and in the sisters\u2019 opinions, she was obsessed with sex. Kiera called her a born-again virgin. After their mother had died, she had appointed herself the girls\u2019 moral guardian. According to Nora, every man was out for \u201cyou know what,\u201d and it was her job to see that they didn\u2019t get it from her girls.</p> <p>Kate peeked around the corner. Fortunately, Nora wasn\u2019t in the kitchen, so Kate turned the television off, removed her raincoat and draped it over a chair. She grabbed her keys and hurried for the garage. If luck stayed on her side, she\u2019d be out of the house before Nora returned. She really wasn\u2019t afraid of her aunt, but when Nora got wound up, her lectures could go on and on and on. Some lasted as long as an hour.</p><p>Kiera followed Kate through the kitchen. \u201cYou be careful tonight. There are a lot of crazies out there who don\u2019t care for Cinnamon\u2019s views on government or religion. Doesn\u2019t she preach anarchy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis month I think she does. I don\u2019t keep track of what she says and what she does, and I\u2019m not worried about tonight. Security will be tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Carl must be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all for show. I don\u2019t think Cinnamon believes any of the nonsense she spouts. She\u2019s just a publicity hound, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe groups she\u2019s offended don\u2019t know it\u2019s all for show, and some of those groups are real radicals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop worrying. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Kate opened the door and stepped into the garage. The heat took her breath away.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to leave so early? The invitation said eight to midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl\u2019s assistant called and left a message for me to be there by six.\u201d</p><p>She got into the car, which felt like an oven, and pushed the remote control to open the garage door.</p><p>Kiera called out, \u201cAre there going to be Kate MacKenna gift baskets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Carl insisted. I think I\u2019ve become one of his projects. He told me he wants to be able to say he knew me when,\u201d she called back. \u201cNow shut the door. You\u2019re letting all the air-conditioning out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already becoming a household name. Pretty sweet, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Kiera evidently didn\u2019t require an answer, for she\u2019d shut the door after making the comment.</p><p>Life was pretty sweet right now. Kate had plenty of time to think as she inched along the highway in the heavy traffic. Though she wasn\u2019t a household name yet, she was definitely headed in that direction. It was funny how a little hobby could end up becoming a satisfying career.</p><p>While she had been busy trying to figure out what she wanted to be, her company was born. She had been a senior in high school and scrounging for ways to make money so she could buy her family and friends birthday gifts. She had also been taking a chemistry class. She\u2019d gone into the teacher\u2019s office, and there was a lighted candle on the desk. Kate had always been sensitive to various scents, and the musky odor from the candle was offensive to her. The horrible smell had given her an idea to make her own candles. But she wouldn\u2019t do the same old same old. She would do something unique. How hard could it be?</p><p>She started out using the kitchen as her lab. By the end of the winter break, she\u2019d made her first batch of scented candles. They were a disaster. She\u2019d mixed several spices and herbs and made the kitchen smell like a sewer.</p><p>Her mother banished her to the basement. She didn\u2019t give up her experiments, though. Every spare minute she had that summer she worked on her project. She scoured libraries and labs, and by the end of her freshman year at college, she had come up with the most wonderful basil-and-grapefruit-scented candles.</p><p>Kate\u2019s intention was to give them away, but her college roommate and best friend, Jordan Buchanan, saw great potential. Jordan took ten candles, priced them, and sold them all in one evening. She talked Kate into using her full name on all of her products. Then she helped her design a logo and some unusual boxes.</p><p>The clean and fresh scents along with the octagonal glass containers Kate found made the candles irresistible and an instant hit. Orders started pouring in. Kate, with two part-time employees, tried to make and stock as much as she could during summer break, but her enterprise outgrew the basement, and so she moved to a rental space across town. It was located in a horrible area and for that reason was dirt cheap.</p><p>By the time she graduated from college, orders were coming in from all parts of the country. Kate realized her weakness was in management and decided to return to school in Boston to complete her master\u2019s. To keep the company running while she was away, she made her mother a partner so that she could sign checks and make deposits. Because Kate poured her profits back into the company, money was tight. She lived with Jordan in her apartment in Boston and often spent her weekends with Jordan\u2019s large family out on Nathan\u2019s Bay.</p><p>It was a struggle, but Kate managed to make the business grow in her absence. Then, when her mother became so ill, Kate\u2019s ambition was put on hold so she could return home to be with her. A long, sad year had passed since her mother\u2019s death, but in that year Kate had completed her graduate degree and formulated plans for expansion.</p><p>Now that she was back in Silver Springs permanently, she was ready to take her company to the next level. She had branched into body lotions and three signature perfumes named Leah, Kiera, and Isabel after her mother and her sisters. The space she rented was becoming too cramped, so she was negotiating a new lease in a warehouse that was much larger and also closer to home. She was also thinking about hiring more employees. Anton\u2019s, a chain of upscale department stores, was eager to carry her products, and soon she was going to sign an exclusive and extremely lucrative contract.</p><p>And any and all money worries would evaporate.</p><p>She smiled thinking about that. The first thing she was going to buy when she had a little extra money was a car with a proper air conditioner. She kept adjusting the vents, but that didn\u2019t help. The air coming out was lukewarm.</p><p>She felt wilted by the time she reached Carl\u2019s outrageously pretentious estate. He\u2019d inherited Liongate from his father and was building his gallery on the property. Two massive lion faces adorned the electronic iron gates.</p><p>A security guard checked her name off his list and let her through. Carl\u2019s two-story house was at the top of a winding drive, but the gallery that would showcase Cinnamon\u2019s work was halfway up the hill on the south side. A massive white tent sat adjacent to the white stone structure.</p><p>Another security guard showed her where to park. Carl was obviously expecting quite a crowd if the number of security men and waiters rushing back and forth from the annex to the white tent were any indication.</p><p>Kate cut across the well-manicured lawn, her heels sinking into the irrigated sod. She\u2019d almost reached the stone path when her cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cHello, Kate darling. Where are you?\u201d Carl\u2019s melodious voice wafted through the receiver.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here on your lawn, Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in my closet trying to choose between the white linen suit and the pinstripe blazer with the cream-colored pants. Either way, I know I\u2019m going to absolutely melt, but I have to look dashing for all the critics who are going to be here tonight, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll look very handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to let you know that I won\u2019t be down for a while. I have to hurry and dress and then go pick up Cinnamon at her hotel. The limo\u2019s waiting for me. I have a favor to ask. Would you check on the tent setup for me? I won\u2019t have time to get there before guests arrive, and I want to be sure everything\u2019s perfect. With your impeccable taste, I know you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s glorious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d Kate answered, smiling at her friend\u2019s flair for the dramatic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sweetheart. I owe you,\u201d Carl said as he hung up.</p><p>Kate found the entrance and went inside the tent. There were air conditioners operating full blast around the perimeter, but they weren\u2019t doing much good with all the waiters coming and going. Huge buffet tables stood in a line at one end. They were topped with colorful flower arrangements in crystal bowls and gleaming silver servers. Small tables with white linens and white folding chairs were scattered around the rest of the space. Everything seemed to be going smoothly.</p><p>She spotted her gift baskets on a table at the back. The white tablecloth reached the ground, and her logo hung suspended in front. She hurried over to straighten it and to place the baskets in a semicircle. When she was finished, she stepped back to admire how lovely it looked.</p><p>She circled the table and reached for the chair but changed her mind. The Wonderbra was driving her nuts. The undergarment felt like a suffocating vise around her rib cage. She was in agony and was trying not to rip the thing off as she hurried into the art gallery to find a powder room so she could remove it and toss it in the trash.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ladies\u2019 room was blocked off and so was the men\u2019s room. There were servants cleaning both. Kate would have ignored the closed signs and gone in, but there were security guards stationed by the doors, and she was sure they wouldn\u2019t let her through.</p><p>Now what? Kate looked around for a vacant room with a door she could shut. There weren\u2019t any. She headed back to the tent feeling absolutely miserable, but her mood improved when she noticed a large basket of flowers had been placed on the ground just beneath her logo to showcase it. She must remember to thank Carl for being so thoughtful.</p><p>The heat was stifling. She picked up a program and began to fan her face. With less than two hours before the crowd would arrive, waiters were hurrying to set up more portable air conditioners. Kate stepped to the back of the tent to get out of their way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she lifted a flap of the canvas to get a breath of fresh air, she spotted a cluster of trees circled by a skirt of dense shrubs a few yards away. Bingo. She knew exactly what she was going to do. The bushes would give her privacy, and it would take just a few seconds to unhook the strapless bra and pull it off. She looked in all directions to make sure no one was watching or going to follow her and headed for the trees.</p><p>A minute later she had accomplished the feat.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d she sighed with relief. Now she could breathe.</p><p>It was her last thought before the explosion.</p> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>The police found her curled up on her side at the base of a hundred-year-old walnut tree. They found her bra dangling from an uprooted magnolia fifteen feet away. No one could quite figure out how the force of the explosion had extracted the lacy black lingerie but left her dress intact. Aside from being covered in leaves and dirt, the dress was still in one piece.</p><p>The blast had taken a huge chunk out of the side of the hill and left a hole the size of a small crater where the tent had been. The resulting fire scorched everything in its path as it poured like lava down the hill. The magnificent and regal walnut tree was split in half straight down the middle. One hefty branch snapped and landed in an arch above Kate, covering her completely. The branch acted as a barrier against the shards of glass, metal, canvas, and wood hurling through the air like bullets from an automatic weapon.</p><p>Houses shuddered as much as half a mile away, or so some of the residents swore. Others thought the trembling they felt was an earthquake and ran to stand in doorways for protection.</p><p>It was a miracle no one was killed or seriously injured. Had any of the staff or guests been inside the tent at the time of the explosion, the paramedics would have been hard-pressed to identify them.</p> <p>Kate certainly should have been killed, and if it weren\u2019t for that ill-fitting bra, she surely would have been standing in the center of the blast. It was yet another miracle that all of her body parts were where they belonged. One of the metal tent poles had rocketed like a guided missile and sliced straight through the tree trunk resting just above Kate. The tip stopped one inch away from her heart.</p><p>Nate Hallinger, a detective newly assigned to the Charleston division, was the first to see her. He was making his way up the hill, trying to stay clear of the crime scene team walking the grid, when he heard a cell phone ringing close by. The musical ring reminded him of the Harry Potter movie he\u2019d taken his nephews to see. The ringing stopped by the time he reached the uprooted walnut tree. He thought the phone was on the ground somewhere, and when he bent down on one knee to push a branch out of his way, he spotted a pair of shapely legs.</p><p>He tried to get closer to the woman to see if she was dead or alive. Part of the trunk began to teeter, and if it shifted at all she would be crushed. He backed away when he heard her groan.</p><p>Two paramedics were coming toward him. \u201cHoly mother, George. Will you look at this?\u201d one of them remarked.</p><p>\u201cLook at what?\u201d his partner said with a distinct Bronx accent. He was shimmying on his belly to get to the victim.</p><p>\u201cThe pole, man. Look at the pole. It stopped just short of her chest. Is she lucky to be alive or what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAssuming she\u2019s all in one piece, then yes, I\u2019ll agree, Riley. She is lucky.\u201d</p><p>George was fifteen years older than his partner. He was training Riley, and though he liked working with him, the younger man\u2019s nonstop chatter occasionally got on his nerves. Riley loved to gossip\u2014which George didn\u2019t approve of\u2014but sometimes he did pass along interesting information.</p><p>Riley carefully lifted one of the broken branches and scooted toward the woman. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe cops think that artist was the target, and the bomb went off too soon. I heard one of the firemen say it was overkill, but I\u2019m not sure what that means, and I didn\u2019t dare ask \u2019cause then they\u2019d know I was eavesdropping.\u201d</p><p>The two men couldn\u2019t reach her, so they called for help. It took four strong firemen to lift the splintered trunk out of the way. The heavy branches were removed a minute later, and the paramedics moved in. They both marveled that there were no broken bones. They braced her as a precaution and gently transferred her onto a stretcher.</p><p>Kate was slow to come around. She struggled to open her eyes. Through the blurry haze, she could just make out three men looming over her.</p><p>She felt like she was in a hammock and the wind was pushing her every which way. She closed her eyes again and fought nausea as she was being carried down the hill. She smelled something burning in the air.</p><p>Nate walked by her side.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cShould be,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for the doctors to decide,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cCan she talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cDetective Nate Hallinger. Can she talk?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a bump the size of a baseball on the back of her head,\u201d Riley replied.</p><p>The other paramedic was nodding, but his attention, Nate noticed, was centered on his patient.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably got a concussion,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Nate said. \u201cBut can she talk?\u201d he asked, thinking that maybe the third time might be the charm with these guys. \u201cHas she said anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s still out cold,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>The fog in Kate\u2019s head was beginning to clear, and she was almost sorry about that. She felt like someone had stuck a hatchet in the back of her skull\u2014and she tried to reach up and find out if there really was something there.</p><p>\u201cYes, she can talk,\u201d she whispered, her voice shaky. \u201cShe can walk, too.\u201d</p><p>Nate flashed a smile. The woman was a smart-ass. He liked that. \u201cCan you tell me your name?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare nod. Any movement at all increased her headache. Aspirin, she thought. An aspirin would take care of it.</p><p>\u201cKate MacKenna,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn explosion.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t remember an explosion. Was anyone hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Please put me down.\u201d</p><p>The request was ignored. She asked once again if anyone was hurt, and George answered, \u201cJust some scratches and bruises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I have an aspirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a hell of a headache, don\u2019t you?\u201d George remarked. \u201cWe can\u2019t give you anything yet. When we get you to the hospital\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone sure was looking out for you.\u201d Riley offered the comment.</p><p>Confused, she squinted up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get blown up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had been inside the tent, you\u2019d be a goner.\u201d</p><p>They reached the bottom of the hill and stopped to wait for an officer to open the back of the ambulance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m riding with her to the hospital,\u201d Nate said.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s all right. Her vitals are good.\u201d</p><p>Nate whistled to get a policeman\u2019s attention, pointed to the ambulance, and climbed inside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a ride to the hospital. I\u2019m all right now,\u201d she said. \u201cMy car\u2019s here . . . somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be driving anywhere,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cMy driver\u2019s license is in my car, and my purse and . . .\u201d She realized how unimportant that information was and stopped talking.</p><p>\u201cThink you could answer a couple of questions?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>She liked his voice. It was smooth . . . and not too loud. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d Why couldn\u2019t she remember? What was wrong with her? Maybe when the headache went away it would all come back to her.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone unusual . . . you know, someone who didn\u2019t belong?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . I\u2019m sorry. Maybe I\u2019ll remember later.\u201d</p><p>She knew she was frustrating him.</p><p>\u201cAnd no one got hurt?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He assured her. \u201cThe caterers and the staff were inside the building preparing trays and trying to keep cool. The owner was in a limo on his way to pick up the artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIf it had happened later, there would have been a massacre,\u201d George said.</p><p>The detective was sitting across from her, his arms on his knees, his hands clasped together, his gaze intent as he leaned forward and asked, \u201cTry to think, Kate. You didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary?\u201d</p><p>The urgency in his voice cut through her haze. \u201cYou don\u2019t think this was an accident, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not ruling out any possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t it have been one of the air conditioners?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere were wires everywhere. Maybe one was overloaded . . .\u201d She stopped when he shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t possible that one of those blew up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA hundred air conditioners couldn\u2019t have done that kind of damage. The explosive took out half that hill.\u201d</p><p>Riley bent over Kate and once again checked her blood pressure. He smiled as he loosened the cuff.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cHer numbers are still good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head\u2019s feeling better,\u201d she said. It was a lie, but she wanted to go home.</p><p>\u201cYou still need to be checked out at the hospital,\u201d George said.</p><p>Hallinger closed his notepad and took a long look at her. Not many victims, he thought, were as gorgeous as this. He realized he was staring and quickly looked away. \u201cThat old tree saved your life. If you hadn\u2019t been standing behind it, you wouldn\u2019t have survived. What were you doing all the way over there? You were quite a distance from the annex and the tent.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and winced. She really wanted an aspirin. \u201cI went for a walk,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t a lie; she had gone for a walk. She just didn\u2019t think she needed to explain why.</p><p>\u201cIn this heat? I would think you would have wanted to go inside the annex, or walk on up to the house, or maybe even stay inside the tent near one of those air conditioners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would think,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t. I went for a walk. The heat doesn\u2019t really bother me.\u201d Okay, that was a lie, but it was a little one and she could live with that.</p><p>\u201cWere you alone when you went for your walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d He looked skeptical.</p><p>\u201cDetective, if someone had been with me, wouldn\u2019t he or she have been knocked unconscious, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he or she had stayed around.\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond he asked, \u201cHow long were you out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d The skepticism had moved to his voice.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe crime scene unit found something about twenty feet away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d they find?\u201d she asked and only then realized where he was headed. Oh my, the bump on her head had made her dense.</p><p>\u201cAn article of clothing,\u201d he said. \u201cAn undergarment, which was why I was wondering who was with you.\u201d</p><p>She could feel her face burning. \u201cNo one was with me. You\u2019re asking me about a black bra, right? And you\u2019re wondering if it belonged to me?\u201d Before he could answer she plunged ahead. \u201cIt did belong to me. The ladies\u2019 room was blocked, and I needed a little privacy to take it off. I saw the trees and I headed there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to take it off?\u201d</p><p>He was being extremely intrusive, she thought, and she could have told him so, but she decided to be honest instead. \u201cIt was killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>Everyone inside the ambulance was suddenly interested in the topic. Riley and George were waiting for her to explain.</p><p>\u201cThe wire . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. \u201cA woman would understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a man wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t letting it go. She wondered if he was deliberately trying to embarrass her.</p><p>\u201cYou try wearing one of those things for an hour, and trust me, you\u2019ll take it off, too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, thanks. I guess I\u2019ll just have to take your word for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to write that down in your notepad?\u201d</p><p>He had a nice smile.</p><p>\u201cAre you married?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs there a husband I should contact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not married. I live with my sisters.\u201d She tried to sit up and only then realized she was strapped down. \u201cI\u2019ve got to call them. They\u2019ll be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we get to the hospital, I\u2019ll call them for you.\u201d He sat back on the bench and glanced out the back window. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to go to the hospital. My headache\u2019s almost gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>From the way he drawled out the response she knew he didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t live in Charleston proper,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. She knew he could already have her address, phone number, and probably every other detail about her life. One phone call to an associate manning a computer would tell him everything he wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cWe live in Silver Springs, but it\u2019s a quick drive to the city. Are you new to this area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cI just moved here from Savannah. It\u2019s pretty laid-back here.\u201d He smiled as he added, \u201c. . . Usually. I\u2019ll bet this is the most excitement you\u2019ll have all year.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>If only.</p><p>Kiera and Isabel rushed through the emergency room doors. Kiera looked relieved when she saw Kate and smiled. Isabel looked scared.</p><p>The ER physician checked Kate and sent her downstairs for a scan. The techs were backed up, and she had to wait two hours before they finished with her. Then she was brought upstairs and assigned a room.</p><p>Kiera was pacing in the hallway. Isabel was sitting on the edge of the bed watching television. The footage of the aftermath of the explosion was all over the news. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The second Isabel spotted Kate she jumped up, anxiously waited until she was in bed, and threw herself into her sister\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay, right? You gave us quite a scare, but you\u2019re okay, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Kiera grabbed the controls and adjusted the bed so that Kate could sit up.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not seeing three of me, are you?\u201d Isabel asked. She was fluffing the pillow behind Kate\u2019s head and causing her sister a good deal of pain.</p><p>\u201cIf she were seeing three of you, she\u2019d be screaming now. One Isabel is enough.\u201d Kiera laughed.</p><p>\u201cNot funny,\u201d Isabel said, but she, too, was smiling.</p><p>Kiera picked up Kate\u2019s chart from the metal slot at the foot of the hospital bed and began to read the doctor\u2019s notes.</p><p>\u201cShould you be looking at that?\u201d Isabel asked.</p> <p>Kiera shrugged. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want you to read it, they shouldn\u2019t leave it. They\u2019re keeping you overnight for observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should stay . . . as a precaution,\u201d she added. \u201cAunt Nora was still at her meeting, but we\u2019ve left a message for her. No doubt she\u2019ll want to bring a cot in here so she can keep watch all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she crack her head?\u201d Isabel wondered, peering over Kiera\u2019s shoulder at the chart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Her skull is like granite.\u201d</p><p>Isabel took hold of Kate\u2019s hand. \u201cYou scared me . . . I mean us. You scared us. I don\u2019t know what we would do without you. It was lonely while you were in Boston. When Kiera was home, her nose was always in a medical book.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine, Isabel. Stop stressing.\u201d</p><p>Isabel walked to the window and sat on the ledge. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t stress. So tell me . . . who was the man with the ambulance guys? He was really cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t like being called cute,\u201d a male voice responded.</p><p>None of them had noticed that Nate was standing in the doorway.</p><p>He was taken aback when all three sisters turned toward him. Damn, there wasn\u2019t a homely one among them. Isabel\u2019s face turned bright pink almost instantly.</p><p>\u201cPlease come in,\u201d Kate said. She introduced him to her sisters and waited for him to tell her why he was there.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to give you my card,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you need anything or remember anything, no matter how insignificant you might think it is, I want you to call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated but couldn\u2019t think of anything else to ask or say that would keep him in the room. \u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><p>He was turning to leave when Isabel called, \u201cMay I ask you something, Detective?\u201d She took a step toward him and smiled.</p><p>Kate and Kiera shared a look. Isabel was turning on the charm, her never-fail charm. She brushed her hair back and took another step.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the police going to put that painter, Cinnamon, in protective custody?\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the door frame. \u201cWhy would you ask?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head toward the television. \u201cShe\u2019s on the news, and she\u2019s demanding police protection, which is really ironic when you think about it. She\u2019s always trashed the police until now. One of the reporters on the news quoted some of the horrible things she\u2019s said in the past. I think she said that you were all on the take or something like that. I don\u2019t know why she hasn\u2019t been sued.\u201d She took a deep breath and then said, \u201cCinnamon says that it was a bomb and it was meant to kill her. She says people are trying to silence her because of her political views . . . and oh, her art, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks people are trying to kill her because of her paintings? Is she that bad?\u201d Kiera asked. She laughed and shook her head.</p><p>Isabel frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny. There were a couple of paintings on the wall behind her, and she kept pointing to them while she was being interviewed. I think maybe she was doing a little advertising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone determined what caused the explosion?\u201d Kiera asked.</p><p>Nate turned to her. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure what kind yet, but it was definitely a bomb. We have a team working on it.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Kate again. \u201cIf you remember anything . . .\u201d he said as he headed for the door.</p><p>Kate nodded.</p><p>Isabel waited until she was certain he was out of earshot and then said, \u201cIsn\u2019t he adorable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s definitely adorable,\u201d Kiera agreed. \u201cBut he\u2019s too old for you. He\u2019s got to be in his thirties. And . . .\u201d</p><p>Isabel folded her arms across her waist. \u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s interested in Kate.\u201d</p><p>Kate hadn\u2019t been paying much attention to the conversation until she heard her name. \u201cAs a witness,\u201d she corrected. \u201cHe\u2019s interested in me as a witness. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not too old for me,\u201d Isabel said. \u201cI wonder if he\u2019s single or married. I didn\u2019t see a ring on his finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it go,\u201d Kiera said, her exasperation obvious. \u201cHe\u2019s not interested in you.\u201d</p><p>Isabel ignored her sister. \u201cYou should have asked him, Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was unconscious, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d She gingerly lay back against the pillow. Her head was throbbing, but the conversation, as ludicrous as it was, did distract her. \u201cWhen should I have asked him? In the ambulance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I was just saying . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let another opportunity pass by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d She would have laughed if her head hadn\u2019t hurt so much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m most certainly not kidding. I swear I don\u2019t remember the last serious relationship you were in. In fact, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever been in a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate darling!\u201d Carl Bertolli called from the doorway.</p><p>He waited until all eyes were on him and then rushed into the room with a flurry. Carl did so love to make a grand entrance, no matter what the occasion.</p><p>Isabel was thrilled to see him again. She\u2019d only met him once, when he\u2019d stopped by the house to pick up Kate for some sort of important benefit, but he\u2019d made a lasting impression. Carl was so flamboyant, so bigger than life. She told Kate she was sure he must own at least one cape to wear to all his winter social events.</p><p>He clasped Kate\u2019s hand in both of his and leaned down to kiss her forehead.</p><p>\u201cMy poor, poor darling. This is a nightmare, a complete nightmare. It\u2019s amazing no one was seriously injured or killed in the explosion, and I tell you, if I were not wearing this white suit, I would get down on my knees to thank God.\u201d</p><p>Kiera coughed to cover her laughter. Kate tugged her hand away and said, \u201cYou remember my sisters, Kiera and Isabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I do.\u201d He flashed a smile and said, \u201cI do hope you don\u2019t blame me for what happened. I never should have allowed that crazy artist to show her work. I was warned, but I didn\u2019t believe anyone would take the woman seriously.\u201d He turned back to Kate and added, \u201cAnd so I guess the blame should rest on my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to be consoled. Kate was having none of it. \u201cCarl, the police will sort it all out. You couldn\u2019t have known someone would go to such extremes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good of you to say so. Do you know the gallery was untouched? Not a stone was jarred loose. Isn\u2019t that astonishing? Of course I have a hole the size of a swimming pool in the lawn that I\u2019m going to have to do something about, but when I think how much worse it could have been . . .\u201d He paused, gave an elaborate shrug, and patted her hand again. \u201cI shall let you rest now that I know you forgive me. If you need anything, anything at all . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to call you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another dazzling smile, bowed to Isabel and Kiera, and left the room.</p><p>Kiera and Isabel stared at the empty doorway. The energy in the room seemed to have been sucked out with his departure.</p><p>\u201cCarl\u2019s an interesting fellow,\u201d Kiera remarked. \u201cA bit dramatic, but interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Nora was taken with him,\u201d Isabel said. \u201cShe told me he reminded her of a young George Hamilton. When I asked her who George Hamilton was, she got real mad at me and said she wasn\u2019t that old. I have no idea what she meant. Hey, Kate, what about Carl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay attention. We were discussing your love life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we weren\u2019t. You were.\u201d</p><p>Isabel ignored the interruption. \u201cAnd since you don\u2019t seem inclined to do anything about it on your own, I feel I should help.\u201d</p><p>Kiera burst into laughter. \u201cAnd you think Kate and Carl would be a good match?\u201d</p><p>Kate grimaced as she tried to keep from laughing, too. \u201cNot only is Carl not my type, he\u2019s engaged. His fianc\u00e9e is much more suited to his idiosyncrasies than I could ever be.\u201d</p><p>Isabel blushed. \u201cOkay, maybe not. But, Kate, you need someone more laid-back to balance your uptightness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such word,\u201d Kiera said.</p><p>\u201cPlease, have mercy on me,\u201d Kate pleaded. \u201cTake Isabel home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re out of here. Call me in the morning and let me know when I can pick you up.\u201d</p><p>Isabel wasn\u2019t the least offended that Kate wanted to get rid of her. She headed for the door then stopped. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever scare me like that again. Promise me, Kate.\u201d</p><p>Kate responded to the fear in her voice. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Isabel nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d She sighed as she added, \u201cNow that you\u2019re home for good, things will be back to normal.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Kiera drove Kate home from the hospital the next afternoon. They pulled into the driveway just as a messenger from a CPA firm was about to knock on their front door. While Kiera signed for the delivery, the messenger dropped a fat package into Kate\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cGuess what we\u2019re going to be doing tonight,\u201d Kate said as she opened the door and headed to the kitchen. She took a knife to the envelope and emptied the contents on the table.</p><p>Isabel followed her sisters into the kitchen. \u201cWhat\u2019s all that?\u201d she asked. She disappeared behind the refrigerator door as she searched for something to munch on.</p><p>Kiera answered her. \u201cBills. I had Tucker Simmons, the CPA, send over all of the accounts Mom handled.\u201d</p><p>Isabel shut the refrigerator and walked over to the table with a celery stick in her hand. \u201cSo why are they giving us the bills now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Mom became so gravely ill, she set it up that Mr. Simmons would take over the bills for one year after she was gone. I told her I could handle it, but she insisted it would be too difficult for me to manage from Boston. And you know how persuasive Mom could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there enough money left to pay all of these bills?\u201d Isabel asked, waving her celery stick at the pile of envelopes.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re about to find out,\u201d Kiera said. \u201cMom was so secretive about her budget. Whenever I asked her how the money situation was, she always said the same thing, \u2018We\u2019re doing just fine.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she always said to me, too,\u201d Kate added. \u201cIt was so aggravating.\u201d</p><p>Isabel took exception to her sisters daring to criticize their mother. \u201cShe was being thoughtful. She didn\u2019t want any of us to worry. Kiera, she wanted you to focus on medicine, and Kate, she wanted you to finish your master\u2019s. Neither one of you needed any money because you both had scholarships and grants. Nora and I were dependent on Mom though, and she wanted to make it easy for us. That\u2019s why she did what she did. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder how much is left in the trust,\u201d Kiera said, ignoring Isabel\u2019s impassioned defense of their mother\u2019s financial decisions. \u201cAnd do we know how much is still to come from Mom\u2019s pension?\u201d</p><p>Kate shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how much her monthly checks were. She refused to discuss it. Somewhere in these statements we\u2019ll get the answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Isabel said. \u201cEven if we had to use up the money, Kate will figure out something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Kiera has to do her last year of medical school, and she\u2019ll never get to come home then, and I\u2019m going off to college in a week, so that leaves you. Besides, you and Kiera got all the brains in the family. You know what? I used to think I was stupid because I wasn\u2019t in advanced classes or got perfect scores on tests, but Mom told me that I was normal. Yes, normal,\u201d she insisted, pointing the celery at Kate. \u201cYou two are the weird ones. I don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings, but you\u2019re both kind of . . . nerds.\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed. \u201cMom never called us weird or nerds.\u201d</p><p>Isabel frowned. \u201cShe didn\u2019t call you normal, either. Kate, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like? I\u2019m opening the bills. I want to get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that now. All of this can wait until after dinner,\u201d Kiera said. \u201cYou look worn out. Go rest for a little while. These bills aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t argue. She still had a lingering headache, and she wanted to take a shower and change out of the pair of slacks and silk blouse Kiera had brought to the hospital for her, so she headed to her room.</p><p>After her shower, she slipped into a pair of shorts and an old T-shirt, and fell asleep curled up on the bed.</p><p>She awoke to the sound of her sisters and aunt maneuvering around the kitchen, the aroma of baked chicken and apple dumplings wafting up the stairs.</p><p>The kitchen was directly beneath her bedroom, and she could hear their chatter.</p><p>\u201cKiera, you and Isabel are going to have to do cleanup tonight. I\u2019m running late,\u201d her aunt said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it tonight, Aunt Nora?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cMy support group, Miss Nosy.\u201d</p><p>Ever since the sisters could remember, Aunt Nora had been a regular at a support group. For years she attended one in St. Louis, and as soon as she moved to Silver Springs, she joined one at the local church. None of the girls knew what Nora was supporting all those years, but they knew better than to ask. They\u2019d heard her right-to-privacy speech too many times to keep count. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wouldn\u2019t allow them any privacy, though. She wanted to know where they were every minute.</p><p>\u201cAnd where will you be off to tonight, young lady?\u201d Kate heard Nora ask Isabel.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my night to sing at Golden Meadows,\u201d Isabel answered.</p><p>\u201cThe men and women at that nursing home are surely going to miss you while you\u2019re away at school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll miss them more,\u201d Isabel said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wake me when you get home,\u201d Nora ordered.</p><p>Isabel argued. \u201cI\u2019m a grown-up, and I don\u2019t think I need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nora interrupted her. \u201cI promised your mother I would watch out for you, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. You\u2019re grown up when you go off to college.\u201d</p><p>Kate heard the back door open. \u201cI forgot to tell you,\u201d Nora said. \u201cThe movers have changed the date on me. They\u2019ll be here on Friday. I expect some help packing my boxes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ll help you,\u201d Kiera promised.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll be leaving on Friday?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting rid of me for good because I\u2019ll be coming to see you as often as I used to visit my daughter. I\u2019ll just be living there instead of here. Now enough of this talk. You\u2019re making me late. Where\u2019s my pocketbook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn your arm,\u201d Isabel said.</p><p>Kate heard the door close. She got out of bed, splashed water on her face, and went downstairs.</p><p>After dinner Isabel rushed off, and Kiera left to pick up some things at the supermarket, so Kate decided to get a start on the papers the accountant had sent over.</p> <p>She began with a large envelope from Summit Bank and Trust. Kate didn\u2019t know her mother had done any business with Summit. The household account she had set up was with a local Silver Springs bank. Kate thought perhaps the papers had something to do with the pension. There were several invoices, copies of a loan application, and a letter on top of the stack from Mr. Edward Wallace, senior loan officer.</p><p>She read the letter and looked at the loan papers. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis has to be wrong.\u201d She read the letter again. She couldn\u2019t accept what she was reading, wouldn\u2019t accept it.</p><p>Yet she knew it was true, for there it was, her mother\u2019s distinctive signature.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMother, what did you do? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>There was no pension, no trust, no insurance money, no savings. Her mother had taken out a three-year loan with a balloon payment of almost three hundred thousand dollars, and it was due in just four weeks\u2019 time.</p><p>She had put up everything she owned as collateral, and every asset would go to the bank if the payment wasn\u2019t made.</p><p>One of those assets was Kate\u2019s company. Another was her name.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>Kate was frantic. She held the letter from the banker and copies of the loan papers her mother had signed as she paced around the kitchen. She\u2019d read and reread the documents at least five times now, and still she couldn\u2019t believe what her mother had done.</p><p>If the papers were in order\u2014and of course they were; there was no reason to believe they weren\u2019t\u2014then her mother had signed everything away. Everything.</p><p>\u201cMy God, Mother, what were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Apparently she hadn\u2019t been thinking at all, Kate decided. Had her mother realized what she was doing? Had she considered the ramifications?</p><p>Kate understood now why her mother would never discuss finances. She hadn\u2019t wanted any of them to know the truth.</p><p>Kate alternated between anger and sadness as she tried to clear her head and come up with a plan to salvage the future. She paced to the kitchen window and looked for Kiera\u2019s car to return. She would give the news to her sister the minute she walked in. Maybe the two of them could make some sense of this.</p><p>By the time several minutes had passed with no sign of Kiera, Kate had changed her mind. Although it would be nice to dump some of the worry in her sister\u2019s lap, it wouldn\u2019t change anything. What was done was done. Besides, Kiera had only a few days to rest before her next grueling round of medical school, and she wouldn\u2019t get a break for another eighteen months. This news would just pile more stress on her and keep her up all night. There would be plenty of time in the morning to talk to her about this . . . if Kate decided to tell her at all.</p><p>And Isabel? If she did tell Kiera, should she tell Isabel? That thought led to another. What about college? Where was Kate going to come up with the tuition money?</p><p>There had to be a solution. Kate sat down at the table, picked up her pen and paper, and ran the numbers once again.</p><p>The doorbell interrupted her. When she looked through the narrow window beside the front door, she saw a good-looking man shifting from foot to foot.</p><p>She opened the door and said, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her, and she instinctively stepped back to get away from the smell of stale beer. He reeked of it. His eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>\u201cIs Isabel here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she isn\u2019t,\u201d Kate answered.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he belligerently demanded.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReece. My name\u2019s Reece Crowell. Now where is she?\u201d</p><p>The man standing in front of her was in his mid-twenties. He wore khaki pants and a button-down shirt with the cuffs rolled up to his elbows. His dark hair was slicked back from a rather angular face, but he was handsome in a soap opera way. Kate had never met him and was surprised that Isabel had dated someone so much older. They were definitely going to discuss this later.</p><p>Reece took another step closer. Kate hadn\u2019t opened the door wide enough for him to step inside . . . unless he walked through her. From his angry expression she thought he might just do that.</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s here,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI want to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not home,\u201d Kate said. She kept her voice firm. \u201cAnd Isabel has said she doesn\u2019t want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>The guy was definitely out of it. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Isabel is going to college, and you\u2019re going to leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>His hands balled into fists. \u201cIt\u2019s your fault. Isabel wouldn\u2019t do this to me. It\u2019s you. She said you wanted her to go to college. She\u2019s throwing away her career because of you and your bitchy sister.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to argue with him. \u201cIsabel has moved on, and you need to do the same.\u201d</p><p>He tried to push past her, shouting Isabel\u2019s name. She stood her ground and used her hip to brace the door.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019m calling the police,\u201d Kate warned.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you? She\u2019s mine. We\u2019re going to Europe next week, and we\u2019ll be married before we come back. I\u2019ve put too much time into her singing career to let you mess it up for me.\u201d</p><p>He came at her again, and this time she shoved with her whole body. She slammed the door and bolted it.</p><p>Kate leaned back against the door as Reece pounded on it and shouted obscenities. He stopped for a second, as if waiting to see if the door would suddenly open to him, and then he resumed the pounding and the screaming. Kate stood on the other side terrified that he was going to break the door down.</p><p>Suddenly the pounding stopped, and at the top of his lungs Reece bellowed, \u201cThis isn\u2019t over, bitch!\u201d Then it was eerily quiet. Kate waited a second before she peered through the side window. Reece was staggering across the lawn. He turned at the sidewalk and kept walking.</p><p>Kate\u2019s heart was racing. She rushed to the phone to call the police, and then she stopped. What could she tell them? Aside from being drunk and obnoxious, Reece hadn\u2019t threatened them with violence or done any damage. Maybe when he was sober he\u2019d come to his senses.</p><p>But his parting words, \u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d echoed in her head.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The phone call came in the middle of the night.</p><p>Kate was awake. She hadn\u2019t slept at all. After Kiera and Isabel had returned home, she had told them about the incident with Reece. When she had seen the worry and fear on their faces, she simply couldn\u2019t tell them about their financial problems as well. They had had enough anxiety for one night. She wasn\u2019t about to burden them with more.</p><p>She had pored over the records multiple times hoping against hope that she might find a solution before she had to reveal the problem to her sisters. The ringing jarred her from her thoughts and she quickly snatched the receiver so it wouldn\u2019t wake the rest of the household. No one ever called with good news at two in the morning. She feared it might be Reece on the other end of the line as she answered.</p><p>\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>Kate let out a quick breath in relief. \u201cNo, I\u2019m wide awake. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you answer your e-mail? I\u2019ve been sitting here in front of my computer since nine o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was going through bills.\u201d Kate could hear the anxiety in Jordan\u2019s voice and knew something was wrong. It had to be something awful, too, or she wouldn\u2019t have called in the middle of the night. Good news could always wait until morning.</p><p>Kate knew better than to come right out and demand to know what the problem was. She and Jordan had been best friends for a very long time, and Kate understood how her mind worked. When pressured, Jordan closed up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on there?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cNot much. Just the usual stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat usual stuff? Kate, I need to talk about mundane things for a minute. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord, the news was bad all right. Kate felt a knot form in her stomach. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been going through bills, and guess what I found? Never mind, don\u2019t guess. Before she died, Mom signed away the house, the car, and all other assets, including my company and my name. She took out a loan the size of Nebraska and only paid the interest for the last three years. The balloon payment is due in thirty days. Oh, and last night, I almost got blown up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear a word I said, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry? What did you say?\u201d</p><p>The question wasn\u2019t a joke. Jordan sounded a million miles away. The knot twisted in Kate\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cI was saying it\u2019s hot here, hot and humid. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found a lump.\u201d</p><p>Four little words and everything changed in that instant. The worry about the house and bills and tuition was forgotten, and all that mattered was her friend.</p><p>\u201cWhere? Where is it?\u201d She tried to keep the urgency out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cLeft breast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen a specialist yet? Have you had any tests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and yes,\u201d she answered. \u201cSurgery\u2019s scheduled for Friday morning. The surgeon wanted to do the biopsy tomorrow, but I wouldn\u2019t let him. You need time to get here . . . right?\u201d She sounded like a little girl now, a scared little girl.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I can be there tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll book you on a flight. I\u2019ll e-mail you times and flight numbers, and I\u2019ll pick you up at the airport.\u201d</p><p>Kate knew Jordan was focusing on the details as a way of staying in control. It was the same thing she would have done. Control was one way to combat fear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting at baggage pickup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay.\u201d Kate was so shaken she couldn\u2019t think of what questions to ask. Her hand was aching and she realized she was gripping the phone. She forced herself to relax.</p><p>\u201cListen. I\u2019ve decided not to tell the family, not yet anyway. After I know what I\u2019m dealing with, then I\u2019ll tell them. I couldn\u2019t stand all of them hovering around me. Mom and Dad have really been through it the last couple of months. As proud as they are of my brothers, having most of them in law enforcement has taken its toll. When Dylan was shot on duty, I think they aged twenty years. For a while there, none of us knew if he was going to make it or not. You were there. You know how bad it was.\u201d</p><p>A shiver rushed down Kate\u2019s spine. \u201cYes, I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you saw how the stress affected everyone, especially my parents. Now that Dylan\u2019s home and mending, the family\u2019s calming down. Just the other day Mom called and mentioned that it had been eight weeks since that nightmare phone call, and she\u2019s just now able to take a deep breath. What was I supposed to say to that, Kate? Brace yourself? I\u2019ve got more bad news for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be bad news or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, but it\u2019s the not knowing that gets everyone all stirred up. It\u2019s better to wait until I find out . . . everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, Dylan is sending Mom and Dad on a cruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? He just wanted to get them out of his hair. Mom\u2019s been driving him crazy, showing up at his place at least once a day with food. He\u2019s not used to being pampered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your sister? I know how close you and Sydney are. Aren\u2019t you going to tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten? She\u2019s in L.A. She starts film school in just a couple of weeks, and she\u2019s busy getting settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, film school. I forgot all about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Sydney knew about the surgery, she\u2019d come home, and I don\u2019t want her to do that. If it\u2019s bad news, then of course she and Mother will need to know right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut for now it\u2019s just you and me. Are you up for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>They talked for another few minutes and then hung up. Kate stayed in complete control while she gathered up the papers from the table and dumped them into a laundry basket. She wanted to put it all in the trash, but that wouldn\u2019t solve anything.</p><p>She still had a little time before the roof came crashing down and the creditors were banging on the doors. There was enough money in the checking account to pay the current bills. When she returned from Boston, she would figure out what to do. She wouldn\u2019t tell her sisters about the financial disaster until then.</p><p>She turned the lights off and carried the laundry basket upstairs to her room. She put it in her closet and got ready for bed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t start crying until she was under the sheets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Jordan had never been on time for anything in her life, and today was no exception.</p><p>Kate was waiting with her bag at her feet outside the airport doors when her friend pulled up to baggage claim.</p><p>Jordan put the car in park but left the engine running, popped the trunk, and got out so she could hug Kate.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>A policeman motioned for Jordan to move the car. Neither Kate nor her friend said another word until they were on the airport exit road heading toward Jordan\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>\u201cHow late was I?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cJust fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Kate, smiled, and said, \u201cYou look like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look worse.\u201d</p><p>Kate was teasing. Jordan always looked beautiful. Though her hair was a deep auburn color, she had a redhead\u2019s complexion. She usually had that all-American, freckle-faced, Ralph Lauren model look about her, but not today. There was very little color in her face. Even her freckles looked pale.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder we\u2019re best friends. We\u2019re both painfully blunt.\u201d</p> <p>She concentrated on merging onto I-90, then cut over to the middle lane and shot forward. \u201cI wish you\u2019d move here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love Boston, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You have to keep the home fires burning for your sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly for Isabel, and just for a little while. She deserves to have some family at home. Of the three of us, Isabel was closest to Mom, and she\u2019s had a hard adjustment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still headed to Winthrop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cShe\u2019s very excited. It\u2019s the perfect school for her.\u201d If I can come up with the money for more than one semester\u2019s tuition, she silently added. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that going away to college will help her grow up a little. Mom always treated her like a baby.\u201d</p><p>Jordan nodded. \u201cShe is the baby in your family, but she\u2019s got a good head on her shoulders. She\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow scared are you, Jordan?\u201d</p> <p>The abrupt change in topics didn\u2019t faze her friend. Her mind worked just like Kate\u2019s, bouncing from one thought to another. \u201cVery,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the specialist tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten three opinions, and all of them have poked, prodded, and taken enough blood to fill a bathtub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pleasant image.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have to prepare me for the worst.\u201d</p><p>Kate nodded. \u201cWhat happens tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Cooper will do the surgery. He\u2019s gone over all the options with me. He\u2019ll do the biopsy . . . and then we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Kate took a deep breath. She knew she had to keep it together. Her friend needed her to be strong.</p><p>They were on Storrow Drive now, and Kate stared out the window at the Charles River. The sun made the water glisten.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get through this,\u201d she told Jordan.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what time do we need to be at the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to be late, even if I have to use electric shock to blast you out of your bed.\u201d</p><p>Jordan laughed. \u201cYou\u2019d do it, too. Dylan threw a soaked towel on my face once to get me to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet you didn\u2019t wake up happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t. I wanted to get even, so the next morning I threw a glass of cold water on him. He roomed with Alec, and you know what a slob he is, and I guess I just didn\u2019t think it through. As soon as the water hit his face, Dylan came off that bed . . . I still shudder thinking about it. I\u2019ve never seen anyone move like that. I had my getaway all planned, but I tripped over one of Alec\u2019s shoes and went careening into his bedside table. I cut my knee open and started screaming. I think Alec slept through it all, but poor Dylan ended up carrying me downstairs to Mom. I had to have stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen or eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a hellion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my moments. Tell me something. How come you didn\u2019t want Dylan to know you sat with him in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there for you, not him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he knew,\u201d she continued, \u201che\u2019d never let me live it down. Your brother loves to tease and torment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll my brothers like to tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Dylan\u2019s the worst, bless his little ol\u2019 heart.\u201d</p><p>Jordan grinned. \u201cYou southern girls mask your criticisms behind the \u2018bless your heart\u2019 you always tack on the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouthern girls never criticize,\u201d she said, deliberately exaggerating her accent. \u201cWe are raised to be soft-spoken ladies. We always tell the truth but in a kind, genteel way.\u201d</p><p>Jordan rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a load of . . .\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cleaning up my vocabulary now that I\u2019ve got nieces and nephews. I\u2019ve got to set a good example. That\u2019s what Theo and Nick tell me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers are telling you to clean up your vocabulary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Dylan . . . I think he\u2019s kind of sweet on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan\u2019s sweet on all women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, he does like women,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cBut he especially likes teasing you because you embarrass so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis accidentally walking in on me taking a shower the first time I visited Nathan\u2019s Bay didn\u2019t help any. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever live that down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot about that.\u201d Jordan laughed. \u201cNo wonder he has such a big grin whenever your name comes up.\u201d</p><p>She turned a corner and spotted a prime parking space directly in front of her brownstone. It was an extremely rare occurrence. She also noticed a black Hummer had just turned the corner and was coming from the opposite direction. The driver obviously wanted the same parking spot because he gunned his motor and came racing toward her. Jordan was quicker. She parallel parked like a pro. The driver of the Hummer made an obscene gesture as he drove past, which Jordan and Kate thought was hilarious.</p><p>Several years before, the brownstone had been converted into three spacious apartments, one on each floor. Jordan\u2019s was on the top. Kate had lived with her during school and was used to the squeaky stairs and narrow corridors.</p><p>Jordan had made a fortune for herself with a computer chip she had designed, and she could live anywhere, but she, like Kate, was a creature of habit. She loved her old, worn-out apartment and didn\u2019t have any plans to move.</p><p>Kate loved the apartment, too. It was warm and inviting even on the coldest of days. It always smelled clean and fresh. Jordan, showing her loyalty to her friend, had placed Kate\u2019s scented candles on almost every table. She had Kate\u2019s body lotions in the two bathrooms and on the bedside tables as well.</p><p>There were three bedrooms. The guest room was at the end of a long hall and was large enough to accommodate the king-sized bed two of Jordan\u2019s brothers had purchased for her so they could sleep over when they were in town. Their parents\u2019 home on Nathan\u2019s Bay was a good two hours with traffic.</p><p>The third bedroom had been converted into an office, and bookcases lined all four walls. The shelves were bowed from the weight of Jordan\u2019s books. The office was open to the dining room on one side and the hallway on the other.</p><p>The hardwood floors were as dark as midnight. Splatters of color came from oriental rugs strewn about. The huge windows in every room were covered with plantation shutters. One of Kate\u2019s favorite study spots was the window seat in the living room that overlooked the Charles River.</p><p>The only sterile room in the apartment was the galley kitchen. Jordan didn\u2019t cook. She lived on carryout or frozen food. If it couldn\u2019t be microwaved, she didn\u2019t buy it.</p><p>Kate immediately went to the guest room and put her bag next to the bed. She cut through the office to get to the dining room. She noticed all the papers on Jordan\u2019s desk and backtracked. As cluttered as Jordan\u2019s bookshelves were, her desk was always immaculate. Aside from her computer and a stack of Post-its, one or two pencils, and a phone, her work area was usually as sterile as her kitchen counters.</p><p>Jordan walked into the office, noticed Kate looking at the layers of papers on her desk, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a mess, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you it is,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always keep a clean desk when you work. You\u2019re kind of obsessive about it. You\u2019ve had a lot of stress lately, though, and I would think paperwork would be the last thing on your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the papers are legal documents. I\u2019m being sued.\u201d</p><p>After dropping that bit of shocking news, she turned around and walked into the living room. Kate chased after her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being sued?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said as she dropped into an easy chair and swung her legs over the arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being awfully blas\u00e9 about it.\u201d Kate stood in front of the coffee table with her arms folded, frowning at her friend while she waited for an explanation.</p><p>It didn\u2019t come soon enough to suit her. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll ask. How come you\u2019re being sued? And how come you\u2019re so calm about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might as well be calm,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting all worked up won\u2019t do any good.\u201d She kicked off her sandals and leaned back. \u201cI\u2019m being sued by a man named Willard Bell. He seems to think he came up with the design for my chip before I did, and I figured out a way to steal it from him.\u201d</p><p>Kate sat in the opposite chair and crossed her feet on the ottoman. \u201cHave you ever met this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He lives in Seattle,\u201d she said. \u201cMy attorney told me that Bell is a computer geek who makes his living suing people. A very nice living,\u201d she stressed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really ever have a case, but it\u2019s cheaper to settle than fight because of all the legal expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Jordan looked exasperated. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to do? You know me better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to settle. Bet your attorney wants you to, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, he does. I\u2019m not going to, though. I don\u2019t care what it costs. What Bell\u2019s doing is wrong, and I\u2019m not going to give him a dime. His attorney is playing hardball,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s frozen all of my accounts. That just means I won\u2019t have money for a while. I\u2019ll get them unfrozen soon,\u201d she hastened to add. \u201cSo there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Theo think about all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t asked him for advice. In fact, I haven\u2019t even told him about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He\u2019s an attorney, for heaven\u2019s sake. You could use his advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo\u2019s overworked and underpaid, and with a new family . . . no, I\u2019m not going to bother him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe graduated from law school, but he doesn\u2019t practice,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t want to involve any of my brothers. My attorney is very capable, and any other problems that come along I can handle on my own. All of my brothers have a habit of taking over, but they\u2019re going to stay out of this. I\u2019m a big girl now. I can fight my own battles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to be so independent?\u201d</p><p>Jordan smiled. \u201cYou make \u2018independent\u2019 sound like a bad word. I\u2019m just like you, Kate. We both like to control everyone and everything.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue because she knew Jordan was right. They were overachievers and did like to have complete control over every aspect of their lives. Other people\u2019s lives, too, when they could get away with it, she admitted.</p><p>\u201cHow come we\u2019re so smart about business matters and so stupid about men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that one\u2019s easy. We tend to date men we can walk all over, and then we don\u2019t want them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Kate wrinkled her nose and made a pathetic face. \u201cWe\u2019re really screwed up.\u201d</p><p>Jordan laughed. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. Listen, I realized after our phone call that I hadn\u2019t really been paying any attention to what you were telling me. You know, when I asked what was going on with you. It was very self-centered of me, don\u2019t you suppose?\u201d</p><p>Kate grinned. \u201cI do suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m paying attention now. Did you say your mother gave away your business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose. I\u2019ve just hit a couple of bumps, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that if you ever need anything from me, it\u2019s yours, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019d do the same for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d Kate agreed. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll work this out. You\u2019ve got enough on your mind right now.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s face turned pensive as if she were trying to re-create their phone conversation in her head. \u201cAnd did I hear you say you almost blew something up? All I could think about was the surgery, so I was only half listening. Were you trying to cook again? Lord, I hope not. You could have blown up your house.\u201d</p><p>Kate protested. \u201cJust because of one little mishap in your kitchen you assume\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jordan snorted. \u201cLittle mishap? The fire department showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this talk about cooking has made me hungry. Do we go out or would you rather order in?\u201d</p><p>They spent at least ten minutes deciding and ended up walking two blocks to a neighborhood bistro that Kate thought served the best seafood chowder in the city.</p><p>They chose a booth in the back of the restaurant so no one would bother them, but neither of them ate much. Jordan looked worn out.</p><p>Kate\u2019s stomach ached from the knot that wouldn\u2019t go away, but the rest of her body was numb. She knew if she allowed herself to feel, she\u2019d melt into a pool of tears. She decided to try to take Jordan\u2019s mind off her worries for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know how I almost got blown up?\u201d</p><p>Jordan stopped swirling her spoon in the now-congealed chowder she\u2019d barely tasted and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the punch line.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke.

You\u2019re a klutz, not me.\u201d</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t argue with her. \u201cYou weren\u2019t joking about almost being blown up, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t. Do you want to hear what happened or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I should start at the beginning. Have you ever heard of the Wonderbra?\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Kate had a selective memory. Because of her mother\u2019s long illness, she and her sisters had spent what seemed like a lifetime in numerous hospital waiting rooms, and yet Kate couldn\u2019t remember what any of them looked like. It was odd, she thought, that she couldn\u2019t recall a single piece of furniture, a wall color, or a carpet. She supposed all waiting rooms were pretty much the same, cold and sterile, with mass-produced paintings of mountains and meadows on the walls.</p><p>She did remember the people who came and went while she was there, almost every one of them, and she remembered the anxiety. The air was thick with it, and like a virus, it passed from one person to the next, attacking anyone and everyone who walked into the room to wait.</p><p>Time and fear, a horrible combination. She remembered the families huddled together, trying to gain comfort and hope from one another. She remembered the young father who looked so lost sitting with his two little girls squeezed up next to him while he read stories and waited to hear if their mother would live or die. He had broken down and sobbed when he was given the good news by the smiling surgeon.</p><p>And she remembered the elderly woman who was sitting all alone until Kate and her sisters walked in. She decided to keep them company, told them she was waiting to hear if her husband of forty years was going to survive bypass surgery. She told one story after another and another and wouldn\u2019t let anyone else get a word in. Faster and faster the woman talked until Kate\u2019s head was spinning. At one point Kate pictured herself sitting there with giant cotton balls stuffed in her ears. It was an uncharitable thought, but the image did make it easier to smile through the woman\u2019s endless chatter.</p><p>Waiting was always a miserable experience. Today was no exception. Jordan wasn\u2019t taken into the OR until a little after ten, and she\u2019d been ready since six-thirty. An emergency had caused the delay. Kate was able to stay with her in preop, but when Jordan was wheeled away, a volunteer who looked about twelve years old showed Kate the way to the surgical waiting room.</p> <p>She led her down a maze of corridors, and Kate soon became suspicious that the girl didn\u2019t know where she was going. It seemed they had made a complete circle and finally found the waiting area by chance.</p><p>There were actually two waiting rooms with a desk and a phone manned by another volunteer in between. The larger room was packed, and after giving her name to the woman behind the desk, Kate went into the smaller room.</p><p>A family of five, all with red-rimmed eyes, was just leaving as she walked in. There weren\u2019t any other people, and Kate was thankful she was alone. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk to strangers. She sat down in the corner by the window, picked up a magazine, and promptly put it back. She was too nervous to read.</p><p>The truth was that she wanted to sit down and have a good cry, but she couldn\u2019t do that, of course.</p><p>Kate reached for another magazine and noticed how her hands were shaking. Get a grip, she told herself. Jordan would be okay. It was just a little bump, not a lump, and everything was going to be all right. Except that the surgeon had been so grim about it. According to Jordan, anyway, but then Jordan tended to overreact.</p><p>Now who was she trying to fool? Her friend never overreacted. She was too . . . practical . . . and cautious to a fault.</p><p>The key to an effective pep talk was honesty, she decided, and so Kate decided to come up with some honest reasons why everything would be okay.</p><p>She paced back and forth while she thought about it. All right then. Jordan had told her that the surgeon had been quite grim. Maybe he had to anticipate the worst so that he would be prepared, and he needed to prepare his patient for the worst, too, didn\u2019t he? Wasn\u2019t that part of his Hippocratic oath or something?</p> <p>How convoluted was that reasoning? Time for a little realism. Yes, it was true that one of Jordan\u2019s aunts on her mother\u2019s side of the family had died because of a lump she had pretended wasn\u2019t there until it was too late. And yes, there was a cousin on the same side of the family who had also been given the same diagnosis. But so what? The cousin was in her late eighties, and so was Jordan\u2019s aunt, wasn\u2019t she? Which meant that statistically the odds were on Jordan\u2019s side, and she should and would have a happy, healthy life for the next sixty-five years, give or take a few.</p><p>Except that she\u2019d found the lump last week, not sixty-five years from now.</p><p>That reminder took the wind out of Kate. She sat down and bowed her head. She was suddenly so tired she could barely think. Early detection was important, right? And Jordan, her sister, Sydney, and their mother had all taken charge of their health. They had the usual examinations\u2014and then some\u2014on a regular basis.</p><p>Don\u2019t borrow trouble. Kate\u2019s mother had often said those very words. Oh, God, she didn\u2019t want to think about her mother now. She had enough to deal with.</p><p>What was taking so long? Kate was looking at her watch for about the fiftieth time just as her cell phone rang.</p><p>Kiera was calling. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Jordan had given Kate permission to talk to Kiera about the surgery but no one else. \u201cStill in surgery,\u201d she answered. \u201cThey were running late, so she didn\u2019t go in until almost ten. It\u2019s been over an hour now. Isn\u2019t that long enough for a biopsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a medical student, not a doctor, and I\u2019m not going to speculate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fourth-year medical student, which means you\u2019re almost finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut still not a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kiera,\u201d Kate said in exasperation. \u201cMake a calculated guess. I\u2019m not going to sue you if you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think an hour is too long. Remember, the surgeon\u2019s waiting for the pathologist\u2019s report. And since you didn\u2019t go into the OR with her, you can\u2019t know exactly when they started.\u201d</p><p>Kate relaxed. \u201cGood point. They could just be starting now, for all I know. I\u2019ll call you as soon as I hear something. How are things at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Reece Crowell has called here several times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Kate asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been very polite. Almost too polite. When I tell him Isabel isn\u2019t here, he says \u2018thank you\u2019 and hangs up, but then a couple of hours later he calls again. I can hear this edge to him, like he\u2019s ready to explode. He\u2019s asked for you a couple of times. Once Isabel is well away at school, I suppose he\u2019ll get the message.\u201d</p><p>Kate wasn\u2019t so sure about that.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Kiera continued. \u201cA man named Wallace has called and left a couple of messages. He said he works for a bank. Have you ever heard of him?\u201d</p><p>The ever-present knot in Kate\u2019s stomach began to swell. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t heard of him,\u201d she lied. \u201cDid he say what he wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut he asked that you call him right away. Do you have a pen? I\u2019ll give you his phone number.\u201d</p><p>Kate closed her eyes. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll call him Monday when I get home. Just leave the messages on the machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it was urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrgent can wait until Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you at all curious to know what he wants?\u201d</p><p>Kate knew exactly what he wanted. Everything they owned. And then some.</p><p>\u201cListen, Kiera. Monday we need to sit down and have a long talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just need to make some decisions about the future. I\u2019m going to hang up now. I\u2019ll let you know how Jordan\u2019s doing later.\u201d</p><p>She flipped the cell phone shut and dropped it into her purse just as a white-haired volunteer called her name. Kate saw the surgeon turning toward her when she stood. Then she saw his face. The surgeon was smiling.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Jordan was going to be fine. The wonderful news from the surgeon made Kate weak with relief. She felt like hugging the man.</p><p>She had thought that she would be able to take her friend home a couple of hours after the anesthesia wore off, but the surgeon wanted to keep her overnight. He explained almost as an afterthought that Jordan had had a very mild reaction to the anesthetic, but there was nothing to worry about, the drug would be out of her system by tomorrow afternoon at the latest, and she could leave the hospital then.</p><p>Nothing to worry about. Kate remembered those words when she saw her friend. Poor Jordan was as red as a boiled lobster, had welts all over her face and arms, and was itching like crazy.</p><p>Kate did what any best friend would do. She pulled out her cell phone, which happened to have a built-in camera, and took her photo so she could torment her later\u2014maybe even make a screen saver for her computer.</p><p>She stayed with Jordan until eight that evening. The rash was still going strong, but the doctor had ordered medication to relieve the itching and help her sleep. Kate waited until she\u2019d fallen asleep again, then drove Jordan\u2019s car back to her apartment and took a long, hot shower.</p><p>She closed her eyes and let the water cascade over her shoulders. Maybe it would wash away some of the tension. However, each time she tried to clear her mind, visions of her sisters and her company and Reece and mountains of bills swirled through her head.</p><p>No, not tonight, she thought. She would not do this tonight. She wasn\u2019t going to let herself get all worked up about the future tonight. Tomorrow would be soon enough.</p><p>Her stomach began to gnaw at her, and she realized she hadn\u2019t eaten anything all day. She toweled off and slipped into her pajamas, a soft gray T-shirt and a pair of gray-and-navy-striped boxer shorts, and headed for the kitchen. Jordan always kept a supply of crackers and jars of peanut butter on hand. There were several old TV dinners in the freezer. Kate was pretty sure they\u2019d been there since Jordan had moved into the apartment. Kate opted for the crackers. She got a fresh box out of the cabinet, put it on the counter, and then opened the refrigerator to get a bottle of water. She was unscrewing the top when, without any warning at all, the tears started.</p><p>Within seconds she was sobbing. She leaned back against the refrigerator, bowed her head, and cried like a baby. The release felt good. She could have kept it up for at least another half hour if someone hadn\u2019t intruded. She heard a knock on the door, grabbed a paper towel to wipe the tears from her face, and stood frozen hoping whoever it was would go away.</p><p>No such luck. Another knock, more insistent this time. She did not want company. Barefoot, she crept to the door and looked through the peephole. Her heart dropped.</p><p>There stood Dylan Buchanan, the bane of her existence. God, he looked good. She shook herself. Stop that. He wore a pale blue shirt neatly tucked into his jeans. The shirt was just fitted enough to show off his broad chest and thick biceps. His dark hair was short, and as usual not a strand was out of place.</p><p>All of the Buchanan boys were ruggedly good-looking, but Dylan had a little extra something going for him. She thought maybe it was his slow, sexy smile. She only knew one thing for certain. When he turned on the charm, he could melt the most frigid of hearts. Jordan referred to her older brother as the sex machine. Kate thought he had earned the dubious nickname because of all the women he had dated\u2014and no doubt taken to bed\u2014while he was in college. She didn\u2019t think he had slowed down much since then, except maybe for a couple of weeks after he\u2019d been shot. The bullet might have slowed him a little.</p><p>He looked tired, she thought.</p><p>He pushed the doorbell again and leaned against the wall behind him balancing a pizza box and a six-pack of beer on one hand.</p><p>Had he heard the floorboard squeak when she\u2019d stepped on that loose one? She moved away from the door, waited a couple of seconds, and then peeked again. Her heart began to pound. It was an instantaneous reaction and one she couldn\u2019t seem to control. The conditioned response stemmed from the night he had walked in on her in the shower. He\u2019d had a mighty fine time teasing her about it ever since. She simply wasn\u2019t up to sparring with him tonight. In her vulnerable state, he\u2019d eat her alive.</p><p>When he winked, she knew he was perfectly aware that she was standing on the other side of the door.</p><p>She was going to have to be grown up about this. She would simply open the door and tell him to go away. She looked through the peephole one last time.</p><p>The man was a force to be reckoned with, and she was not in the mood tonight. She needed to finish crying and go to bed.</p><p>Get it over with, she told herself. She unlocked the double deadbolts and pulled the door open as she said, \u201cJordan\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time. The pizza\u2019s getting cold and the beer\u2019s getting warm. Move out of the way. Come on, Pickle. Move.\u201d</p><p>The silly name he called her had always gotten under her skin.</p><p>He was already over the threshold and about to step on her toes.</p><p>The pizza smelled wonderful and so did he. She got a tiny whiff of his cologne when he strode past her on his way to the kitchen. She followed him and got trapped behind the refrigerator when he opened the door to put the beer inside. He popped the tab on one can and offered it to her. She shook her head. He shut the refrigerator, stepped closer, and pinned her to the counter as he slowly reached over her to get to the pizza.</p><p>He was deliberately trying to get a reaction, and from the sparkle in his eyes, she knew he was thoroughly enjoying himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d</p><p>His chest rubbed against hers, and it was then that she remembered what she was wearing.</p><p>\u201cJordan\u2019s not here,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have called first and saved yourself a trip. I\u2019m not dressed for company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I noticed that, too. You\u2019ve got great legs, Pickle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not company.\u201d</p><p>She pushed against his shoulder to get him to step back. When he winced, she realized what she had done. \u201cOh, Dylan,\u201d she whispered as she jerked her hand back. She\u2019d forgotten about his injury. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>He left the pizza but took his beer into the living room and dropped down on the sofa. Kate followed him.</p><p>\u201cI hurt you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it go,\u201d he said. He knew he\u2019d sounded irritated and softened his tone when he added, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t look fine. He looked ready to pass out. His complexion had turned gray, but if he wanted her to let it go, then that\u2019s what she would do. She went into the kitchen, grabbed the pizza, some napkins, and her bottled water, and then decided to take him another beer as a peace offering of sorts.</p><p>There were newspapers spread on the coffee table. Kate put the box down on top and then excused herself and went into Jordan\u2019s bedroom to borrow one of her robes. Her friend was taller than Kate, and the pink robe dragged on the floor. It was missing a belt.</p><p>She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror above the sink as she walked past and inwardly groaned. She\u2019d forgotten she\u2019d clipped her hair into a ponytail that was more out than in, and there were mascara smudges under her eyes. \u201cLovely,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>She grabbed a washcloth and started scrubbing. By the time she came back to the living room Dylan had finished his third slice of pizza and was reaching for a fourth. He\u2019d also emptied her bottle of water and gotten her another one.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gone that long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou snooze, you lose. At least in the Buchanan family you do. Come sit.\u201d She must have looked wary. \u201cI won\u2019t bite, unless you want me to.\u201d</p><p>He was smiling at her, and oh, Lord, he was something. Good thing she wasn\u2019t interested, she reminded herself. Like the big bad wolf, he\u2019d devour her. No, thank you.</p><p>He was sitting in the center of the sofa and took up a fair amount of space, but she didn\u2019t ask him to move over. She shoved several pillows out of the way and sat down.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering . . .\u201d he began.</p><p>She stacked the pillows neatly between them. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He was smiling at her again. She wanted to tell him to stop it, that when he smiled, she lost her ability to concentrate. Wouldn\u2019t he love hearing that? He\u2019d have something more to tease her about.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the remote?\u201d</p><p>The question jarred her. \u201cThe remote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he drawled. \u201cThe remote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the remote for the television. Let me guess. Sports channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m that predictable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. You\u2019re a Buchanan male.\u201d</p><p>She threw a couple of pillows on the floor and dug between the sofa cushions. She fished out the remote and handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice of you to bring Jordan a pizza. I\u2019ll save this for her,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring it for her. It\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan told me.\u201d She shook her head. He nodded. \u201cShe also told me to keep you company tonight.\u201d</p><p>Kate was taken aback. \u201cWhen did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour ago.\u201d She didn\u2019t look like she believed him, and so he added, \u201cIn the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there . . . in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . but how did you find out she was there?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer but said, \u201cShe didn\u2019t call you. Did she call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t call me. She didn\u2019t call any of us,\u201d he added, referring to his brothers, \u201cand I\u2019ll be discussing that with her as soon as she\u2019s feeling better. We\u2019re her family and she shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him before he got all wound up. He was well on his way.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me how you found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of Nick\u2019s works in outpatient and just happened to notice the name on the surgical schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd called Nick?\u201d She was outraged by the possibility.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSomething like that. She didn\u2019t know Nick had gotten married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unethical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is? Getting married or . . .\u201d</p><p>She was going to argue with him about confidentiality and realized he was trying to get a rise out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an extremely exasperating man,\u201d she said, and then she nudged him and nodded. He nudged her back and sent her flying off the sofa. He grabbed her arm and pulled her up next to him.</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s sitting with Jordan now, and like I said, I\u2019m here because she told me to keep you company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do whatever Jordan tells you to do?\u201d She scooted forward and picked up a slice of pizza. The bottom was still warm.</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s something I want. You\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t send Zack.\u201d</p><p>Zachary was the youngest. He was still in high school but was already as arrogant and full of the devil as his brothers were. According to Jordan \u201cthe baby\u201d wasn\u2019t really wild but wanted everyone to think he was. He was giving his parents fits\u2014after raising so many children, they were clearly worn out\u2014but Kate thought Zack was adorable.</p><p>\u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, be careful. I think he likes you a whole lot more.\u201d</p><p>She took a bite of the pizza and was suddenly starving. She devoured it and reached for another. Dylan turned on the television and straightened the cushions on the back of the sofa. Kate smiled inside to see that he hadn\u2019t changed. He was still a bit obsessive about having things in their place.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t paying much attention to her now and yawned loudly. There was some sort of sports recap show on, and he seemed mesmerized by it, so she picked up the empty can and pizza box and took them into the kitchen. She was trying to figure out a diplomatic way to get him to leave.</p><p>She decided the direct approach was best.</p><p>\u201cYou should go now,\u201d she said as she returned to the sofa.</p><p>He glanced up. \u201cYou look worn out. How come you\u2019re so frazzled?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not frazzled. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were crying before I came, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew, then why did you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult week,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had a lot of frustration. Crying sometimes helps me get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other ways to get rid of pent-up frustration.\u201d He wiggled his eyebrows after making the comment.</p><p>He was an outrageous flirt. Kate decided it was high time she called his bluff. She was determined to make him squirm.</p><p>\u201cYou would probably have heart failure if I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you what?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath and said, \u201cIf I put my arms around your neck and kissed you crazy.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her without saying a word for a good ten seconds, mostly focusing on her mouth, and said, \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. He definitely was not squirming, and she was bombarded with all sorts of nutty thoughts. She suddenly realized what she was doing and decided to get him out of the apartment as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>She could hear the laughter in his voice. \u201cMaybe later,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her mouth went dry. She took a gulp of water. She couldn\u2019t understand why she was feeling so nervous, but she was. She didn\u2019t want him to know it, though. To give her hands something to do she took her time straightening up the newspapers. What in heaven\u2019s name was the matter with her? She was feeling so unsure of herself\u2014and embarrassed. That didn\u2019t make any sense. She\u2019d known Dylan for a long time, and he\u2019d never had quite this effect on her before. She was actually trying to block fantasies about him. She\u2019d never been one to waste her time on fantasies\u2014she lived in the real world, not make-believe. But now one image after another\u2014all involving Dylan\u2019s amazing body\u2014was bombarding her.</p><p>As she fidgeted with the papers, her robe fell off her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get all these bruises?\u201d Dylan asked. His hand touched the base of her neck and moved down her arm.</p><p>She didn\u2019t push his hand away, but she craned her neck to see. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that one was there. It must have happened when I fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the one on your forehead? And the one on your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame fall.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slid across her back causing goose bumps. She hoped he didn\u2019t notice what his touch was doing to her.</p><p>\u201cAre you as accident-prone as Jordan is?\u201d He laughed as he thought about that possibility, and then said, \u201cThe two of you living together . . . she\u2019s always tripping . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when she forgets to wear her glasses,\u201d she defended.</p><p>\u201cSo why were you crying?\u201d</p><p>They had come full circle, and he was once again back to his initial question.</p><p>\u201cYou have already asked me that, and I\u2019ve answered.\u201d</p><p>She took the remote from him and pushed a button. A commercial popped on. Turning the volume up, she pretended to be fascinated by a loud salesman dressed in cowboy attire who was shouting into the camera that he must be out of his mind. He was waving a lasso around as his scantily clad female sidekick, showing her patriotic flair with her sequined red, white, and blue ensemble, held up signs with slashed prices on each one. Apparently the salesman was only going to be out of his mind for a one-week extravaganza.</p><p>Dylan reached over, pushed the mute button, and said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t healthy to keep everything all bottled up inside.\u201d</p><p>Heaven help her, he sounded sympathetic. And that was her undoing. She could feel the tears coming again and was suddenly desperate to get him out of the apartment before she started blubbering.</p><p>\u201cYou should go home now.\u201d Her voice quivered. Why couldn\u2019t she control her emotions tonight? What in God\u2019s name was wrong with her? It wasn\u2019t like her to be so undisciplined.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should stay,\u201d he said.</p><p>The remote became a Ping-Pong ball, going back and forth between them. He had possession now and was scanning the channels. He turned his head ever so slightly toward her. He had beautiful eyes. And they were looking at her with genuine concern.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to sit with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t go on. He wouldn\u2019t have understood a word said after that, anyway. She was sobbing. It was mortifying but impossible for her to stop.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Kate jumped up from the sofa thinking she would try to regain a tiny shred of dignity and walk out of the room with her head held high, but Dylan had other intentions. He pulled her down on his lap.</p><p>For the next ten minutes he didn\u2019t say a word to her. He simply wrapped his arms around her, occasionally patted her awkwardly, and let her soak his shirt.</p><p>Once the tears stopped, the hiccups started. Her head was down on his good shoulder, her mouth pressed against the side of his throat. She told herself to get a grip and move away from him.</p><p>\u201cDylan?\u201d</p><p>He smiled against her. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell what?\u201d</p><p>Dylan lazily picked up a strand of her hair and let it slowly slide over his hand. Her hair smelled like apricots. She was so warm and feminine, and he was very aware that the only thing between his hands and her body were a flimsy T-shirt and shorts.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it. Yeah, right. Telling himself not to think about it made it all the more impossible not to think about it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t kiss and tell.\u201d He grimaced. His voice was hoarse and a little gruff.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t kissed you . . . yet.\u201d</p><p>He needed to regain control of the situation . . . and himself. \u201cListen. I won\u2019t tell anyone you cried. Now get off me.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his neck, deliberately tormenting him by tickling his skin with the tip of her tongue.</p><p>\u201cSon of a . . .\u201d</p><p>He jerked back, as though he\u2019d just been struck by lightning.</p><p>Kate wiped the tears from her face with the backs of her hands as she sat up.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think? You\u2019re a fraud,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Teardrops glistened on her eyelashes and slipped down her cheeks, and he suddenly wanted to kiss every one of them.</p><p>\u201cHow am I a fraud?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She stared into his eyes and said, \u201cYou love to flirt when you think you\u2019re safe, but now that I\u2019m . . . willing,\u201d she whispered, \u201cand taking the initiative, you\u2019re shaking in your boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing boots, sugar.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd this is me shaking in my socks.\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped the back of her neck and gently pulled her close. He took his time as his lips gently touched hers. The contact of her mouth on his changed everything. This wasn\u2019t a teasing little kiss. It was hot, openmouthed, tongue stroking, and son of a bitch, it was nearly his undoing.</p><p>A shiver of longing rushed through Kate. She wrapped her arms around his neck and let him kiss the breath out of her, and she quickly became the aggressor. She felt his hand splayed wide across her back. How he\u2019d gotten under her T-shirt was beyond her comprehension at the moment.</p><p>He tried to end the kiss, but she wouldn\u2019t let him even as she was realizing that seducing Dylan was a bad idea. A really bad idea. She had never, ever had a one-night stand before, but all she wanted to do now was lose herself in his arms and pretend all was right with the world for one glorious night.</p><p>Wham, bam, thank you, ma\u2019am. She didn\u2019t really even need a thank-you. It would be one night of escape, pure and simple.</p><p>Oh, who was she kidding? There wouldn\u2019t be anything simple about it. At least not for her. Sex with the proper stranger who just happened to be her best friend\u2019s brother would be filled with problems and regrets. No, she couldn\u2019t do it. She would feel too much guilt tomorrow.</p><p>Why did she have to be so uptight about sex? Why couldn\u2019t she be more nonchalant about the whole thing? Her girlfriends, most of them anyway, didn\u2019t think it was a big deal to hook up with a different guy every Saturday night. But Jordan didn\u2019t do that, and neither did Kate. Jordan used to say that she had too much respect for her body to rent it out to any guy for a night. Kate felt the same way. There had to be an emotional investment, didn\u2019t there? No, no, then there would be strings, wouldn\u2019t there? And she didn\u2019t want that, either. Kate knew she could come up with at least a hundred other reasons why she was so skittish, but maybe what it really boiled down to was that she was terrified of being hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And that admission tipped the scales. It was definitely safer to abstain.</p><p>Now that she had made the decision, all she had to do was implement it. She was going to have to stop kissing him first, of course, but oh Lord, that was proving a difficult challenge. Dylan was an amazing kisser. He could give lessons. He took his time, savoring what he was doing, as he lazily explored her mouth with his tongue.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure when she crossed the line from being smart and sending him on his way to unbuttoning his shirt and kissing nearly every inch of his neck and chest. He was warm and hard and sexy. Her fingers gently traced the ragged scar on his left shoulder. The bullet had gone clear through, tearing tendon and muscle and just barely missing an artery.</p><p>Dylan grabbed her hand and wouldn\u2019t let her stroke him. He kissed her again, long and hard, and then tried to end it.</p> <p>\u201cKate, we aren\u2019t going to do this.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if she heard him. She was nibbling on his earlobe, driving him nuts. Then she shifted on his lap, and his jeans suddenly felt three sizes too small. It was damned painful. He grabbed hold of her h*ps to keep her from wiggling again. His voice was ragged when he said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to stop, now\u2019s the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t resist when he lifted her off his lap. She stood next to the sofa and looked away as she tried to catch her breath. Kissing had never caused such a reaction before, but then she\u2019d never kissed Dylan.</p><p>He also stood. They were toe to toe but he towered over her. He stared at the top of her head while he waited for her to look at him. His shirt was hanging out and was wide open, but he didn\u2019t bother to button it. His priority now was to get the hell out of the apartment before he did something he knew she would regret.</p> <p>He had no business starting this. Granted, he had had the hots for Kate since the moment he\u2019d met her. The woman was built, all right. Still, wanting and doing were two different things. Dylan loved women, and flirting with Kate was always fun. She might give others the appearance of being a sophisticated woman, but he saw through that fa\u00e7ade. When it came to men and sex, she wasn\u2019t all that experienced.</p><p>He threaded his fingers through his hair. He was throbbing with his need to touch her. To feel her na*ed body underneath him . . . to taste the liquid heat . . . to hear her moans of pleasure . . . to . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go.\u201d She reached out and grabbed hold of his shirttails. \u201cUnless you want to stay.\u201d She stared into his eyes as she slowly slid her arms around his waist. The feel of his warm skin made her want to do crazy things.</p><p>For one night only. Like the commercial . . . a once in a lifetime deal . . . take it or leave it.</p><p>\u201cKate, listen to me. You know I want you, but . . .\u201d He gently pushed her arms down.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d She pulled back, but her eyes were still looking up into his.</p><p>His mouth settled on hers, his tongue slowly penetrated and then began to stroke hers until she trembled in his arms. He couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of her. He slowly eased her T-shirt up.</p><p>The second he touched the sides of her br**sts he felt her shiver, and he knew then he was lost. He tore his mouth away from hers, kissed her neck, and then moved lower, all the while telling himself to pull away.</p><p>He listened to his own warning for a second but then stepped back, lifted her into his arms, and carried her to her bed. His mouth left hers long enough to pull her T-shirt over her head.</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cCrazy for one night.\u201d</p><p>She was nibbling on his earlobe as she tugged his shirt off. The contact of her br**sts against his hairy chest made her shiver again. She helped him get out of his jeans.</p><p>Cradling her in his arms, he followed her down onto the bed. His hands caressed every inch of her body. She was just as passionate, as giving, and as frantic to please him. She rubbed against him, cuddled him between her thighs. He loved the feel of her soft body pressed so intimately against his own.</p> <p>He left her long enough to see to their protection and when he was ready, he drew her into his arms and kissed her again, a hot, searing kiss that made her ache to have him inside her.</p><p>Her response stunned him. She became a wild woman in his arms, and the sexy sounds she made drove him crazy. All he wanted to do was lose himself in her.</p><p>Her legs moved restlessly against his. \u201cDon\u2019t make me wait any longer . . . please,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He tore his mouth away and buried his face in the crook of her neck, inhaling her wonderful feminine scent as he thrust deep. He growled low with such intense pleasure he thought he would die from it. He heard her cry out, realized he might have hurt her, and went completely still. He could feel her throbbing around him, squeezing him, and damn, if he didn\u2019t know better, he would have thought this was her first time. He lifted his head and looked into her eyes, saw passion and tears there, but before he could speak, she closed her eyes and arched up against him.</p><p>He could feel the urgency in her. \u201cSweetheart, did I hurt you? Did I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her nails gently scored his shoulder blades as she once again arched up against him.</p><p>The pleasure she gave him intensified. He slowly withdrew and then thrust inside her again. She increased the pace, demanding more and more of him until they were both mindless to the world around them. Only the two of them existed, and for that short time, there were no problems, no fears, no insecurities.</p><p>She reached a shuddering, heart-stopping orgasm before he did. She cried out and squeezed him, forcing his own cl**ax.</p><p>Kate couldn\u2019t form a thought, couldn\u2019t make herself let go of him. She took deep breaths and tried without success to calm her racing heart.</p><p>\u201cAh, Kate,\u201d he whispered. He collapsed on top of her, grimaced when his left shoulder struck hers, and quickly eased the weight to his right side.</p><p>He could hear her ragged breathing and lifted up on one elbow. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He looked into her eyes and laughed. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond he ran his thumb across her lips. \u201cCan you feel my heart? It\u2019s still trying to jump out of my chest.\u201d</p><p>Her hand curled around his neck. She leaned up and kissed him, let go of him, and closed her eyes. \u201cYou exhausted me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the bridge of her nose and rolled away from her. It took every ounce of energy he had to get out of bed, but he finally managed it.</p><p>Kate heard the bathroom door close behind him. She was still woozy from their lovemaking, but reality was trying to intrude. She rolled to her side, pulled the sheet up, and hugged the pillow to her. She could taste him on her lips. Don\u2019t think about it, she told herself. Keep your eyes closed and try to go to sleep.</p><p>She tensed when she heard the door open. Light spilled across the bed, but she didn\u2019t look behind her. If he thought she was asleep, he would probably just leave. Had he come to his senses, too? Lord, she hoped he didn\u2019t regret what had happened.</p><p>She heard him yawn, and she felt the mattress give as he got back into bed. She tried to roll over to face him, but he hauled her up against him and kissed the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cAre you asleep?\u201d</p><p>His warm, sweet breath tickled her ear. \u201cYes.\u201d She gasped then, for he\u2019d just covered her breast with his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re asleep.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it, but she was actually embarrassed to look at him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she whispered, clutching the pillow tighter as he began to caress her breasts.</p><p>\u201cMaking love to you. Roll over, Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we . . . you\u2019re . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure am,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one night, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight\u2019s not over.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Dylan Buchanan was a man of his word. Their night didn\u2019t end until he left the apartment at seven the following morning. Saying good-bye should have been awkward, but Dylan made it easy. Kate was just drifting off to sleep when he leaned over her and kissed her on the cheek.</p><p>She remembered that sometime during the night he\u2019d told her he would be tied up for the rest of the weekend, but that he would probably see her Sunday night or Monday. He was either giving her the \u201cI\u2019ll call you sometime\u201d line or he actually thought she was back in Boston for good. She didn\u2019t correct the misconception. She doubted that after everything they had done she would ever be able to look him in the face again.</p><p>So much for being a sophisticated, empowered female.</p><p>The doctors kept Jordan until Sunday. She was still too miserable with her splotches to complain about having to stay in the hospital, and when she finally got home, she slept the afternoon away.</p><p>Kate picked up carryout for their dinner. They spent a quiet evening together, and both went to bed early.</p><p>Jordan wanted Kate to stay a couple more days, but Kate was anxious to get home and tackle the problems there. She also wanted to get out of Boston before she ran into Dylan again. Every time he was mentioned Kate rushed to change the subject. She usually told Jordan everything, but this was different. Way different.</p><p>By Monday Jordan was feeling much better and the splotches had faded. Still, Kate wouldn\u2019t let her drive her to the airport. She took a cab. It wasn\u2019t until she was in the air and on her way back home that she realized how nervous she\u2019d been about seeing Dylan. She sighed with acute relief and decided then never to think about him again. She couldn\u2019t change what had happened, but she could force herself never to think about it or talk about it to anyone.</p><p>Out of sight, out of mind didn\u2019t work. She tried to read, but she couldn\u2019t concentrate, and when she closed her eyes and pretended to sleep so the salesman sitting next to her would stop bothering her, all she could see was Dylan\u2019s amazing body. The man didn\u2019t have any fat at all. And his thighs . . . oh Lord, those thighs . . .</p><p>Stop thinking about him. Telling herself to do so didn\u2019t make it happen, though. By the time she reached Charleston, she was furious with herself. She had the discipline of a nymphomaniac. How could she go so long without sex and then in one night . . .</p><p>Stop thinking about it. Those words were becoming a chant in her head.</p><p>She took a bus to the long-term parking lot. When she was dropped off, she stood for a second and watched lightning shoot across the ominous sky as she tried to remember where she had parked her car. The bus had just turned the corner when she heard a car coming up behind her. She was standing in the center of the lot and hurried to get out of the way. The driver, she noticed, increased his speed. It was probably some teenager with a lead foot, she thought as she jumped between two parked cars to get out of his way. The car zoomed past. Kate tried to see the driver\u2019s face but couldn\u2019t. The windows had been tinted a dark gray. She shook her head as she watched him turn the corner on two wheels.</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t just referring to the crazy driver. She was feeling like an idiot herself because she had forgotten where she\u2019d parked the car. She dug through her purse until she found the parking ticket stuck in the back of her billfold. Fortunately, she had remembered to write down the number and the row on the back of the ticket. She was standing in section B, but her car was in D, row three. She headed in that direction, pulling her overnight case behind her.</p><p>Her battered, rusted-out car was parked by the exit, wedged in between two huge SUVs. She put her suitcase in the trunk and was just pushing the lid down when she heard the squeal of tires. She turned around and spotted the same white car barreling down the lot one row over. He slowed down a couple of times, then increased his speed again.</p><p>Kate had the sense that the driver was trying to find someone. He had to be a teenager, probably joy-riding around the lot, having a fine old time scaring people or, more specifically, scaring her.</p><p>The car was heading down her row now. She wasn\u2019t certain if the driver saw her or not. He was barreling straight toward her as if he was actually trying to run her down. She dove to the pavement just as the car sped by, and she whacked her knee in the process. Grimacing from the sting, she got to her knees. Her purse had opened and her lipstick was rolling under the Suburban. She hit her head when she lunged for it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow I am an idiot. A paranoid one at that.\u201d</p><p>She heard a car honk and thought that maybe the white car was terrorizing someone else. She finally managed to unlock her door and get inside. She felt like she was climbing into a pizza oven. She quickly rolled down the windows but didn\u2019t turn the air conditioner on just yet because the car had been sitting a long while and would stall if she didn\u2019t let the motor warm up. Getting it started a second time would be tricky at best.</p><p>She looked for the white car as she drove to the booth, and after she\u2019d paid for parking, she told the attendant about the crazy driver. He immediately picked up the phone to call security.</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t remember to turn her cell phone on until she was waiting at a red light before merging onto the highway. She found it in the bottom of her purse, and about twenty seconds after she pushed the button for power, the phone rang, notifying her that she had voice mail.</p><p>The message was from a contractor named Bill Jones. Kate had never heard of him. He explained he worked for the owner of the warehouse she was going to lease, and he wanted to meet her there to go over the design changes she wanted. He also mentioned that the inventory she\u2019d sent over had been stacked in the back of the space and would be out of harm\u2019s way during the renovation.</p><p>What was going on? Kate hadn\u2019t even signed the lease yet, and she certainly hadn\u2019t authorized any construction on the warehouse. What had the Realtor told the warehouse owner? She waited until she was at another stoplight to return the call. Jones answered on the second ring. She pulled off the street and into a parking lot as soon as the light changed. She hated talking on her cell phone while she was driving.</p><p>\u201cJones here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Kate MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>There was static on the line and what sounded like traffic in the background. The contractor couldn\u2019t have been at the warehouse because that was located at the end of an isolated street.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you called, Miss MacKenna. I need to see you at the warehouse as soon as possible. Time is money, and I\u2019ve got my crews ready to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Your message said that my inventory was moved over to the warehouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m on my way over there now. I\u2019ll be waiting for you. It shouldn\u2019t take long at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait a minute. Who authorized the move?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, and then he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. The boxes with your name on them were just there when I opened this morning.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t make sense. Kiera and Isabel wouldn\u2019t have arranged anything like that, and Kate\u2019s two full-time employees were on vacation.</p><p>\u201cMr. Jones, I can\u2019t make any changes or authorize any improvements\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He cut her off before she could explain that she wasn\u2019t going to sign a lease. With her bleak financial situation, moving her company now was the last item on her agenda. She needed first to figure out how to keep her company before she did anything else.</p><p>\u201cListen, you\u2019re breaking up. Just meet me there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe side door\u2019s unlocked if you get there before I do. Grab a cup of coffee and wait for me. I\u2019m across town, and there\u2019s quite a bit of traffic, but I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Jones, about my inventory\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to move it, we\u2019ll move it for you.\u201d</p><p>Kate was so frustrated she wanted to scream. How many boxes had been taken to the warehouse? It appeared the only way to find out was to drive there and see for herself.</p> <p>They\u2019d have to be moved immediately. She could stack them in her garage, she supposed, but then she\u2019d have to move them again when the house went on the market. Oh Lord, how was she going to tell Isabel and Kiera?</p><p>First things first. She tried to get her sisters on the phone to tell them she\u2019d be late, but the answering machine picked up. She left a message informing them that she was back in town but was going over to the warehouse before she came home.</p><p>She was just pulling out of the parking lot to get back onto the highway when she noticed how low she was on gas. Since she was in an unfamiliar part of the city, it took her a while to find a filling station. She spotted a McDonald\u2019s across the street and decided to get a Diet Coke. She wasn\u2019t in a hurry to get to the warehouse because she didn\u2019t want to have to wait for Jones.</p><p>She arrived at the warehouse a half hour later. It was located at the end of a long winding street in an area that was earmarked for renovation by the city. There were already several trendy lofts just a few blocks away. Pembroke Street hadn\u2019t been touched yet, and there were potholes everywhere, requiring a lot of zigzagging. The empty storefronts with broken windows hadn\u2019t been repaired yet, but the projected turnaround in this blighted area of Silver Springs and the expansion that would follow were exactly what Kate had been looking for.</p><p>The building was still quite a distance from her house, but the rent was doable\u2014or at least she used to think it was\u2014and she had intended to put in a security system for the safety of the employees.</p><p>The employees she might have to let go.</p> <p>\u201cStop feeling sorry for yourself,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Kate pulled into the lot and parked directly in front of the side door. There weren\u2019t any other cars or vans around.</p><p>She was about to turn the motor off when her phone rang. She sat back, adjusted the vents, and picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jones. Are you there yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cI should be there in about five minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp yourself to some coffee while you wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t drink coffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, wondering why they were having this inane conversation.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind turning the pot off? Last time I forgot I nearly burned the place down.\u201d</p><p>That comment didn\u2019t instill a lot of confidence in Kate. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll turn it off,\u201d she said. \u201cBut about my inventory . . .\u201d she continued impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have those boxes moved tomorrow. They never should have been sent over in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry if there\u2019s been a mix-up, Miss MacKenna. I\u2019ll do whatever you want. I\u2019ll see you in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected the call before she could tell him that meeting him was really a waste of his time and hers, that she wasn\u2019t going to be making any improvements because she wasn\u2019t going to be renting the space. Still, she did want to see how many boxes of her scented candles and body lotion had been moved.</p><p>Kate tossed her phone on the seat next to her, but it struck her purse, bounced to the floor, and rolled under the seat.</p><p>She unfastened her seat belt and was reaching for the phone when the engine began to make an all too familiar knocking sound. She knew what that meant. She quickly turned the air conditioner off and then the motor so that it could cool down. Otherwise, it would be impossible to start again. She leaned across the console and bent down to get her phone.</p><p>She was digging under the seat when the warehouse exploded.</p><p>The blast, like a sonic boom, rocked Kate\u2019s car and blew out the windows. Had she been sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, her face would have been slashed by the razor-sharp chunks of glass flying through the air. The shards pounded the hood and roof of her car and impaled the sides. Next came the wall of fire that blew through the building and rolled across the parking lot. The tires of her car buckled from the intense heat. The dashboard stayed in one piece as it was ripped free and propelled through the back window. It landed on top of the Dumpster across the lot.</p><p>Kate lay unconscious on the floor, unaware of the destruction surrounding her.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d</p><p>Those were the first words out of Kiera\u2019s mouth when she was finally allowed to see her sister. Kate had been taken to the Silver Springs hospital and had just been moved to her room and helped into her bed when both her sisters came storming in.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you been there and done that already?\u201d Kiera asked with a worried smile. She was so overcome with joy that Kate hadn\u2019t been seriously injured there were tears in her eyes.</p><p>Isabel was beside herself. \u201cYou could have been killed. Why do you have to do things like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d Kiera said.</p><p>Isabel was shaking her head. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Kate. I\u2019m not going to ever let you leave the house again. I\u2019ll even give up college and stay home to make sure you stay put and out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel, you\u2019re not being reasonable,\u201d Kiera said.</p><p>\u201cReasonable?\u201d She sounded frantic now. \u201cIs it reasonable to get yourself blown up twice in one week? Is that reasonable?\u201d She looked at Kate, pointed a finger, and stammered, \u201cYou scared me.\u201d She burst into tears and turned her back on Kate. \u201cI mean it. I\u2019m not going to college.\u201d</p><p>Kiera walked over to the bed. \u201cShe\u2019s been like this since we heard, but now that she knows you\u2019re fine, she\u2019ll stop crying.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s head was killing her, and it was difficult to follow the conversation. She was in a dark room, but when Isabel pulled the drapes open, Kate winced. Isabel noticed and immediately closed them again.</p><p>\u201cYou were really lucky. Your skull should have been split wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a picture I won\u2019t soon be forgetting, Kiera,\u201d Isabel snapped. She grabbed a tissue and wiped her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJordan\u2019s called a couple of times,\u201d Kiera said, ignoring Isabel now. \u201cShe\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called to say hello and Isabel told her what happened and how the fire department had to pry you out of your car. It\u2019s totaled, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be thankful I didn\u2019t call Aunt Nora. She\u2019s only now unpacking, I bet, but she would have dropped everything and come back here. She\u2019d make sure you didn\u2019t take any more crazy chances,\u201d Isabel said.</p><p>Kate closed her eyes. \u201cWhen can I go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow at the earliest. The doctor may want to keep you longer.\u201d</p><p>Isabel\u2019s voice shook. \u201cYour face looks sunburned. It\u2019s probably from the fire. Kate, do you have any idea how close you came to being killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to start crying again, are you?\u201d Kiera asked.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I can\u2019t be a robot like you and keep my emotions all bottled up.\u201d</p><p>Kiera didn\u2019t respond to the comment. \u201cWe should go and let you rest,\u201d she said to Kate.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Kate whispered, surprised her voice sounded so weak. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>She started to shake her head and quickly changed her mind. Pain shot up to the top of her skull.</p><p>\u201cThey think it was a gas leak,\u201d Kiera said.</p><p>\u201cWe heard it on the radio on the way over,\u201d Isabel said. \u201cIt must have been a gas leak because it\u2019s taking forever to put out the fire.\u201d</p><p>Kiera changed the subject. \u201cYou were fortunate the neurologist was here,\u201d she said. \u201cI talked to him, and he said he was happy with the scans. It appears you\u2019re going to come out of this without any serious injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiera was concerned you jarred something loose in your brain,\u201d Isabel said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you were concerned,\u201d Kiera countered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it was me. The doctor was so cute. You know what, Kiera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, here we go again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just going to say that he would be perfect for you. I know what you\u2019re going to say,\u201d she rushed on before Kiera could stop her. \u201cHe\u2019s not interested in you, but you can\u2019t possibly know if he is or not until you . . . you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake a move. Talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not have this conversation?\u201d</p><p>Isabel ignored the request. \u201cMaybe if you put on a little makeup and did something about your hair . . .\u201d</p><p>Kiera folded her arms across her waist and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get a good haircut and not one of those five-dollar places, either, and you should get some concealer to hide those dark smudges under your eyes. You\u2019re sleep-deprived, and you know what? I blame it all on medical school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the risk of sounding like you . . . duh.\u201d</p><p>Kate started to laugh and then groaned. Her head fell back against the pillows and she closed her eyes. \u201cStop making me laugh, and take your discussion someplace else. I just want to pull the covers over my head and pretend today didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Kate, you still haven\u2019t told us why you were at that warehouse,\u201d Isabel said.</p><p>Kate opened her eyes. She started to answer and then stopped. \u201cI don\u2019t remember. I mean, I feel like I do, but I can\u2019t think right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything?\u201d</p><p>Kate took a long minute before answering. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIsn\u2019t that odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019ll come back to you. Get some rest now. I\u2019ll be here later to check on you,\u201d Kiera said.</p><p>Isabel wasn\u2019t ready to leave. She went to the side of the bed and asked, \u201cDo you remember going to Boston?\u201d</p><p>Kate smiled. \u201cYes, I do. And I remember coming home. There was a car . . . at the airport . . .\u201d</p><p>Isabel patted her hand. \u201cYes, there was a car,\u201d she said. Her voice was soothing, and she was acting as though she was trying to reason with a three-year-old. \u201cYou\u2019re remembering your car. You drove to the airport.\u201d</p><p>Kate looked to Kiera for help.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, would you hand me the phone before you leave?\u201d Kate asked. \u201cI want to call Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember her phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel, the bump on her head didn\u2019t turn her into an idiot,\u201d Kiera said.</p><p>Isabel shrugged. She handed the phone to Kate and patted her hand again. \u201cTell Jordan we said hello,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if she wants to come see you, you better tell her not to,\u201d she added. \u201cWith your streak of bad luck, someone might run over her before she gets to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has been a horrible week, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cIt can only get better,\u201d Isabel assured her as she followed Kiera out the door.</p><p>Kate hoped she was right. She turned onto her side and fell sound asleep.</p><p>A couple of hours later she called Jordan. She tried her best to be cheerful, but it took effort. The attempt didn\u2019t work. Her friend could hear the stress in her voice.</p><p>\u201cTell me about that first explosion again,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cNow that I\u2019m not worried about bumps and lumps I can concentrate. Someone was trying to kill that artist, right?\u201d</p><p>Kate went through it all again, and when she was finished with that incident, she told her about the crazy teenager joy-riding in the airport parking lot. Last, but certainly not least, she told her about her latest mishap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember the explosion at all,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I keep thinking about coffee. Isn\u2019t that peculiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t drink coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s what makes it peculiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow hard was that hit on your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hard enough to give me a headache. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think someone was trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Jordan laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You\u2019ve just had a bit of bad luck, that\u2019s all. Do you want me to come down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Besides, maybe this bad streak isn\u2019t over, and I don\u2019t want you hurt in the fallout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let your imagination get the better of you. Remember, you\u2019re not a superstitious person, so don\u2019t overreact. Could I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid something happen between you and Dylan?\u201d</p><p>Kate nearly dropped the phone. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called here looking for you, and when he found out you\u2019d left, he wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why. So you really don\u2019t think someone might be trying to kill me?\u201d she asked, searching for anything that would steer the discussion in a different direction.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s trying to kill you. I do think you\u2019ve got an overactive imagination. Get some sleep and call me tomorrow when you\u2019re lucid again.\u201d</p><p>Jordan disconnected the call and immediately dialed Dylan\u2019s number. The second he answered she blurted, \u201cSomeone\u2019s trying to kill Kate.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dylan wasn\u2019t in the best of moods. He\u2019d just finished another grueling hour of physical therapy for his shoulder, and that had hurt like hell. The muscles were still throbbing, and though he had a prescription for painkillers, he wasn\u2019t going to take any. He wasn\u2019t trying to be macho. He had tried a couple of the pills last week and had hated the way they made him feel. The pills did dull the pain, but they also dulled his ability to think. He\u2019d felt as though he was moving around in a thick fog. No, thank you. He\u2019d take the pain over the fog any day of the week.</p><p>He was about to strip out of his clothes and get into a hot shower when Jordan called.</p><p>After checking the caller ID, he picked up the phone and said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s nice.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re out of the hospital now. I don\u2019t have to be nice. And since when have I ever been a nice guy? You\u2019re getting me mixed up with Alec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way I\u2019d confuse the two of you. Alec\u2019s a slob and you\u2019re a neat freak, which is why you two made such perfect roommates growing up, but unlike Alec, you can be a real grouch sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re finished with the compliments, I\u2019d like to get into the shower.\u201d</p><p>Jordan was on a roll. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re real nice to the women you want to sleep with, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, for the last time, what do you want?\u201d he asked, deciding her comment about his sex life didn\u2019t merit a response.</p> <p>\u201cKate\u2019s in trouble. The problem is, I don\u2019t think she realizes she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m hanging up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d</p><p>She quickly explained what she knew about the first explosion and said, \u201cIf that wasn\u2019t enough for poor Kate, when she returned from Boston, someone tried to run her down in the airport parking lot. And then . . . Dylan, are you listening?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right,\u201d Jordan continued. \u201cSomeone is trying to kill her. There\u2019s more, too,\u201d she added.</p><p>Before she could tell him about the second explosion, he said, \u201cWhat exactly do you want me to do about it? Talk to whoever is in charge of the investigation? I doubt the detectives in South Carolina would want me looking over their shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to call. I want you to go to Silver Springs and check it out. You\u2019re on leave from the department, so you\u2019ve got the time, and I know you\u2019re bored. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re hesitating. This weekend you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw Kate. What is it with you? Out of sight, out of mind?\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, right, he thought. He hadn\u2019t been able to get Kate out of his mind since he\u2019d touched her, and that bothered the hell out of him. She was messing with his mind.</p><p>She obviously wasn\u2019t giving him a second thought. She\u2019d left Boston without a word, so their night together had been what he and she had wanted it to be, recreational. That attitude should have pleased him. No commitment and no messy good-byes. One perfect night, no doubt about that, with no regrets.</p><p>So why was he so irritated she\u2019d left without telling him?</p><p>He shook his head. She wasn\u2019t easy to forget, and that was all there was to it. It might take a couple of weeks, but then he wouldn\u2019t give her another thought.</p><p>\u201cDylan, are you going to go to Kate or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking . . .\u201d</p><p>He was in a strange predicament. He\u2019d never been dumped by a woman before, and he didn\u2019t know how to feel about it. No, that wasn\u2019t true. He knew how he felt. Damned angry.</p><p>Had he ever treated a woman like that? Spent the night with her and then vanished? He shook his head. He hoped he hadn\u2019t. But had he?</p><p>He suddenly pictured her sitting by his bedside in the hospital. To this day she didn\u2019t know he was aware of her. He had opened his eyes and looked at her just as she was drifting off to sleep. He remembered he liked her being there.</p><p>But then he liked women, he told himself. Still, she\u2019d been there for him, so shouldn\u2019t he do the same for her?</p><p>Jordan\u2019s patience ran out.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t go, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell. Okay, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheer up, Dylan. If I\u2019m right, you might get to shoot someone.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Roger Mackenna had some badass friends. They were \u201ccasino friends\u201d who\u2019d slithered up to him at the gaming table, introduced themselves, and became his best buddies almost overnight. When Roger won, they helped him spend his money. When his winning streak ended, however, his new best friendsturned into sniveling and conniving snakes. They introduced him to a loan shark named Johnny Jackman, and when Roger was over two hundred thousand in debt at fifty percent interest, his friends wooed him back to the tables to lose even more.</p><p>All the sharks in town had a hands-off policy toward Roger because they knew, like everyone else in the gambling world who\u2019d run a background check on him, that when Roger\u2019s uncle Compton MacKenna died, Roger would inherit millions of dollars. If anything happened to Roger in the meantime, none of the sharks would get a dime.</p><p>Johnny Jackman had quite an investment and had his own crew tailing Roger at all times. This was an asset he wasn\u2019t going to let out of his sight. He didn\u2019t want Roger reformed either, so when he became infatuated with a pretty little thing named Emma who talked him into attending a Gamblers Anonymous meeting, Jackman became concerned. The next evening sweet little Emma was taken out of town.</p><p>Roger was told that Emma had been in an automobile accident. He went to the hospital, took one look at her bruised and swollen face, and went running back to the casino. Emma left town as soon as she was released from the hospital. Roger sighed with relief. He had felt such terrible guilt that he couldn\u2019t stomach the sight of her, but now that she was out of his life, he could forget about her. He could also forget all about ever attending meetings for his gambling addiction.</p><p>By July, Johnny Jackman was getting nervous. Roger had racked up a debt of an even seven hundred thousand dollars, and if it wasn\u2019t paid to the casino by the first of September, Jackman would have to pay it.</p><p>Jackman decided he couldn\u2019t afford to be a patient, nice guy any longer. He took Roger to dinner that night at Emerald\u2019s, let him drink a bottle of expensive wine, and then told him that if he didn\u2019t find a way to repay every dollar with interest within thirty days, Jackman was going to start taking body parts as collateral. He toasted Roger and told him he was going to start between his legs.</p><p>He made sure Roger knew he wasn\u2019t bluffing.</p><p>Three packs of cigarettes and a bottle of gin a day had aged Roger. He was only thirty-four, but he looked sixty. His hair was thinning and gray. His complexion was just as gray from all the years he\u2019d spent in dark casinos and backrooms.</p><p>His nicotine-stained fingers shook as he lit another cigarette. \u201cWhere am I going to get that kind of money?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou know I\u2019m good for it, but not until my uncle dies. He\u2019s sick. It shouldn\u2019t take long. According to . . . my source, the old man is dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the source?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone real close to him. I\u2019m not going to give you the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, deciding not to press. \u201cBut your uncle could linger a long time, now couldn\u2019t he? If it\u2019s more than thirty-one days, you\u2019re going to be in a world of hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll pay you a bonus. And there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll win big the next time I hit the tables, right?\u201d</p><p>Jackman shook his head. \u201cYour credit is used up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome at any table until your debt is paid in full. Thirty-one days,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come up with all of it, you\u2019re no longer a man. You understand me? You won\u2019t get a sip of booze to dull the pain. My associates will take you out in the desert, hold you down, spread your legs, and . . . snip, snip.\u201d He made his fingers move like scissors. \u201cI might even tell them to put your balls in your mouth to stop you from screaming while they work on your penis. You do have balls, don\u2019t you, Roger?\u201d</p><p>Jackman was the most successful loan shark in the city, and when Roger stared into his cold, flat eyes, he suspected that a real shark had more feeling. He didn\u2019t have any doubt at all that Jackman would do what he promised. He wasn\u2019t a man who bluffed.</p><p>Roger began to hyperventilate. He overturned his chair in his haste to bolt from the table. He made it to the corridor before he threw up. Jackman followed him, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get me my money, aren\u2019t you, Roger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his arm and jerked him back. He whispered close to his ear, \u201cYour uncle\u2019s going to die real soon, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Roger began to cry. \u201cYes, he is.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later Roger took a cab to the airport and flew home on the red-eye. He was too scared and too sick to drink anything. He knew he had to get clear-headed. When he got back to Savannah, he was going to have to pay a visit to his uncle Compton to see for himself just how far gone the old man was and to assure himself the money would be coming soon.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Kate had wallowed in self-pity long enough and knew it was time to take charge. The trip to Boston had actually helped her get a grip on things. Dylan certainly had taken her mind off her problems, but she was determined never to do anything crazy like that again, and by the time she was released from the hospital a second time she was able to put everything into perspective.</p><p>She was going to have to make some huge changes. The first change was the most important to her. There would be no more secrets, and so she called a family meeting and explained to her sisters just how bleak their financial situation was. When she was finished, she put the stack of bills in the center of the kitchen table.</p><p>Kiera was rendered speechless. Isabel didn\u2019t want to believe any of it. She refused to hear anything that might discredit her mother. Kiera became the peacemaker when Kate demanded that Isabel open her eyes and stop trying to make their mother a saint.</p><p>\u201cHow about we all agree that mother did the best she could,\u201d Kiera said, \u201cand then let\u2019s move on. Arguing won\u2019t help us figure anything out, and right now we need to form some kind of a plan.\u201d</p><p>Isabel finally calmed down. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Kiera. Mother did do the best she could. We never went hungry, did we? And I got braces when I needed them, and she made sure all of us were educated.\u201d</p><p>Her sisters were quick to agree. \u201cAnd Kate, Mom wouldn\u2019t have hocked your company if she hadn\u2019t needed to, so stop being angry at her,\u201d Isabel demanded. \u201cShe can\u2019t be here to defend herself.\u201d She didn\u2019t give Kate time for a rebuttal but said, \u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what?\u201d Kiera asked.</p><p>Isabel took a deep breath, folded her hands on the table and said, \u201cI guess this,\u201d she nodded toward the stack of bills, \u201cmeans no college for me . . . yet. Since Kiera is on a full scholarship, she should finish her last year of medical school, right? And you and I, Kate, are going to have to get jobs right away if we\u2019re going to keep the house.\u201d</p><p>Kiera was trying not to smile. \u201cAren\u2019t you the little planner? So there is a brain under all that blond hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to be sarcastic,\u201d Isabel snapped.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t being sarcastic,\u201d Kiera said. \u201cI was giving you a backhanded compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel, your education is far more important than keeping the house. This place has served its purpose. We have to let it go,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cBut if you got a real good job . . . with your education . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think she\u2019s going to let the bank take her company?\u201d Kiera asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she can stop them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we need money now, don\u2019t we? The electric company will turn off the power if we don\u2019t pay their bill. How long do we have? Hey, I\u2019ve got an idea. You know what I think we should do?\u201d</p><p>Kate was afraid to ask. Isabel was famous for coming up with nutty ideas. This one turned out to be a real whopper.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s rent out rooms.\u201d</p><p>Kate wasn\u2019t certain if she laughed first or Kiera did. Isabel let them have their moment and then said, \u201cIt makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you . . .\u201d Kiera began.</p><p>Kate nudged her under the table. She didn\u2019t want Kiera to make fun of Isabel\u2019s harebrained scheme now. Their sister had just had the rug pulled out from under her. She was losing her home, and right now she thought she was losing her college education, too.</p><p>\u201cEven if we rented rooms, we couldn\u2019t make enough money to pay all of these bills and a huge loan,\u201d Kiera said. She smiled as she added, \u201cUnless we charged around ten thousand a week.\u201d</p><p>Isabel ran her fingers through her hair. \u201cOkay, it was a dumb idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kate said. \u201cYou\u2019re brainstorming and that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were smart like you and Kiera, we wouldn\u2019t be worried about this. Kiera got a full ride through college and medical school. The money she gets even pays for her living expenses. I\u2019m the drag on this family.\u201d</p><p>Kate rolled her eyes, and Kiera shook her head. \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to play the drama princess,\u201d Kiera said.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll unpack my stuff.\u201d She sounded pitiful. \u201cIt took forever to get it all inside Kiera\u2019s car. And I\u2019ll have to call the school tomorrow and ask them to send back the boxes I\u2019ve already shipped with all my room stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t unpack the car. You\u2019re still leaving for college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plan hasn\u2019t changed. Kiera\u2019s going to drive you there in her car, and then she\u2019ll drive on to Duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where will we get the money for my tuition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe initial fees have already been paid,\u201d Kiera said. She turned to Kate. \u201cI could take out a loan, couldn\u2019t I, to pay the rest of her tuition and expenses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good backup plan, but for now I think I can come up with enough from my business account and the household account to cover the first semester.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut how will you live?\u201d Isabel asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rent a car. Since mine was totaled, the insurance company will be sending me a check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be getting much for that old pile of junk,\u201d Isabel remarked.</p><p>\u201cCould the bank put a hold on the money in the accounts?\u201d Kiera asked.</p> <p>Kate shook her head. \u201cThe bank can\u2019t touch the money until the loan is due.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s less than a month away,\u201d Isabel said.</p><p>Kate got up from the table and went to the refrigerator to get a bottle of water. It was a luxury she would soon be doing without. Nothing wrong with plain old tap water, she thought.</p><p>She reached for three bottles, handed one to each of her sisters, and said, \u201cWhen I first opened all of those bills and notices and read the letter from the bank explaining that our mother had signed away everything, including my company, I can tell you, I was extremely upset.\u201d</p><p>Isabel dropped her head and Kate hurried to add, \u201cYou have to stop trying to understand or defend Mom. You said it yourself. She did the best she could.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why did you go and bring it all up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to explain. I was stunned and furious, and I certainly wasn\u2019t thinking straight. Now, however, I\u2019m back in control.\u201d She circled the table and sat down. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to take my company away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was Mom able to use your company as collateral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was an equal partner. I set it up that way because at first I was underage and it turned out to be convenient when I was in Boston. She had the authority to sign checks and act on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how are you going to stop the bank from taking your company?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work something out with the department store, maybe give them a bigger percentage for a lump sum up front. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut if that doesn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow Isabel\u2019s advice. I\u2019ll take in renters.\u201d She smiled as she added, \u201cMaybe the men will pay more if I throw in a little something extra.\u201d</p><p>Kiera laughed. The doorbell rang, interrupting the discussion. Isabel jumped up and headed for the door. \u201cMaybe this is our first renter,\u201d she called out, laughing now.</p><p>Kate glanced at Kiera as she stood. \u201cYou think that could be Reece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s gone to Europe. He left a message for Isabel that he was leaving, and he hoped she\u2019d think about their future together while he was gone.\u201d</p><p>Kate replied. \u201cOh dear. Well, at least he\u2019s away from Silver Springs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, your first renter is here,\u201d Isabel called out from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWhat in heaven\u2019s name . . .\u201d Kate whispered.</p> <p>Both she and Kiera stood just as Isabel, grinning from ear to ear, walked into the kitchen. Dylan Buchanan was right behind her.</p><p>Kate was so astonished to see him she fell into the chair. Isabel introduced him to Kiera, who was moving forward to shake his hand. Kate couldn\u2019t find her voice to say hello. Or good-bye.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard so much about you,\u201d Kiera said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you. It wasn\u2019t possible for us to go to Kate and Jordan\u2019s graduation. Were all the Buchanans there?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and smiled. \u201cThere are a lot of us. We probably would have overwhelmed you.\u201d</p><p>He deliberately ignored Kate as he carried on a pleasant conversation with her sisters, answering questions about Nathan\u2019s Bay and Boston.</p><p>Kate was still reeling from the surprise. All she could do was stare at him and hope she wasn\u2019t blushing. Her face felt warm, though. Was blushing a telltale sign of guilt? But what did she have to feel guilty about? As if she didn\u2019t know. How about having hot, amazing sex all night long with her best friend\u2019s brother. Yep, that would do it, all right.</p><p>Oh my, he looked good. But untouchable, she told herself, even as she was remembering how warm and hard his body had been pressed against hers. Enough. He was untouchable, she repeated. The one-night-only special was over and done with, and the sooner she got him out of her house the better for her peace of mind.</p><p>Could a man grow taller in just a couple of days\u2019 time? No, he just seemed taller because he towered over Isabel. When Kate was finally able to stop gawking at him, she noticed that both of her sisters were pretty impressed with him, too.</p><p>Isabel looked starstruck, and Kiera couldn\u2019t stop smiling; however, she was a bit more astute than Isabel. She kept looking back and forth from Dylan to Kate. She knew something was going on, but Kate didn\u2019t think she had figured out what just yet.</p><p>Isabel was telling Dylan something he found amusing. That lopsided grin of his was outrageously adorable.</p><p>Kate finally shook herself from her stupor and stood. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>When he looked at her, she wished he hadn\u2019t. The smile was gone. She couldn\u2019t define the exact look on his face, but she would have to say it was somewhere between aloof and homicidal.</p><p>\u201cKate, where are your manners?\u201d Isabel asked, shocked by her sister\u2019s surly tone.</p><p>Kate circled the table and offered him her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see you again.\u201d Her speech took on a pronounced southern accent, but then it always did get thicker when she was nervous. She couldn\u2019t help that any more than she could help his effect on her.</p><p>He glanced down but didn\u2019t shake her hand.</p><p>Okay, she\u2019d tried the southern lady approach. Time to get rude again.</p><p>\u201cI repeat, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Isabel asked. She sounded appalled. \u201cYou\u2019re being terribly impolite.\u201d Turning to Dylan, she asked, \u201cMay I offer you something cold to drink? How about some iced tea or perhaps a soda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we all go into the living room? That would be so much more comfortable,\u201d Kiera suggested as she hurriedly gathered the bills into a stack and set them aside.</p><p>Dylan wasn\u2019t paying any attention to Kiera or Isabel. He was staring at Kate. He knew he\u2019d shaken her when he\u2019d walked into the kitchen, and it was just fine with him if she felt uncomfortable. She deserved at least that for leaving Boston and not telling him.</p><p>As if she could read his mind, she said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were coming here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving where?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>She folded her arms and frowned at Dylan as she took a step toward him. \u201cI spoke to Jordan just a couple of hours ago, and she\u2019s doing fine, so I know you aren\u2019t here because of her. Did she know you were coming? No, she couldn\u2019t have. She would have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, she sent me,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>She took another step closer. \u201cNo,\u201d she said suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cYes, she did,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll be staying with us?\u201d Isabel asked eagerly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Kiera and I will be leaving tomorrow, but I\u2019m sure Kate would love to have the company,\u201d she continued, casting a warning glance at Kate to cooperate and be hospitable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be staying with you, though I appreciate the offer. This is a quick trip. After I talk to Kate, I\u2019m going to check into a hotel. I\u2019ll probably be in town only one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must stay with us,\u201d she insisted. \u201cWe have the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wants to stay in a hotel, we should let him,\u201d Kate said with a scowl in Isabel\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay for dinner?\u201d Isabel asked. When she smiled, the dimple in her cheek was prominent.</p><p>Kate had the sudden desire to stuff a dish towel into Isabel\u2019s mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t think Dylan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to stay.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if he agreed because he was hungry or because he knew it would irritate Kate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a taste of southern hospitality,\u201d Isabel promised.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he said.</p><p>His cell phone rang. He smiled when he saw who was calling, said, \u201cExcuse me a minute,\u201d and walked out of the kitchen as he answered.</p><p>Kate waited until he was out of earshot and turned to Isabel. \u201cWill you stop flirting with him? I don\u2019t want him to stay for dinner. I want him to go back to Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want him to stay,\u201d Isabel argued.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d Kiera asked. \u201cFrom the moment Dylan walked in you\u2019ve been acting so strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRude,\u201d Isabel offered.</p><p>\u201cNothing is going on with me,\u201d Kate explained. \u201cI\u2019m just stressed. That\u2019s all. I just need a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I think?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>Neither Kate nor Kiera seemed interested in hearing what she had to say.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, go set the table,\u201d Kiera said. \u201cDinner\u2019s almost ready.\u201d</p><p>Isabel didn\u2019t protest. Kiera waited until she\u2019d gone into the dining room and whispered, \u201cSomething is going on. And don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s my imagination. I can see the sparks between you two, and the way you look at him and the way he looks at you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks at every woman the same way. He\u2019s got a real fan club back in Boston.\u201d</p><p>Kiera was trying to signal Kate to be quiet because Dylan was standing in the doorway again, but Kate was looking the other way and didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cWomen seem to love him,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned against the door frame. \u201cAnd I love women. No secret about that.\u201d His tone was neither boastful nor apologetic. He was simply stating a fact.</p><p>Not the least bit embarrassed, she turned toward him. \u201cYes, you do,\u201d she agreed. \u201cMay I have a word in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Pickle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop calling me that!\u201d she demanded in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink before you have your private word with my sister?\u201d Kiera asked. She pointed her paring knife at Kate as she continued. \u201cYou might want to fortify yourself. Kate isn\u2019t in the best of moods. She isn\u2019t always like this. She can be nice when she tries. When you get to know her better, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll learn to appreciate her as much as we do.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. He looked at Kate when he said, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think I can know her any better than I already do.\u201d He was happy to see that Kate looked like she wanted to punch him. \u201cWhy do you think I call her pickle? She\u2019s sweet one minute, sour the next.\u201d</p><p>Feeling the tension that was crackling between Kate and Dylan, Kiera said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll leave you two so you can talk.\u201d</p><p>When Isabel walked into the kitchen, Kiera turned her in the opposite direction and gave her a gentle shove back into the hallway.</p><p>They were gone before Kate could stop them. She spun around and frowned up at Dylan. \u201cOkay, so why are you really here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan seems to think you\u2019re in some kind of danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in any danger. I\u2019ve just had a little bad luck lately. Jordan\u2019s worrying over nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you were in an explosion. Why did you tell me the bruises were from a fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were,\u201d she said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t mention I fell when a bomb exploded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you mention it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>His expression grew darker. \u201cAnd somebody tried to run you down in a parking lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but it was just a teenager acting crazy.\u201d</p><p>He noticed the fresh bruises on her forehead and moved closer. Lifting the strands of hair covering the marks, he said, \u201cThese weren\u2019t there before, were they? These look new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are new,\u201d she replied as she backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cDid you fall again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cI was just coincidentally in the wrong place at the wrong time. It happens,\u201d she insisted. \u201cNothing for you or Jordan to be worried about. There\u2019s a perfectly good explanation for all of it.\u201d</p><p>Dylan turned a kitchen chair toward him and straddled it, resting his arms across the back. \u201cOkay then. Start explaining. Why don\u2019t you begin by telling me about this explosion,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me there was more than one explosion?\u201d Dylan looked incredulous.</p><p>Kate slowly nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. Jordan didn\u2019t mention . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not related,\u201d she explained. \u201cOne was a bomb and the other was a gas leak. They weren\u2019t even in the same city,\u201d she added. \u201cSo you see? Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cAll of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it.\u201d</p><p>The set of his jaw told her he wasn\u2019t going to let it go until she gave him a quick summation, and so she went through her ordeals from start to finish.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me see if I\u2019ve got the sequence. Explosion in Charleston, hospital, Boston, attempted hit and run in the Charleston airport parking lot, another explosion in Silver Springs, hospital again, and home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget Reece. He was a trauma, too,\u201d Kiera said. She was waiting in the doorway for Dylan to finish his rundown.</p><p>\u201cHe was more of a challenge than a trauma,\u201d Kate said. She then related what had happened when Reece had shown up at the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call the police?\u201d Dylan asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat could the police have done? He didn\u2019t threaten me or Isabel or Kiera,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t arrest someone for being obnoxious or sinister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he touch you?\u201d Dylan quietly asked.</p><p>She shook her head but immediately contradicted herself when she said, \u201cHe might have tried to push me out of the way so he could come inside. He was convinced Isabel was hiding somewhere in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching you in any way is enough to get the police involved,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>\u201cShe did think about calling them,\u201d Isabel blurted out. She had been listening from across the room. \u201cAfter she told Kiera and me what happened, she said there was still time for her to call the police and make a complaint, but . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>Isabel looked at Kate when she answered. \u201cI begged her not to,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI felt sorry for him.

Besides, I\u2019m leaving town for a long time, and he\u2019s in Europe. I\u2019ll just bet he comes home with a new girlfriend.\u201d She nodded as she added, \u201cI think he\u2019ll give up on me, but I doubt he\u2019ll ever forgive Kate. He thinks she\u2019s making me go away to college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you both go into the living room,\u201d Kiera said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the way, Kate. Kiera and I need to get dinner on the table,\u201d Isabel said. She was thankful the conversation had turned away from Reece.</p> <p>Dylan followed Kate out of the kitchen. She sat down on the sofa and said, \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>She should have been more specific, she supposed. He sat down next to her and was so close their arms were touching. She quickly moved to the end of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go through it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have forgotten something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget anything,\u201d she insisted. \u201cGo back to Boston and tell Jordan to stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s convinced you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you came all this way to save me?\u201d She pointed her finger at him and stabbed at the air. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to save me. I can take care of any problems that come my way.\u201d</p><p>He was trying to be patient. \u201cKate, what is it I do for a living?\u201d</p><p>She knew where this was going. \u201cYou\u2019re a detective with the Boston Police Department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why Jordan asked me to help figure out what\u2019s going on. Now, who was in charge of the bomb investigation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDetective Nate Hallinger. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to him,\u201d he said, and before she could argue with him he continued. \u201cIs he convinced that the explosion was meant to kill the artist, Cinnamon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in protective custody,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he must think she was the target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the question. \u201cWhat kind of explosive device was used?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t ask,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I doubt that Detective Hallinger would have told me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. His words were more clipped when he asked, \u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d</p><p>She pointed her finger again. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to snap at me. This isn\u2019t an interrogation room, and I\u2019m not a suspect.\u201d</p><p>He obviously had gotten a kick out of what she\u2019d said because he looked like he wanted to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think this is how I interrogate suspects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a tone.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her sarcasm, he continued. \u201cYou were inside your car when the place blew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was. One of the paramedics told me that the fire department had to use a can opener to pry me out of the wreckage. Fortunately, I was unconscious. I don\u2019t think I would have liked opening my eyes and seeing all that metal pressing in on me. It would be like waking up inside a steel coffin.\u201d</p><p>He inwardly cringed. \u201cYou were extremely lucky.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, acting as though what she\u2019d just told him wasn\u2019t all that terrible.</p><p>He had the urge to wrap his arms around her, but in her present mood he thought she\u2019d probably use that finger to poke him in his bad shoulder if he did. He made up his mind that, after they had discussed the more important issues plaguing her, he would find out why she was being so prickly with him. But for now, if she wanted to act as though they barely knew each other, he\u2019d go along with it.</p><p>His silence was making her nervous. She crossed one leg, then uncrossed it.</p><p>Dylan didn\u2019t believe in coincidences, and he didn\u2019t think that two near misses could be summed up as a streak of bad luck. Being in the wrong place once\u2014okay, he\u2019d buy that. But twice? No way.</p><p>\u201cDid Detective Hallinger give you his card?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><p>Kiera was standing at the sink washing fresh vegetables from the garden. Isabel was folding linen napkins.</p><p>\u201cKiera, what did you do with Detective Hallinger\u2019s card?\u201d Kate asked as she entered the kitchen.</p><p>Kiera tilted her head toward the refrigerator. \u201cIt\u2019s under the cow magnet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops. Kate, don\u2019t get mad,\u201d Isabel began.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot to tell you Detective Hallinger called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour ago. He\u2019d like to stop by later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, and it would have been rude of me to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsabel, you\u2019ve got to learn to write down messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was using the phone and I got call-interrupted,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s ready,\u201d Kiera announced.</p><p>Kate took the card back to the living room and handed it to Dylan. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to call him,\u201d she said. \u201cEvidently he\u2019s coming over. Dinner\u2019s ready. I\u2019ll show you where you can wash up.\u201d</p><p>Dylan had been checking his text messages. He put the phone away and stood.</p><p>Kate led the way. \u201cI would appreciate it if we didn\u2019t discuss explosions at dinner. I don\u2019t want Isabel and Kiera to worry. If they think there\u2019s a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem,\u201d she said. \u201cThen they won\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re protecting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Besides, my nearly getting blown up isn\u2019t suitable dinner conversation.\u201d Never in her wildest dreams could she ever have imagined those words coming out of her mouth.</p><p>He laughed as he followed her. \u201cIs that in the etiquette book?\u201d</p><p>Dinner was quite lovely by Isabel\u2019s standards. The conversation was actually pleasant.</p><p>As Isabel cleared the table, Kate and Kiera did the dishes. Dylan had offered to help, but Isabel was vehement in her refusal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the South now, and a guest in our home does not lift a finger.\u201d</p><p>Kiera told him it was pointless to argue, and so after once again thanking them for dinner, he excused himself from the table and went into the den at the back of the house to make a phone call. Kate noticed he shut the door.</p><p>The doorbell rang a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet that\u2019s Detective Hallinger,\u201d Isabel said. She put a platter down on the counter and hurried out of the kitchen. \u201cKiera,\u201d she called out, \u201cyou have time to go up the back stairs to put on some lipstick.\u201d</p><p>Kiera was filling the sink with soapy water when Isabel made the suggestion. She bowed her head and said, \u201cShe just doesn\u2019t stop, does she?\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed. \u201cBetter you than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason she isn\u2019t focusing on you right now is because she thinks you\u2019ve met your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning Dylan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I think I understand why she\u2019s trying to find someone for me. She doesn\u2019t want me to be lonely . . . or scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s had a harder time of it, much harder, this past year. She was so close to Mom. So the way I see it, we can\u2019t let her think she\u2019s on her own. I\u2019ll call her almost every day until she adjusts, but Kate, you\u2019re going to have to make weekend trips to see her, especially on parents\u2019 weekend. If I can get the time off, I\u2019ll be there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you happen to notice Dylan was asking Isabel all those questions about Reece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very smooth about it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s on the phone now running a check on Reece. You know, finding out if he has a criminal record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Lord, wouldn\u2019t that be something.\u201d</p><p>Kate dried her hands, handed Kiera the towel, and went to greet Detective Hallinger.</p><p>It was Dylan who actually let the detective inside. Isabel smiled and waited until Kate had made the introduction to say hello.</p><p>The two men shook hands. Hallinger was the first to speak. \u201cHow long are you in town, Detective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Dylan.\u201d</p><p>Kate was about to tell Hallinger that Dylan would be going home tomorrow, but she never got the chance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for a while. Not sure how long.\u201d</p><p>The two men were sizing each other up, like two roosters in a henhouse, she thought, and then she realized the comparison wasn\u2019t flattering to her or her sisters.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know yet,\u201d Dylan answered.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll stay with us,\u201d Isabel urged. She turned her attention to Detective Hallinger and said, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to see you, too,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you come in and sit down,\u201d she offered, gesturing toward the living room.</p><p>He and Dylan walked in together. Dylan was talking, but his voice was so low Kate couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying. The detective took his notepad out and started writing.</p><p>\u201cDid you offer him a beverage?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were standing right here. You know I didn\u2019t. Besides, this isn\u2019t a social call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you what was so important?\u201d</p><p>Kate was watching them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>Isabel pulled her toward the banister and farther away from the men. She glanced into the living room and lowered her voice and said, \u201cWhen Detective Hallinger called, he said he wanted to talk to you about something important. I thought he sounded kind of grim or something. I\u2019m not going anywhere if you\u2019re in trouble, Kate. I want to know what the detective says. Maybe I could sit with you and listen. I won\u2019t interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe detective just wants to tie up some loose ends,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing you haven\u2019t already heard.\u201d It was a lie, of course, and Isabel didn\u2019t look like she was buying it.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that? He hasn\u2019t had time to tell you anything yet.\u201d</p><p>Good point, she thought. \u201cI know because Dylan told me. And you trust him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how is that possible? He only just met Detective Hallinger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, you\u2019re suspicious. Dylan talked to someone at the police department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . okay, then.\u201d</p><p>Kate was appalled at how easily she could lie. She was getting a little too good at it.</p><p>Isabel looked relieved, though. Kate hadn\u2019t realized how much Isabel was worrying about her. So maybe in this instance the end did justify the means.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured her. \u201cAnd I will offer the detective something to drink. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother would want you to remember your manners.\u201d</p><p>World War III could be going on, but by God no one would be thirsty if Isabel had her way, Kate thought.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She tried to go into the living room, but Isabel stopped her once again. \u201cOne more thing and don\u2019t get mad.\u201d</p><p>Kate sighed. \u201cWho called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just wanted to see how you were doing. He was very upset. He told me he was mortified about you getting blown up at his party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not get blown up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou almost did,\u201d she said. \u201cCarl also said to tell you he\u2019s so sorry about everything, and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. He\u2019s kind of dramatic, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can be,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll call him when I get a free moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you can\u2019t call him. He said to tell you he\u2019s going away where no one can bother him. He wouldn\u2019t tell me where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll wait until he calls me again. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>Isabel looked guilty. \u201cYes, the box lady called. She said she had something important to ask you.\u201d She rushed on. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you about it because she said she\u2019d call back soon.\u201d As if on cue, the phone rang. \u201cSee?\u201d Isabel said gesturing toward the sound.</p><p>Kate glanced at Dylan and Nate, who were deep in conversation, then headed to the den to answer the phone.</p><p>Haley George was on the line. To all of her clients she referred to herself as \u201cthe box lady.\u201d She was one of Kate\u2019s most valued suppliers. Her small company, which designed and produced specialty containers, had provided the octagon boxes for Kate\u2019s products from the beginning. She never missed a deadline, and Kate had come to rely on her efficiency.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to call you so late,\u201d Haley apologized. \u201cI realize your business is on hiatus right now, but I thought I should call you about this right away so there won\u2019t be a delay when production starts again. I know how important the details are to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Haley,\u201d Kate assured. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new spools of ribbon came in today. Your initials were printed in silver as always, but the ribbon color isn\u2019t your usual mint green. This one is more of a sage green. If I send it back, it could take another month to get the right color. I want to know what you want me to do.\u201d</p><p>Kate sighed. With all of her other problems, the color of a ribbon seemed at the bottom of her priority list right now. Nevertheless, the design and color of her packaging had become a Kate MacKenna trademark, and if nothing else, she was a perfectionist when it came to consistency and quality.</p><p>\u201cSend it back,\u201d she told Haley. \u201cAnd thanks for letting me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Haley answered.</p><p>Kate hung up the phone. Maybe a slight variation in color wasn\u2019t all that important, she thought, but as long as this company was still hers, she would make sure it followed the high standards she had set for it.</p><p>Isabel stuck her head in the door. \u201cDylan\u2019s asking for you,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d Kate answered.</p><p>\u201cTry to be nice to him, Kate. He\u2019s Jordan\u2019s brother,\u201d she reminded her. \u201cYou could show him a little affection.\u201d</p><p>A little affection? If she only knew, Kate thought. Affection had reached a whole new plateau in Boston.</p><p>Kate joined the men and apologized for making them wait, but neither seemed to have noticed. They were busy sharing war stories about their departments.</p> <p>Hallinger had spread his notes on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cNate was telling me the FBI and ATF are both involved in the investigation now, which is no big surprise,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that means it\u2019s a real circus downtown,\u201d Nate said. \u201cEach agency wants to run the show. They\u2019re all stepping on each other\u2019s toes, and more are on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one wants to share information until they\u2019ve finished their reports,\u201d Dylan interjected.</p><p>Kate knew Dylan was simplifying the situation, but still, so many people thinking they were in charge complicated the situation and made the detective\u2019s job much more difficult. Assuming he was still part of the investigation.</p> <p>\u201cWhere does that put you, Detective?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could say I\u2019m at the bottom of the food chain,\u201d he answered, smiling. \u201cAnd please, call me Nate.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is his investigation no matter how many agencies get involved,\u201d Dylan added.</p><p>The two men had quickly become allies, and Kate thought she understood why. Their jobs put them in the trenches and in the line of fire, and neither one of them appreciated outsiders coming into their neighborhoods and taking over. It seemed to be a territorial thing.</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI\u2019s going to give me the most trouble,\u201d Nate remarked. \u201cThey\u2019re all arrogant know-it-alls.\u201d</p><p>Kate looked at Dylan to see how he was reacting to Nate\u2019s comments. He was smiling.</p><p>\u201cDid you mention to Nate that you have two brothers who are FBI agents?\u201d</p><p>Nate flinched. \u201cNo kidding. Look, I\u2019m sorry I . . .\u201d</p><p>Dylan put his hand up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Nick and Alec are both arrogant know-it-alls on occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know so far? Are there any leads? Any suspects?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been determined that the explosive was placed inside a basket of flowers. The investigators can usually pinpoint the origin of the explosion,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe basket was on the ground in front of a table toward the back of the tent. Your table,\u201d he added matter-of-factly.</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t show any outward reaction to the news. She simply nodded. \u201cI remember the flowers. They were beautiful. I didn\u2019t see who delivered them,\u201d she added, knowing that was Nate\u2019s next question. \u201cI went inside the gallery for just a few minutes, and when I came back to the tent, there they were.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just drove back from the airport,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI offered to pick up this hotshot expert named Sutherland. He leads the eastern national response team,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhich is actually part of the ATF. As it turns out, he\u2019s a real decent guy. He gave me some useful information. This is all off the record because he\u2019ll still go through the site with trained dogs and whatever else it takes, but he told me he knows who it is. He said he\u2019s been after this guy for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows who the bomber is?\u201d Kate felt an instant of relief.</p><p>\u201cHis signature,\u201d he corrected. \u201cHe knows his signature.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. She looked at Dylan, and he quickly explained. \u201cEvery bomber has a signature. They\u2019re creatures of habit,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the materials he uses, always the same, or maybe as in this case, where he hides it. This guy likes to hide the explosive in a basket, sometimes more than one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlower baskets,\u201d Nate interjected. \u201cThey call him the Florist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe likes to blow things up in a big way. He\u2019s partial to buildings, but he\u2019s done cars and houses. The thing is, no one\u2019s ever inside. He seems to go to great lengths to avoid hurting anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil now,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>Nate glanced at Dylan who nodded and then said to Kate, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good fire department in this little town. They know what they\u2019re doing, and one of them noticed the similarities and called Charleston PD to find out who was in charge of the Charleston investigation. That\u2019s when I found out you were at the warehouse.</p><p>\u201cNo easy way to say it,\u201d Nate said. \u201cSomeone tampered with the gas line, but Kate, that wasn\u2019t enough to cause the damage done. We checked it out and discovered it was\u2014\u201d</p><p>She realized at that moment what he was telling her. \u201cAnother bomb,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cYes, and you\u2019re the only connection between the two,\u201d Hallinger answered. He could see the bewilderment in her eyes. \u201cSo now we\u2019re wondering . . . who wants you dead?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>They gave her a couple of minutes to absorb the information. Nate was relieved she wasn\u2019t falling apart. He hadn\u2019t thought she was the type to become hysterical, and he was right. On the surface she was calm and in control.</p><p>Kate was screaming inside. She was thinking about the mess her life was in on every possible level, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need this now.\u201d</p><p>Dylan smiled. \u201cWhen exactly is it a good time to get blown up?\u201d</p><p>She realized how crazy her comment was. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean . . . oh, never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re early into the investigation,\u201d Nate said. \u201cAnd the leads could take us in a hundred different directions, but for your safety, we have to assume that you\u2019re the target and take the necessary precautions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d</p><p>Nate looked at Dylan. \u201cHow long are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor as long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need a weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll clear it with Bob Drummond, the chief of police here in Silver Springs. He\u2019ll check you out, of course, and he\u2019ll want to talk to you. I\u2019ll warn you, he\u2019s tough, and because he\u2019s getting ready to retire, he doesn\u2019t care who he offends. He\u2019ll give us a hard time, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Kate said. She felt like the world had just gone into warp speed. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201d</p><p>Nate turned back to her. \u201cCan you think of anyone who has a vendetta against you? Is there anyone who would profit if you were out of the picture, like a partner in your company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a partner. I do have life insurance, but my sisters are the beneficiaries. The face value is quite small. The only person I can think of who would like to get rid of me is Reece Crowell.\u201d</p><p>Nate nodded. \u201cDylan told me about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has to be a mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been away for almost a year, and I just got home. I haven\u2019t been here long enough to make enemies.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s back was beginning to throb. She had been sitting on the edge of the easy chair, too nervous to relax. Dylan didn\u2019t seem to be having any trouble, though. He looked very comfortable with his arm draped over the back of the sofa and his ankle crossed over his knee.</p><p>\u201cWho owned the warehouse?\u201d Dylan asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told it\u2019s a corporation,\u201d Nate answered. \u201cI don\u2019t have names yet.\u201d He asked Kate, \u201cHow did you find out about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Realtor called me. She showed me several spaces, but that warehouse was perfect for my needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the Realtor know you were looking for a bigger space?\u201d Dylan asked.</p><p>\u201cCarl Bertolli suggested she call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>\u201cHe asked you to get to the reception early,\u201d Nate said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, wait. Actually my aunt Nora took a phone message, and I just assumed it was from Carl, but now that I think about it, that can\u2019t be right because when I arrived and was walking toward the tent, Carl called me on my cell phone and asked if I would please hurry and help set up. He seemed surprised that I was already there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be checking to make sure she was there,\u201d Nate told Dylan.</p><p>\u201cDid you interview him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure did,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd let me tell you, that was no easy job. He\u2019s quite emotional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know anything, didn\u2019t see anything, and he says he was on his way to pick up the guest of honor. I checked that out with the limo driver, and he verifies the time. I\u2019ll be talking to Carl again after the feds and the ATF get finished with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to find him first,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cFind him?\u201d Nate repeated.</p><p>\u201cIsabel told me that Carl called earlier today and told her he was going away. He does that,\u201d she quickly added so they wouldn\u2019t jump to any crazy conclusions. \u201cWhen life becomes too stressful, he goes into seclusion. When he comes back, he\u2019s refreshed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to wait until he\u2019s refreshed, whatever in God\u2019s name that means. I\u2019ll find him,\u201d Nate said.</p><p>\u201cHow often does life become too stressful for Carl?\u201d Dylan wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThree or four times a year,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might want to talk to his fianc\u00e9e,\u201d she suggested then. \u201cCarl doesn\u2019t go anywhere without telling her. She has a business to run, so she can\u2019t take off as often as Carl can.\u201d</p><p>She gave Nate the name and phone number and added, \u201cShe\u2019s a lovely woman but a bit . . . high-strung, I guess you could say, so please try not to scare her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s high-strung, and she\u2019s engaged to Bertolli?\u201d Nate shook his head. \u201cNow that\u2019s a pair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re wasting your time with Carl,\u201d she said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have seen anything, and if you knew him as well as I do, you\u2019d realize what a kind, sensitive, decent man he is. He\u2019s done so much for this community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about the man who called you to come to the warehouse. Had you ever heard his voice before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you recognize it if you heard it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was so much noise in the background I could barely hear him. I don\u2019t think I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>Isabel interrupted by calling Kate\u2019s name from the stairs.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Kate said. \u201cDetective, would you like something to drink? A soft drink, iced tea, water . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIced tea would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for interrupting.\u201d Isabel was standing in the foyer smiling at the men. Kate noticed she\u2019d put on lip gloss and had taken the time to brush her hair.</p><p>Kate excused herself and went to her sister.</p><p>\u201cDid you want something?\u201d Kate asked when Isabel continued to stand there staring. Had Kate been that transparent around a good-looking man when she was seventeen?</p><p>Isabel took a step toward the living room. \u201cDetective Hallinger? Everything\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t it? Kate said that Dylan told her you\u2019re here to tie up some loose ends. There isn\u2019t anything more, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you everything was all right,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cKate\u2019s helping the detective with his investigation,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cNothing for you to worry about, Isabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Nate confirmed.</p><p>\u201cNow will you stop worrying,\u201d Kate ordered.</p><p>\u201cWho could blame me for worrying? You\u2019re so accident-prone . . .\u201d</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t give her time to get worked up. \u201cDetective Hallinger would like a glass of iced tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would? I\u2019ll get it for him.\u201d</p><p>Kate followed her into the kitchen.</p><p>Dylan was making suggestions when she joined them again. She started for the sofa where Dylan was sitting and, deciding it would be better to keep her distance, changed her mind and headed back to the chair.</p><p>\u201cYou do understand why I\u2019d rather Kiera and Isabel didn\u2019t know about this, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving Silver Springs tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan filled me in, and I agree,\u201d Nate said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep this quiet for now.\u201d</p><p>Isabel carried the iced tea in, handed it to Nate, and then told him it was a pleasure meeting him, and said good night. She shocked Kate when she kissed Dylan on the cheek. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll stay in Silver Springs awhile,\u201d she said.</p><p>Nate called as she was leaving the room, \u201cThanks for the tea, Isabel. That was very thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>She turned and beamed with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay upstairs all evening,\u201d he told her, thinking she was doing so to give them more privacy.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have a few phone calls to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me translate that for you.\u201d Kate laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be on the phone for hours.\u201d</p><p>Nate waited until Isabel was out of earshot, and said, \u201cShe\u2019s a sweetheart. She reminds me of my first truelove, Mary Beth Durstweiller.\u201d He shook his head and grinned. \u201cShe broke my heart.\u201d He became serious again and returned to the business at hand. \u201cOkay, Kate. You said you hadn\u2019t been home all that long.\u201d He was flipping his notepad to find a clean page.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to retrace your footsteps and tell me where you went, who you talked to . . .\u201d</p><p>Kate thought it was going to be easy and quick to recount her activities from the time she\u2019d returned to Silver Springs. Why, it wouldn\u2019t take more than ten, maybe fifteen, minutes.</p><p>Her estimation was off by an hour. Nate kept making her go back and start over. She knew he was hoping she\u2019d remember something that would lead to some answers.</p><p>No such luck. The only lead was still the same. Reece Crowell.</p><p>Nate then wanted to talk about her company. She hated doing it, but she had to tell him about the financial mess she\u2019d found. He was extremely interested in the terms of the loan.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem too upset,\u201d Dylan remarked.</p><p>\u201cI was very upset at first . . . I had no idea my mother . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say anything that would give Dylan a negative opinion of her mother.</p><p>\u201c. . . was struggling so. It was very insensitive of me not to notice how difficult it was for her. I also believe that when she took out the loan and used her assets as collateral, she didn\u2019t realize that my company was one of those assets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you planning to do about it?\u201d Dylan asked.</p> <p>Now that she\u2019d had some time to think about it, she had come up with several options. She didn\u2019t discuss them but simply said, \u201cI\u2019ll make some changes and work it out. I\u2019ve got about three weeks, and that\u2019s plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>Nate asked her a couple more questions and then thanked her for her help.</p><p>Dylan walked outside with him and stood in the drive talking for another ten minutes. Then he went to his rental car and got his bag out of the trunk. Kate held the door open as he carried it in.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I sleeping?\u201d he asked. He locked the door behind him and headed to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAlone,\u201d she answered.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his garment bag, grabbed her hand, and pulled her into the living room. He let go of her but was still able to back her into a corner by simply moving closer and closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you? And don\u2019t even try to pretend you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>The man could be intimidating when he wanted to be. He got that look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . difficult . . . after Boston,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Because you\u2019re making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, start making sense. How am I making you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t be. In Boston . . . the night you showed up to keep me company and I came on to you and pretty much pounced on you . . .\u201d</p><p>One eyebrow shot up. \u201cYou pounced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLower your voice, please,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPounced, seduced,\u201d she said. \u201cCall it what you want.\u201d She tried to get around him to put some space between them, but he trapped her with his hands on either side of her. The message wasn\u2019t subtle. She wasn\u2019t going anywhere until she explained.</p><p>\u201cYou seduced me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d she said. \u201cI deliberately went after you. I shouldn\u2019t have, but I did.\u201d She brushed her hair away from her face and looked into his eyes. He was so close she could feel his heat. She had the sudden, insane urge to kiss him again. Get over it, she told herself.</p><p>\u201cTry to understand,\u201d she said. \u201cI had just gotten some awful news, and I felt like my world was crashing in on me. Then there was Jordan\u2019s surgery . . . and I was so scared for her . . . and after . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went a little nuts. You were there, and I . . . you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seduced me?\u201d He was trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d She couldn\u2019t understand why he was having so much trouble comprehending what she was telling him. Had he already forgotten that night?</p><p>\u201cI made the first move. I jumped your bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you had a lot to deal with, and you went crazy?\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she just said as much? \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t smiling now. \u201cGuess I was damned lucky I\u2019m the one who showed up at your door with the pizza. Tell me something. If Nick had knocked on your door, would you have jumped his bones?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, of course not. He\u2019s married. You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t leave her guessing. He didn\u2019t like what she was telling him. Tough, she thought. At least she was being honest.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened was a mistake,\u201d she continued, ignoring his frown. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJumped my bones?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was pretty great. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need a testimonial?\u201d She was actually trying to lighten the mood with her question because he was frowning so intently, and she was surprised when he nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was wonderful, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan, try to understand. I shouldn\u2019t have come on to you the way I did. You\u2019re my best friend\u2019s brother. I\u2019m going to be going back and forth to Boston quite a lot, and I don\u2019t want it to be awkward when I see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what was your game plan?\u201d</p><p>She pushed against his chest, hoping to get him to move back, but he wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cAnswer me,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI had hoped that I could come home and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend it never happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and looked relieved that he finally understood.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do this a lot, do you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHit on men and take them to my bed? No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not very with it, am I? And you on the other hand probably can\u2019t remember the number of women you\u2019ve slept with. That\u2019s why I thought you\u2019d be . . . safe. You know\u2014no promises, no regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to get this straight. It\u2019s a little surprising, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought that spending the night together and having passionate sex wouldn\u2019t mean anything to me?\u201d She opened her mouth to protest, but he shook his head. \u201cAs I was saying, you chose me, used me, and now you want me to move on without . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny guilt or worries.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, smiled, and then laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so happy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPickle, you\u2019re a dream come true.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>The letter arrived by special messenger at ten o\u2019clock that evening. Everyone heard the doorbell ring, though they were each in different areas of the house.</p><p>Isabel was upstairs packing; Kiera was in the kitchen folding laundry, and Kate had spread the papers from the CPA firm on the coffee table to search for a copy of the loan agreement. Dylan had decided to do a home security check and was moving from room to room inspecting the doors and windows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d Isabel shouted from the upstairs landing.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Dylan replied in a no-nonsense tone of voice as he came from the back of the house. He went outside and pulled the door closed behind him. Isabel watched from the side window.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s at the door?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cSome man with an envelope. Dylan just made him show him his driver\u2019s license. That\u2019s kind of odd, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d Kate offered as an excuse.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s scared of Dylan. If you could see his face . . .\u201d She jumped back so Dylan wouldn\u2019t know she\u2019d been watching when he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cOne of you needs to sign for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would send something this late at night?\u201d Isabel asked as Kate signed the form.</p><p>The envelope was marked URGENT. That can\u2019t be good, Kate thought. She looked at the return address and wanted to groan. The envelope had come from a law firm, and that definitely couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cSmith and Wesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gun company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe law firm.\u201d</p><p>Concerned that the letter was delivering more financial bad news, Isabel snatched the envelope out of Kate\u2019s hand so that Dylan wouldn\u2019t see it. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we let Kiera open this,\u201d she said as she quickly headed to the kitchen.</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t follow her. If it was another unpleasant surprise, she didn\u2019t want to be the one to break it to the others this time. She returned to her work in the living room. So far, she hadn\u2019t found the loan agreement, nor had she found a ledger summarizing the account since Tucker Simmons, the CPA, had taken it over. She was just about to go through the stacks once again when Kiera interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cKate, you\u2019ve got to read this.\u201d She held up the letter. Her face was flushed.</p><p>Isabel followed close behind. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the loan, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. This is from an attorney in Savannah representing Compton Thomas MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>Isabel was trying to read the letter, but Kiera kept waving it around.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Compton Thomas MacKenna?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe he was our father\u2019s father or maybe an uncle. He could even be a cousin.\u201d</p><p>Kiera stepped over a file box and sat down next to Kate. Isabel dropped down on her other side.</p><p>\u201cEither read it to me or let me read it,\u201d Isabel said. \u201cThe suspense is killing me.\u201d</p><p>Kiera handed her the letter. She read it out loud and then said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this exciting? I wonder what this Compton Thomas MacKenna wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears he wants us to come to Savannah. It says he requests our presence,\u201d Kiera answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not going? Shouldn\u2019t we at least think about it?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>An argument ensued, and Dylan walked right into the middle of it. \u201cKate, the back door\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I\u2019m not going,\u201d Kate said. \u201cYou two can do whatever you want, but I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with those people. Our father\u2019s family disowned him when he married Mother, and I have no interest in meeting any of them now.\u201d</p><p>Isabel was becoming more and more frustrated. \u201cBut one of us has to go, and it should be you, Kate. Maybe this man wants to beg our forgiveness. He said the matter was of the utmost importance. It must be, because he wants us there tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to drop everything and drive to Savannah with absolutely no notice? I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing where?\u201d Dylan asked.</p><p>No one answered him. The sisters were all talking at the same time. It was loud and chaotic, and very much like the home he grew up in, which was probably why he felt so comfortable. He leaned against the door frame, folded his arms, and simply waited for them to finish. Then he was going to give them hell for not locking their doors. Not only was the back door unlocked, but also the side door and the outside door leading to the garage. Damn, he thought, they ought to just put a sign out on the lawn, VICTIMS INSIDE.</p><p>Oh, yes, they were all going to catch hell no matter how long he had to stand there and wait.</p><p>Kiera yawned loudly. \u201cI can\u2019t go,\u201d she said. \u201cIsabel and I can\u2019t take the time. We should have left here yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we stayed because of you. You just had to go and get yourself blown up again,\u201d Isabel said.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I did not . . .\u201d</p><p>Isabel looked at Kiera. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you drop me off at the dorm and backtrack to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped when Kiera shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t have the time. I have to get back. As it is, when we get to Winthrop, I\u2019ll have only enough time to help you find your room and unload the car. Once I get back to my apartment, I\u2019ll be working twenty-four-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see, Kate? You\u2019re the only one of us who can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d she repeated for what she thought had to be the tenth time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stubborn,\u201d Isabel muttered. She nudged Kiera\u2019s foot as she walked past and said, \u201cMake her go.\u201d</p><p>Kiera laughed. \u201cHow do you suppose I could do that?\u201d</p><p>Isabel noticed Dylan in the doorway and turned to him. \u201cHow about you? I\u2019ll bet you could make her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he could not,\u201d Kate said emphatically.</p><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d Dylan asked once again.</p><p>Isabel realized that Dylan didn\u2019t know what they were talking about and hastened to tell him what the letter said and to catch him up on their family history. \u201cWe\u2019ve never met any of our father\u2019s side of the family,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is a wonderful opportunity to find out about them, which is why Kate has to go. We don\u2019t even know how many uncles and aunts and cousins there are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to have anything to do with any of them? Not one relative even came to Dad\u2019s or Mom\u2019s funeral,\u201d Kate argued.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Isabel, but I\u2019m in Kate\u2019s corner. If she doesn\u2019t want to go, then she shouldn\u2019t go,\u201d Kiera said. \u201cExcept\u2014\u201d</p><p>Isabel interrupted. \u201cThis man . . . this Compton MacKenna . . . maybe he wants to give us something that belonged to our father. If you don\u2019t go, we may never know what he wants to talk to us about.\u201d</p><p>Kate ignored Isabel. \u201cExcept what?\u201d she asked Kiera.</p><p>\u201cNone of them wanted anything to do with us . . . until now. Wouldn\u2019t you like to know why? Besides . . . this would be a great opportunity to get some medical history. Certain diseases run in families,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me that way. There could be heart disease and all sorts of genetic problems we\u2019re unaware of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I take one of those forms they make you fill out when you\u2019re a new patient in a doctor\u2019s office? Or maybe you could make up a list of questions for me to ask them. I could even check their teeth and report back if you want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Kate. We don\u2019t have any medical knowledge about our father\u2019s side of the family. It would be good to know something, but if you don\u2019t want to go, then don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><p>Isabel was so frustrated with her sisters she threw her hands up and started to walk out of the room. Dylan stopped her.</p><p>\u201cGo sit,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to talk to you.\u201d He added, \u201cEspecially you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease think about it, Kate. This could fill in so many holes and answer so many questions about our family,\u201d Kiera reasoned.</p><p>Kate let out an acquiescent sigh. \u201cOh, all right, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s settled then,\u201d Kiera said. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot just yet,\u201d Dylan interjected. No one was going anywhere until he\u2019d had his say about their total disregard for safety. After looking over their house, he had been tempted to submit it for the \u201cwhat not to do\u201d section of a home-security manual.</p><p>\u201cDid you want something?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact I do. I want to give all three of you hell.\u201d</p><p>And then he proceeded to do just that.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Dylan called Nate to fill him in on Kate\u2019s plans to drive to Savannah.</p><p>\u201cI like the idea of getting her out of Silver Springs,\u201d Dylan told him, \u201ceven if it is just for a day or two, especially since it was a spur-of-the-moment decision and very few people know about it, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe letter coming out of the blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cKate and her sisters have never heard of this relative, so I\u2019ve got to wonder, why now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll check him out and let you know what I find. Make sure you keep me apprised of what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll call Chief Drummond to tell him you\u2019ll be by his office first thing in the morning. It\u2019s his jurisdiction, and as for the legal ramifications, you won\u2019t only be on loan from Boston PD, you\u2019ll be under his command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be an interesting change. What about the FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let the agent running the show know where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know who\u2019s in charge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve narrowed it down to three candidates, but it looks like this guy Kline from the Georgia field office is taking over.\u201d</p><p>It was apparent Nate had an attitude toward the FBI. Dylan couldn\u2019t blame him. No detective liked being squeezed out of his own investigation.</p> <p>Kate sat on the front hall stairs and waited for Dylan to finish his phone call. She was so exhausted she could barely keep her eyes open.</p><p>He checked the door locks once again and picked up his garment bag. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She finished yawning before she answered. \u201cWaiting to show you where the guest room is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look wiped out. Didn\u2019t you get much sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the hospital last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Kate, that\u2019s right. You should be in bed.\u201d</p><p>She led him up the stairs to the guest room. It was the first door on the right and directly across from her room. She opened the door and stepped back so he could go inside. \u201cYou\u2019ll have your own bathroom. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find it. Night.\u201d</p> <p>He shut the door in her face.</p><p>She stood there for several seconds staring at the door trying to figure out what had just happened. He hadn\u2019t been rude or angry. In fact, he\u2019d been smiling.</p><p>She suddenly felt very foolish. She\u2019d been expecting him to try to kiss her good night, but that apparently was the last thing on his mind.</p><p>She went into her room and closed the door. All right then. Her \u201cthat was then, this is now\u201d explanation had obviously gotten through to him. And that\u2019s exactly what she wanted, wasn\u2019t it? So how come she was feeling so disgruntled? And come to think of it, how come he hadn\u2019t argued at all when she\u2019d told him it was fine and dandy to move on? Not a single word of protest had he uttered.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about his behavior while she brushed her teeth and got ready for bed. Women were like fish in the sea, and Dylan was such a playboy he would always have a new catch.</p><p>Kate tried to muster up some disgust over his sexual conquests but couldn\u2019t quite manage it. So she tried anger. Dylan was an arrogant jerk. How dare he show up on her doorstep without warning. Who did he think he was? Walking in and taking over like that.</p><p>She had to admit, however, she did feel safer with him in the house\u2014and the way he talked to Isabel about safety had made an impact. After he had come down hard on all of them because of their lackadaisical attitude about security, his focus had turned to Kate\u2019s younger sister. When he was finished with her, Isabel knew everything there was to know about dead bolts, and then some. She wouldn\u2019t be walking anywhere on campus without looking over her shoulder or being aware of her surroundings. He had been very candid with her, and yet he hadn\u2019t scared her. Kate had watched as Isabel sat transfixed by Dylan\u2019s calm instructions.</p><p>He\u2019d actually been very sweet. He had no business being sweet. How was she ever going to keep this relationship platonic and forget about him when he went back to Boston if he continued to do caring things for her and her sisters?</p><p>Why oh why did she go to bed with him? That had been a huge mistake, and then what had she done to top that? She\u2019d given him the \u201cIt means nothing to me and I\u2019m sure nothing to you, so move along\u201d speech.</p><p>She got into bed and pulled the sheet up. And how had he responded? She was a dream come true. That\u2019s what he\u2019d said all right.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m a frickin\u2019 dream come true.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Kiera\u2019s plan to be on the highway by seven didn\u2019t quite work out. Isabel was on time; she wasn\u2019t. It was almost eight before they were finally ready to leave. Kate stood by the car for a final good-bye and tried to assure them that everything was going to be fine.</p><p>\u201cI hate leaving you with this financial mess,\u201d Kiera said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this. We\u2019ve got a plan, right? So stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let me know what\u2019s going on? Don\u2019t try to shield me, Kate,\u201d Isabel said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Dylan\u2019s here,\u201d Kiera said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had such a hellacious week, and it will be nice for you to have company driving to Savannah.\u201d</p><p>Dylan locked the front door and took a seat on the top step of the porch waiting for the good-byes to end so he and Kate could leave. He\u2019d already packed his rental car and was impatient to get going.</p><p>Kate said something to her sisters, and they all turned to smile at him.</p><p>Dylan looked at his watch, and when he glanced up, he was momentarily struck by the beauty of the three girls facing him.</p><p>Though they looked like sisters, there was something unique about each one. He\u2019d already figured out that Isabel was a charmer and a people pleaser. She was about five-five, and her hair was blond with streaks of honey. Her eyes were as big and as round as Kate\u2019s, but the color wasn\u2019t the same. Kate\u2019s were a vivid blue and were stunning framed by her dark chestnut hair. Isabel\u2019s eyes were more of a blue-green, like the ocean. Kiera was taller than the other two, and in the sunlight he could see the streaks of red in her strawberry blond hair. She had freckles on her nose like Kate, but they were on her cheeks, too. She reminded Dylan of a well-scrubbed girl next door who just happened to have a very nice body. She was the most laid-back of the three, and he thought she was also a peacemaker in the family.</p><p>Kate was neither a charmer nor a peacemaker. She gave as good as she got, and then some, at least with him, anyway. She stood up to him, and he liked that. He must, he thought, because here he was, back for more.</p><p>Kate had a little something extra that drew him to her. On the surface she was one tough cookie. He imagined she was a barracuda when she negotiated a business contract, but there was a vulnerability he could see that pulled at him. She was talented and a smart businesswoman, but he didn\u2019t think she was smart about men. Maybe that was why he had been able to get her into bed so quickly. He knew she regretted their night together, but he sure as certain didn\u2019t. The fact was, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.</p><p>One thought led to another, and it didn\u2019t take long before he was picturing her na*ed in his arms. Not a good idea to be daydreaming about that now, he realized.</p><p>\u201cKate, wind it up. We\u2019ve got to get going.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him and waited until Kiera had backed out of the driveway before she finally turned away.</p><p>She had tears in her eyes, and she knew he\u2019d noticed. He didn\u2019t say anything. He simply walked to the car, opened the passenger door, and waited for her to get in.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m forgetting something. My purse . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the overnight bag you made me pack in case we have to stay in Savannah, which by the way is totally unnecessary since we\u2019ll have plenty of time to get back home . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I left my bag in the foyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the trunk. Get in, Pickle.\u201d</p><p>She gave him what he had begun to call \u201cthe look.\u201d He translated it to mean, \u201cCall me Pickle again and I\u2019ll deck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about . . .\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little nudge. \u201cThe iron\u2019s turned off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t turn it on . . . did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, get in the car.\u201d</p><p>She stopped arguing. Once she was settled and had clipped her seat belt on, she said, \u201cWhy do we have to leave so soon? We have plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t explain until they had pulled away from the house. \u201cWe need to stop at the police station, and I don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s going to take. Chief Drummond\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>She gave him directions. The station was only a mile from her house. The parking lot was in the back of a two-story brick building that looked old and worn. And charming, he thought, if such a word could be used to describe a police station.</p><p>Ivy crept up the back of the building nearly to the roof, and the brick path that led to the front door had chunks broken off.</p><p>\u201cIs there a jail inside?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so, either in the back or upstairs.\u201d</p><p>The front door had recently been painted a shiny black. He noticed the white shutters flanking the windows had been painted, too.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen anything like it . . . for a police station, that is.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a bed-and-breakfast place.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he walked inside, though, he felt as if he were back on familiar ground. The floors were an ugly gray linoleum; the walls were a dingy pea green, and the receptionist was just as old and surly as the one back in Boston. The station even smelled the same\u2014must and sweat and Pine-Sol. He loved it.</p><p>Chief Drummond came out of his office to meet both of them. He was a heavyset man with a permanent scowl on his face and the grip of a weight lifter in his handshake.</p><p>He offered Kate a cup of coffee and asked her to wait in the outer office.</p><p>Kate took a seat on one of the gray metal chairs against the wall and pulled her BlackBerry out of her bag to check messages. Haley had called again, probably about the ribbon on back order, she thought. Nothing she could do about it now, so she decided she\u2019d call her from the car.</p><p>If she had her briefcase with her, she could go through some of her other notes. Had she left that at home, or had Dylan put it in the trunk?</p><p>The chair was hard and uncomfortable. Kate sat back, crossed one leg over the other, and tried to remain patient. What was taking so long? It seemed that Dylan had been in the office for at least fifteen minutes. She noticed the receptionist was repeatedly glancing at her from behind her computer screen.</p><p>Kate looked at her skirt to make sure it hadn\u2019t hiked up, then checked her blouse to make certain all the buttons were buttoned.</p><p>The woman\u2019s head was hidden behind the computer monitor when she said, \u201cI like your candles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>She leaned to the side. \u201cI said, I like your candles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to hear that.\u201d</p><p>The receptionist was blushing. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about buying some of your lotion next, but I\u2019m not sure which scent I want. Got any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see if I have any samples.\u201d Kate dug through her purse and found three. \u201cTry these three,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re all different: Isabel, Kiera, and Leah.\u201d</p><p>The woman was thrilled. She introduced herself and shook Kate\u2019s hand. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re a celebrity around town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d she asked, smiling. \u201cMy candles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, dear. They\u2019re lovely, of course, but you\u2019re famous because you nearly blew yourself up at the old warehouse.\u201d</p><p>She made it sound like Kate had done it on purpose. Kate was about to respond to the woman\u2019s assessment, but the door opened, and Dylan and the chief walked out of the office. She immediately noticed the gun in a holster at Dylan\u2019s side. He had a box in his hand. Probably extra bullets, she thought. Can\u2019t have enough of those, can he?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in good hands with this boy, Miss MacKenna. He\u2019s got an impressive record and his superior in Boston was mighty aggravated he was doing a job for Silver Springs. He finally agreed but made sure I knew it was temporary. They want him back,\u201d he added with a nod.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop looking at the gun. Images of Dylan lying in the hospital bed flashed into her mind. She realized his job required that he carry a gun, and as Drummond had just confirmed, Dylan was very good at that job, but still, just seeing the weapon made her feel queasy. She smiled at the chief and said, \u201cYes, I am in good hands with this boy.\u201d</p><p>Drummond walked them to the door and held it open. In parting he called, \u201cTry not to get yourself blown up again, Miss MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>Kate walked ahead of Dylan to the car. \u201cThe way people are acting around here you\u2019d think I was some kind of walking detonator\u2014wherever I go there\u2019s an explosion,\u201d she complained.</p><p>Dylan laughed. \u201cI think you\u2019ve brought a little more excitement to Silver Springs than they\u2019re used to.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the car out of the parking lot but stopped at the corner. \u201cWant to give me directions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most direct route to get to the highway is to take Main Street, which is your next left, but there will be a lot of traffic this time of morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompared to Boston, this is nothing,\u201d he said a few minutes later. \u201cIt\u2019s nice not to have to be so aggressive. The noise level is so much lower here. I like that.\u201d</p><p>Kate adjusted the air conditioner vent so it wouldn\u2019t blow on her face and tried to relax.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think of Chief Drummond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCranky,\u201d he said. \u201cThe man is definitely cranky. I don\u2019t think he knows how to smile. The way he was frowning at me when he took me into his office made me think he was going to give me trouble, and even after he started complimenting me on my record, the guy was still frowning. It took me a while to catch on.\u201d He shook his head and added, \u201cHe kind of reminds me of my father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJudge Buchanan isn\u2019t cranky.

We call him \u2018sir.\u2019 He was tough with us when we were growing up, but I guess he had to be. Keeping six boys out of trouble couldn\u2019t have been easy.\u201d</p> <p>Kate was remembering what Judge Buchanan was like in the hospital when he was waiting with his family for Dylan to come out of surgery. The time had dragged on and on, and the anguish in his eyes was heartbreaking to see. He might have been hard-nosed with his sons, but he also loved them fiercely.</p><p>\u201cI hate hospitals.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d whispered the thought out loud until Dylan said, \u201cI imagine you do.\u201d Responding to the sadness he heard in her voice, he put his hand on top of hers and said, \u201cWhat made you think about hospitals?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \u201cI just did,\u201d she said without an explanation.</p><p>The highway traffic was light. Dylan set the cruise control and sat back.</p> <p>\u201cI talked to Nate early this morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let him know last night that you were going to Savannah,\u201d he explained, \u201cand I asked him to check out a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, he had already told us that a corporation owns the warehouse that blew, but he was having trouble finding out who the shareholders were. He finally was able to dig through the layers, and guess who has controlling interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarl Bertolli.\u201d</p><p>She certainly hadn\u2019t expected to hear his name and immediately thought there had to be a mistake. \u201cCarl? Are you sure? He said Carl? That can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Nate made it up?\u201d he asked, smiling.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, but . . . Carl? He never said anything to me . . . why wouldn\u2019t he tell me he owned the warehouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously because he didn\u2019t want you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Jennifer know?\u201d she asked. \u201cSurely she did. She\u2019s a Realtor, for heaven\u2019s sake. She\u2019d have to know who the owners were. Did anyone talk to her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and her family are camping, but she\u2019s scheduled to be back at work tomorrow morning. Nate could have tracked her down, but he\u2019d already gotten the names of the shareholders, so he\u2019s waiting until tomorrow to question her. Nate\u2019s guessing Carl instructed her not to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Kate couldn\u2019t wrap her mind around any of it. It just didn\u2019t make any sense.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would Carl have to gain by blowing up his property? Even if he had the place heavily insured.\u201d Her mind was racing. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need the money. And tell me, please, what would he gain by killing me? No, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bet the FBI is digging into Carl\u2019s financials right now. If there\u2019s a motive, they\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI won\u2019t find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be surprised. Everyone has secrets, and Carl could have a couple of big ones.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t accept it. \u201cI\u2019ve got to think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you something else to think about. Compton Thomas MacKenna was, in fact, your great uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. He died last night, exactly two hours before the letter went out. According to his attorney, Anderson Smith, Compton left specific instructions about the notification of his relatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to the attorney\u2019s office to meet Compton as the letter implied. You and your sisters have been summoned for the reading of his last will and testament.\u201d</p><p>She was shocked by the disappointment she felt. \u201cThen I guess I can\u2019t ask him any questions, can I? You might as well turn around. I\u2019m not interested in anything the man left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sisters might be interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to give them the attorney\u2019s phone number, and they can talk to him. The next exit is coming up. We can turn around there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, you and your sisters weren\u2019t the only ones to receive letters. Your cousins will also be there. Now are you interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust cousins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that. The attorney only mentioned cousins to Nate. Smith also told him that the cousins don\u2019t know you\u2019re coming. Fact is, he was certain they don\u2019t even know you and your sisters exist.\u201d</p><p>She was even more disheartened. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not interested, then. Slow down. You\u2019ll miss the exit.\u201d</p><p>The exit ramp was a blur as they sped by.</p><p>\u201cDylan, I told you I\u2019m not interested. There isn\u2019t any reason for me to go to the reading now. If these cousins haven\u2019t been told anything about Kiera and Isabel and me, they certainly won\u2019t be able to answer any of my questions, now will they? They were obviously kept in the dark by their parents.\u201d</p><p>She thought about it another moment and said, \u201cI know Kiera would like medical history, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe attorney has photos of your father and other mementos that belonged to him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOkay, now I\u2019m interested.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Roger Mackenna came armed with a .45 to the reading of the will.</p><p>He arrived at the prestigious law firm of Smith and Wesson twenty minutes before the scheduled appointment, but because it was the lunch hour and the area was filled with trendy, upscale bistros, he had to park three blocks from the square. He got out of the car, leaned against the door, and took one last drag of his cigarette. He\u2019d smoked it down to the filter and could feel it burning his lips as he sucked the nicotine in. He tossed it away and immediately reached for another.</p><p>His head felt as though it were going to explode. He was in no condition to walk anywhere today, but he wasn\u2019t about to miss this appointment even if he had to crawl to get there.</p><p>He had no one but himself to blame for his misery. Upon hearing the glorious news that his uncle had finally died, he\u2019d cried out with joy and then proceeded to get roaring drunk. His private celebration lasted well into the middle of the night.</p><p>Walking in the heat and humidity was making him nauseated. He finally reached the square and would have cut across the park, but it was crowded with office workers taking in the sun while they ate their packed lunches.</p><p>By the time he stopped in front of the attorney\u2019s office building he was exhausted, out of breath, and coated with a clammy sweat. He was anxious to get inside. Pulling the door open, he rushed in. He felt a blast of cold air brush his face a scant second before the alarm sounded. The noise was surprisingly dignified. It wasn\u2019t a loud, piercing siren, but a quiet and steady pulsating beep like a heart monitor.</p><p>Two armed guards rushed toward him from opposite corridors. Like a jackal, he snarled at them and tried to bluff his way past. The ploy didn\u2019t work, and he was given the choice of either leaving the premises or handing over his weapon.</p><p>He pulled the gun out of his vest pocket and gave it to the guard standing directly in front of him.</p><p>The man glanced down at the weapon, and said, \u201cIs this loaded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s loaded,\u201d Roger snapped. \u201cWhy would I carry an empty gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you realize you failed to put the safety on?\u201d he asked as he lifted the gun to show Roger and then flipped the lever. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want this to go off accidentally, now would you?\u201d</p><p>Roger didn\u2019t answer. The guard on his left drew his attention when he said, \u201cSir, do you have a permit to carry a concealed weapon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly do,\u201d he answered indignantly. It was a lie. He\u2019d gotten the gun from his brother Ewan for protection. Ewan kept an arsenal of weapons and didn\u2019t mind making a temporary loan. \u201cI\u2019ll want that gun back when I leave.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t ask his permission when they patted him down to make sure the gun was the only weapon he was carrying. Roger was outraged. He was a multimillionaire now and should not be treated this way.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d</p><p>He assumed they didn\u2019t when neither one of them answered. They stepped out of the way and let him go forward.</p><p>He was fuming as he stormed across the tile floor toward the receptionist. He practically shouted his full name so the guards would be sure to hear.</p><p>The receptionist asked him to wait while she called upstairs to announce him.</p><p>\u201cMr. Smith\u2019s assistant, Terrance, will be right down to escort you to his offices,\u201d she said.</p><p>Roger didn\u2019t have to wait long. He looked up to the top of the winding staircase just as a young man appeared on the landing. He was elegantly dressed in a spotless dark suit, crisp white shirt, and tie. He neither introduced himself nor shook Roger\u2019s hand. He simply said, \u201cMr. MacKenna, if you\u2019ll follow me please.\u201d</p><p>He followed the assistant up the stairs and down a corridor and was shown into the attorney\u2019s spacious outer office. The carpet was thick, the furniture was plush, and the paintings on the walls appeared to be originals.</p><p>The place reeked of money, and Roger was impressed. Though he\u2019d never met his uncle\u2019s attorney, he used his first name when he asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Anderson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Smith will be here momentarily. May I offer you something to drink while you wait?\u201d</p><p>Roger ordered bourbon straight up, and as the assistant was leaving to fetch it, he called out, \u201cAnd bring the bottle. My brothers and I will want to . . .\u201d He caught himself before he said \u201ccelebrate\u201d and substituted \u201ctoast our uncle.\u201d</p><p>Bryce was shown into the office a few minutes later. He spotted the tray on the coffee table and immediately helped himself to a drink. There was an ice bucket, but he didn\u2019t bother. He took a long gulp, expelled a sigh, and finally acknowledged his brother\u2019s presence.</p><p>They had not seen each other in over six months, and Roger was shocked at the change. The flesh seemed to hang from Bryce\u2019s body. A mannequin had more fat than his brother. His eyes had a yellow tinge to them, and his skin was pasty. Cirrhosis, Roger thought. Up close and personal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bryce agreed. \u201cWhen was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle MacKenna\u2019s birthday bash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, Bryce?\u201d</p><p>His brother immediately went on the defensive. \u201cI\u2019m feeling fine. Why would you ask me that? Don\u2019t I look fine?\u201d</p><p>Was he daring him to tell the truth? \u201cI heard . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What did you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa mentioned you weren\u2019t feeling up to par.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s talking about.\u201d</p><p>Roger shrugged. If Bryce didn\u2019t want to admit his liver was going south, he wouldn\u2019t argue with him. \u201cHas she moved out yet? Last time we talked you told me she was threatening to leave you.\u201d</p><p>Bryce poured another drink before answering. \u201cSeparate bedrooms, separate lives,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t you worry about Vanessa. She hasn\u2019t been deprived. Somebody\u2019s been seeing to her needs for several months now. Oh, she doesn\u2019t think I know about him, but I can hear her on the phone late at night planning where they\u2019ll meet next. Can\u2019t say I blame her.\u201d He added, \u201cIt seems to work for us. The fact is, we\u2019re both too lazy to change anything, and if she left, she couldn\u2019t nag me to stop drinking, could she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s still trying to get you to stop, she must still care about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves me in her own sick, twisted way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about you, Roger? How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got big plans,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestments,\u201d he added with a nod and hoped that Bryce wouldn\u2019t want to know the details. He was making it up as he went along. \u201cI\u2019m going to make some changes in my life.\u201d</p><p>His brother didn\u2019t seem interested in hearing about his future. \u201cHave you talked to Ewan lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke to him briefly a while back,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t mention that he\u2019d met him in a bar to get a gun from him. Bryce was always so superior, and Roger knew his older brother would look down his nose at him if he heard about the gun, and an argument would be inevitable. Bryce was a drunk, but he was still snooty.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he been up to?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t really care. He was simply filling time until the attorney got the show on the road.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t volunteer any personal news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he still body building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask. I would assume so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d</p><p>The brothers turned in unison as Ewan walked in. Bryce greeted him by raising his glass.</p><p>Roger thought Ewan looked more fit than ever. He sported a deep tan that came from his sun worshipping hours at the club. From the waist down, he was trim, but his chest and upper arms were huge. He was still lifting weights all right.</p><p>The youngest wasn\u2019t dressed appropriately, though. He wore khaki pants that appeared to have been purchased at one of those mall chains and a short-sleeve knit shirt that looked like it had been glued to his chest. Ewan had never wanted to grow up. He obviously had loved his college days so much, he continued to dress like a frat boy.</p><p>Roger wondered if he still played Jell-O shot games with his juvenile buddies but didn\u2019t ask. The least little thing set Ewan off, and Roger wasn\u2019t in the mood to put up with his temper today.</p><p>Ewan managed to be civil for about thirty seconds. \u201cNice to see both of you again.\u201d And before Bryce or Roger had a chance to respond, Ewan wrinkled his nose and said, \u201cWhich one of you stinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be Roger,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>Before Roger could protest, Bryce continued, \u201cIt\u2019s the nicotine oozing through your pores and the smoke all over your clothes. You really ought to give up that filthy habit.\u201d</p><p>And the gloves came off.</p><p>Vanessa walked into the middle of the fray. Dressed in a pale gray silk pantsuit, she was a statuesque woman who was accustomed to turning heads when she entered a room. She wore her raven black hair swept back into a chignon, as only a woman confident in her beauty could. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a lovely family reunion,\u201d she said sarcastically. She quickly separated herself from the brothers, looked at her watch, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re all here. Where\u2019s the attorney?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bryce checked the time and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got ten more minutes until one.\u201d</p><p>She tried to open the door to the inner office. It was locked.</p><p>\u201cApparently he doesn\u2019t want us rifling through his files,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to wait. This is outrageous,\u201d Roger muttered. \u201cThis outfit isn\u2019t going to be handling my share of the money, I promise you that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow much do you think there is?\u201d Bryce asked.</p><p>\u201cMillions,\u201d Roger answered.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer the question. How many millions?\u201d Ewan wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing sixty million,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a high estimate,\u201d Ewan said.</p> <p>\u201cGuessing is rather pointless,\u201d Vanessa interjected.</p><p>Ewan glared at her. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two have never gotten along, have you?\u201d Roger said. He sounded like he\u2019d just figured that out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s soft-pedaling the truth,\u201d Ewan responded. \u201cI detest her. Her holier-than-thou attitude. She\u2019s a snob, and I have no use for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling\u2019s mutual,\u201d she responded.</p><p>\u201cI repeat, why are you here?\u201d Ewan asked again.</p> <p>\u201cBryce and I both received letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t ride with your husband?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI had a meeting with the art council. It was cultural, so of course you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Her condescension infuriated him. He turned to Bryce and said, \u201cHow in God\u2019s name do you stand her?\u201d</p><p>Bryce smiled at his wife. \u201cThe question should be, how does she stand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Your self-loathing became tiresome years ago,\u201d Ewan scoffed.</p><p>Vanessa was saved from having to listen to any more of Ewan\u2019s sarcastic drivel when the door swung open and Anderson Smith, trailed by his assistant, swept into the room.</p><p>The attorney\u2019s manner was as smooth as alabaster. Without saying a word, he demanded attention, and he got it. He introduced himself and Terrance and shook hands with each one, starting with Vanessa.</p> <p>He was an older gentleman and quite charismatic. She watched him work his magic on the brothers and was both fascinated and amused, for they were suddenly all on their best behavior.</p><p>Terrance unlocked the door, and one by one they filed into the inner sanctum.</p><p>Roger spotted the video equipment and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s all this for? Are we going to see a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a movie,\u201d Anderson responded. \u201cPlease make yourselves comfortable. We\u2019ll begin in just a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we start now?\u201d Ewan asked.</p><p>Anderson walked to the office door and was pulling it closed when he answered, \u201cNot everyone is here yet.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>Dylan made certain they weren\u2019t being followed, and when they were closing in on Savannah, he left the highway and took less-traveled roads into the city.</p><p>He got lost in no time at all, but because he was a Buchanan male, he wasn\u2019t about to admit it or ask for directions. Kate was filling him in on some historical facts about Charleston\u2019s sister city and wasn\u2019t paying attention to the route he was taking.</p><p>\u201cSavannah\u2019s called the jewel of the south,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you probably already knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I am. You\u2019re a jewel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Savannah\u2019s the jewel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut so are you, Pickle.\u201d</p><p>She gave up trying to educate him, picked up her BlackBerry, and checked for any new messages.</p><p>Dylan still hadn\u2019t gotten his bearings. He was certain he\u2019d passed the very same park a couple of times now. He kept driving west. Several blocks later he stopped to let some jaywalkers cross in front of him and happened to look at the number on the door across the street.</p><p>Son of a gun, they were exactly where they were supposed to be.</p><p>The attorney\u2019s office was on the perimeter of a large square that surrounded a shaded park. In the center was a monument to one of the South\u2019s revered statesmen, who stood perched on a tall pedestal looking down on the sidewalks and park benches scattered about. Ancient oaks dripping with moss provided shade.</p><p>All of the buildings butted up against one another and were once the grand homes of Savannah\u2019s finest citizens. Some were still residences, but others had been renovated and converted and now fit into the urban mixture of offices and galleries and restaurants.</p><p>Dylan got lucky again when a car pulled out of a prime parking spot near the corner. He backed into the space, put the car in park, and said, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here?\u201d She looked startled.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made good time.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the digital clock on the dashboard. \u201cWe\u2019re twenty minutes early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s closer to fifteen minutes.\u201d He unsnapped his seat belt and tried to open the door.</p><p>She grabbed his arm. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get there early.\u201d She sounded apprehensive now.</p><p>\u201cSure, okay. We won\u2019t be early.\u201d He reached for the door again.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I made a quick call first? I need to talk to Haley about ribbon. It won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. While you\u2019re doing that, I\u2019ll check in with Nate.\u201d</p><p>Kate was suddenly feeling nervous. She couldn\u2019t remember Haley\u2019s phone number and had to look it up on her BlackBerry.</p><p>Haley\u2019s assistant answered and explained that she had left for a luncheon appointment. Kate left the message that she would be unavailable for a few hours but that she would call Haley later that afternoon.</p><p>Dylan got hold of Nate right away. It was a one-sided conversation, and Kate had to wait until he\u2019d flipped his cell phone closed to find out anything.</p><p>\u201cDid he have any news?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d He didn\u2019t expound.</p><p>Dylan got out of the car, grabbed his suit jacket from the backseat, and put it on so his gun would be concealed, then he went around the car and opened her door.</p><p>He was acting like a bodyguard, she thought. He was watching the street when he said, \u201cYou stay close to me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a suggestion but an order.</p><p>\u201cI plan to,\u201d she said. She gathered her things, stuffed them into her purse, and took his hand.</p><p>They crossed the street and walked around the corner. Kate did not want to think about where they were headed. The notion to bolt was gaining momentum. She needed to stall\u2014to give herself a few minutes to gather her thoughts. She glanced at the park across the street and blurted out, \u201cLook at the park. Isn\u2019t it lovely? Did you know that there are over twenty squares in Savannah? All have parks in the center.\u201d She stopped and said, \u201cThis one is my favorite.\u201d</p><p>Dylan seemed more interested in the people and the cars. He was subtle about it, but he was making certain that his body protected hers as they walked along.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said.</p><p>She deliberately slowed the pace. \u201cWe\u2019re building a park like that in Silver Springs.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder, nodded, and said, \u201cI noticed it on our way to the police station.\u201d</p><p>She walked even more slowly. \u201cAnd we have three more in the works. They\u2019re going to be interconnected when they\u2019re finished. The buildings aren\u2019t on this grand scale, of course.\u201d</p><p>Kate saw the door with the names Smith and Wesson engraved on a plaque directly ahead of her, and stopped. \u201cLet\u2019s go sit on the park bench for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Dylan didn\u2019t know what was going on in her mind, but he wasn\u2019t about to stand on the sidewalk and argue with her. She obviously needed a few minutes to calm down, and then maybe she would tell him what was bothering her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we won\u2019t be early. We\u2019ll find someplace to wait.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, she said, \u201cThank you.\u201d She looked around and spotted a coffee shop catty-corner to the law firm. \u201cWould you like to get some coffee? I\u2019m sure they have iced tea, too.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later they were seated at a tiny round table in the back of the coffee shop. There wasn\u2019t any air-conditioning, and both front and back doors were wide open. Two ceiling fans were going full speed. Both made a clicking noise that sounded like fingers snapping.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lunchtime,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were lucky to get a table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot in here. That\u2019s why we got a table. Look around. We\u2019re the only ones here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could find somewhere else if the heat bothers you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Kate waited until the waitress had left with their iced-tea orders to ask, \u201cWhat did Nate have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey still can\u2019t find Carl. The case is building against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in trouble with the IRS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never joke about the IRS. He\u2019s in trouble,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack taxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich. He inherited a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he did, he\u2019s gone through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stunned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never said anything to you about money worries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, no. Carl is every inch the southern gentleman,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd southern gentlemen never ever discuss money problems. It would be . . . unseemly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that part of the southern gentleman code?\u201d</p><p>He was teasing, but she was serious when she answered. \u201cYes, it is. Being a gentleman is serious business here.\u201d</p><p>The waitress had eyes for Dylan only as she placed the iced tea on the table. Kate thanked her anyway, took a sip of the cold drink, and said, \u201cI can\u2019t figure this out. Poor Carl, bless his heart. He\u2019s always trying to help others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does he help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gives lavish parties to promote the arts. And he\u2019s helped promote my company, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked you to bring those gift baskets to his party, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. He thought it would be good promotion. Oh, I see that look in your eyes. Dylan, Carl was trying to help. I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s a good man. He wanted to buy into my company. I\u2019m sure he thought I needed financial assistance, and of course he couldn\u2019t talk about it . . . so he offered to be a partner. If he had such terrible money problems, where would he get the money to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he try to buy into your company? For God\u2019s sake, Kate, why didn\u2019t you tell me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was relevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cOver a year ago.\u201d</p><p>Dylan checked the time, pulled his wallet out, and put money on the table. \u201cDrink up. We have to get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve still got time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat else did Nate tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing a background check on your relatives, and I had hoped he\u2019d have something for me by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no such luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. He got pulled into a meeting, but he has people working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be finding out about them soon enough.\u201d Too soon, she thought. Why, oh, why had she agreed to come to Savannah? Guilt, she decided. Isabel and Kiera had guilted her into coming.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like walking in blind. I want to know what I\u2019m dealing with. You understand?\u201d</p><p>Oh, boy, did she. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dreading it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d And when she didn\u2019t immediately answer, he asked, \u201cWhy are you so worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She guessed there really wasn\u2019t any reason not to tell him. He already knew about her financial situation and her mother\u2019s devastating business and personal decisions. \u201cI hope this meeting isn\u2019t another surprise my mother left behind. I don\u2019t think I could take another . . . disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that\u2019s a possibility? Seems pretty remote to me. You told me your mother never mentioned her husband\u2019s relatives,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThe letter . . . by special messenger . . . it started me thinking. Mother might have borrowed money from this uncle and now the estate wants it paid back.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her a long minute and then asked, \u201cHow long are you going to stay mad at her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad. I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. I guess you\u2019re just not ready to say it, so how about I say it for you? You\u2019re furious with her.\u201d</p><p>Her spine stiffened. The defiance didn\u2019t last long. Tears sprang into her eyes, and she couldn\u2019t stop them. She\u2019d already cried in front of him once; she wasn\u2019t about to do it again.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m angry,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. \u201cShe lied about everything, and she left a mess.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on top of hers. \u201cAh, Katie. It\u2019s not about the money.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand away. \u201cOh? Then what is it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother got sick, and she died, and no matter how hard you tried, you couldn\u2019t stop it from happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he agreed, and stood. \u201cSo maybe you ought to think about forgiving her.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to argue, to tell him his amateur analysis was way off, but something stopped her. What if there was a germ of truth in what he was saying? Was she using anger to shield herself from the pain of losing her mother?</p><p>He pulled her to her feet. \u201cCome on, Pickle. Time to meet the relatives.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>The law firm of Smith and Wesson and Associates resided in an early-nineteenth-century, three-story home that had been transformed into offices but had kept its antebellum elegance.</p><p>The lobby was wide, and the eye was immediately drawn to the colorful mosaic design on the tiled floor. A grand staircase in the center led up to an open balcony that surrounded the lobby and was supported by white Doric columns. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dylan half expected to see a southern belle sweep down the steps in her hoop skirt to greet them, but instead a receptionist in a dark suit with a silk blouse and pearls smiled up at them from her tidy mahogany desk.</p><p>Kate waited by Dylan\u2019s side while he dealt with the security guard. The alarm had been triggered when he\u2019d walked in, but as soon as he showed his badge, the pulsating noise stopped.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to give her name to the receptionist. The young woman already knew who she was.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Miss MacKenna. Mr. Smith will be right down. He\u2019s most anxious to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>Anxious? Was that a good anxious or a bad one? Kate wondered.</p><p>Less than a minute later, the attorney rushed down the stairs. His smile seemed genuine. Still, he was a lawyer, she reminded herself, and from his surroundings, a very successful one at that. Therefore, he had to be quite good at masking his real emotions.</p><p>Extending his hand, he said, \u201cMy name is Anderson Samuel Smith, and I am delighted to meet you, Miss MacKenna. Simply delighted.\u201d</p><p>He was quite polished, for he quickly put her at ease. He shook Dylan\u2019s hand, and the two men exchanged polite greetings.</p><p>Speaking to both of them, he said, \u201cI was your great uncle Compton\u2019s attorney for seven years, and I do believe the firm took great care of him. He was quite an interesting fellow. Perhaps we might have dinner sometime, and I\u2019ll tell you what I know about him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you know his brother?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did, Miss MacKenna. Our firm did not handle his affairs, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Kate.\u201d</p><p>He flashed another brilliant smile. \u201cKate. A good name,\u201d he added with approval. \u201cAnd you must call me Anderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to freshen up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Dylan said.</p> <p>Good idea? What did that mean? She must either look a mess, or Dylan wanted to talk to the attorney alone.</p><p>Anderson showed her the way to the powder room and returned to Dylan in the foyer.</p><p>Kate washed her hands and checked her appearance in the full-length mirror. Okay, she was a bit disheveled, but she didn\u2019t look that bad, did she? She didn\u2019t look that good, either. She could make herself a little more presentable, she decided.</p><p>She brushed her hair, and since there was some curl, she didn\u2019t clip it back again but let it fall around her shoulders. Digging through her purse, she found her blush and lipstick and freshened her makeup. She checked herself again. It was the best she could do without a complete overhaul.</p><p>She wanted to give Dylan another couple of minutes with the attorney. She stopped near the door and gave herself a quick pep talk. Try to be optimistic and stop looking so worried. It was going to be fine. Anderson wouldn\u2019t have been so happy to meet her if she owed the estate a lot of money, right? No, that wasn\u2019t logical. He could have been thrilled because she had shown up, and he knew he had a good shot at getting her to pay the money back\u2014and she would pay it back even if it took the rest of her life to do it.</p><p>Wait, that wasn\u2019t optimistic thinking. Kate wanted to latch on to something that would make her feel better. The photos. Yes, there were photos of her father as a little boy. That was definitely something wonderful to share with her sisters, something that would give them a connection to the man who had loved her mother and had given them life.</p><p>All right. The pep talk was working. She took it a step further. Maybe she would actually like these cousins. She might.</p><p>Straightening her shoulders, she whispered, \u201cHere goes,\u201d and opened the door.</p> <p>Dylan barely spared her a glance as he listened to the attorney who was very seriously explaining something to him. Kate didn\u2019t want to interrupt, and so she waited by the receptionist\u2019s desk until they finished their discussion.</p><p>The smile was back in place the second Anderson spotted her. \u201cShall we go upstairs?\u201d he said as he led the way.</p><p>Kate hung back and whispered to Dylan, \u201cYou\u2019re frowning. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Should he warn her? Or should he let her go in cold without any preconceived ideas about the vipers Anderson had just described to him?</p><p>He decided to give her a little forewarning. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like your cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will,\u201d she said, determined to hang on to the burst of optimism she\u2019d mustered up.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t predict . . .\u201d She suddenly stopped. Oh, who was she kidding? Her bubble of enthusiasm was slowly deflating.</p><p>He saw the disheartened look in her eyes and realized he shouldn\u2019t have said anything. \u201cYou stay tough,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI am tough,\u201d she responded.</p><p>They had just reached the landing when they heard a man shout a gross obscenity. Kate stopped cold and looked at Dylan. He shrugged as if unfazed.</p><p>Anderson looked mortified. \u201cGive me a moment, please,\u201d he said.</p><p>He hurried down the hall, probably intent on getting his guests to shut the hell up, Dylan surmised, but the damage was done. Kate had gone from worried to fearful.</p><p>She grabbed his arm. \u201cDid Anderson tell you why I received a letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why. The reading of the will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but did he say anything more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about the will at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed to know what we\u2019re going to be walking into, and so he filled me in on your cousins. And by the way, he wants to assure you he doesn\u2019t represent any of them.\u201d</p><p>She continued down the corridor. She heard another obscenity and whispered, \u201cGood Lord. What have I gotten into? Maybe it\u2019s not such a good idea to meet any of them just now.\u201d Or ever, she silently added.</p><p>Dylan didn\u2019t want her facing the nest of vipers looking worried. If they sensed vulnerability, they\u2019d strike. The cousins needed to see what a strong woman she was.</p><p>Anderson opened the door and motioned them to come forward.</p><p>\u201cKate.\u201d Dylan touched her arm to stop her.</p><p>She looked up and was shocked by his grin. \u201cYes, Dylan?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his voice so only she would hear and asked, \u201cHow much do you want to bet Anderson Samuel Smith never uses his initials?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get it for a couple of seconds but then put it together. \u201cGood heavens, only a man would think of that.\u201d She was laughing when she walked into the office.</p><p>The air was thick with hostility, but the shouting and the vulgarities stopped when one by one the brothers noticed the couple and fell silent.</p><p>Roger was the first to get past his surprise. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d he muttered. \u201cWho are they, Anderson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares who they are. They don\u2019t belong here,\u201d Ewan said with a sneer. He took a threatening step toward them.</p><p>Did he think he could scare her out of the office? She wasn\u2019t going to put up with that nonsense. She looked him right in the eye and kept walking.</p><p>Anderson put his hands up. \u201cIf you\u2019ll calm down, I\u2019ll make the introductions. Kate, I\u2019d like you to meet Vanessa MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>The striking woman was unlike the others clustered together across the room. She didn\u2019t seem angry, only curious.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Vanessa said politely.</p><p>\u201cVanessa,\u201d Anderson continued, \u201cis married to Bryce MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>The man Anderson gestured to didn\u2019t speak. He acknowledged Kate with a curt nod.</p><p>\u201cStanding next to Bryce is Roger MacKenna, and on his right is Ewan MacKenna. And now I would like all of you to meet your cousin, Kate MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur cousin?\u201d Ewan roared. \u201cShe has to be a fraud. We don\u2019t have any cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwan\u2019s right,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you do,\u201d Vanessa said with a hint of amusement in her voice.</p><p>The brothers ignored her.</p><p>\u201cAnd who is he?\u201d Roger asked. \u201cIs he passing himself off as a cousin, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he? He\u2019s with Kate,\u201d Anderson said and refused to explain further.</p><p>\u201cDo they think they\u2019re going to get a piece of the pie? How absurd,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>Anderson held up his hand again. \u201cYour uncle assured me the video will explain everything to your satisfaction. None of you will be left with any questions. He also requested that each of you get a copy of what you\u2019re about to see. Terrance, please distribute the disks to everyone.\u201d He noticed the sun was shining on the television screen and hurried over to the windows to adjust the blinds. \u201cIs there a disk in the player?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Everything\u2019s ready,\u201d Terrance answered.</p><p>Anderson clasped his hands together and tried to sound enthusiastic. \u201cAll right then, shall we get started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone, please take a seat.\u201d His gaze moved to Roger and Ewan. \u201cAnd try not to comment or interrupt while your uncle is speaking.\u201d</p><p>Roger slumped into his chair. \u201cWe have to listen to that old buzzard lecture us before we get our money?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d addressed the question to Ewan, who promptly answered, \u201cHe\u2019s still trying to control us, even from the grave. What a hard-nosed bastard.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa turned on Ewan. \u201cYour uncle isn\u2019t here to defend himself. Only you would stoop so low as to defile the dead.\u201d</p><p>Ewan wasn\u2019t fazed by her contempt. He turned to Roger and whispered loud enough for everyone to hear, \u201cOnly a bitch could love a bastard.\u201d</p><p>Kate felt as though she was watching a horror movie. How in heaven\u2019s name was she going to tell Kiera and Isabel about these vile, contemptible brothers? She was appalled and nauseated that she was actually related to them. They were horrible human beings.</p><p>Bryce seemed to be in a hurry to get drunk. He was gulping liquor like water, and the more he drank, the nastier he became. The other brothers seemed to appreciate his twisted wit, and their laughter only encouraged him. How would she describe them to Kiera and Isabel? \u201cRepulsive\u201d came to mind. And creepy. Definitely creepy. No one could become this obnoxious without years of practice.</p><p>Her attention turned to Vanessa. She was most curious about her. One could easily assume that the poised, sophisticated woman had wandered into the wrong office by mistake. She seemed so out of place here.</p><p>Anderson stood behind Vanessa\u2019s chair. He nodded to Terrance, who immediately picked up the remote and pushed the play button.</p><p>The bickering stopped as Compton Thomas MacKenna addressed his audience, but the silence didn\u2019t last long.</p><p>\u201cDid he just say he changed his will some time ago? Why weren\u2019t we informed?\u201d Ewan demanded.</p><p>\u201cShut up and listen,\u201d Roger said. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart the damned thing again,\u201d Bryce snapped. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear a word, thanks to my brothers\u2019 yapping.\u201d</p><p>And the fighting started all over again.</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t know how much more of this she could take. \u201cOh, my,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Dylan heard her. He draped his arm protectively across the back of her chair and leaned down to whisper, \u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, she certainly did. But she also wanted those photos, and she wanted to know why she and her sisters had been invited to this freak show.</p><p>\u201cI have to see this,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>Anderson got them to quiet down, and the DVD began to play again. The brothers kept quiet until their uncle gave a history of the family. One of them groaned then.</p><p>Kate was fascinated to hear about her father\u2019s ancestors, and she listened intently. But then he brought up her mother. In a heartbeat Kate\u2019s attitude went from curiosity to outrage. The old man\u2019s words, said so callously, reverberated in her mind. No better than a street beggar. The insults didn\u2019t stop there. His contempt for her mother was apparent in everything he said about her.</p><p>Did the uncle want Kate to see this so he could slander her mother? Was that his purpose for summoning her here?</p><p>She stiffened when he talked about her sisters and was shocked to hear that he had someone checking up on all of them. She couldn\u2019t believe the audacity of the man. The comment that stunned Kate the most, however, was his assessment of her. She heard his remark that she was the most like him. Dear God, how could he think such a thing? And he was smiling when he said it, as though he thought it a wonderful distinction to be his spitting image.</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t think she could be more stunned than she already was. There simply couldn\u2019t be anymore surprises, could there?</p><p>Obviously there could.</p><p>\u201cThe bulk of my estate . . . eighty million dollars . . . will go to Kate MacKenna . . .\u201d</p><p>No, no, that couldn\u2019t be right. She started to stand and fell back. The disk dropped off her lap. She couldn\u2019t hear the rest of the video, and she was oblivious to the bedlam going on around her. She sat there paralyzed . . . and sickened.</p><p>No better than a street beggar. How dare he say such a thing about her mother.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>They turned on her like a pack of rabid animals. She didn\u2019t realize how dangerous the situation had become. Dylan certainly did. He stood and quickly moved in front of her.</p><p>Bryce was blubbering and cursing; Roger was screaming and crying, but Ewan was the real threat now. His face was contorted with rage. He came out of his chair like a crazed bull on steroids, and he was completely controlled by his temper as he charged at Kate.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it? How did you get that demented old man to change his will?\u201d He tried to push Dylan aside, and when Dylan wouldn\u2019t budge, he screamed, \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d</p><p>Dylan responded quietly. \u201cGo sit down.\u201d</p><p>Ewan tried to throw a punch at him, but Dylan knocked his fist away and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this. I\u2019ve got my nice suit on, and I\u2019m in this nice office with my girlfriend. I don\u2019t want to get into a fistfight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you can take me?\u201d</p><p>He was behaving like a sixteen-year-old bully, and Dylan was not amused. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sit down, one way or another.\u201d</p><p>With a roar, Ewan took a wild swing. Dylan dodged the hand, but he was through being nice. When Ewan tried again, Dylan gave a right jab to his midsection. As the man was going down, Dylan shoved him toward the sofa, and Roger got out of the way so Ewan could land on the cushion next to him.</p><p>Dylan smiled. \u201cOkay. Now he\u2019s sitting down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the police, Anderson,\u201d Ewan gasped. \u201cHave this man arrested for assault. Call nine-one-one. I\u2019m pressing charges. Why aren\u2019t you calling? I want the police here now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid I forget to properly introduce Detective Buchanan?

He looked positively overjoyed.</p><p>Vanessa hadn\u2019t said a word until now. \u201cI cannot believe it. Eighty million?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, my dear?\u201d Anderson asked.</p> <p>Ewan turned to her. \u201cMaybe whoever is screwing you now won\u2019t think you\u2019re so hot after this.

I\u2019m thrilled he gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>Bryce was sneering at her. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully smug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be smug? You treated him shamefully. All of you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget her,\u201d Roger shouted. \u201cWhat the hell are we going to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll sue,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cWe\u2019ll contest it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could take years,\u201d Ewan answered.</p><p>Roger was desperate when he said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait. I have to get my hands on that money now.\u201d</p><p>The room erupted in chaos as each brother shouted over the next.</p><p>The noise faded into a dull roar inside Kate\u2019s head as her thoughts spun in circles and the words echoed. Eighty million . . . eighty million . . . eighty million. She could save her company. Isabel\u2019s tuition could be paid. They could keep the house, and all her problems would be solved. This was the answer to her prayers, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>She picked up her purse and stood.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d she said to Anderson. The room suddenly fell quiet.</p><p>\u201cI can understand your shock, Kate,\u201d Anderson replied. He walked over to his desk and placed his hand on a thick binder. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re beginning to see that your great uncle Compton was a meticulous planner. He arranged the transfer of the estate down to the smallest detail.\u201d He patted the binder. \u201cThis is a summation compiled by his accounting firm. You are to take it with you today so that you can familiarize yourself with the cash holdings and other assets. He wanted you to understand and appreciate what he accomplished in his life. Tomorrow at three p.m. you are to return here for a meeting with his financial advisors. At that time they will answer any questions you might have and offer you their services to make the transition as smooth as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t want it. Any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive this some time to sink in,\u201d Anderson cautioned. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make any rash decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard her,\u201d Roger argued. \u201cShe said she doesn\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>Ewan rushed forward. \u201cWhat happens if she won\u2019t take it?\u201d</p><p>Anderson was reluctant to answer. \u201cYour uncle was adamant that the estate go to Kate and he was quite confident that she would accept. He did not name a succeeding heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means if she refuses to take it, then it will go to our uncle\u2019s next of kin, right?\u201d</p> <p>Anderson didn\u2019t respond. He turned to Kate instead. \u201cYou have until tomorrow to think about this. Please take the binder and look it over. We\u2019ll discuss it then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Kate answered calmly. \u201cI will not accept the inheritance. I want nothing from that man.\u201d</p><p>Dylan had been standing beside her in case one of the brothers got too close, but she was the one in charge now. She was not about to let them intimidate her, and that impressed the hell out of him.</p><p>Vanessa started walking toward the door. She stopped when she reached Kate and said, \u201cHe wanted you to have it. I think it would be wise for you to consider this before you give it away.\u201d She smiled then and whispered, \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you moving, Anderson?\u201d Ewan yelled. \u201cDraw up the papers for her to refuse the money.\u201d</p><p>The attorney shook his head. \u201cI cannot do that. It is my responsibility to carry out your uncle\u2019s wishes to the best of my ability.\u201d He picked up the binder and looked at Kate. \u201cI cannot force you to accept the inheritance, but I strongly urge you to at least look at these records so that you can make an informed decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut the records down, Anderson. She doesn\u2019t want them.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s patience had reached its limit. She smiled at Anderson and said, \u201cI appreciate your concern, and I understand that you\u2019re simply doing your duty. But you must understand, I\u2019m not going to change my mind. If there are papers I must sign to decline this, please draw them up.\u201d</p><p>Anderson realized that any further protests now would be wasted. She needed time. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take me a day or two to notify everyone and to put together the documents. I\u2019ll let you know when they\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I have the photos of my father now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he replied and reached into his drawer to retrieve a large manila envelope for her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cCould we go?\u201d she asked Dylan.</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d he answered. He moved aside to let her walk ahead of him and kept his eye on the brothers as he passed them. They were all but bursting at the seams with the joy of their victory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk out with you,\u201d Anderson offered.</p><p>The three passed through the outer office and headed for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch with you soon,\u201d he said as he accompanied them down the hall. \u201cI urge you to think about this tonight. Perhaps you\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult to explain all of this to my sisters. I knew when I came here that I would meet our relatives, but I certainly didn\u2019t expect they would be so . . .\u201d</p><p>Anderson smiled. \u201cI know. They\u2019re hard to describe, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed then. \u201cYes. At least I have the\u2014 Oh . . . I forgot the disk.\u201d She spun around and rushed back into the outer office before Dylan could stop her.</p><p>She could hear laughter and the sound of glasses clinking together. She reached for the doorknob, but something else caught her attention. She froze. The brothers seemed to be having a grand celebration. They laughed uproariously when one of them made a joke about her family.</p><p>Kate stood at the door and listened for a couple of seconds. That was all the time she needed.</p><p>When she opened it and marched into the room, the laughter came to an abrupt halt. She didn\u2019t spare her cousins a glance, but walked to her chair and picked up the disk she had dropped. Then she swung around and reached for the binder on the desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Roger demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019ll be needing this after all,\u201d she said, as she turned around to face their stares.</p><p>With the binder clutched to her chest, she walked back to the door where Dylan stood waiting.</p><p>As the door closed behind her, she looked over her shoulder and calmly said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t let me interrupt you, cousins. Please. Carry on. One of you was just calling my mother a whore.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Dylan posed the question as they crossed the lobby.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be a little more specific,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich hell are you referring to?\u201d</p><p>Anderson Smith, beaming like a proud parent whose child has performed way beyond his expectations, chased after them.</p><p>\u201cMiss MacKenna . . . Kate, Kate, please, wait just a minute.\u201d</p><p>For a split second Kate considered running from him. She desperately wanted to get away from the relatives with all possible haste, but not at the attorney\u2019s expense. It wasn\u2019t his fault that his client had been such a foul old man. She also couldn\u2019t blame him for the vile relatives. Anderson seemed to be just as shocked and repulsed by their behavior as she and Dylan were.</p><p>Forcing a smile, she turned around and waited for the attorney to reach her.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so pleased to hear you say you have decided to accept your inheritance. Shall I expect you here tomorrow at three? Your uncle\u2019s accountants and advisors will be ready to answer any questions you will surely have after you\u2019ve looked through the report, and they will also witness your signature.\u201d He took a breath and added, \u201cAnd I will of course continue to do my best to guide you until the transfer is complete and until you name a new firm to represent you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no plans to replace you, Anderson,\u201d she assured.</p><p>He was obviously thrilled with her decision. He clasped her hand. \u201cWonderful, wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the eighty million\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, my dear, your uncle understated the value.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour inheritance is considerably more than eighty million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . and you will continue to represent . . .\u201d Her voice trailed away.</p><p>\u201cWill I see you tomorrow at three?\u201d</p><p>He was moving too fast for her. Everything was moving too fast. \u201cI\u2019ll need time to read . . . tonight . . . and tomorrow . . .\u201d She looked frantically at Dylan for help. She couldn\u2019t seem to get the words out. She thought she must sound moronic.</p><p>Dylan thought she sounded as dazed as she looked.</p><p>\u201cCould Kate get back to you about the meeting? She could call you in the morning to let you know when to schedule it. Don\u2019t do anything until you hear from her.\u201d</p><p>She was nodding eagerly. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Anderson pointed to the binder she was gripping. \u201cYou have quite a bit to read tonight and to absorb. I\u2019ve printed out the arrangements for your uncle\u2019s burial in the event you wish to attend, though I would encourage you not to.\u201d He patted her hand and stepped back. \u201cAs your attorney,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cI want you to feel that you can call me at any time, day or night, with questions or concerns. My card is inside the binder with each of my numerous phone numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>She started to turn away, then stopped. \u201cAbout this meeting . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill the cousins be there?\u201d She was proud of herself. She\u2019d said \u201ccousins\u201d without flinching or gagging.</p><p>He was sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say they will have to be invited. Your uncle\u2019s instructions were quite specific. I didn\u2019t question his motive when he told me his wishes, but it\u2019s my belief he wanted the brothers to see firsthand what they\u2019d be losing. Their presence isn\u2019t mandatory, however, because their shares of the estate have already been assigned to them. The same applies to your sisters, Kiera and Isabel. You are the only one who has to be present to sign anything.</p><p>\u201cIf you had refused the inheritance, I am confident the three nephews would ultimately be the next in line to receive it, since they maintained contact with your uncle while he was alive. His will explicitly limits what he has bequeathed to your sisters, so I doubt they would be able to lay claim to the larger estate. I guess what I am trying to say is that it all rests with you.\u201d</p><p>He spoke more to Dylan than to her when he said, \u201cI cannot impress upon you strongly enough the importance of continuing to be cautious.\u201d Taking her hand again, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be concerned about any of your relatives barging into the meeting with a weapon. There will be sufficient security, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>She thought he was making a lame attempt at a joke until he addressed Dylan again.</p><p>\u201cMy security guard has informed me that the serial number on the gun he confiscated had indeed been filed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Dylan replied. \u201cDid he call it in, and did he check on a permit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. The police are on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d</p><p>Anderson finally let them escape. They were crossing the lobby when Dylan spotted the security guard anxiously waiting in the shadows near the entrance.</p><p>Kate tried to walk ahead to the door, but Dylan grabbed her arm. \u201cHold on a minute.\u201d</p><p>The guard rushed over to them. \u201cDetective Buchanan, did Mr. Smith tell you what I found out about the gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I tell them? They\u2019re going to be here any second.\u201d</p><p>Dylan could see the guard was nervous about the procedure. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything but give them the gun. They\u2019ll handle Roger MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t they be warned about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have been warned,\u201d he assured him. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing. You just stay out of their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnderson is going to try to keep all of them in his office until the police arrive, but if Roger insists on leaving, he\u2019ll walk down with him. You won\u2019t have to face him alone.\u201d The guard still looked worried. \u201cOr you could wait in your office . . .\u201d Dylan continued.</p><p>Instantly relieved, the guard answered, \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want me to do, sir, then I\u2019ll wait in my office.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOkay, Kate. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. Her look of astonishment was priceless, and he almost laughed.</p><p>\u201cThe gun surprised you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Surprised? Oh, please. She\u2019d gone way past surprise in the attorney\u2019s office. Like an Irishman at an Anglican wake, she had this totally inappropriate urge to laugh. The brothers just kept getting worse.</p><p>\u201cRoger brought a gun to the attorney\u2019s office?\u201d She took a couple of steps toward the door and stopped. \u201cWho would bring a gun to the reading of a will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently Roger MacKenna would, and in fact did. The police will take him to the station and have a little chat with him. They\u2019ll run the gun, too,\u201d he added. \u201cHopefully, Roger will do some heavy sweating in jail. That would be pretty sweet, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be waiting for the police? They might have questions . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not waiting. We\u2019re getting away from here as quickly as possible. Unless you want to run back upstairs and kiss the cousins good-bye.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered with repulsion. She\u2019d rather eat glass.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she said politely. \u201cI\u2019d just as soon leave.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI thought you might.\u201d</p><p>A clap of thunder greeted them when they stepped outside. It was already drizzling, but the clouds were dark and heavy. A hard rain would come any second now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWant to make a run for it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to answer. He grabbed her hand and took off. By the time they reached the corner, the drizzle had turned into rain.</p><p>She was keeping pace with him, which was no small feat. \u201cI would prefer that you bring the car around.\u201d</p><p>They sprinted across the street as he said, \u201cNo way, Pickle. You\u2019re staying with me, and we\u2019re getting out of here.\u201d</p> <p>They raced along the path through the park. Dylan was scanning the area, looking for anyone or anything that didn\u2019t belong. His hand rested on the handle of his gun.</p><p>Kate\u2019s high heels were taking a pounding and killing her, but pride kept her from complaining or asking him to slow down. She\u2019d keep up or die trying.</p><p>When they reached the car, Dylan opened her door and practically tossed her inside. He removed his jacket and, just as he was handing it to her, the skies opened up. He managed to make it to the driver\u2019s side without getting completely soaked.</p><p>Kate folded his jacket and carefully laid it on the backseat. After placing the thick binder and the envelope on the floor behind her, she sat back and tried to calm her racing heart. She couldn\u2019t get the cousins out of her thoughts. She felt as though she\u2019d just spent the past hour whirling in a blender.</p><p>Dylan checked the street and the buildings beyond. The rain had chased pedestrians under the awnings and into doorways. Two pickup trucks drove by, but the drivers didn\u2019t look their way.</p> <p>They were safe . . . for the moment.</p><p>A police car sped by and turned the corner. It came to an abrupt stop in front of Smith and Wesson.</p><p>Dylan started the engine and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The windows were beginning to steam up as he pulled onto the street. He flipped on the air conditioner.</p><p>Kate wasn\u2019t paying attention to where they were going until she noticed he missed the turn that would take them to the highway. When she pointed that out, he nodded but kept going.</p><p>It seemed to her that he turned left or right at nearly every corner. She soon lost her sense of direction. She thought they had started out going north, but he\u2019d made so many turns she couldn\u2019t get her bearings.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere yet. I\u2019m making sure we aren\u2019t being followed.\u201d</p><p>She quickly turned around and looked out the back window. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust being careful.\u201d</p><p>The rain was already letting up. Dylan spotted a baseball field and pulled into a parking lot adjacent to a set of metal bleachers. There wasn\u2019t a soul around, no doubt because of the weather, but the sun was already moving in, and with it came a renewed wave of heat and humidity. Steam rose up from the concrete path that circled the lot.</p><p>Dylan put the car in park, unhooked his seat belt, and loosened his tie. He took a deep breath and slowly let it out.</p> <p>Kate waited a moment before saying, \u201cDylan? Do you remember I told you I couldn\u2019t think of anyone who would want to kill me?\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile softened his expression. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I could come up with some names for you now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Kate seemed to have a knack for always knowing just what to say to take the edge off. And one of her smiles could cut right through the tension.</p><p>Dylan knew she had to be afraid. She\u2019d already been through hell and still carried the bruises as a reminder that someone was trying to kill her, but when she got her back up, she was a force to be reckoned with. She was an amazing woman.</p><p>He, on the other hand, was a basket case. Real nice admission coming from a detective.</p><p>Her uncle had put Kate in a very dangerous position. Dylan didn\u2019t care about the money or what the man\u2019s motives had been. Knowingly or unknowingly, Compton MacKenna had given his nephews more than eighty million reasons to get rid of her.</p><p>The thought of anyone hurting her enraged him. And terrified him. Not good, he realized. Not good at all. He\u2019d gotten too emotionally involved, damn it. Too . . . attached. Now how in blazes had that happened?</p><p>Kate studied Dylan\u2019s face. He was glaring through the windshield at nothing in particular.</p><p>\u201cDylan . . . ?\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let anyone hurt you.\u201d The promise was given with such intensity, his voice shook.</p><p>Kate jumped to the conclusion that he needed reassurance. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m concerned about your ability to protect me because you were shot in the line of duty?\u201d</p><p>Man, was she dense. He actually laughed. \u201cYeah, that was my worry, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of all of your commendations,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019re excellent at what you do. I\u2019m not at all worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d he said drily.</p><p>That problem resolved, she said, \u201cI\u2019m in a real mess aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d he admitted with a nod.</p><p>\u201cFor how long, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you a timeline.\u201d</p><p>She knew that, of course she did, but she still wanted one. Her entire life had been placed in limbo, and she couldn\u2019t get anything done, personally or professionally, until this was settled.</p><p>She suddenly realized how foolish her thoughts were. Staying alive was the first priority.</p><p>Dylan grabbed his cell phone and opened the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to call Nate. Anderson had given him the names of the relatives, and Nate was going to run a background check on all of them. He should know something by now. You stay put.\u201d</p><p>He left the motor running and the air conditioner on.</p><p>Nate had been anxiously waiting for Dylan to call. He picked up on the first ring and quickly filled Dylan in on what he\u2019d found out about the brothers.</p><p>\u201cMight as well start with the youngest, Ewan,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a bodybuilder and has one hell of a temper. At last count he had three lawsuits pending, all for assault. He put one guy in ICU a year ago, shattered another man\u2019s jaw, and beat the crap out of a bartender for cutting him off. His lawyers have been doing some pretty fancy dancing to keep him out of prison, and Ewan owes them major bucks. A couple of years back he went into business with some investors to produce and sell some sort of new exercise contraption, but that went bust, so now he\u2019s banking on the inheritance to come through. If he doesn\u2019t get it, he could be bench-pressing in prison.\u201d</p><p>Dylan could hear him flipping papers.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Nate continued, \u201cBryce . . . he\u2019s the oldest, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cNo criminal record,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he\u2019s still bad news. He started drinking the hard stuff in college, and by the time he graduated, he was a full-blown drunk. He\u2019s been hospitalized several times for liver problems. He won\u2019t stop drinking, though,\u201d he added. \u201cAbout eighteen months ago he tried to get on the liver transplant list. He didn\u2019t qualify because he was still drinking. From what I\u2019ve been told, Bryce went crazy for a while, even tried to buy himself a liver. He\u2019s as whacked as Ewan is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe did some day-trading when the market was booming, but eventually he lost his shirt. You should see his credit report. It\u2019s pages and pages long. His debt is staggering. He doesn\u2019t seem to care that his wife is going to end up with all the bills. Anderson Smith said that the specialists give Bryce about six months tops before he keels over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his wife?\u201d Dylan asked. \u201cI noticed she wasn\u2019t wearing a wedding ring. Are they separated or divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re still married,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was going to file, but then she was told that Bryce was dying, and she thought she should be there with him until the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get that from Anderson, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cHe respects . . . what\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanessa,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Dylan could hear the papers turning over again. Several seconds passed and then Nate said, \u201cAh, here she is. No criminal record, not even a speeding ticket. She\u2019s received several awards for her work in the community,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe\u2019s got a small interior design business. The uncle took a shine to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Roger MacKenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was saving the best for last. You got to meet all of these people, didn\u2019t you? You were there in the office with Kate, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet that was interesting. I heard Kate turned it all down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cSure wish I could have seen the brothers\u2019 reactions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want the money. She was ready to sign it all away until she heard Bryce, Roger, and Ewan slandering her family. That got her back up, and she changed her mind.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, then a burst of laughter. Nate was obviously tickled by the news.</p><p>\u201cGood for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find out about Roger?\u201d he asked, trying to get Nate back on track.</p><p>Dylan paced the parking lot while he waited for Nate to find his notes on the middle brother.</p><p>Kate watched him from the car. She couldn\u2019t hear his conversation because the air conditioner was making a racket and he was walking away from her.</p><p>Then he turned and smiled at her. The news from Nate must not have been so terrible. Dylan wouldn\u2019t be smiling if he was hearing terrible things.</p><p>The smile didn\u2019t last long, though. She took her eye off him for only a few seconds while she reached down into her purse to get her cell phone, but when she looked at him again, she couldn\u2019t believe the radical change. He wasn\u2019t calm now; he was furious, so furious in fact he was shouting into the phone.</p><p>\u201cGood heavens,\u201d she whispered. She thought she heard him yell a man\u2019s name\u2014Jack\u2014and wondered who he was.</p><p>She turned the air conditioner off and tried to hear more of the one-sided conversation, but other than a roar or two every now and then, she couldn\u2019t make out anything he was saying.</p><p>She frowned with disapproval. Shouting wasn\u2019t very professional of him, especially shouting at the poor, overworked detective, and she was going to tell him so when he got back into the car.</p><p>A few minutes later she was screaming into her own phone, and she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She had just listened to a message from her box supplier, Haley, and unable to believe what she had heard, she had to replay the message again.</p><p>\u201cWe keep missing each other,\u201d Haley began. \u201cPlease call me and give me some direction here. This woman . . . this crazy woman . . . keeps barging into my office trying to change everything. Her name is Randy Simmons, and she insists that she\u2019s the new owner of the Kate MacKenna company. I thought it was some kind of sick joke. If you could see her and see how she was dressed, you\u2019d understand why I would think it was a prank. She\u2019s very . . .\u201d The message paused for a couple of seconds. \u201c. . . crude. She wouldn\u2019t go away, Kate, and when I told her that I had recently talked to you and that you hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about selling your company, she explained that of course you wouldn\u2019t say anything because you were humiliated and embarrassed. She said you defaulted on your loan.\u201d</p><p>It was at this point when Kate first listened to the message that she started screaming into the phone. The shock hadn\u2019t worn off because she started shouting again the second time she listened.</p><p>\u201cYou can imagine my reaction,\u201d Haley continued. \u201cI was speechless. I think Randy was amused by my reaction. Oh, and get this, she told me not to worry. She didn\u2019t have any plans to fire me as long as I did what she wanted. I reminded her that I own my own company and have quite a few clients. I explained in very simple terms that she couldn\u2019t fire me because I didn\u2019t work for her. I don\u2019t think she understood, though. She said she was so excited about owning her own business, perhaps she was being a little overeager to get started. She kept telling me she was going to make big changes. And get this. She said your colors were too quiet.</p><p>\u201cI finally got my wits about me, and I told her she would have to prove she was the new owner before she could make any changes. She assured me her husband was taking care of everything, and she promised to have the legal papers on my desk before the month was over. In the meantime she didn\u2019t want me to order anything more for you that couldn\u2019t be returned. Kate, you\u2019ve simply got to call me and tell me how you want me to handle this. Oh, and by the way, I don\u2019t know how she did it, but she found out the name of the company we use to make your ribbon, and she called them direct to cancel the order. She told them she was the new owner and that she wanted to change the color to something that would get more attention. She\u2019s not sure what color the boxes will be yet, but the ribbons will be bright blue with fuchsia trim. The sales rep called me and asked what he should do. Please get back to me as soon as you can. I really need some help here.\u201d</p><p>Kate was yelling at the phone when Dylan returned to the car. He knew she wasn\u2019t talking to anyone because she was holding the phone at arm\u2019s length and shouting incoherently.</p><p>\u201cKate, listen to me\u2014\u201d It was as far as he could get.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s changing my ribbons. Do you believe that? She\u2019s telling people she owns my company. The loan . . . that loan . . . she knew all about the loan my mother . . . it\u2019s that weasel accountant, Simmons . . . this must be his wife.\u201d</p><p>She was so angry she was shaking and talking so fast all Dylan got was something about a ribbon and a weasel.</p><p>\u201cYou need to listen to me,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cForget about the ribbon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not forget about my ribbon. I\u2019m calling a lawyer, and I\u2019m going to nail that little weasel. How dare he . . . and she . . . change my ribbon? She wants fuchsia? Can you believe the gall . . .\u201d</p><p>She was waving her phone around while she rambled on. Dylan dodged it once, then grabbed it and placed it on the console.</p><p>Once again he tried to get her attention. \u201cKate . . .\u201d</p><p>She was on a roll. \u201cDo you think the loan officer at the bank is in on it, too? If he is, he\u2019s going to prison with the weasel. How dare they\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cupped the sides of her face and forced her to look at him. \u201cKate.\u201d He didn\u2019t shout her name but he came close. He got her full attention. \u201cYou\u2019ve got much bigger problems than ribbon.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her, sat back, and waited for her to calm down. The impact of what he\u2019d just said cut through her anger. She was suddenly so embarrassed by her raving lunatic behavior she apologized. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have shouted . . . it was just a shock, you see. They\u2019re trying to steal my company . . . those sneaky\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He quickly stopped her before she got all revved up again. \u201cBut you won\u2019t let them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. I won\u2019t let them.\u201d She was finally able to compose herself.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m ready. What did Nate tell you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe cousins are all bad news. Bryce has racked up a huge debt which will all be dumped on his wife when he dies. He\u2019s in liver failure, and the doctors figure he\u2019s got about six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shock there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe looks like he\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just thirty-five, and he has already destroyed his liver with alcohol.\u201d</p><p>He moved on to Ewan. Kate wasn\u2019t surprised to hear about his violent behavior. She\u2019d seen a glimpse of his temper in Anderson\u2019s office. Ewan seemed capable of going into a rage at the least provocation.</p><p>\u201cRoger\u2019s the gambler in the family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the video Compton said Roger had gambled away four hundred thousand. That surely was an exaggeration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was pretty accurate,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cAnd apparently Roger hasn\u2019t slowed down. He\u2019s in to a loan shark for about seven hundred thousand now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAre you sure? Seven hundred? That\u2019s crazy.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo wonder he was crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard the bad news yet. Roger borrowed the money from Johnny Jackman. He\u2019s the real badass here. He\u2019s got connections you wouldn\u2019t believe, and he also has a reputation to uphold. He\u2019s going to get that money one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you know Jackman. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met him, but I\u2019ve heard all about him. The feds are going to be happy with this development. They\u2019ve been trying to get something on him for a long time. Nate can\u2019t leave them out of this any longer. He needs them. And so do we.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He was exasperated with her but understood. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t go home.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have taken the money,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it. But then I heard them saying such terrible things about my family . . . my mother in particular, and I wanted to strike back. Taking the money seemed the best way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Whoever wants you out of the way couldn\u2019t take the chance you might change your mind. Too much is at stake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo everything that\u2019s been happening to me is tied up with this money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to assume it\u2019s about the money. You heard what Compton said. He changed the will some time ago, but according to the date on the video, he didn\u2019t record his message until a few weeks ago. Since the explosions happened after the video was made, the question now is, who knew about the video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw how shocked and outraged those brothers were, and Vanessa looked dumbfounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So, either there\u2019s a player out there we don\u2019t know about, or one of your relatives is a damned fine actor.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t want to stay in Savannah for the night. She dearly loved the city, but because her relatives were there, she was determined to get as far away as possible.</p><p>Dylan understood and agreed. He headed northwest, avoided the highway, and stayed on the scenic back roads. He didn\u2019t seem worried about where they\u2019d spend the night. He also didn\u2019t seem concerned that they were getting low on gas.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to run out of gas on a back road,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d he agreed. He glanced at her and asked, \u201cAre you going to worry about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll stop. Get the map out of the glove compartment, please. Find Bucyrus. The sign we passed a couple of minutes ago says we\u2019re ten miles from it.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t noticed the sign. After unfolding the map and checking their location, she gave him directions. The little town was nestled in a valley, and according to the WELCOME TO BUCYRUS sign, there were 828 residents.</p><p>They found a restaurant on Main Street. The parking spots angled into the curb. Dylan pulled in front of the hardware store. He turned the motor off and asked, \u201cAre you hungry? Sure you are,\u201d he answered before she had a chance to say anything. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>He made two phone calls while she stretched her legs and tried to shake off the sick feeling in her stomach. She wasn\u2019t ill, but every time she thought about the relatives she became nauseated.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have an appetite until she walked into the restaurant. The aroma of freshly baked bread, cinnamon, and other more pungent spices greeted them, and by the time she sat down, she was ravenous.</p><p>The owner had taken time and care with the restaurant\u2019s d\u00e9cor and was apparently a fan of stripes. Yellow-and-white-striped curtains hung at the windows. The tablecloths were also yellow and white and so were the stools at the counter. But the motif had not yet reached the booths. Strips of duct tape covered tears in their blue vinyl seats.</p><p>\u201cQuaint\u201d or \u201ccharming\u201d might be overstated descriptions of the eatery, but it definitely fit into the homey category. On each table were ceramic salt and pepper sets in various animal shapes. The table Dylan and Kate chose had black-and-white-spotted cows.</p><p>What the restaurant lacked in ambience was made up for by the food, which was delicious and homemade. They both ordered a shrimp and pasta dish that came with a salad. Dylan ate all of his and half of hers.</p><p>The restaurant was empty except for the waitress and the cook, who were occupied with the soap opera that was playing on the small television at the end of the counter. Dylan leaned in so that he couldn\u2019t be heard and said, \u201cTell me more about this weasel and ribbon.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s brow wrinkled into a frown and she shook her head. \u201cYou know about the loan my mother took out using my company, among other things, as collateral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And . . . ?\u201d Dylan urged.</p><p>\u201cIt appears the accountant who managed my mother\u2019s finances and his wife are planning to take over my company just as soon as the due date for the payment arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do with ribbon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Kate filled him in on her conversation with Haley, and after she was through, Dylan sat back in the booth and fell silent for a few minutes. He was deep in thought and Kate could tell he was analyzing all the facts of her situation.</p><p>\u201cI think we have a lot more to look into,\u201d he said finally. He stood, took her hands, and pulled her to her feet. Before leaving the restaurant he got directions to the nearest filling station.</p><p>While he filled the gas tank, Kate used her cell phone to try to get hold of Jordan, but the answering machine picked up yet again. Kate left her a message to please call.</p><p>Once he was back in the car, Dylan looked at the map for about thirty seconds and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a destination in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I surprise you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as the rooms are clean, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot rooms,\u201d he said. \u201cOne room. You\u2019re staying with me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue. \u201cWill I have my own bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>But what if I don\u2019t know what I want? she wondered. What then? She thought about the silly that-was-then-this-is-now speech she\u2019d given him and wished she\u2019d kept her mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to make any phone calls, do it now because once we leave Bucyrus I don\u2019t want you calling anyone on your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I use my cell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter to be cautious.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t much of an explanation. \u201cI should call Kiera and Isabel. I\u2019ve put it off long enough. Hopefully their answering machines are on. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to go into detail, and I\u2019d rather not do that now.\u201d</p><p>Kate lucked out. She got voice mail right away. She left the same message for each of them. \u201cThe relatives are horrible,\u201d she began. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a video to show you of the great-uncle we\u2019ve been blessed not to know. I\u2019ll explain everything tomorrow. I\u2019m in a rush now and will be unavailable. If you need me, leave me a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t tell them about the inheritance?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important.\u201d She noticed his smile and asked, \u201cWhy is that amusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot amusing . . . just reflective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReflective of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>A sudden worry turned her attention. \u201cWhat about Kiera and Isabel? They\u2019re safe, aren\u2019t they? Their inheritance has already been transferred to them. Still . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnderson assured us they aren\u2019t in line to inherit the fortune. But I already talked to Nate about your sisters, and he\u2019s going to make sure they\u2019re covered. Hopefully, neither one of them will notice she has a shadow. You don\u2019t need to worry about them. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other phone calls you want to make, make them now,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kate quickly called Haley and once again missed her. She left a long message explaining that she still owned the company, and everything would be straightened out soon. In the meantime, she asked her not to say anything to the Simmons woman.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t let her know we\u2019ve talked. I\u2019m working on a surprise for her and her husband. I\u2019ll explain everything soon,\u201d she promised.</p><p>She disconnected the line, then tried once again to get hold of Jordan. She left another message before turning her phone off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reach your sister, and she hasn\u2019t returned my calls. That\u2019s not like her,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been able to get in touch with her since I showed up at your front door, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably just giving you time to cool down. I\u2019m sure she thinks you\u2019re angry with her for interfering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy sending you to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit for a little while I was irritated. I didn\u2019t like the idea of any man coming to save the day, and I found it a bit galling that Jordan, who is beyond a liberated woman, would send her brother to take care of me. I know\u2014she sent you because you\u2019re a detective who knows how to handle this sort of thing, but I still want to give her a piece of my mind. Making you come all this way . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan can\u2019t make me do anything I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>Ha. Of course she could, but Kate wasn\u2019t going to burst his bubble and tell him so. Jordan, like her sister, Sydney, could get all of her brothers to do anything she wanted. When begging didn\u2019t work, she used guilt. She\u2019d perfected various other techniques as well; however, guilt had always worked best.</p><p>Kate was thankful Dylan was with her. Oh, she knew that Nate and the other detectives in Charleston were capable men, but she was . . . comfortable with Dylan. There was also the trust issue. Hers was absolute.</p><p>Dylan\u2019s phone rang. The second he read the caller ID he started smiling. One of his women was on the line, no doubt. It was a reasonable conclusion. The man was grinning like an idiot.</p><p>Kate couldn\u2019t believe how disgruntled she became. What did she care about his love life?</p><p>Apparently far more than she wanted to, she admitted.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie. What\u2019s going on?\u201d he said into the phone.</p><p>Sweetie? He called her sweetie? Kate felt like grabbing the phone from him and tossing it out the window. She wondered how sweetie would like that.</p><p>She folded her arms and pretended not to be listening as she looked out the side window. The woman on the phone was doing most of the talking, but every once in a while Dylan would interject a word or two of encouragement or praise.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear . . . now you\u2019re thinking . . . yes, of course you can call me anytime . . . no, no, you\u2019re doing great. I\u2019ll talk to you real soon. You take care now . . .\u201d</p><p>It was enough to make her want to throw up. How many women did he have dangling, waiting desperately for him to call? I\u2019ll talk to you soon? How many times had he given that promise? Did he ever follow through? Did he call back? Probably not. It was just a kiss-off line.</p><p>She did notice that Dylan hadn\u2019t used his flirty voice, that wonderful, sexy tone that melted her defenses. Just bet he\u2019d melted a lot of other women, too . . .</p><p>Good God, she was jealous.</p><p>\u201cKate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She snapped the word out with bullet speed.</p><p>\u201cIsabel says hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d If she\u2019d been standing, she would have fallen over. \u201cIsabel . . . what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said hello. What\u2019s the matter with you? Why are you so jumpy?\u201d</p><p>If he only knew. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour face is red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said your face is red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did Isabel call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had my phone number,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she wanted me to know she changed the dead bolt on her door.\u201d He smiled as he added, \u201cShe said the lock didn\u2019t work, so she went to a hardware store, got what she needed, and impressed her roommate by doing it all herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What did you think?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to explain. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she call me? I just left her a message about meeting the relatives. Did she mention it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she did. She wanted me to tell you she\u2019s sorry they weren\u2019t more hospitable.\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed. \u201cHospitable? That\u2019s something Isabel would say, all right. She probably thinks they would have been nicer if I\u2019d offered them a beverage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sell her short, Kate. There\u2019s a brain hiding inside that blond hair. I\u2019ll tell you what. She\u2019s going to break a lot of hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry about her,\u201d she admitted. \u201cShe\u2019s too trusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want her to be more cynical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not cynical. You\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d Oh, that was an intelligent, well-thought-out response. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Isabel was on the phone?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was having too much fun watching you get all riled up.\u201d</p><p>Had her body language been that easy to read?</p><p>Kate made the mistake of trying to bluff her way through the awkward conversation. \u201cWhy would I get riled up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou thought I was talking to a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Okay, trying to bluff had been a mistake, she realized. Better not to say anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not denying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you believe me if I were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Determined to ignore him, she stared out the window and tried to be fascinated by the scenery. The tarred road they were on wound through a collage of colors. They passed an old, deserted fruit stand, and a few minutes later a black-water lake came into view.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I find real interesting?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou keep insisting that our night together in Boston was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it was. And it cannot happen again. It was an unusual circumstance, but now that we\u2019re back to normal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is normal?\u201d</p><p>She had to wait for him to stop laughing before she could continue. \u201cApparently I need to explain my actions again.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to give me the that-was-then lecture again, are you?\u201d</p><p>He was beginning to infuriate her. \u201cDo I need to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to enjoy giving that speech,\u201d he replied. And before she could interrupt, he added, \u201cWhat I find interesting is that you don\u2019t want me to touch you, but when you thought I was talking to a girl back home, you got all riled up. That\u2019s a contradiction, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>She needed to stop being defensive and embarrassed. \u201cYou enjoy flirting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine with me. But you know as well as I do that a relationship with me would be a disaster. Eventually you\u2019re going to go home, and you would feel terrible if you hurt me when you ended it, and I\u2019d feel terrible if I hurt you by ending it, and it\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot to mention Jordan this time.\u201d</p><p>Rattled, she said, \u201cI what? What do you mean \u2018this time\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time you told me a relationship with you wouldn\u2019t work, Jordan was at the top of your list of reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said all of this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>That took the wind out of her sails. \u201cThen I shouldn\u2019t have to go through it again, should I? I value Jordan\u2019s friendship . . . did I mention that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure did. You also told me you didn\u2019t want it to be awkward.\u201d</p><p>He was sounding slightly patronizing now. \u201cSo you were listening and you do understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I agree. Getting involved is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>She knew she should be relieved that he agreed with her, and yes, she was relieved, but did he have to agree so quickly?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t being logical. The problem was, she didn\u2019t know what to do about it.</p><p>Exhaustion and stress. Perfectly sound reasons for being so contradictory.</p><p>\u201cI have every right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Great. She was in worse condition than she\u2019d realized. Now she was thinking out loud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stressed, and I have every right to be stressed, and do you know why?\u201d She continued before he could say a word. \u201cSomeone out there is trying to blow me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she said. \u201cSince I came home from Boston, I\u2019ve felt like a punching bag. I think it\u2019s time for me to start punching back.\u201d</p><p>He nodded approval. \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. As long as you know who to punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve got a few people in mind.\u201d</p><p>They rode along for several minutes in silence, and she asked, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I use my cell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably being overly cautious, but when I heard that Jackman could be involved and probably is, I didn\u2019t want to take any chances. A cell phone is easy to pinpoint, and calls, just like regular phones, can be traced if you\u2019ve got the right equipment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me Jackman was a loan shark. Would he have that kind of capability?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a whole lot more than a loan shark, and if he doesn\u2019t have the capability, he knows people he can lean on who do.\u201d</p><p>The man sounded like a monster. A chill ran down her spine. \u201cHave you told anyone where we\u2019ll be spending the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not a soul. I thought we\u2019d head to Charleston. I\u2019ll find a hotel there, maybe on the outskirts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe closer we get to Silver Springs, the happier I\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to figure out what to do about tomorrow. We can\u2019t go back to Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut until I sign those papers . . .\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>The hotel was packed, yet Dylan managed to get them a lovely room\u2014all without showing any identification, as far as Kate could see. She waited across the lobby and watched the master at work. The person behind the counter was a young woman, and Dylan was Mr. Charismatic. It took him less than five minutes to get her to blush and hand him the key. Kate thought she might have handed him her phone number, too.</p><p>The room was well appointed and spacious and had a breathtaking view of the ocean. There were two queen-size beds which the maids had already turned down for the night.</p><p>As soon as the bellman left, she asked Dylan, \u201cWhat did you have to promise that woman to get this wonderful room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give away trade secrets,\u201d he said. He unzipped his garment bag and hung his clothes in the walk-in closet.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYou just can\u2019t help it, can you?\u201d</p><p>She thought he hadn\u2019t heard her. He went into the bathroom, put his shaving kit on the marble counter, and called out, \u201cThis place is huge. I can\u2019t help what?\u201d</p><p>He had been listening. \u201cIt\u2019s second nature to you. I think you were born with this . . . talent. Now that I think about it, all of the Buchanan brothers have it. It must be in the genes,\u201d she added as she considered the possibility.</p><p>He stood in the doorway watching her. \u201cI\u2019ve got lots of talents, Pickle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I born with?\u201d</p><p>She really wished she hadn\u2019t started this conversation because he wasn\u2019t going to let it go. \u201cA tiger can\u2019t help having stripes, and you can\u2019t help flirting. It\u2019s okay,\u201d she hastened to add. \u201cYou make every woman you meet feel special. It\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift, huh?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if he was pleased by her observation or irritated. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Which bed do you want?\u201d she asked, hoping to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cThe one by the door. You sound like you approve of this gift.\u201d</p><p>Approve? She wouldn\u2019t go that far. \u201cI understand,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t faze me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I were to come on to you, or hit on you, or flirt, or whatever it is you think I do . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t bother me at all. I\u2019m immune now, Dylan.\u201d</p><p>Ah, man, was he going to have some fun with her. \u201cGood to know,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Desperate to change the subject, she picked up her makeup bag and her pajamas and robe. \u201cI\u2019d like to take a shower and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glanced at the clock on the bedside table and was shocked by how late it was. They\u2019d stopped for dinner and must have lingered longer than she realized.</p><p>She was walking past him when she remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day.\u201d She thought he had said something and turned around. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cWhat . . .\u201d</p><p>He moved fast. His hand cupped the back of her neck and his mouth captured hers.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even think about pushing him away or stepping back. She might have sighed into his mouth, though. When his tongue swept inside to stroke hers, her body tingled all the way down to her toes.</p><p>She was about to put her arms around his neck when he pulled back. Her heart was racing, and she couldn\u2019t catch her breath, but Dylan looked unaffected. He reached behind her and pushed the bathroom door open. She didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me to?\u201d His eyes sparkled with devilment.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little push to get her to move. \u201cI could have sworn you did. My mistake.\u201d</p><p>She caught a glimpse of his grin as he walked away.</p><p>She shut the door, locked it, and dropped her makeup bag on the counter. There were two sinks. She took the one closest to the wall and tried not to think about the kiss as she took out her toothbrush and toiletries.</p><p>She glanced at herself in the mirror and cringed. She looked horrible. Her hair was hanging limply around her face, and the shadows under her eyes had gotten darker. And he\u2019d kissed her. Goes to show you, she thought. Dylan either had very low standards, or he would hit on any woman no matter how bad she looked.</p><p>A hot shower made her feel almost human again. She hadn\u2019t realized how tense she was or how much the muscles in her neck and shoulders ached until the hot water loosened them.</p><p>She worried about Dylan\u2019s shoulder. He hadn\u2019t had therapy in a while. Were his muscles tightening up? Was he in pain? If he weren\u2019t so sensitive and macho about his injury, she would have asked.</p><p>She washed her hair and dried it, brushed her teeth, and put on moisturizer. Then she cleaned the bathroom. She knew how much Dylan hated clutter. He liked everything neat and in its place. When she was finished she checked herself in the mirror one last time and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>He gave her the once-over as he walked toward her. His gaze lingered on her legs.</p><p>She swallowed. Why was she feeling so nervous? After all, she\u2019d slept with him, hadn\u2019t she? He\u2019d seen her naked, and she\u2019d seen him.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it. Just dive in bed, pull the covers up, and hide like a coward.</p><p>He stopped when he was directly in front of her. His hands settled on her h*ps and he pulled her close. He leaned down, and she thought he was going to kiss her again. She couldn\u2019t allow that, shouldn\u2019t allow it, she thought as she tilted her head back in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cDylan, I don\u2019t think . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think what? I\u2019m trying to get a closer look at those bruises. The one on your forehead is beginning to fade.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her and stepped back. She felt like an idiot. \u201cIt\u2019s better now,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing,\u201d he said when she tried to walk past him.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She looked up just as his hand brushed the side of her face. And then he kissed her. It was a quick touch of his mouth on hers, and yet it was electrifying all the same.</p><p>She wanted more.</p><p>She forced herself to put some distance between them. \u201cAbout that kiss . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t like it?\u201d He didn\u2019t give her time to answer. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it either.\u201d</p><p>Before she could prepare her defenses, he wrapped her in his arms, tilted her head back, and kissed her again. He was serious this time. His mouth was open and hot. How could she not respond? She felt as though she were melting under his touch, and oh it felt so right.</p><p>He ended the kiss abruptly and let go. She nearly fell backward, but he grabbed her and smiled. \u201cI like that a lot better.\u201d</p><p>One kiss and he\u2019d turned her mind into mush. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it,\u201d she whispered hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an easy one. I lean in, and my mouth presses against yours, and my tongue\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake. I\u2019m not asking you how to kiss. I just mean that I don\u2019t know how you can so easily make me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He beat her to the punch. \u201cWant more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlustered.\u201d She nearly shouted the word. \u201cYou make me flustered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>This time she watched him walk into the bathroom and shut the door. She tried to summon up a frown, to work up a little anger. Self-preservation. That\u2019s what it was, she thought. If she could hide behind anger, she wouldn\u2019t have to face the truth.</p><p>A smile came unbidden, and she was suddenly weak-kneed. She sat on the bed and fell back against the pillows. It was odd, the thoughts that came into your mind when you weren\u2019t blocking them. She pictured Dylan lecturing Isabel and instructing her. He\u2019d been so caring with her.</p><p>He\u2019d been caring with Kate, too. She remembered the way he\u2019d held her in his arms while she\u2019d wept against his shoulder . . . the way he\u2019d touched her . . .</p><p>There was so much more to Dylan than his relentless teasing during those pickup football games on Nathan\u2019s Bay. He was strong, and yet he could be very gentle. He was decisive, but still he took time to listen. He was kind and smart and sexy and . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she groaned. She was in love with him.</p><p>The truth stunned her. When had this terrible thing happened to her? She tried but couldn\u2019t come up with a defining moment. She had a feeling that it would take years of therapy to figure this one out.</p><p>Of all the men in the world she could have fallen in love with, she had to pick Mr. Love-\u2019em-and-leave-\u2019em. She groaned again.</p><p>All things considered, however, she thought she was taking the realization quite well. She wasn\u2019t running down the hallways screaming or tearing her hair out.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t jumping up and down with joy, either. But then why should she? She\u2019d lost her frickin\u2019 mind.</p><p>She reached for the phone to call Jordan. It was an automatic reaction to want to talk to her best friend and pour her heart out. Then she remembered she couldn\u2019t call anyone now and knew she shouldn\u2019t anyway because Dylan was Jordan\u2019s brother. It just wouldn\u2019t be right to scream and carry on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She would have to suffer in silence. She rolled onto her stomach and buried her face in her pillow, thinking that if a scream escaped, the pillow would muffle the sound.</p><p>\u201cKate, are you trying to suffocate yourself?\u201d</p><p>Now that\u2019s a plan. She was laughing when she sat up. \u201cI always put a pillow over my face when I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>He was wearing a pair of khaki shorts that rode low on his hips. They were zipped but not buttoned. His stomach was flat, hard. He didn\u2019t bother with a T-shirt. He was sexy, no doubt about it. She refused to look into his eyes, fearing he\u2019d know he was getting to her.</p> <p>She grabbed the notepad from the bedside table and a pen. \u201cI\u2019m going to write down the names of the people I think would like to kill me.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out on the bed, adjusted the pillows, and stacked his hands behind his head. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be quicker to write down the names of the people who don\u2019t want to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople enjoy my company. They do,\u201d she insisted when she thought he looked skeptical.</p><p>\u201cI sure enjoyed you.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the mood for teasing. Ignoring him seemed to be the only logical course of action. Kate began to write names, and in no time at all, she\u2019d filled two pages and was working on a third. She suddenly stopped. She was struck by what she was doing, and why. Granted, the notepad was small, but still, two and a half pages? Oh, dear Lord.</p> <p>\u201cKate, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just hit me . . . what I\u2019m doing. If someone a month ago had told me I would be making this kind of a list, I wouldn\u2019t have believed him. Good heavens, Dylan,\u201d she cried out, \u201clook at all these names.\u201d</p><p>He rolled to his side to face her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to panic on me, are you? You\u2019re safe now. Right this minute you\u2019re safe. Concentrate on that.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not freaking out, so you can stop talking to me in that keep-her-calm-until-we-get-the-straitjacket-on-her voice. It all sort of overwhelmed me for a moment, that\u2019s all. Two shocks in one night . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, two?\u201d</p><p>He would have to zoom in on that slip, wouldn\u2019t he? Realizing she loved him was a bigger jolt to her system than her long list of suspects. Maybe because the truth had snuck up on her and then . . . boom.</p> <p>\u201cKate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s work related,\u201d she lied. She rotated her pen between her fingers while she once again concentrated on the list. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sleep until I\u2019ve crossed off at least one of these names. I\u2019d feel like I was making some progress,\u201d she explained before he could ask a third time. \u201cYou could help, you know.\u201d</p><p>He was on his back again staring at the ceiling. He looked half asleep.</p><p>She thought he was ignoring her until he said, \u201cI guess you could cross off the artist, Oregano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCinnamon,\u201d she corrected. \u201cHer name is Cinnamon. I\u2019ll bet she\u2019ll be devastated to know the explosion wasn\u2019t meant to kill her. She was getting a lot of mileage out of the publicity.\u201d She sighed as she added, \u201cI didn\u2019t put her name on my list so I can\u2019t cross her off.\u201d</p><p>She read him the names she\u2019d written. All of the MacKenna brothers made her list, and she had even included Anderson and his assistant. She couldn\u2019t remember his name.</p><p>\u201cTerrance,\u201d he supplied.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t think Anderson or Terrance or Vanessa MacKenna is involved, but I included them because they were in the office when the video was played. I also put Carl\u2019s name on the list, but I can surely cross him off, can\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. He\u2019s guilty until proven innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works. It\u2019s the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when it comes to your life. He\u2019s involved in some way,\u201d he added. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how yet.\u201d</p><p>She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and studied her list for another minute or two.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d forgotten to add Jackman. She wrote the name and was putting the pen down when he added, \u201cAnd his associates.\u201d</p><p>She was becoming more and more frustrated. \u201cI\u2019m going to put a name down and then I\u2019m going to cross him off, got that? What about Reece? Should I put him on the list?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was becoming shrill. She knew she needed to calm down before she lost it. She just wasn\u2019t sure how.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so relaxed about all this?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWaiting\u2019s always tough. I\u2019ve got good people gathering information for me. I have to be patient, and so do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you sorry you got involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The answer was abrupt, almost angry. Kate thought she might have offended.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the weasel\u2019s wife who took your ribbon? Would you feel better if you put her name on the list and crossed it off?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t take my ribbon. She and her husband are trying to steal my company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got a plan to stop them, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She was able to smile again. \u201cYes, I do. And when I\u2019m finished with them, I assure you they\u2019ll want to kill me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed; she\u2019d sounded so gleeful. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>She tossed the pad and pen on the table and turned the lamp off. The room was suffused in moonlight filtering in through the sheers.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. Had he already fallen asleep? Or was he faking it so she\u2019d stop talking and give him a little peace?</p><p>She knew she wasn\u2019t going to get any rest. All she could think about was Dylan. She wanted to sleep with him, and for a minute or two she was actually able to pretend that she only wanted to be held in his arms, but she was deceiving herself and she knew it. She wanted it all. She wanted to feel him moving within her, to touch every inch of him.</p><p>She thought about his mouth, his hot, sexy mouth, and what he could do with it . . .</p><p>\u201cKate?\u201d</p><p>She nearly came off the bed. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you groan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Maybe I did. I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just turned the lamp off. Don\u2019t you think you should give yourself a couple of minutes before you decide you can\u2019t sleep? Is there anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>If he only knew. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>She was certain she heard amusement in his voice. Did he know what his nearness was doing to her?</p><p>Hold on a minute. What about him? Was she affecting him the same way? He was the sex maniac, not her . . . until recently, anyway, or more specifically until she\u2019d spent the night with him. Was he toying with her?</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t think of a thing you could do to help me.\u201d</p><p>She waited for a reaction and was disappointed when she didn\u2019t get one. Several long minutes passed in silence. She couldn\u2019t even hear him breathe.</p><p>And then a long drawn out sigh. \u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dylan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I coming over there, or are you coming to me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Morning came all too soon, and she awoke with no regrets. After the night they\u2019d shared, she probably should feel a little awkward around him, and when she thought about all the things he\u2019d done to her and she\u2019d done to him, she should at the very least find it difficult to look him in the eye. But regrets? No, there were no regrets.</p><p>She was thankful she woke up before he did. He was sleeping on his stomach with one arm hanging off the bed. The pillows and sheets and blankets were on the floor. It had been a wild night, all right. And glorious.</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t start worrying until she was in the shower. Had she said something she shouldn\u2019t have in one of those passionate moments when he was driving her out of her mind? Had she told him she loved him? Dear God, she didn\u2019t, did she? She couldn\u2019t remember. She prayed she hadn\u2019t. But if she had . . . what then? Pretend she hadn\u2019t? She couldn\u2019t think of anything better to do, and so she settled on that. Senators did it all the time, and under oath no less. They pretended they hadn\u2019t known . . . whatever. And if lying was good enough for a congressman, by God, it was good enough for her.</p><p>Okay, it had finally happened. Dylan had made her completely crazy.</p><p>She\u2019d never get out of the shower if she didn\u2019t stop thinking about him. There was so much she needed to get done today. She had promised Anderson that she would look through the binder. He wanted her to understand how the uncle had amassed his fortune, she supposed. And his advisors and accountants would be on hand to answer questions. No choice, she decided. She had to read the thing.</p><p>But there were also the photos of her father. She\u2019d been too weary last night to look at them.</p><p>Kate hurried to get dressed. She packed her makeup and toothbrush in her bag and opened the door.</p><p>Dylan was just getting out of bed. He didn\u2019t look awake, though. His hair was tousled and he was naked. As he walked toward her, her stomach quivered.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>He grunted a reply. Obviously not a morning person, she decided.</p><p>He passed her, grabbed her arm, and before she had time to prepare, he kissed her. She wanted to put her arms around him and lean into him. His body was so warm and . . .</p><p>She pulled back. Her thoughts were going to get her in trouble. \u201cI\u2019ve got reading to do, and you need to wake up.\u201d</p><p>With the least amount of coaxing she would have gone back to bed with him. She rushed to the table and grabbed the binder and the envelope of photos. She heard the bathroom door shut, and she relaxed. She was safe from acting out her lustful thoughts, and hopefully when he came out of the bathroom, he\u2019d be dressed.</p><p>She went to her bed, kicked her shoes off, and sat with her back against the headboard. Ready now, she opened the binder and began to read . . . and became sick in no time at all. That horrible old man had documented each acquisition with boastful notes in the margin, and after reading about fifteen pages word for word, she understood the pattern and skimmed over the rest.</p><p>He made his fortune buying companies, stripping them, and selling off what was left.</p><p>If Anderson had told her that Compton had been a shrewd businessman and had carefully built his portfolio by buying and selling properties, Kate probably wouldn\u2019t have thought much about it, and she doubted she would have been repulsed. Lots of clever, driven men and women made their fortunes wheeling and dealing, and Kate would have assumed Compton fit into that category. But seeing what he had done, and how he had done it, on paper, made all the difference. He used deceit and false promises, anything, it seemed, to get what he wanted. He certainly didn\u2019t have any scruples. The number of lives, the dreams he\u2019d destroyed over the years, the jobs and security of faithful employees he\u2019d snatched away . . . all that meant nothing to him, nor did the families of those who were dependent on the income of the companies he closed. The human element wasn\u2019t his concern, and compassion wasn\u2019t in his nature.</p><p>The only thing Compton MacKenna ever cared about was money, and how to make more.</p><p>What he had done wasn\u2019t criminal. But it was immoral. And he had gone to his grave proud of his accomplishments. Had he compiled this testimonial to his conquests just to impress her?</p><p>Dear God, he believed she was like him.</p><p>Reading his financial history validated her initial decision. She could not and would not spend a single dollar of his money on herself, her family, her company, or her future.</p><p>Compton MacKenna was a selfish, cruel man. She was not like him, and she meant to prove it. Whatever she decided to do with the money had to be perfect, and when she was done, she hoped Compton would roll over in his grave.</p><p>Shoving the binder aside, she reached for the envelope and opened it. Her mood immediately improved. There were ten photos, all black and white.</p><p>Her father had been a handsome boy. He looked dashing in his school uniform. He was definitely a child of privilege, she thought, as she studied one photo of him in a polo outfit standing so proudly in front of a horse. In another photo he was about four or five years old, and he was standing on a lawn, smiling into the camera. In the background was a house\u2014no, not a house, a mansion. Had he lived there?</p><p>There weren\u2019t any photos of him with his parents or other relatives. She thought that was odd and wondered if there were other pictures of her father packed away somewhere. She made a mental note to ask Anderson to find out.</p><p>She was just tucking the last photo back into the envelope when Dylan joined her.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d</p><p>She put the envelope and binder in her overnight bag.</p><p>Dylan was folding linens and placing them back on the bed with the pillows he\u2019d already picked up. He noticed what she was doing and asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to take that binder in the car so you can look it over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already looked through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you impressed? I got the idea that whoever put it together for you thought you would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She checked the bathroom and closet to make sure she hadn\u2019t left anything behind, but Dylan had already straightened them. Even the damp towels in the bathroom had been folded and left on the vanity.</p><p>They stopped for breakfast at the hotel coffee shop, but neither one of them was very hungry. As soon as they were back in the car, he checked the map again so he could avoid highways as they made their way toward Silver Springs.</p><p>\u201cI should call Anderson,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to plan on seeing me at three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you might see him at three,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all depends on how we work things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going back to Savannah? Won\u2019t that be dangerous? That\u2019s a terrible idea. I\u2019m warning you now. If we walk into that office and I see a basket of flowers anywhere in the vicinity, I won\u2019t be responsible for my actions. I\u2019ll do something terrible. I just know I will. I don\u2019t know exactly what that will be, but I assure you I cannot endure getting blown up again, and I won\u2019t let you get hurt. No, it\u2019s out of the question. We simply can\u2019t go back there. My mind\u2019s made up.\u201d</p><p>He did try to interrupt her during her tirade, but she was on a roll and wouldn\u2019t be stopped. When she finally had to take a breath, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet if we have to go back to Anderson\u2019s office. He might be able to bring the papers to us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have overreacted . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have?\u201d</p> <p>She reached behind her seat for the briefcase. \u201cIf you had mentioned this sooner, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten upset.\u201d She found the file folders she was looking for and pulled them out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLoan papers my mother signed. I want to read them again. The other folder is from one of the hospitals. In the last year of her life she spent more time there than at home.\u201d</p><p>Kate took the next twenty minutes to read each paper, each bill, and each receipt, and she at last understood. Tears clouded her vision. What little insurance her mother had, had run out, and in desperation she\u2019d signed away everything so that her daughters wouldn\u2019t be saddled with her debt.</p><p>The hospital bills alone were astronomical. How she must have worried, but in silence, telling no one and keeping the heartache and fear inside.</p> <p>Tears streamed down Kate\u2019s face. She turned away so Dylan wouldn\u2019t notice. She found a tissue in her purse and quickly wiped the tears away.</p><p>\u201cKate, do you want to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need information,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Anderson is ethical? If he\u2019s going to become my attorney, I\u2019ll need to know he has scruples. Is there a way to find out quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got someone looking at him. We\u2019ll know something soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like him. But he did represent Compton MacKenna, and that worries me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an attorney and obviously a good one or your uncle wouldn\u2019t have hired him. It\u2019s na\u00cfve to think Anderson had to like or respect him or any of his other clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other people I want checked out. Who would give us the name of a good investigator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do it for you. This is about your company, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got enough to deal with, and I need this information soon.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t argue. \u201cLet me think about it,\u201d he said.</p><p>She put the folders in the briefcase and sat back. Her mind was racing with details she needed to take care of.</p><p>\u201cAfter you sign those papers, what are you going to do with all that money?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>The question reminded her of yet another errand. \u201cI need to go to a bank in Silver Springs.\u201d</p><p>He thought she meant she would transfer the money there. \u201cAnderson will do that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I need to get a loan.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Dylan had the uneasy feeling that he was forgetting something. He kept replaying conversations in his mind and going over various details again and again, and still he couldn\u2019t figure out what was bothering him.</p><p>He knew he was missing something, but what? What wasn\u2019t he seeing?</p><p>Kate noticed how preoccupied and withdrawn he had become. It didn\u2019t take long for her to catch on that he didn\u2019t want to talk\u2014his abrupt one-word responses were a dead giveaway\u2014and for over an hour neither of them said a word. The silence wasn\u2019t awkward, though. Had she become that comfortable with him, she wondered, that she could feel so at ease?</p><p>They had reached the outskirts of Silver Springs. When he suddenly took an unexpected turn, she asked him where they were going.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere safe,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quiet at my house now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could go there.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He bypassed her neighborhood and continued down Main Street to the Silver Springs police station.</p><p>He drove around the corner to once again park in the back lot.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to check in,\u201d he said.</p><p>He got out of the car and came around to open the door. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do you have to check in?\u201d</p><p>He offered her his hand. \u201cEven though this is a temporary assignment, I\u2019m working for Chief Drummond, and I answer to him, so it\u2019s my job to keep him informed. I don\u2019t want to do that over the phone. I was also thinking that the chief could be a big help to you with your company problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted an investigator to check out the weasel. Drummond\u2019s got the resources, and I know he won\u2019t mind helping. You\u2019ll have to explain why you want the information, but he\u2019ll keep whatever you tell him confidential. I know how worried you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be wonderful if I could get something in my life straightened out. Thank you,\u201d she said, overcome with gratitude.</p><p>\u201cThe chief\u2019s helping me out, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve already called him several times and given him names to run for me. Hopefully, he\u2019ll have something by now.\u201d</p><p>She was smiling. \u201cYou must have really impressed him. I remember what Nate told you about the chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was tough . . . or difficult . . . and because he was retiring soon, he didn\u2019t care who he offended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is retiring,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how old he is or how long he\u2019s been at the job, but I\u2019ll tell you this. He hasn\u2019t lost his edge. After I met with him to get the badge and gun and we talked, I made a couple of calls of my own. I wanted to know that, if I had to, I could trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cHe\u2019s got an impressive record, and he\u2019s a good man. I respect him,\u201d he added, \u201cand I definitely trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll trust him, too.\u201d</p><p>They started to cross the parking lot, but Kate turned back. \u201cI\u2019ll need my briefcase. The chief might want to look at some of the papers in my mother\u2019s file . . . if he has time to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll make time,\u201d he assured her as he retrieved the briefcase.</p><p>After he\u2019d handed it to her, she whispered, \u201cAnd you\u2019re certain he\u2019ll keep this confidential?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed. I\u2019m just trying to protect my mother\u2019s reputation. I know you think I\u2019m being silly. My mother wouldn\u2019t care. I just don\u2019t want anyone to think less of her.\u201d They started toward the path again. \u201cI\u2019m glad the chief is helping you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to take some of the load off Nate\u2019s shoulders,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe\u2019d do whatever I asked him to do, but he\u2019s overworked as it is. He\u2019s trying to track down Jackman, who seems to have vanished from Las Vegas, and he\u2019s also keeping a tail on Roger and the two brothers. I doubt he\u2019s asking for any outside help. He\u2019s new to the Charleston department, and I know he wants to prove himself. The FBI is focusing on the bomber, and from what I understand, they\u2019ve got a couple of solid leads there. They\u2019re also searching for Jackman, and according to Nate, everyone\u2019s still tripping over everyone else. It would look real good on his record if Nate brought Jackman in.\u201d He glanced at the station and said, \u201cIt will be less chaotic here.\u201d</p><p>Chief Drummond must have spotted them from the window. The back door swung open and he beckoned to them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you listen to your messages?\u201d he asked Dylan in lieu of a greeting.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to do that,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cWhen you do, you\u2019ll hear me tell you to call me. We\u2019ve got a real interesting situation here,\u201d he announced.</p><p>He tipped his head to Kate and said, \u201cGood morning, Miss MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too, Chief Drummond, and please call me Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d</p><p>Southerners, Dylan was learning, were always polite, no matter what the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cYou have a situation?\u201d Dylan asked, trying to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cReal interesting,\u201d he said. He stepped out of the way so Kate and Dylan could go inside first, then made sure the door locked behind him.</p><p>\u201cA fella came in here about a half hour ago. Said his name was Carl Bertolli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl\u2019s here?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>The chief nodded. \u201cYou heard right. He\u2019s here.\u201d He led the way up the stairs to the first floor.</p><p>Kate waited impatiently for him to explain, but he didn\u2019t seem to be in any hurry as he proceeded down the back hall and pushed open the door to his office.</p><p>She hurried inside and turned to face him. \u201cWhy is he here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe said he drove all this way to pay you a call, Kate, but you weren\u2019t home, and so he decided to come on down here and turn himself in. Please, take a seat.\u201d</p><p>She dropped into one of the chairs facing his desk. \u201cBut what is Carl turning himself in for?\u201d She was thoroughly confused.</p><p>Drummond made himself comfortable in his old squeaky chair. He folded his hands on his desk and said, \u201cHe told me he was responsible.\u201d</p><p>Kate looked at Dylan, who had closed the door behind him and was leaning against it with his arms folded across his chest. He seemed to be taking the news in stride. She wasn\u2019t. She was flabbergasted.</p><p>She carefully placed her briefcase and her purse on the floor next to her chair, her mind racing with questions.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Carl saying he\u2019s responsible for?\u201d she asked the chief.</p><p>Drummond shifted his weight and tilted his chair back on two legs. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I thought I would give him a few more minutes to settle down, and then I\u2019d try once again to get an answer out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down?\u201d Dylan asked, not understanding.</p><p>Drummond nodded. \u201cI want to question him, I sure do, and just as soon as I can figure out a way to get him to stop crying, I\u2019ll start in.\u201d</p><p>Kate now understood why the chief looked so bewildered. He\u2019d obviously never encountered anyone quite like Carl.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s . . . dramatic,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d the chief agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd he can be temperamental. He\u2019s an artist,\u201d she hastened to add, so Drummond wouldn\u2019t think she was criticizing her friend. \u201cHe majored in drama at the university, and he\u2019s been in several local theater productions. And as I\u2019m sure you know, some creative artists are high-strung and . . . emotional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s emotional all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you suppose he knew you were looking for him?\u201d she asked Dylan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing his fianc\u00e9e,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe police questioned her about his whereabouts. She must have gotten word to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to take a shot at him?\u201d Drummond asked Dylan. \u201cHe should be calming down about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Drummond said.</p><p>Dylan was shaking his head, but she ignored him as she stood, picked up her things, straightened her skirt, and asked the chief to please take her to Carl.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t immediately hop to, she said, \u201cWhere is he waiting? In a conference room or a lounge? Chief, if I have to open every door on every floor to find him, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do have a nice conference room, and we\u2019ve got a lounge with a soda machine, but Carl isn\u2019t in either one of those rooms. He\u2019s in a cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou locked that dear man in a cell?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to get all worked up. \u201cNow hold on. I didn\u2019t want to put him there. It wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen whose idea was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe insisted that I lock him up.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t make any sense to her. \u201cBut why did you arrest him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t arrest him. He wanted me to lock him up, so I did. I figured a cell was as good a place as any for him to calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the cells?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please take me to him? He must be beside himself with worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not taking you to his cell, but here\u2019s what I will do. I\u2019ll bring Carl down to the first floor and put him in the interrogation room. You can talk to him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. You\u2019ve still got to get around him,\u201d he said, nodding at Dylan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you what he had to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could stand on the other side of the two-way mirror and watch and listen,\u201d Drummond suggested. \u201cWe just had it installed,\u201d he announced proudly.</p><p>The chief was clearly on her side, and that made her like him all the more.</p><p>\u201cKate has something she would like to talk to you about,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cNow would be the perfect time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that can wait until after I talk to Carl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on being here all day,\u201d the chief said.</p><p>She took a step toward Dylan. \u201cCarl and I are friends. He\u2019ll talk to me. He isn\u2019t going to hurt me, and if that\u2019s your reason for not wanting me to talk to him, then come in with me. Just don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cScare him.\u201d He looked exasperated. \u201cAnd don\u2019t intimidate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is this guy? Ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sensitive,\u201d she muttered. \u201cUnlike you.\u201d</p><p>Dylan had to move out of the way so the chief could open the door and leave. Kate seized the opportunity and slipped past Dylan on Drummond\u2019s heels.</p><p>Drummond pulled a huge round key ring with only three keys dangling from it off a wooden peg attached to the wall and headed toward the open staircase. \u201cThe interrogation room is the second door on the right. You two wait in there, and you better decide who\u2019s talking to him and who\u2019s listening, and then get on with it because, Dylan, you know you\u2019ve got to call this in to Charleston and let Detective Hallinger know Carl\u2019s here. And he\u2019ll have to let the FBI know, and that means that you\u2019ve got about an hour tops after you make that call before they all come tearing in here to snatch Carl away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to wait,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make the call after I find out what Carl knows. I also want to run a couple of things past you,\u201d he explained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAfter we talk to Carl,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>He finally relented but with conditions. \u201cIf I think he\u2019s playing you, you\u2019re out of there. Understand?\u201d Before she could agree or disagree he continued, \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t like the way he\u2019s talking to you, you\u2019re out of there.\u201d He let her go ahead of him, and when they reached the interrogation room, he added yet another condition. \u201cAnd if I think he\u2019s becoming belligerent or threatening . . .\u201d</p><p>She turned around. \u201cLet me guess. I\u2019m out of there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to know what I think?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to listen anyway. If he plays me, I\u2019ll know it and I\u2019ll tell him to knock it off. And if I don\u2019t like the way he\u2019s talking to me, I\u2019ll tell him to stop. Should he threaten me, I\u2019ll threaten back.\u201d</p><p>The interrogation room was tiny. There was a small oblong table and four chairs, two on either side. The two-way mirror was on the wall opposite the door. Dylan pulled out a chair for Kate, but he remained standing as they waited.</p><p>Carl turned out to be a surprise. Dylan had made a couple of snap judgments about the man, but as soon as Carl walked into the room, he knew he was wrong.</p> <p>Carl was extremely happy to see Kate, and before Dylan could stop him, he hugged her.</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re safe. This is all my fault, darling. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She quickly disengaged herself and made the introductions. Once the formality was dispensed with, she sat down, and Carl took the seat across from her. She put her hand out and he clasped it.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am tired. That\u2019s why I went away. I need to rest and rejuvenate, but I\u2019ve been so worried.\u201d</p><p>Kate was sympathetic. \u201cIt must have been upsetting for you to find out that the police were looking for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it was most distressing.\u201d His eyes welled up with tears. \u201cBut not nearly as upsetting as it was for Delilah. My fianc\u00e9e worries about me, you see,\u201d he added. \u201cI should call her. I\u2019m allowed one phone call, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Dylan pulled out a chair next to Kate and sat down. \u201cYou can make as many phone calls as you want. You\u2019re not under arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I a suspect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kate said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you have to tell me,\u201d Dylan explained.</p><p>\u201cI should be arrested. I\u2019m responsible for everything that\u2019s happened to Kate.\u201d He looked at her and summoned a weak smile. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d Oh my, she was sounding like Isabel again.</p> <p>\u201cA decaf latte would be lovely, but I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s a Starbucks close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry, not yet.\u201d</p><p>Dylan had had enough of the chitchat. \u201cTell me why you think you\u2019re responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was my idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your idea?\u201d His voice took on a sharp edge. He wanted some answers now.</p><p>\u201cIt was my idea to display Kate\u2019s products at the event I was hosting. All of Charleston\u2019s elite were going to be there. They wouldn\u2019t dare miss,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I thought it would be a wonderful opportunity to present her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresent her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaunch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not getting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough I know this is going to sound egotistical, it\u2019s a simple truth that if I endorse a product, it skyrockets.\u201d</p><p>He was right. It did sound egotistical.</p><p>\u201cThat makes you a very powerful man, doesn\u2019t it? You can make or break a career.\u201d</p><p>Carl shook his head. \u201cI have never tried to destroy anyone. It would be vulgar. If I don\u2019t approve of a product or a person, I keep silent.\u201d</p><p>So he only used his power for good? Did he think he was Superman? Dylan suppressed a laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you have to gain from this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatisfaction,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the warehouse? Why didn\u2019t you want Kate to know you owned it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only one of the owners,\u201d he corrected. \u201cBut I do have controlling interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d Dylan was tired of being accommodating. He was about to tell Kate to leave, but Carl surprised him by beating him to the punch.</p><p>\u201cKate, darling, would you please give us a moment alone?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to leave; she wanted to stay to make sure Dylan didn\u2019t tromp all over Carl\u2019s feelings, but she knew it would be rude to refuse. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Both men stood when she did, and Dylan opened the door for her. She gave him a warning look as she walked past and whispered, \u201cBe patient with him.\u201d</p><p>The audio control for the interrogation room was on the wall in front of him. Dylan decided to turn it off.</p><p>Carl had resumed his seat and arrogantly gestured for Dylan to do the same.</p><p>\u201cIf Kate knew what I was about to tell you, she would be embarrassed, and so I would appreciate your discretion. In return I shall be completely frank with you. Now then, I didn\u2019t want her to know that I owned the warehouse because I was going to offer it\u2014through a Realtor, of course\u2014at a substantially reduced price. I was trying to help Kate,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe is the dearest lady, and what I have seen happening to her this past year has been heart-wrenching. She was on the fast track, you know, and she had such grand plans. She was going to move her company to Boston. She has so many connections there. Within a year, I guarantee you, her company would have become a giant in the industry. Within five years, her products would have been sold all over the world. She could have accomplished unparalleled success.\u201d</p><p>He carefully adjusted the collar of his white shirt before continuing. \u201cShe won\u2019t move her company now. She\u2019s responsible, you see. Always responsible. Everyone comes before Kate. She will stay in Silver Springs because that\u2019s the responsible thing to do. For a long while she stayed for her mother, and now she\u2019ll stay for her sister. Isabel is the youngest, but of course you know that, don\u2019t you? Kate will stay here for at least another two, perhaps three, years.</p><p>\u201cI would love it if she stayed permanently and expanded her company from here. She could put Silver Springs on the map. It would probably take her longer to achieve international success from here, but with her drive and her determination I have no doubt she\u2019ll get it . . . if that is what she wants. She\u2019ll do magnificent things wherever she is, but this is where Kate belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did the other owners feel about reducing the price of the warehouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t ask them. I have controlling interest,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd the others will do whatever I want them to do. Together we own several blocks, and now that the renovation is under way and the rebirth has begun, they know they\u2019ll make a fortune. Silver Springs is a small community, and because it offers people a slower pace and a safer environment, it\u2019s becoming the place to live and play. We want to attract local business, so helping Kate by reducing the price will be seen as goodwill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need the names of the other owners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you reduced the price because it was a smart business move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but also because I knew Kate was in financial trouble.\u201d</p><p>Dylan sat back. \u201cOh? How did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Carl ran his fingers across the smooth surface of the table while he thought about the question. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how I knew,\u201d he admitted. \u201cSomeone told me. Yes,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cSomeone must have told me, and now you\u2019ll want to know who that person was, and for the life of me, I can\u2019t remember. There have been so many cocktail parties and dinners, and people tell me things\u2014in the strictest confidence. I hear things, often secondhand, and everyone knows how much I love Kate. I boast about her company all the time so I can get people talking and buzzing about her lovely candles and her body lotions. My Delilah adores them. Her signature perfumes are divine, and there\u2019s a new one coming in December that I believe is the most divine of all. It\u2019s called Sassy.\u201d He bit his lower lip to restrain his emotion.</p><p>Dylan had never questioned anyone quite like Carl before. He was prone to digression, but Dylan was determined to keep him on track. \u201cIf I were to ask you to write the names of the people who knew you owned that warehouse . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d Carl said. \u201cI\u2019ve been heavily promoting the area. I swear I\u2019ve told half of Charleston and Silver Springs and Savannah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Savannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have many friends,\u201d he explained. \u201cI spend a great deal of time there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met any MacKennas in Savannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I recall. I believe Kate and her sisters are the only MacKennas I know, but then I do meet so many people and I don\u2019t always catch the names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t explained what makes you responsible for the explosions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cI invited Kate to my estate, and I insisted she bring her products, and boom, she\u2019s nearly killed. And through a Realtor I encourage her to look at my warehouse, and boom, she\u2019s nearly killed again. I own both properties, you see. I am responsible. I just don\u2019t know how or why. I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll be able to figure that out.\u201d</p><p>The only thing Carl might be guilty of was telling everything he knew to anyone who would listen. Someone used him for information.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your financial situation?\u201d Dylan asked.</p><p>\u201cDismal at the moment. Abysmal. I\u2019ve completely over-extended myself. But it\u2019s temporary,\u201d he assured him. \u201cI\u2019m building a gallery on my property\u2014which will be magnificent when it\u2019s completed\u2014and I\u2019ve sunk the rest of my money into this latest project. But I have no doubt the return will be well worth the risk.\u201d</p><p>Dylan was a little surprised by Carl\u2019s candor. He was an unusual character and a complete contradiction. On the one hand he was pretentious and arrogant, and on the other he was straightforward and considerate. One thing was certain, he wore his heart on his sleeve for everyone to see, so there was little pretense when it came to his feelings.</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet Kate?\u201d Dylan asked. It seemed such a curious friendship to him.</p><p>Carl smiled. \u201cI met her at the hospital. It was several years back. She was there with her mother, and I was visiting my sister, Susannah. Kate was in high school, but she was already a beauty. And such a presence. Do you understand what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He understood perfectly.</p><p>\u201cShe could start pulses racing even back then. My sister actually introduced us. Kate was waiting for her mother to come out of X-ray, and my sister was waiting to be taken in, and they began to chat. They became dear friends in no time at all. Susannah was two years younger than Kate,\u201d he thought to add. \u201cKate told her about the candles she was making with all the strange scents, and she asked Susannah if she would give her opinion of some of them. My sister was thrilled. Kate made her feel very important.</p><p>\u201cSusannah was ill for quite some time\u2014in and out of the hospital so often she called it her home away from home.\u201d He paused with a melancholy smile at the memory. \u201cKate\u2019s mother went into remission, so Kate didn\u2019t need to come to the hospital anymore, but she never forgot Susannah. She visited her often, and even after she started college, Kate would make a point of seeing her when she came home for vacations. And no matter where she was, every week, she would send a little something to Susannah. A candle, a special lotion, a flower . . . a gift to tell her she was thinking about her. Each time Kate started working on a new product, she would call to get her input. I know Kate didn\u2019t really need Susannah\u2019s opinion, but she asked for it just the same. It gave Susannah something to look forward to, especially in her last days when she was so weak.\u201d Carl\u2019s voice cracked when he said, \u201cWe lost Susannah in September. But Kate, my dear, dear Kate, still hasn\u2019t forgotten her. She told me she wanted to do something special in her memory, and so she\u2019s developed a special perfume that will be named after my sister. Susannah was her given name, but we called her Sassy.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>Dylan wasn\u2019t about to let Kate walk into the Smith and Wesson building to sign any papers until he was absolutely certain she would be safe. Figuring out all the details and coordinating security measures with Nate and the Charleston PD, the FBI, and the Savannah PD would not only take time but would also be a logistical nightmare, and that meant that the three o\u2019clock meeting this afternoon would definitely have to be rescheduled.</p><p>One solution would be for the attorney to bring the papers to Kate. The Silver Springs police station would have been a good location, but anywhere away from the heart of Savannah and the MacKenna brothers would have been acceptable.</p><p>Unfortunately, the location for the meeting couldn\u2019t be moved. When Dylan got Anderson on the phone and suggested other arrangements, the attorney was most apologetic as he explained that a change of venue wouldn\u2019t be possible.</p><p>\u201cI must follow Compton MacKenna\u2019s instructions. He insisted that the meeting take place at Smith and Wesson. He liked to direct every facet of his affairs. He signed his new will in the conference room on the second floor, and that is where he wanted the transfer of his estate to take place. He even went so far as to assign seating. Kate must first listen to his advisors and his accountants as they explain how Compton accumulated his fortune, and when they are finished, she can sign the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a mandatory condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was his reason for setting it up this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were several reasons,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cHe expected Kate to follow in his footsteps, and he therefore believed that his advisors would guide her in future decisions that would increase his fortune. It is not a condition of the will, however, that Kate continue to employ them, and as her attorney I will strongly recommend that she fire the lot.\u201d</p><p>Before Dylan could ask why, Anderson continued. \u201cI also believe Compton wanted to impress her, to brag, if you will. In his mind Kate was a prodigy, his prodigy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe won\u2019t like hearing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter having spent a very brief time with her, I have already judged her to be nothing like Compton . . . or his advisors,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think someone who was going to hand over that much money to one person would want to get to know her,\u201d Dylan surmised.</p><p>\u201cI mentioned that very thing to him a few months ago, but he became indignant at the suggestion. He felt his investigation told him everything he needed to know about Kate and her sisters. He was quite the recluse at times\u2014I suppose one would call him eccentric. He had difficulty establishing any sort of personal relationship. I think, as long as he kept his transactions on a strictly business level, he could control them. I was his attorney for the last seven years and found him to be extraordinarily inflexible. He preferred to work through his financial associates.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix in all,\u201d he replied. \u201cFour advisors and two accountants. I\u2019ve already given their names to Detective Hallinger.\u201d</p><p>Dylan was walking back and forth in the hall of the police station while he talked to Anderson on his cell phone. The door to the lounge was open. The tiny room was furnished with a synthetic leather sofa and a soda machine. Dylan went in and dipped into his pocket for some change as he continued his conversation. He asked the attorney to e-mail him the names and phone numbers so he could do a little checking on them, too. Just to be on the safe side. Who knew, maybe he\u2019d find out something Nate had missed. Remote possibility . . . but still . . .</p><p>\u201cDid Compton also want to control the time for the meeting from his grave, or can that be rescheduled?\u201d he asked and then quickly answered his own question. \u201cIt has to be rescheduled. There\u2019s just no way it can take place this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cCompton was more flexible about the time. He realized people do get sick and there are emergencies. I believe the only reason he wanted the meeting scheduled two days after his death was to make certain his advisors and accountants would be in Savannah in time for his funeral. It was his way of making sure someone besides me showed up. What about tomorrow evening at seven? Would that be convenient for Kate?\u201d Anderson asked. \u201cOr the day after that? The others are coming in from out of town. They\u2019ll stay in Savannah for as long as necessary. But, you know, the sooner those papers are signed, the better for everyone\u2019s peace of mind.\u201d</p> <p>And better for her chances of survival, Dylan thought. \u201cHow much notice do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you can give me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about notifying the MacKennas? You said they had to be invited? Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I know the time, I\u2019ll call them, though I doubt any of them will show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did Compton want them there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say, but I think it was out of spite. Perhaps he wanted to rub their noses in what they had lost.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s try for tomorrow at seven, and if I can\u2019t make it happen, I\u2019ll call you to reschedule.\u201d</p><p>Dylan realized he was making decisions without Kate\u2019s input. He would have to run his plans by her and get her approval.</p><p>He disconnected the call and then went through the rest of his voice messages. Nate had called four times trying to find him. With each message he became angrier. Dylan understood why. Nate felt responsible for Kate\u2019s well-being, and not knowing where she was would naturally infuriate him. Dylan didn\u2019t particularly care how angry he was. The fewer people who knew her whereabouts, the better.</p><p>He knew he couldn\u2019t avoid Nate much longer. He got two sodas out of the machine, popped the tab of one, and took a drink. And then he called Nate.</p><p>And got his voice mail. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m calling you back. So call me on my cell phone.\u201d</p><p>That ought to piss him off, Dylan thought.</p><p>Kate was in the chief\u2019s office. Dylan decided she had had enough time to talk to Drummond about the weasel problem, and went downstairs to join them.</p><p>She was stuffing papers into her briefcase when he walked in and handed her the other can of soda. Drummond was making notes on his legal pad.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right on this,\u201d he promised. He looked at Dylan and said, \u201cKate wants to stay the night at home. I think we could make that happen. Don\u2019t you? I could get some men to sweep the house and get a couple more to patrol the grounds. She lives in a cul-de-sac, and that will make the job easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you put him up to this?\u201d Dylan asked Kate accusingly.</p><p>\u201cI might have mentioned that I would like to be able to sleep in my own bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a bit more than mention it to me,\u201d the chief countered. \u201cYou out and out begged me to get Dylan to agree.\u201d</p><p>She closed her briefcase and placed it on the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t beg,\u201d she said. Turning to Dylan, she asked, \u201cDid you know that Chief Drummond was a detective in Los Angeles? He retired after twenty years of service and moved here because he got tired of all the traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s trying to convince you that I\u2019m qualified for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already talked, Kate,\u201d Dylan answered. \u201cHe knows all about my background, and I know a considerable amount about his. I think the chief knows how much I respect his experience.\u201d</p><p>Kate stood. \u201cThen I can go home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit right back down,\u201d the chief ordered. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere until your house has been swept. And the street,\u201d he thought to add. \u201cIs the attorney going to bring the papers here for Kate to sign?\u201d</p><p>Dylan had previously talked to Drummond about the possibility. \u201cNo. It was nonnegotiable. If Kate agrees, we\u2019ll try for seven o\u2019clock tomorrow evening. That should give us enough time to get organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Savannah?\u201d the chief asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. You\u2019re going to have everyone but me taking charge then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSavannah\u2019s in another state,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cThe FBI isn\u2019t going to be left out. This really should be their case. And then you\u2019ve got Charleston PD wanting to stay in charge. The first explosion did take place in their jurisdiction, and now you also have to include Savannah PD, especially if you think something might happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Savannah police? Why would you want to involve them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ll be in their yard,\u201d the chief said. He looked at Dylan and added, \u201cThink how they\u2019re gonna feel if there\u2019s gunfire or something gets blown up and they\u2019re not consulted.\u201d</p><p>Dylan nodded. \u201cWe\u2019d never hear the end of it.\u201d</p><p>They were joking . . . weren\u2019t they? If all those people showed up, there wouldn\u2019t be enough room inside the Smith and Wesson building.</p><p>And then it hit her. If there was gunfire or a bomb\u2014which did seem to be the favored weapon of destruction\u2014some of those people could die.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to go to Savannah with me. I\u2019ll go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you handle this,\u201d the chief said to Dylan as he pushed his chair back. \u201cI\u2019ve got things to do.\u201d</p><p>After Drummond left, Dylan leaned against the desk waiting for Kate to explain.</p><p>She was waiting for him to argue with her. When he remained silent, she demanded, \u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she was frowning up at him.</p><p>What had set her off? \u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to go alone, you can go alone.\u201d</p><p>She immediately became suspicious. This was too easy. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t your car blown up?\u201d</p><p>How could she have forgotten that? \u201cI won\u2019t drive my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rent a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, what\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>You, you big dummy. You\u2019re what this is about. You could get killed. Oh, God, she couldn\u2019t even think about that. And what about all the other detectives and policemen? All of them could die in one big boom. She shook her head, letting him know she wasn\u2019t willing to explain.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take the hint. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She gave in. \u201cIt just struck me. People could die protecting me . . .\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in her eyes. Dylan must have seen them because he pulled her to her feet and hugged her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re just a little overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I am,\u201d she said. She waited for him to give her a few words of comfort, to say something, anything, that would make her feel better.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem inclined to do more than hold her, and after a moment she realized that was all she really needed.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>Kate lifted her head from Dylan\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat about Carl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>She put some space between them. \u201cAre you convinced that he had nothing to do with any of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he can go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. He\u2019s going to have to convince some other people first.\u201d</p><p>Two FBI agents and another detective from Charleston PD who were helping Nate out arrived at the police station an hour later and took turns questioning Carl. After they had finished with him, they let him go home. He kissed Kate on the cheek, squeezed her hand, and whispered, \u201cBe brave, darling.\u201d</p><p>They questioned her next. She was weary of having to go through every little detail again, starting with that first explosion, but she cooperated and answered every question as thoroughly as she could. By the time they ran out of questions, she had run out of patience.</p><p>Drummond came to get her. \u201cCome on, Kate. It\u2019s time to go home. Your house has been searched from top to bottom, and is clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dylan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you in back.\u201d</p><p>She collected her purse and briefcase from his office and followed him to the back door.</p><p>He put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get through this just fine,\u201d he said. If she wasn\u2019t sure of his good intentions, she might think he was chastising her with his abrupt order.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be over later with dinner,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to all that trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I looked inside your refrigerator. I\u2019ll bring something,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>She was glad hadn\u2019t protested when she arrived home and looked in the refrigerator. There really wasn\u2019t anything there she wanted to eat. Her stomach was grumbling. Neither she nor Dylan had eaten anything since breakfast, and it was already after six.</p><p>\u201cTime flies even when you\u2019re not having fun,\u201d she remarked as she walked into the front hall.</p><p>Dylan followed her up the stairs carrying their bags.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not having fun? I guess we\u2019ll have to do something about that.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask her if she wanted him to share her bed. He put his bag in the guest room and dropped her bag on her bed.</p><p>She was not going to ask him to sleep with her. Absolutely not. She went into the bathroom, locked the door, and took a long shower, hoping that would revive her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help much. She put on her favorite pair of old jeans and a T-shirt and actually did feel a little better then. She combed her hair and went downstairs.</p><p>Dylan was in the backyard talking to a police officer. She watched him from the kitchen window while she chewed on a wilted celery stick. He looked tired, she thought. And wonderful. He certainly seemed to be coping better than she was. There were moments when she felt she was going to fall apart.</p><p>Not wanting him to catch her staring at him, she forced herself to turn away. She listened to the messages on her home phone. Most of them were for Isabel, and none of them were important.</p><p>She was feeling out of sorts and restless. She got a bag of potato chips out of the pantry and put it back unopened.</p><p>She knew what was wrong with her. Dylan. How long was it going to take her to stop loving him, she wondered. Was it even possible, or was she doomed to live in misery the rest of her life? There was no one to blame but herself for her unhappiness. She had known from the very beginning what she was getting into with him\u2014he loved them and he left them. He didn\u2019t make any excuses about the way he lived. He was what he was.</p><p>And she was what she was\u2014a complete idiot because she had fallen in love with him.</p><p>Definitely melancholy tonight, she decided. Stress was putting her on edge. That\u2019s what it was, all right. Stress. And feeling completely helpless.</p><p>The doorbell rang, and she was forced to stop feeling sorry for herself. She assumed it was Drummond with dinner, and she was suddenly ravenous. It wasn\u2019t Drummond, though. It was Nate, and when she opened the door for him, he looked astonished to see her.</p><p>He was quick to recover. \u201cWhat are you doing opening this door?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>His glare made her flinch. \u201cYou rang the doorbell. Answering it seemed the proper thing to do. Please, come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you alone in here?\u201d he demanded as he stormed past her. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with you? Don\u2019t you know someone\u2019s trying to kill you? Or don\u2019t you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, and yes, I care,\u201d she said softly. \u201cPlease stop shouting at me. My ears are ringing.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cI\u2019ve got to yell at someone. Where\u2019s Dylan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the backyard. There are deputies in the front and the back,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it was all right for me to open the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m angry,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She chased him to the kitchen. \u201cThen why are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know where the hell you were last night. Not good,\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou two just . . . vanished. What if I had vital information? What then? Dylan wasn\u2019t answering his cell phone, and you weren\u2019t answering yours . . . what the hell\u2019s the matter with him? He knows better. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>Nate was on a rampage. \u201cI just told you,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cTell me again,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cIn the backyard,\u201d she said. \u201cHave at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare open that front door again. Understand me?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for an answer but tore the kitchen door open and went outside. The door slammed shut behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s just lost his dinner invitation, she thought. How dare he shout at her. She wasn\u2019t a child he could scold.</p><p>But he was right, she reluctantly admitted. They should have let him know where they were going. It wasn\u2019t deliberate; they weren\u2019t trying to hide from him. They hadn\u2019t been sure where they would spend the night, and once they had checked into the hotel, one thing led to another, and they had become occupied.</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s a great excuse. Sorry we didn\u2019t call. We were too busy having sex. Nate would understand. Sure he would.</p><p>The chief arrived a few minutes later with enough food to feed half the town.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on out there?\u201d he asked as he set the bags on the kitchen counter and looked out the window. \u201cLooks like Hallinger is giving Dylan hell.\u201d</p><p>Kate quickly explained.</p><p>The chief glanced out the window again. \u201cDylan doesn\u2019t seem contrite. Fact is, he\u2019s giving it back.\u201d With a shrug he added, \u201cThey\u2019ll work it out. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>The chief was right; they did work it out. Nate didn\u2019t ask if he could stay for dinner. He grabbed a plate and helped himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get some men here in an hour and let you off the hook, chief,\u201d he offered.</p> <p>\u201cNo reason to do that,\u201d Drummond replied. \u201cWe\u2019re all set. You\u2019ve got enough going on trying to get everyone in place for tomorrow\u2019s meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a for-sure thing?\u201d Nate asked. \u201cShe signs the papers tomorrow? No more changes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven o\u2019clock tomorrow night unless you change the plan,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cWe just went over this in the backyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making sure. No one\u2019s going to disappear on me again. Got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to let that go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you need\u2014\u201d Nate began.</p> <p>Drummond put his hand up to stop him. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Kate needs all the help she can get, so stop bickering and get with the program.\u201d</p><p>Nate nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>The three men went over strategy for the next day while they ate.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find out about the video?\u201d Dylan asked Nate. \u201cAny idea who taped it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We know that it and the packet of photos were delivered by messenger to Anderson Smith\u2019s office. He claims no one there even knew a video existed until it and Compton MacKenna\u2019s instructions showed up on his desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone knew about it,\u201d Dylan insisted. \u201cWhen Compton was talking into the camera, he would glance beyond the lens every so often. Obviously, someone else was in that room. What about servants, staff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no one we can find who knew anything about it.\u201d</p><p>Dylan glanced over at Kate, whose eyes were half closed.</p> <p>\u201cKate, why don\u2019t you go upstairs to bed,\u201d he suggested. \u201cWe\u2019re almost finished here.\u201d</p><p>She was happy to oblige. It had been a very long day. She could hear the men talking as she put on her pajamas, and a few minutes later she heard Nate and Drummond leaving.</p><p>She was tired, but she decided to call Isabel to check on her before going to bed. Her sister surprised her by answering. Kate said hello and didn\u2019t get another word in for about fifteen minutes. Isabel must have assumed that the reading of the will had turned out to be a big nothing because she didn\u2019t ask Kate about it. Her social life seemed to be the only thing she was interested in talking about, and Kate had to remind her she was there to study. She was relieved, however, that Isabel was happy . . . and safe.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Reece Crowell?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cHe should still be in Europe, but don\u2019t worry. If he comes back and starts bothering me again, I can handle him,\u201d Isabel replied, and then she moved on to more immediate topics.</p><p>While Kate was listening to Isabel\u2019s description of the young man who sat next to her in her sociology class, the call was interrupted. Thinking it could be important news, Kate cut into Isabel\u2019s chatter.</p><p>\u201cIsabel,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve got another call. I have to hang up now. You be very careful, okay?\u201d</p><p>She was surprised by the voice she heard when she switched over.</p><p>\u201cKate, this is Vanessa MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>Kate was slow to respond, unsure of how she should react. After an awkward pause, she said, \u201cVanessa, hello, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa was a bit stiff as she began the conversation, but she quickly loosened up and actually became quite gracious.</p><p>\u201cAnderson called and told me how much you loved having those photos of your father,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me if I wouldn\u2019t mind looking around Compton\u2019s house\u2014or rather my house now\u2014and see if there might be others. The attic is packed full of boxes, and I decided I might as well get started clearing things out. As luck would have it, I found a box full of things I believe belonged to your father. There are photos but also trophies and school papers and a couple of report cards. I\u2019ll pack it all up and send it to you, or I could drop it off at Anderson\u2019s office if you\u2019d prefer. And I\u2019ll keep looking for more,\u201d she promised. \u201cI\u2019m staying at the house now because Bryce went back into the hospital last night, and this will make it a shorter commute to see him. You know, you could stop by and see the old place . . . if you\u2019re interested. I\u2019d love to show you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to see it someday,\u201d she responded.</p><p>\u201cJust let me know when it\u2019s convenient. Perhaps next week or the week after? I\u2019d like to get to know you, Kate. You seem so . . . different from Bryce and his brothers, refreshingly different.\u201d</p><p>Kate felt a pang of guilt after the conversation ended and she\u2019d hung up the phone. She hadn\u2019t asked Vanessa how serious Bryce\u2019s condition was, but then she realized an expression of sympathy or concern would have been hypocritical.</p><p>Dylan walked into her bedroom as she sat cross-legged on her bed with the phone still in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI just received a call from Vanessa MacKenna,\u201d she announced. \u201cShe invited me to come to Compton\u2019s house. She said she has more things that belonged to my father.\u201d</p><p>Dylan stopped at the foot of the bed and scowled. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere near that house or any of the Savannah MacKennas until we\u2019ve caught whoever is out to kill you,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she assured him. She wasn\u2019t in the mood for a lecture now. She\u2019d had enough pressure in one day to last a lifetime, and so she moved away from the subjects of bombs and killers and money.</p><p>\u201cI also talked to Isabel,\u201d she said. \u201cShe seems happy. I didn\u2019t tell her you were here. I didn\u2019t want her to know . . . you know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cI told her everything was fine, and if she knew you were here, she\u2019d start asking questions. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m taking my clothes off, and then I\u2019m going to get in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shower in the guest bath . . .\u201d</p><p>She stopped talking when he shut her bathroom door. A second later she heard the shower.</p><p>She could be more forceful and send him to the guest room to sleep, but she didn\u2019t want to, and that was the problem. In her heart she knew she was going to attack him as soon as he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI need help,\u201d she muttered. She was thoroughly disgusted with herself. She pulled the covers back and stretched out on the bed. This is all Jordan\u2019s fault, she decided. Jordan sent Dylan, and she knew . . . oh, yes, she knew what would happen.</p><p>Kate rolled onto her side and picked up the phone. Jordan couldn\u2019t avoid her forever, and she decided she would leave a message that would guarantee she\u2019d call back.</p><p>Voice mail picked up. Kate waited for the beep and then she said, \u201cJust thought you should know I\u2014\u201d She suddenly stopped. What if someone else listened to the message and heard her say she\u2019d slept with Dylan? \u201cNever mind,\u201d she said.</p><p>She was hanging up the phone when she heard someone say, \u201cShe should know what?\u201d</p><p>It was a man\u2019s voice. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael Buchanan. Is this Kate?\u201d</p><p>Thank God she\u2019d come to her senses. \u201cWhat are you doing in Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on leave. I got in early, and I\u2019m staying with Jordan until next weekend. Then I\u2019ll move over to Nathan\u2019s Bay. Mom and Dad will be home by then.\u201d</p><p>Michael had graduated from Annapolis and was training to become a Navy SEAL. He was a real daredevil, and of all the Buchanan brothers he was the most competitive.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you coming back to Boston?\u201d he asked. \u201cI want a rematch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019ll only lose again.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was just like Dylan\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know Dylan\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Jordan told me he\u2019s helping you with a little problem.\u201d</p><p>A little problem? \u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>They talked for another minute. She promised to tell Dylan that Michael was home, and Michael promised to make Jordan call her back.</p><p>She\u2019d just hung up the phone when Dylan came out of the bathroom. He\u2019d put on his khaki shorts and was going downstairs to check on the police officers to make sure they were where they were supposed to be. Kate thought he was being a little obsessive-compulsive.</p><p>He didn\u2019t come back upstairs for a long time. Kate tried to go to sleep, but her mind wouldn\u2019t rest. She kept thinking about the \u201clittle\u201d problem of figuring out who was trying to kill her. It had to be one of the MacKennas, but which one? Maybe all of them. Wouldn\u2019t that be something? Vanessa could be in on it, too. At this point anything was possible.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>Kate had been tossing and turning for what seemed like hours when Dylan finally came to bed. It was well after midnight.</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask her if he could sleep with her. He simply took off his shorts and slid in next to her. He was awfully sure of himself, she thought, and she was about to tell him so when he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou awake, Pickle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too nervous about tomorrow to go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. He lifted her hair off the back of her neck and began to nibble on her soft skin.</p><p>Shivers coursed down her legs, and she moved restlessly against him. \u201cWhy is it good?\u201d she asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good because I won\u2019t have to wake you up to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>He might have said something more to her; she couldn\u2019t remember. The way he was touching her demanded her full attention, and forming a coherent thought simply became impossible.</p><p>Their lovemaking was different tonight, more passionate, far more intense. And when at last they had both found fulfillment, he continued to hold her in his arms and stroke her back. His chin rested on top of her head, and every once in a while he would kiss her.</p><p>As soon as the haze of passion lifted, she was miserable. She wanted to tell him how she felt, but she couldn\u2019t. Why? Because the quickest way to get him to disappear would be to admit that she wanted to be with him forever.</p><p>She did want that impossible dream with all her heart. How would he respond if she told him she wanted him forever? He\u2019d probably pass out on her. She was actually able to summon up a smile as she thought about how crazy those three little words would make him.</p><p>Good thing she knew CPR.</p><p>Dylan turned over on his back and stared at the ceiling. \u201cKate, how come you want to get a loan? You did say that was what you were going to do. Were you joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was serious. I need a loan to pay off a loan. It\u2019s a temporary solution that will buy me some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know that as soon as you sign those papers tomorrow, you\u2019re going to be a millionaire, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t be a millionaire for long. When I go to the bank and fill out the application, I\u2019ll have to list the money as an asset . . . a temporary asset,\u201d she stressed.</p><p>He yawned. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna think you\u2019re nuts.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled up against him and whispered, \u201cMaybe I am.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think she was too worried about the reputation of her mental state because she fell asleep less than a minute later. Dylan pulled the sheet up over them and tried to clear his mind so he could sleep. That proved to be impossible. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about tomorrow and all the things that could go wrong.</p><p>Kate slept hard that night, but she didn\u2019t feel rested when she got out of bed the following morning. She so dreaded the day ahead of her. She hoped to heaven none of the MacKennas would come to the meeting. Bryce was probably still in the hospital, and she felt a little ashamed hoping he hadn\u2019t been released yet. Roger and Ewan were the biggest worries. She didn\u2019t think she had the stamina to put up with their vulgarity again, and if they began to slander her mother, she didn\u2019t know what she would do.</p><p>Dylan was downstairs in the kitchen talking to someone. She thought she heard Chief Drummond\u2019s voice, but she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Nine o\u2019clock. She couldn\u2019t believe the time. She\u2019d never slept this late before. No reason to rush, she decided. The meeting at Anderson\u2019s office wasn\u2019t until seven that evening, and she assumed that she and Dylan wouldn\u2019t leave Silver Springs until the middle of the afternoon.</p><p>Anderson wouldn\u2019t be back from the funeral until at least five, maybe later. For some unknown reason, Compton MacKenna had insisted that his funeral begin at precisely two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. He\u2019d written out a schedule of \u201cevents\u201d and had even included the names of the mourners he wanted to speak on his behalf. Kate wondered if Compton had also written the eulogy.</p><p>She thought about that crazy old man while she showered and dressed for the trip. Just in case they had to stay the night in Savannah, she packed her overnighter again.</p><p>She carried the bag downstairs, left it in the foyer, and went into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dylan was drying his hands. He draped the towel on his shoulder as he walked toward her. He kissed her with a good deal of gusto, and when he moved back, he was pleased with her reaction. She was actually blushing.</p><p>He pulled a chair out from the table, kissed her again but so quickly this time she wasn\u2019t at all ready, and then gently forced her to sit.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want for breakfast?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ll fix it for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToast would be nice. Who were you talking to? I thought I heard Chief Drummond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did hear him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just left. White or wheat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make my own breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting wheat.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t ask her if she wanted orange juice. He poured a glass and put it on the table in front of her.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you finish breakfast, we need to get on the road.\u201d</p><p>He was leaning against the counter facing her, one ankle crossed over the other, looking absolutely gorgeous, and she was suddenly feeling overwhelmed by him.</p><p>The toast popped up. \u201cHere we go.\u201d</p><p>He put the dry toast on a plate and handed it to her. Cooking obviously wasn\u2019t one of his talents. She picked up a slice and tore a corner off.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you in such a rush?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe have plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a change in plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat change in what plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a plan, and we changed it,\u201d he explained. \u201cCome on, Kate. Eat your breakfast. Did you pack a bag for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s in the foyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put it in the car,\u201d he said, and as he walked out of the kitchen, he ordered, \u201ceat.\u201d</p> <p>The second he was out of sight, she dumped the toast in the disposal, gulped the orange juice, and rinsed the plate and the glass.</p><p>The kitchen sink looked brand-new. Dylan had obviously scrubbed it. He may not be much of a chef, but he certainly knew how to clean. He\u2019d be a good man to have around . . . for all sorts of reasons.</p><p>She ran upstairs to get her purse and laptop. She hadn\u2019t had a chance to answer her e-mails in heaven knew how long, and she hoped there would be time this afternoon or this evening after the meeting. She slipped the laptop behind the cushioned divider in her briefcase and went back downstairs.</p><p>Chief Drummond was getting into his car. He had parked his Jeep behind Dylan\u2019s rental in the drive.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me he was waiting. I would have hurried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to hurry,\u201d Dylan responded.</p><p>\u201cThat was different.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to try to figure out what she meant. \u201cThe chief wanted to go over the car just to make sure there weren\u2019t any surprises waiting for us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean like a bomb?\u201d she asked but didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cDid he find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he coming with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut he wrote out instructions. We\u2019re going to be taking some roads that aren\u2019t on any map.\u201d</p><p>Kate had grown up in Silver Springs and thought she knew the area better than anyone, and she\u2019d driven to Savannah too many times to count, but several of the back roads Dylan took she had to admit she\u2019d never seen before. Some of them weren\u2019t roads at all. They were gravel ruts.</p><p>The drive was scenic, and every now and then Dylan would point out something he found fascinating. He loved the weeping willows and the wildflowers growing in clusters in untended fields. He didn\u2019t know what any of them were called and was impressed that she did.</p><p>\u201cHow could you ever want to leave this?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be leaving for a long time . . . if ever. I think I\u2019m meant to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do it. I could live here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to get her hopes up that he might stay in her life, and so she tried to think of all the reasons he should leave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d miss Boston. There\u2019s such energy there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I would miss Boston,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready for a change. Besides, Charleston is just down the road from Silver Springs, and it has all the big-city advantages and problems. You want energy, drive there. I certainly wouldn\u2019t miss the traffic,\u201d he added. \u201cI wonder what the crime rate is in Silver Springs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore or after I moved back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we made it,\u201d he said. \u201cRead the sign. We\u2019re officially in Savannah.\u201d</p><p>Kate assumed they were going to meet at one of the Savannah precincts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit in a police station until the meeting,\u201d she said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we go on to Anderson\u2019s office? I could get some work done while I wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d he said.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later he was pulling up in front of Smith and Wesson. \u201cYou were planning on driving here anyway, weren\u2019t you? Does Nate know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can just walk in?\u201d</p><p>As she asked the question, two police officers exited the building and waited for Dylan and Kate to get out of the car. Yet another officer came from across the street. \u201cYou can leave the car here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure no one touches it.\u201d</p><p>Dylan turned the motor off but left the keys in the ignition. He followed Kate inside, and once the door was shut behind him, he said, \u201cWhich one of you checked the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bomb squad just left. The place is clean,\u201d one of the officers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a man watching the door and a couple of security guards, one inside and one out back. The two of us are assigned to you. Where do you want us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here in the entry is good. Who\u2019s in the building now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost everyone is either at a funeral or on vacation. The receptionist\u2019s here, and so is Smith\u2019s assistant, a guy named Terrance. He\u2019s upstairs in Smith\u2019s office. You want him out, we\u2019ll get him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can stay.\u201d</p><p>Terrance must have heard all the commotion. He came rushing downstairs. \u201cMiss MacKenna, I\u2019m afraid Mr. Smith isn\u2019t here just yet. The funeral\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cWe\u2019re quite early. I was wondering if I might have a desk to use. I\u2019d like to do some work until Anderson returns.\u201d</p><p>He seemed nervous, and smiling at him didn\u2019t put him at ease. She finally figured out why he was so jumpy. Dylan was making him apprehensive. Terrance was watching him out of the corner of his eye, acting like he expected Dylan to grab him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see the conference room,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>Terrance led the way up the stairs and down a long hallway on the right. The conference room was one door down from Anderson\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cI was just putting name cards in front of each chair,\u201d Terrance said.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I worked in here?\u201d Kate asked. \u201cIf I could plug in my computer . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He pulled the chair out at the head of the table and showed her where the outlet was located.</p><p>Dylan left the door open and continued down to the end of the hallway. To the left was an alcove with a fire door wired to the alarm. A small red light was blinking, indicating the system was on. A wide metal bar crossed the door in the center. Dylan assumed that on the other side of the door were fire escape stairs leading to the ground.</p><p>The carpeted back staircase was to his right. He descended a flight to the first floor where a guard was stationed in front of the exit that led to the parking lot. Dylan showed him his identification and talked to him a few minutes before going back up.</p><p>Satisfied with security, he returned to Kate, who had her laptop set up on the conference room table and was answering e-mail. When they heard someone shouting Dylan\u2019s name, his hand immediately went to his gun, and he took a protective step toward her.</p><p>Dylan recognized the voice when his name was shouted again, and he relaxed. A couple of seconds later Nate came running into the room. His face was flushed and he was smiling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he announced jubilantly.</p><p>\u201cOver?\u201d Kate asked. \u201cReally over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You two can start breathing easy again and get on with your lives. The case is closed,\u201d he added. \u201cOr will be,\u201d he qualified. \u201cAs soon as all the paperwork is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Dylan demanded.</p><p>Nate was enjoying the moment. His eyes lit up with excitement. \u201cRoger MacKenna. Just as I thought. The bastard was behind it all. After seeing that video, I was sure he was the number one suspect. I had requested a search warrant, but now that\u2019s not necessary. We have all the proof we need. Roger was quite the busy little planner. He had help, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cAnd Jackman had all the connections to get the job done. The loan shark didn\u2019t really have a choice. He had to help Roger. It was the only way he would ever see the money Roger owed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you ever get Roger to confess?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem the type to cooperate with the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t confess. He killed himself.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected to hear that. Stunned, she said, \u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilled himself,\u201d he repeated. He looked at Dylan as he continued. \u201cWe had a tail on him, but our guy didn\u2019t hear the gunshot. Roger lived in a high-rise,\u201d he explained. \u201cOur detective was in a parked car out front, and he\u2019d watched him go inside. He told me he heard about it on the scanner. A woman called, said she heard a gunshot. He went inside then and found Roger on the floor. One head shot,\u201d he added. \u201cHe also found incriminating evidence and lots of it. He didn\u2019t touch anything, of course. He said it was all sitting out on the table in plain sight. I think Roger wanted the police to know that Jackman was involved. I can\u2019t wait to get over there and have a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Crime Scene there yet?\u201d Dylan asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on their way. Do you want to meet me over there? His apartment is only about a mile from here. Or I could drop you off. I\u2019ve got to check in with Savannah PD first. Then I\u2019ll head over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I want to see it, and I don\u2019t want anything moved until I get there. Make that happen.\u201d</p><p>Nate smiled. \u201cFBI said the same thing. CSU will have first priority. The sooner we get over there, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Where did Roger get the gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a gun when he came to the reading of the will,\u201d Kate said. \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police wouldn\u2019t have given it back to him,\u201d Nate said. \u201cRoger had just made bail. He was carrying a concealed weapon without a permit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell the police where he got that gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe said Ewan gave it to him and that Ewan had bought it on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ewan now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s voluntarily turning himself in. He\u2019s on his way to the police station, no doubt with an attorney ready to bail him out. That\u2019s why I\u2019m headed there now. He\u2019ll find out about Roger when he gets there. I checked on Bryce\u2019s whereabouts, too. He\u2019ll never hear about Roger. He\u2019s slipping in and out of consciousness. His wife is by his side and will stay until the bitter end, which is going to be real soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jackman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI in Las Vegas picked him up for questioning. He\u2019s their problem now.\u201d Nate started toward the door as he said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really over, isn\u2019t it? I still can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Kate said. Dylan was nodding, but she didn\u2019t think he was paying attention. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I want those policemen to stay until you\u2019ve signed those papers.\u201d</p><p>He walked downstairs with Nate, and together they checked in with the officers on duty, who assured them they would stay as long as Kate was in the building.</p><p>When Dylan came back into the conference room, she said, \u201cI thought you wanted to look at the evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, and shut the door behind you. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>Kate hadn\u2019t quite absorbed the news yet. The man who tried to kill her was dead, and his accomplice was in custody. And here she sat diligently answering her e-mail as though nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.</p><p>She would probably fall apart tonight when she was all alone. Dylan could very well be on his way back to Boston by then. She felt an instant rush of panic and became angry with herself. Why should she be upset? She\u2019d always known he was going to leave. No surprise there. And she would get through it just like everything else in her life that had been painful.</p><p>But Dylan wouldn\u2019t go until tomorrow, she decided. He\u2019d drive her back to Silver Springs, spend the night with her, and early the next morning while she was sound asleep, he\u2019d leave.</p><p>She knew he cared about her. It had taken a considerable amount of coaxing just to get him to leave her alone to work on her computer while he went to the crime scene with Nate. He\u2019d even suggested she go with him.</p><p>She realized she wasn\u2019t going to get any work done if she continued to think about Dylan. He\u2019d only just left, and she was already missing him.</p><p>She forced herself to go back to work. She\u2019d answered several more e-mails before she was interrupted by Anderson\u2019s assistant. He timidly knocked on the door and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cMiss MacKenna, there\u2019s a phone call for you on line one. The gentleman wouldn\u2019t give me his name, but he insisted he was a friend.\u201d</p><p>Who would be calling her at the law office? The only people who knew where she was had her cell phone number.</p><p>\u201cShould I tell him you\u2019re unavailable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll take the call,\u201d she said.</p><p>Terrance picked up the phone from the credenza and placed it on the corner of the table. \u201cWould you like me to help you with anything? Get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but thank you for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need me, I\u2019ll be in the library. Just push the intercom button.\u201d</p><p>She thanked him again, and as he was pulling the door closed, she answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cIs this Kate MacKenna?\u201d a man asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t recognize the caller. The voice was pleasant, though.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd who is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to give you my name. I want to help you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I mean you no harm. I have information for you,\u201d he rushed on. \u201cWill you please listen to what I have to say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied cautiously. \u201cI\u2019ll listen, but first, please tell me why it isn\u2019t a good idea to tell me your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wanted by the police,\u201d he answered. He hurried to add, \u201cI\u2019ve never killed anyone . . . at least on purpose.\u201d He laughed, and then he snorted. \u201cJust kidding . . . really, I\u2019ve never killed anyone.\u201d</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t know what to make of him, but the call was beginning to unnerve her. She glanced around. She was alone, and the conference room door was closed.</p><p>Before she could ask him why he was a wanted man, he continued. \u201cThe authorities don\u2019t know my real name, and I would prefer they never find out. Will you promise to remain calm? I want to help you, and in order to do that, you have to be able to hear what I have to say. You can\u2019t become hysterical.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll remain calm,\u201d she told him. \u201cJust tell me who you are.\u201d She could hear the apprehension in her own voice.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNice try. I won\u2019t be giving you my name. But I\u2019ll tell you what I will do; I\u2019ll give you the name the police call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Florist.\u201d</p><p>Kate nearly dropped the phone. Her immediate response was disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny . . . I don\u2019t believe . . . why would . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, you promised to stay calm . . .\u201d</p><p>Kate looked at the closed door again, willing it to open and Terrance\u2014anyone\u2014to walk in so she could signal him. Maybe someone could trace the call.</p><p>\u201cThis is a twisted prank,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt is not a prank,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI\u2019d never prank you. I am called the Florist, and I do want to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me? If you are who you say you are, your bombs have nearly killed me twice.\u201d She pressed the intercom button hoping that someone would hear the conversation, but the phone would not allow her to access the intercom as long as she was on the line.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t try to kill you,\u201d he said, exasperated. \u201cI only made the explosives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou need to hear what I have to say.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound crazy. He sounded reasonable. Was he going to offer her an apology?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll listen. Start explaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like blowing things up.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he was crazy after all. She thought she should say something in response. \u201cDo you want to tell me why?\u201d If she could keep him on the line, she might be able to summon help.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made quite a nice income. I bought a big-screen TV with surround sound last month. You wouldn\u2019t believe how it makes the Nature Channel come alive . . . but I digress. Truth is, I enjoy the extra income, and it allows me to do something I love doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlowing things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like building explosives, and in the past I never let anyone else near them. Until recently. A friend of a friend of a friend . . . you know how it goes. I was lured by the money, and I was hoodwinked. I was told the explosives would be used in the desert. There was a lot of talk about caves and underground facilities. Oh, yes, I was spun an elaborate lie, and I believed it. I was extremely na\u00cfve and greedy.</p> <p>\u201cI took the money and went back to my day job. I didn\u2019t think another thing about it until I opened the newspaper and saw a photo of an explosion at a gallery. It made the national news. I recognized my work right away. I was outraged because I had been hoodwinked, and after I read the article about how you had narrowly escaped death, I was scared, and I felt really bad for you.\u201d He snorted again. \u201cReally, I did . . . heh, heh . . . I thought about sending you flowers.</p><p>\u201cI tried to get hold of my contact, but he had disappeared. Then I read about another explosion that destroyed a building and nearly killed you again. I knew then that you were the target.\u201d</p><p>She heard him take a deep breath and let out a long sigh.</p><p>\u201cThis is a dangerous business.\u201d</p><p>He was just now figuring that out? \u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling me to tell me you\u2019re retiring?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer the question. \u201cThere\u2019s a gentleman who has been pursuing me for several years now. His name is Sutherland, and he works for ATF. I would appreciate it if you would call him and tell him to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re retiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>This was the most bizarre conversation she had ever had. \u201cI think you should tell him. I\u2019m sure he would love to meet you, even if only by phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we have met, several times, in fact. He just doesn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>She bet Sutherland was going to love hearing that. She spotted her purse on a chair next to the window. Her cell phone was in it. If she could get it, she might be able to contact someone.</p><p>She needed to keep him talking.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask a question?\u201d she asked as she stood up and moved the phone to the end of the table as far as the cord would allow so she could reach for her purse.</p><p>\u201cCertainly. If I can answer it, I will, and no, I\u2019m not really a florist. If you could see my garden, you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the question I was going to ask. I was told that you always put your explosives in baskets. I was curious to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a common misconception. I don\u2019t put them in baskets. They are the baskets. It\u2019s quite intricate work. I like to think of myself as a virtuoso. The Beethoven of bang, if you will.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you really call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get serious now,\u201d he said as he stopped his laugh with a sigh. \u201cI want to save your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you plan to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy giving you important information. The first explosion tore out a hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She grabbed the purse handle and pulled it to her.</p><p>\u201cYou walked away and barely suffered a scratch. Do you know the statistical odds for that?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cThe second explosive took down a building, and you survived that as well. That\u2019s phenomenal, just phenomenal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said again. Where was this leading? She fished to the bottom of the purse for her phone.</p><p>\u201cThe odds are becoming positively astronomical. I\u2019m quite worried about you. You just can\u2019t survive another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You see, I made three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stopped. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more bomb out there, and you need to listen carefully . . .\u201d</p><p>Kate was concentrating so intently on what the bomber was saying, she didn\u2019t hear the door open behind her.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-five</p><p>Roger Mackenna\u2019s apartment smelled like forgotten garbage. Roger smelled like he\u2019d rolled around in it before he killed himself. He was lying on the floor in the living room, flat on his back, the gun still clutched in his hand. Blood had pooled around his head and upper shoulders and had formed what appeared to be a perfect black chalk outline. Death had captured his expression of despair. One eye was closed, the other was somewhere in the back of his skull.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a pretty sight.</p><p>The FBI was there in force, and the agent in charge, Joel Kline, turned out to be surprisingly accommodating. He was about Dylan\u2019s age, but he already had deep creases at the corners of his mouth. His tall, thin frame was hunched at the shoulders as though permanently bent from stooping over too many crime scenes.</p><p>Once Dylan had diplomatically let him know that he was in no way interested in usurping his position, Kline handed him a pair of gloves and told him to have a look around. He\u2019d be happy to get his input.</p><p>The medical examiner was a middle-aged man named Dr. Luke Parrish. He was kneeling beside the body. Dylan squatted next to him, introduced himself, and showed him his badge.</p><p>Parrish liked to chat. \u201cI used to live near Silver Springs,\u201d he said. \u201cReal nice area. Not enough homicides to keep me busy or interested, so I moved here. Savannah\u2019s real nice, too,\u201d he added. \u201cWith that accent of yours I\u2019d say you\u2019re from the northeast. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cBoston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou relocating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is a temporary job.\u201d</p><p>They both turned to look at the body. \u201cThis one knew what he was doing,\u201d Parrish said. \u201cOne clean shot took care of it. Most of them don\u2019t know where to aim.\u201d</p><p>The weapon was a Glock. Parrish bagged it and handed it to a hovering agent. \u201cDamn, he stinks. I don\u2019t think he ever took a shower. He hasn\u2019t been dead long. He had this stench on him when he was alive. How could anyone live like this? Look around. The place is a pit. You\u2019d think anybody who could afford expensive furniture like this might try a little to keep it nice. That leather sofa alone had to have cost a couple thousand.\u201d</p><p>Parrish wasn\u2019t exaggerating about the apartment. It was a pit. There were overflowing ashtrays on tables and chairs, and empty whiskey bottles scattered about. The sofa looked like it was ready to be carted off to the city dump. The cushions were all broken down, and there were cigarette holes along the arms.</p><p>The coffee table was the only clean surface in the apartment. The papers on top were organized.</p><p>\u201cDid you find a suicide note?\u201d Dylan asked.</p><p>Kline crossed the room to join him. \u201cNo, not yet. But he left us all these papers. I think he wanted to help us get Jackman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there enough to prosecute him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not through looking.\u201d</p><p>In other words, no, Dylan thought. \u201cTell me what you do have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve compared what we found here with the information we\u2019d already gotten from Nate Hallinger. He\u2019s gonna love seeing all this evidence when he gets here.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like Roger knew just about everything there was to know about Kate MacKenna. He had all of her phone numbers, her work and home addresses, the make and model of her car, the license plate number, her business associates\u2019 phone numbers and addresses, her sisters\u2019 cell phone numbers. He even had Isabel MacKenna\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2019s name and phone number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had Reece Crowell\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019d underlined Carl Bertolli\u2019s address and had the date and time for the gallery party. He had the address for the warehouse, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, he had it all, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting warmed up. We already bagged the calendar we found in the kitchen next to the phone. It was covered with prints. It looked like someone else besides Roger had made notes. There were two distinct handwritings. I sent it to the lab over an hour ago and put a rush on it. We should have a preliminary report any minute now. Besides times and places, there were flight numbers. Kate\u2019s flight numbers. He knew when she was going to Boston, and he knew when she was coming home.\u201d</p><p>Dylan was having a difficult time controlling his anger. How long had the son of a bitch been stalking Kate? Had he been inside her house? It would have been easy for him. She never locked the damned doors.</p><p>\u201cHave you looked at his car yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kline answered. \u201cIt\u2019s a white Ford with tinted windows. This has to be the car Kate described to Hallinger, the one that tried to run her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting all this information took a lot of time and care.\u201d Dylan rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were two dates heavily circled on the calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dates of the explosions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Kline said. \u201cRoger made a lot of notations. One was real interesting. \u2018Jackman got the baskets.\u2019 \u2018Two hundred thousand\u2019 was written next to it. That has to be the amount he paid for the explosives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate told me Jackman\u2019s been picked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cRight now he\u2019s sitting in an interrogation room in Vegas waiting for his attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger\u2019s notes aren\u2019t going to be enough to hold him long, and you still don\u2019t know who was behind the camera when Compton MacKenna filmed his farewell address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know it wasn\u2019t one of the nephews because he didn\u2019t trust any of them, and he didn\u2019t want them to know what he was up to,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was real apparent in the video. There are a couple of people looking good to us, though. One\u2019s the housekeeper. We just found out she made a fat deposit in her account about six weeks ago. We\u2019re bringing her in to have a little talk.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd we\u2019re also interested in Compton MacKenna\u2019s attorney. I\u2019m not worried. We\u2019ll find whoever it was.\u201d</p><p>Dylan took his time walking around the apartment and studying the papers and the handwritten notes. Nice tidy package, he thought. Roger couldn\u2019t have been more accommodating if he\u2019d tried. He\u2019d left just enough hints to connect Jackman, but not hard evidence to nail him.</p><p>Something didn\u2019t compute. Dylan made a second examination of the information the agents had collected, but each time a question was answered, another one popped up. What was Reece\u2019s name doing in Roger\u2019s notes? Why did he leave information for them to find and yet leave no suicide note? Where did he get another gun so quickly? There was nothing orderly in Roger\u2019s life, so why was this so organized?</p><p>One perfect shot . . . knew just where to aim.</p><p>The paramedics had come in to bag the body. Agent Kline moved out of their way and noticed Dylan staring down at the papers, frowning. \u201cSomething bothering you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Dylan nodded. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel right. It isn\u2019t working for me.\u201d</p><p>They both watched the body being carted away. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got here is a nice, tidy package,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>Kline shrugged. \u201cIt can happen this way . . . all of it coming together . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Since when does it happen this way? Everything laid out nice and easy for you? The only thing missing from the table are arrows pointing to the evidence on those papers.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t like nice and tidy, and do you know why? It makes me think that maybe all this was staged.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>Dylan had stayed at the crime scene much longer than he\u2019d intended, and he was anxious to get back to Kate. He took the stairs at Roger\u2019s apartment building and called her cell phone on his way down to let her know he was returning to the law office. He was only ten minutes away, but he needed to hear her voice. He heard her voice mail instead. What the hell? Why hadn\u2019t she answered? Where was she? Trying not to panic, he quickly called Smith and Wesson. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiss MacKenna is on another line. Would you like to hold, or may I take a message?\u201d the receptionist inquired.</p><p>He didn\u2019t leave a message, but he did relax. It was okay. Kate was where she was supposed to be.</p><p>He was crossing the busy street heading to his car when his phone rang. Nate was on the line.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem. Ewan MacKenna hasn\u2019t shown up at the police station. His attorney\u2019s still there waiting for him, and he swears he doesn\u2019t know where his client is. Can\u2019t find Ewan\u2019s car, either. We\u2019ve sent some men to his house. No car, no Ewan. He left in a hurry, too, because his front door was wide open. Police went in and searched. Nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to Ewan\u2019s surveillance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently some idiot pulled it when Roger was found with all that evidence. I\u2019ve got some guys checking a couple of Ewan\u2019s favorite health clubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better get someone over to the hospital to make sure Bryce and Vanessa haven\u2019t disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just about to send someone. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>Dylan pulled his car key out of his pocket and was inserting it in the door when he saw Agent Kline rushing across the street waving to get his attention.</p> <p>\u201cGlad I caught you. Ewan MacKenna\u2019s missing,\u201d Kline said as he caught up to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard,\u201d Dylan answered.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s more. I just got a call from the lab. They found a match to the fingerprints on the calendar, and they just happen to belong to Ewan MacKenna himself. Maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe the crime scene was staged. So now I guess we\u2019ve got a whole new kettle of fish to deal with here.\u201d</p><p>Kline folded his arms, looked at the ground for a second as he thought, and then said, \u201cHere\u2019s my original theory: Someone the old man trusts films the video and makes himself an extra copy. He sells it to Roger. Roger watches it and knows he\u2019s got to get rid of Kate or he\u2019s not gonna see a dime. So what does he do? He calls Jackman and cuts him in because he needs his connections. This all makes sense, right? But now I\u2019ve got to consider that either Ewan is in on it with Roger and Jackman, or maybe the video is sold to Ewan. Roger doesn\u2019t know anything about it. Ewan watches it, and he cuts Jackman in, and the two of them set Roger up to take the fall. It could have happened that way because, I\u2019m telling you, there sure as certain isn\u2019t any brotherly love going on in that family.\u201d</p><p>Dylan draped his arms across the car door and listened to the agent\u2019s hypothesis.</p><p>Kline continued to think out loud. \u201cStill nice and tidy, right?\u201d he asked. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to wonder about the timing. Why did Roger kill himself when he did?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he did kill himself,\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>Kline\u2019s shoulders hunched a bit more. \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Dylan got in the car and rolled down the window. \u201cHopefully, evidence will prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Roger was murdered, Ewan becomes the number one suspect. He\u2019s capable of murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that family . . . they\u2019re all capable of murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when we find Ewan,\u201d Kline said. He jogged back across the street and into the building.</p><p>Dylan couldn\u2019t get rid of the uneasy feeling that he was missing something. He was looking at it but not seeing it. He locked in on Kline\u2019s comment about timing. Maybe that was it. The timing was wrong. Yeah, that\u2019s what was bothering him.</p><p>At the first stoplight he dug through his pocket, found Anderson\u2019s cell phone number, and called him.</p> <p>The attorney, who had forgotten to turn off his phone, answered in a whisper. \u201cMay I call you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you may not,\u201d Dylan said firmly. \u201cYou need to answer a question for me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying my respects\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me just step outside this door . . .\u201d His voice became louder. \u201cAll right. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some puzzle pieces missing,\u201d Dylan answered. \u201cI need you to help me create a timeline.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-seven</p><p>Timing really was everything, and the phone logs at Smith and Wesson would confirm what Dylan had finally figured out.</p><p>The truth didn\u2019t set him free; it enraged him. How could he have been so blind? And why had it taken him so long to see what was there the whole time?</p><p>He realized he was driving like a maniac. He didn\u2019t care. Panic was building inside him, and all he could think about was getting to Kate. He needed to see her and know that she was all right. She didn\u2019t realize the danger, and she was so trusting. She was sitting in the middle of a hornet\u2019s nest. The bastard knew where she was, and he would be coming for her.</p><p>He turned the corner on two wheels, slammed on the brakes, and hit the ground running. He had a plan. After he made sure Kate was safe, he was going to kill the son of a bitch.</p><p>Dylan sprinted into the building. Two policemen were hurrying down the stairs toward him. As soon as he saw their expressions, he knew something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kate?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cGone . . . she\u2019s gone,\u201d one of the officers answered.</p><p>The other rushed to add, \u201cWe\u2019ve searched the entire building. She left in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>They both talked at once.</p><p>\u201cPhone was off the hook, purse and briefcase still there . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alarm on the back door . . . someone disarmed it . . . couldn\u2019t have been her . . .\u201d</p><p>A security guard rushed forward, visibly shaken. \u201cThis is all my fault. She went out the back door. I got called on the intercom to come up to the entrance, and I didn\u2019t question it. I thought it was one of the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe called it in as soon as we realized . . . The FBI is on the way. Agent Kline says to wait here.\u201d The first policeman said.</p><p>Dylan was too late. The son of a bitch had her.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-eight</p><p>Light slowly crept into the black void. Kate struggled to open her eyes. It was such a difficult task, and when she finally managed it, the room she was in refused to come into focus. Thoughts were spinning in and out of her mind, and nothing was making sense.</p><p>She was lying on something hard and cold. What was it? A table? A slab? She couldn\u2019t be on a slab. She wasn\u2019t dead. She could feel herself breathing. Had she been in an accident? She couldn\u2019t remember. She wasn\u2019t in pain, but she didn\u2019t think anything was broken. She gingerly tested her arms and legs to make sure. Good, she could move, but it was difficult. She felt so weak and lethargic, and she couldn\u2019t understand why. What had happened to her?</p><p>Oh, no, she didn\u2019t get blown up again, did she?</p><p>Panic jolted her awake. Isabel. Oh, God, Isabel was in trouble. Someone had taken her. Kate remembered running. She had to get to her before he hurt her . . .</p><p>Where was her sister? Kate tried to call out to her, but her voice wouldn\u2019t cooperate.</p><p>Drugged. She had been drugged. She remembered the peculiar smell pressed against her face. And then a pinch. Yes, someone had pinched her arm.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been unconscious. Her mind was clearing now, and she could feel her strength coming back. She managed to sit up. A wave of nausea gripped her, but it quickly passed.</p><p>The room finally came into focus. She was sitting on a hardwood floor. There were books on shelves against the wall and a desk in front of her\u2014a library. Why did it look so familiar? The video. Yes, that was where she\u2019d seen the desk. Compton MacKenna had been sitting there. She was in his library. The painting that had been behind him in the video was still there hanging on the wall. A hunting scene . . . with kilts. A countryside somewhere in Scotland.</p><p>What was she doing here?</p><p>She made a feeble attempt to stand and nearly toppled over. Gripping the arm of the chair to balance herself, she was about to try again when she heard a door slam. Then she heard voices getting closer.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you gave her enough? I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll wake up before I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Kate froze. She recognized the voice. Vanessa.</p><p>Who was she talking to? Kate heard another voice, but too far away and muffled.</p><p>Vanessa continued to speak. \u201cI\u2019ll need at least fifteen minutes. Twenty would be better. And that\u2019s enough time? Okay, I\u2019ll stop worrying. We still need to hurry, though. Drag him into the library.\u201d Another door slammed shut. \u201cAnd hurry. You need to get back before you\u2019re missed.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa was just outside the door now. Kate dove to the floor and rolled onto her back. Her heart was pounding. She heard a crash. It sounded like glass breaking. Then laughter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cNothing in this rat trap is worth anything. Can you believe that senile old man thought I\u2019d be happy with this house and a measly hundred thousand dollars? And he thought he could give his fortune to a stranger. I swear, I almost killed him with the camera. That stupid fool. I didn\u2019t put up with a drunk just for this dump. By the way, sweetheart, Bryce should be expiring any moment now. He was too drunk to know how many pain pills he was taking. I told the doctors I was worried about him accidentally overdosing.\u201d There was the sound of feet shuffling and then, \u201cMy hands are full. Could you get the door for me?\u201d</p><p>Kate felt a slight draft as the door opened. She heard a skirt rustle. Vanessa was walking toward her. She stopped and nudged Kate\u2019s foot, and Kate knew the woman was staring at her. And then Vanessa kicked her thigh. Hard. Kate was certain Vanessa was watching her face. She didn\u2019t dare flinch.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still out cold,\u201d Vanessa said smugly. She walked to the desk.</p><p>What was she doing? And where was \u201csweetheart\u201d?</p><p>Then she heard him. He was dragging something. He dropped whatever it was to the floor with a heavy thud.</p><p>A phone rang, and Vanessa let out a slight gasp. \u201cThat has to be your cell. Mine\u2019s in the car. We need to hurry. Go. Go. I\u2019m right behind you. Oh, I almost forgot. Here, take the desk phone out with you. I\u2019ll lock the door\u2014just in case.\u201d</p><p>Quick footsteps, and the library door closed. Then another door shut. Kate thought it might be the front door. Were they really gone? Or was it a trick? It was deadly quiet. She didn\u2019t move for several seconds. Finally, she dared to open her eyes.</p><p>They were gone. But she wasn\u2019t alone. Ewan MacKenna lay on the floor facing her. His eyes were closed. Was he dead or alive? She crawled close and put her hand on his chest. He was breathing. Had he been drugged, too?</p><p>She had to get help. She made it to her knees and reached for the top of the desk for support. Then she saw it. A basket of flowers.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-nine</p><p>The elevators were too damned slow. Nate raced up the three flights of stairs to the ICU. He crashed through the double doors, spotted the nurses\u2019 station on his right, and headed there.</p><p>A technician and a nurse were working behind the counter. \u201cWhere\u2019s Vanessa MacKenna?\u201d he demanded, panting for breath. \u201cHer husband, Bryce, is a patient here.\u201d</p><p>The two of them shared a worried look, and the nurse moved closer to the counter. \u201cSir, are you a family member?\u201d she asked. Her voice was soothing, as though she were comforting a distraught relative.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m Detective Hallinger,\u201d he said. He showed his badge. \u201cNow answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. MacKenna isn\u2019t here,\u201d the nurse said. No more soothing pretense. She was all business now. \u201cShe received a call here at the station.\u201d</p><p>The tech nodded. \u201cI answered it. A man was calling. He said he was Bryce MacKenna\u2019s brother, Ewan. I remember the name because he said it a couple of times. He was upset and said it was urgent that he talk to Mrs. MacKenna. I went and got her, and she talked to him. Whatever he was saying upset her. I heard her tell him several times to calm down, and when she hung up the phone, she was very distraught. Wasn\u2019t she, LeeAnne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me there was an emergency, and she had to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you where she was going?\u201d Nate asked urgently. He watched the second hand on the clock behind the counter. He knew he had to hurry. \u201cThink,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t tell me where she was going,\u201d the tech answered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too far away,\u201d LeeAnne interjected. \u201cShe told me it wouldn\u2019t take her any time at all to get back if we needed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also said she wouldn\u2019t be gone long,\u201d the tech volunteered, trying to be helpful.</p><p>\u201cCompton MacKenna\u2019s house is close by,\u201d he said. \u201cDid she mention his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall her,\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou have her number. Call her and see if she\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did try to call her, but she didn\u2019t answer. I even had her paged here at the hospital\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry her again,\u201d he said. He shoved his hands in his pockets as he waited.</p><p>The nurse didn\u2019t argue. She found the number and made the call.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ringing,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s her husband doing?\u201d Nate asked the tech.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacKenna expired a few minutes ago. That\u2019s why we were trying to get hold of Mrs. MacKenna. She had hoped to be by her husband\u2019s side. She\u2019s a devoted wife. And he was so self-destructive. But she knew he was dying\u2014she\u2019s prepared for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoice mail answered on the fourth ring,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cShould I leave a message?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and reached for the phone. \u201cGet me an outside line. I\u2019ve got to call this in.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty</p><p>Vanessa was about to become a terrified woman, running for her life.</p><p>She needed to look the part. She ran halfway down the hill, turned toward the driveway, closed her eyes, then threw herself on her left knee and struck the cement. The skin split just as she\u2019d hoped, and the cut began to bleed. Stumbling to her feet, she kicked one shoe off and deliberately fell into the shrubbery. She instinctively protected her face with her arms, but when she looked, there were cuts and scratches everywhere. She rolled over and made sure there were twigs and a blade of grass or two in her hair and dirt on her face. Her knee was throbbing\u2014a small price to pay for the millions she would inherit. She checked her watch again just to see how much time she still had.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought to rip her clothes, but when she staggered to her feet, she heard her skirt tear. Nice touch, she thought, tearing it just a bit more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was almost time to make the call. She\u2019d already moved Ewan\u2019s car to the end of the drive at the bottom of the hill, and she\u2019d parked her car behind his. It had to be out of harms way when the house blew, and she\u2019d be able to tell the police that Ewan blocked the drive and she couldn\u2019t get any closer. There was so much detail to the planning. Nothing could be overlooked.</p><p>It was ironic that she really did fall down when she was just a few feet away from her car door. She even bumped her forehead on the fender.</p><p>She got the door open and slid into the driver\u2019s seat. Her gaze locked on her watch as the seconds ticked by. Less than three minutes remained. Perfect timing. She glanced up at the old Victorian brick mansion at the top of the hill and laughed to herself. To think that she\u2019d ever want such a monstrosity was ludicrous. The old man hadn\u2019t done anything in thirty years to update or maintain it. It was just a huge, ugly monument to his mean and selfish life.</p><p>She knew she was supposed to wait until after the explosion to make the call, but she thought it would be more convincing if she were on the line pleading for help when the house exploded.</p> <p>Two minutes to go. Now, she thought. She pushed 9-1-1.</p><p>An operator answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, please help me,\u201d she cried out. \u201cHe\u2019s got a bomb, and he\u2019s going to kill her. I got out, but she\u2019s still inside the house with him, and I can\u2019t . . . oh, please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your address?\u201d the calm operator asked.</p> <p>\u201cFour-seventeen Barkley Road. Please hurry,\u201d she screamed.</p><p>\u201cWe have two cars in your area, ma\u2019am. They\u2019re on their way. Just stay on the line with me until they get there. What is your name?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa was sobbing and panting for breath and hoped she sounded hysterical. \u201cVanessa MacKenna. They\u2019ve got to get here now. Don\u2019t you understand? He\u2019s going to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, ma\u2019am? Who are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate MacKenna. My brother-in-law Ewan has her.\u201d</p><p>Less than a minute to go.</p> <p>The operator continued to ask questions.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you now, ma\u2019am? Are you away from the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He looked the other way, and I ran. I\u2019m at the gate at the end of the driveway\u2014by my car. Oh, I hear sirens. They\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay with me until they get to you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will. Oh, please, they have to stop him.\u201d She took the phone from her ear and turned it toward the house.</p><p>Five . . . four . . . three . . . two . . . one.</p><p>Time ran out . . . and nothing happened.</p><p>Chapter Forty-one</p> <p>Dylan\u2019s heart dropped to the pit of his stomach. How could he have let this happen? Kate . . . oh, God, Kate . . . .</p><p>No sooner had he absorbed the news that she had disappeared than he heard a car screech to a stop in front of the building. Agent Kline had told him he would meet him at Smith and Wesson, but he didn\u2019t get out of his car. He pounded on the horn.</p><p>The security guard who had left his post leaped out of the way in the nick of time, or Dylan would have plowed over him as he bolted out the door. His brain was on automatic now.</p><p>Kline had the window down and was shouting, \u201cGet in! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go.\u201d He leaned across the seat and pushed the passenger door open.</p><p>Dylan jumped inside. He was pulling the door closed when Kline hit the gas pedal. The car rocketed forward.</p><p>\u201cKate\u2019s gone,\u201d Dylan roared.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kline answered. \u201cI heard it from dispatch. I know where she is,\u201d Kline said, hoping to God he was right. \u201cA call was patched through from Savannah PD. Vanessa left the hospital, said it was an emergency. She was meeting Ewan at Compton\u2019s house. She\u2019s been staying there, and I\u2019m guessing Kate\u2019s with her. Process of elimination,\u201d he rushed on.</p><p>He ran a red light, turned left, and shot down the street.</p><p>\u201cVanessa told people where she was going? It could be a setup,\u201d Kline said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking,\u201d Dylan said, trying to make sense of it all.</p><p>They both knew Kate could already be dead, but neither voiced the fear.</p><p>\u201cKate has to be there with Vanessa,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cAnd if she isn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know where they could have taken her. I never should have left her. I should have stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re close,\u201d Kline said. \u201cAnd every available unit is on the way. We\u2019ll get to her in time.\u201d He took another corner on two wheels, straightened, and, tires squealing, sped on.</p><p>Dylan pulled his gun out of the holster, popped the magazine out, checked it, and then snapped it back in with the heel of his hand. \u201cIf anyone hurts Kate, I\u2019ll kill them. And it\u2019s not going to be quick or clean.\u201d</p><p>Dylan\u2019s tirade made Kline nervous. \u201cTry to remember I\u2019m a federal agent, okay? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to kill someone. That\u2019s called premeditated murder. You\u2019re a detective. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Dylan shoved the gun back in the holster. \u201cCan\u2019t you drive faster?\u201d</p><p>The radio in the police car Kline had commandeered crackled to life as dispatch relayed the 911 call from Vanessa.</p><p>Dylan heard the word \u201cbomb.\u201d It felt like a crushing blow hit him in the gut.</p><p>The dispatcher was routing police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks to the neighborhood. Kline got on the radio and gave the operator his approximate ETA.</p><p>They turned onto a four-lane, heavily congested street flying past other vehicles. Most drivers pulled over when they heard the siren, but there were a few who either hadn\u2019t heard the noise or had heard it and didn\u2019t care. Kline swung the car in and out with the efficiency of a NASCAR driver.</p><p>Dylan still thought he could do better, go faster.</p><p>\u201cVanessa\u2019s saying Ewan\u2019s got a bomb, right?\u201d Kline asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Ewan,\u201d Dylan shouted.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Kline said. \u201cYou convinced me, but what I\u2019m trying to say is that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been detonated yet. If it\u2019s anything like the other two bombs, we\u2019d have heard about it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d Dylan actually felt a kernel of hope. \u201cI never told her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold her what?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cYou\u2019re slowing down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I am. We\u2019re closing in. Bomb squad should be right behind us. Damn, another bomb. Third time\u2019s the charm? We\u2019ve got to get this prick.\u201d</p><p>Kline spotted an ambulance in his rearview mirror weaving in and out of traffic. \u201cOne more turn up ahead and straight about a mile,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this ritzy neighborhood, the estates are spread out\u2014that\u2019s good because I hate to think\u2014\u201d He stopped, but not in time.</p><p>Dylan finished the thought. \u201cIf the houses are crammed together and a bomb goes off, the number of casualties escalates. You think I don\u2019t know the problems?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Kline shouted back. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to become my problem, got that? You\u2019re involved with Kate, aren\u2019t you? I can hear it in your voice and see it in your face. Emotional involvement makes you a risk. You\u2019ve got to keep it together, or you\u2019ll be no help at all.\u201d</p><p>Kline didn\u2019t slow down enough when he turned the corner, nearly putting the car into a spin. Quickly compensating, he regained control.</p><p>\u201cWhen this is over, Kline, you need to take driver\u2019s ed. You drive like an old lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going sixty down a residential street.\u201d</p><p>Ahead there was a four-way stop. Two police cars raced toward the intersection from opposite directions. Kline fishtailed around the stop signs, narrowly missing both cars.</p><p>Cars rushed at the MacKenna mansion from every direction. Two police cars blocked the street, and the uniforms were cordoning off the area. One signaled Kline to stop, but he ignored the directive, driving over the curb toward the iron gates. Through the trees, Dylan glimpsed the house. An ambulance was parked next to another car which obstructed his view of the people clustered together.</p><p>Kline had a better vantage point. \u201cHallinger\u2019s here. That\u2019s his car, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see Kate. Do you see Kate?\u201d Dylan asked, reaching for the door handle.</p><p>\u201cHold on! Let me get inside the gate. Keep looking,\u201d Kline urged. \u201cAh, there\u2019s Vanessa. Over on the right. You let me handle her, you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see Kate. I don\u2019t see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBomb squad\u2019s here. They\u2019re getting ready now. Dylan, what the hell are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kline slammed on the brakes, but Dylan was already out of the car and running flat out toward the gates. Cursing, Kline put the car in park, jumped out, and chased him.</p><p>\u201cDylan, hold on, hold on,\u201d Kline shouted.</p><p>Dylan wasn\u2019t listening. He was frantically seaching for Kate while Kline was frantically trying to get to him before he did anything crazy.</p><p>Dylan veered around the bomb squad van. Two policemen stood with Vanessa, who was sobbing and pointing to the house. One of them spotted Dylan coming toward them and ran to intercept him.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Kate MacKenna?\u201d Dylan demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe just got here, and were the first on the scene. An ambulance followed us in, and a Detective Nate Hallinger pulled in behind us.\u201d</p><p>Kline caught up, panting for breath.</p><p>The policeman continued, \u201cVanessa MacKenna told us there are people inside. Detective Hallinger just took off, the crazy idiot. He\u2019s going to try to get them out before the bomb goes off. I couldn\u2019t stop him.\u201d</p><p>Dylan was already gone. He crossed the drive, vaulting over the hood of a car that was in his way, and sprinted up the hill.</p><p>Kate was still inside . . . if the bomb exploded . . . something must have gone wrong because the house was still standing. Maybe Vanessa hadn\u2019t timed it right . . . maybe she called it in too soon. What the hell was the plan? His thoughts raced. There had to be a backup plan.</p><p>He\u2019d just reached the mansion\u2019s entryway when he heard a gunshot.</p><p>He pulled his gun, flipped off the safety, and stealthily moved inside the house. There was no one in sight.</p><p>Nate stood at the library door at the back of the house. He had jammed the lock in his hurry to get inside and had been forced to shoot it and kick the door to get in. He took the entire room in at once. Ewan was on the floor, face up, eyes closed. Nate searched for Kate, but couldn\u2019t find her. He saw the basket of flowers on the desk and rocked back on his heels, knowing that it could go off any second. He opened his mouth to call for Kate, but only a strangled sound escaped. He felt the barrel of a gun against the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cDrop the gun or you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Dylan stood behind him.</p><p>Nate flinched. \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you crazy? Get your gun away from me! I\u2019m trying to get Kate and Ewan out before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop the gun, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Nate roared.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying to save her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean \u2018kill her\u2019? Were you going to use Ewan\u2019s gun or your own? Nice and tidy, right? Make it look like Ewan shot her. Then you\u2019re the hero if you take him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nuts. Why would I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dylan cut him off. \u201cYou made a big mistake. You knew about the money, and you hadn\u2019t even talked to the attorney yet.\u201d Dylan pushed the barrel harder against Nate\u2019s skull and shouted, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, you\u2019ve got this all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d The library door behind them edged forward, and Kate stepped around it, a pair of scissors raised in her right hand. She lowered her arm and in a stunned voice, she said, \u201cI thought Vanessa was coming back, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nate\u2019s gun had been pointed at Ewan, but he inched the barrel up toward the basket on the desk. \u201cI\u2019m not going down for this, Dylan. I pull this trigger, and we all die. Hand over your gun and nobody gets hurt. Kate\u2019s gonna be my insurance. She\u2019ll walk out with me, and everyone stays alive. I\u2019ve got nothing to lose. Now hurry up and decide. This bomb could go at any second.\u201d</p><p>Dylan didn\u2019t lower his gun. \u201cKate, get out of here. Run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Dylan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo! Now!\u201d</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t budge. \u201cDylan\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door in the front of the house burst open. Nate\u2019s head turned for a split second. Like lightning, Dylan\u2019s free hand chopped Nate\u2019s arm and sent his gun flying. In one motion, Dylan kicked his feet out and threw him to the floor, holding him with his foot, his gun still pointed at Nate\u2019s head.</p><p>The bomb squad rushed toward the library in their full protective gear, and Dylan shouted to them as he pulled Nate to his knees. \u201cGet Kate out first. And take Ewan. Hurry!\u201d</p><p>Kate was finally able to speak. As the team stepped toward her, she put her hand up. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dylan had Nate on his feet now and gave him a shove toward the door.</p><p>\u201cNow, Kate!\u201d Dylan ordered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d Kate went to the desk and put the scissors down, then she opened her other hand. A blue wire just a few inches long lay in her palm. \u201cThe bomb isn\u2019t going to explode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how do you know . . . ?\u201d Dylan began.</p><p>She gave a relieved smile and said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess who called me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty-two</p><p>Leaning against the side of a squad car, too weary to move, Kate quietly watched all the commotion.</p><p>Dylan was talking to a lieutenant with Savannah PD, but he kept glancing over at her\u2014probably making sure she didn\u2019t disappear again.</p><p>The paramedics carried Ewan out of the house on a stretcher. He was still unconscious, but she heard one of the policemen say that Ewan was expected to recover. Whenever he did open his eyes, he\u2019d find himself handcuffed to a hospital bed. There were several charges pending against him. Supplying his brother with a stolen gun that had been used in a crime was going to top the list of offenses.</p><p>By now, reporters and cameramen from all the television stations that had been monitoring the 911 calls had arrived, but they were being kept outside the gates.</p><p>Most of the cameramen focused on the house, expectantly waiting for the suspect to step outside, but Vanessa was getting some attention, too. She was hysterical, and this time it wasn\u2019t an act. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a terrible mistake,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI\u2019m a victim here! I was trying to save lives when I called nine-one-one. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong. I\u2019m a victim!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>She had just been handcuffed by an agent who was telling her she had the right to remain silent. When he was finished reading her her rights, he asked her if she understood. She pulled herself together long enough to say yes, she understood, but then she started screaming again. Her shrieks were grating and terribly annoying.</p><p>\u201cReally, lady, you have the right to remain silent. I strongly urge you to exercise that right.\u201d</p><p>A detective who had loaned Kate his cell phone came back to retrieve it. Handing it to him, she was thanking him when Dylan joined her.</p> <p>\u201cDid you get hold of Isabel?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes, and she\u2019s just fine. I knew she would be, but I needed to hear her voice. I also called Kiera, and she\u2019s okay, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen Nate came running into Smith and Wesson\u2019s conference room and told me Reece had taken Isabel and that she\u2019d been hurt, I panicked. I didn\u2019t think twice about following him out the back door. The only thing I remember is getting in his car . . . and then I woke up on the library floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to know they\u2019re okay, but what about you? Are you okay?\u201d He put his arm around her and squeezed her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she assured him. She looked up at the house and asked, \u201cWhy are they taking so long to bring Nate out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing everything by the book,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it hasn\u2019t been long. You\u2019re just anxious to get out of here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould we leave now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Two paramedics hurried across the driveway to Kate. Dylan saw them coming. \u201cThey\u2019re going to want to check you out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really.\u201d</p><p>One of the paramedics, hearing her protest, said, \u201cWe should look you over, take your vitals and all.\u201d He flashed a penlight in her eyes. \u201cNot dilated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, go with them, make sure. I\u2019ll wait here,\u201d Dylan said.</p> <p>Though Kate insisted none of this was necessary, she walked to the ambulance with them and let them take her blood pressure and pulse. She admitted to herself that she wasn\u2019t feeling all that great. She was sure that her nausea wasn\u2019t caused by the drug she\u2019d been given. Finding out the truth about Nate Hallinger had made her sick. She didn\u2019t mention her queasy stomach to the paramedics.</p><p>Once she\u2019d been declared no worse for the wear, a paramedic offered his hand and was assisting her out of the ambulance when he glanced up the hill and saw several men exit the house.</p><p>\u201cHey, they\u2019re bringing the suspect down the hill now. Uh-oh. It looks like the detective you were with is waiting for him, and look at his face.\u201d He turned to his partner. \u201cWe may not be done here, after all.\u201d</p><p>Dylan had turned away, and Kate couldn\u2019t see his face. She ran to him, praying Dylan wouldn\u2019t do anything crazy. No, of course he wouldn\u2019t. His hand wasn\u2019t on his gun. That was a good sign, wasn\u2019t it? And his arms were folded across his chest. His stance suggested he was relaxed.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a good sign. She wished she could see Dylan\u2019s expression. She\u2019d know then.</p><p>\u201cDylan,\u201d she called out.</p><p>\u201cStay back, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She reached him. He didn\u2019t look at her when he said, \u201cI told you to stay back.\u201d</p> <p>She put her hand on his arm. \u201cSince when have I ever done anything you\u2019ve told me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate . . .\u201d The warning was in his voice.</p><p>The ambulance was about ten feet behind her. Dylan grabbed her hand and practically dragged her there. \u201cGet inside.\u201d</p><p>She stood her ground. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to do anything stupid, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she could believe him. \u201cDon\u2019t even talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was going to kill you,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>Agent Kline shouted something to Dylan.</p><p>\u201cStay here, Kate,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she relented.</p><p>He looked as if he didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>Dylan turned and walked toward Nate, stopping when he was just a few feet away. Kline had a grip on Nate\u2019s arm as he led him down the hill. He\u2019d taken great pleasure in putting the handcuffs on the detective. Police officers and detectives were moving in, forming a circle around them as they headed toward a squad car.</p><p>Nate glared at Dylan. \u201cThis is never going to stick. You\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have enough,\u201d Kline said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cIf you have anything, it\u2019s circumstantial.\u201d</p><p>Dylan\u2019s smile didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u201cYou sure have had your troubles, haven\u2019t you? And I\u2019ll bet you thought it was all gonna be so easy. One bomb, and boom, problem solved. Kate\u2019s dead before she ever finds out about the will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you with Savannah PD?\u201d Kline asked Nate.</p><p>Dylan answered for him. \u201cLong enough to meet Vanessa and start shacking up with her. It was common knowledge that she was sleeping around. Come to find out\u2014and I did find out\u2014you were the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hatched your plan and transferred to the Charleston police force,\u201d Kline said. \u201cYou had to distance yourself from Vanessa, and you also wanted to find out everything you could about Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI transferred because there was an opening, and I wanted a change,\u201d Nate argued.</p><p>\u201cWhat you wanted was eighty million dollars, you prick,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cVanessa was behind the camera filming the old man. Compton trusted her, and he asked her to film his video. She must have been real pissed off when Compton looked into the camera and said he was giving it all to Kate. He\u2019d already changed the will so it wouldn\u2019t do her any good to kill him after the fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you all about it, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Kline said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t prove\u2014\u201d Nate objected.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who checked her alibi the day the video was made. You said it was airtight. Why would I think you were lying?\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>Nate didn\u2019t respond, but then, Dylan didn\u2019t expect him to. \u201cDid you have the connections to get to the Florist, or did you go to Jackman and offer him a deal he couldn\u2019t refuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t prove a damn thing. This is all speculation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt got complicated, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Kline said, ignoring his protests. \u201cKate wouldn\u2019t cooperate. Two explosions, and she\u2019s stayed alive. Her good luck, and your bad. Did you buy all three bombs at the same time, or did you have to keep going back for more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew Kate would be at Carl\u2019s party,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cYou knew before it was in the paper. Carl was your source, even though he didn\u2019t know it. He likes to promote Kate\u2019s company, and he does a lot of charity events in Savannah. Compton mentioned Vanessa\u2019s good works had helped uphold the MacKenna name. Vanessa was smart enough not to meet Carl, but she was always there, listening, wasn\u2019t she? You knew way in advance and had time to plan it just right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just happened to be in the area when the bomb went off,\u201d Kline added. \u201cFirst on the scene and first to find Kate. Must have disappointed you to see she was still breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Nate shouted.</p><p>Once again Kline and Dylan ignored his outrage.</p><p>\u201cPutting Reece Crowell\u2019s name on the paper in Roger\u2019s apartment was overkill, don\u2019t you think? Were you trying to confuse us, or was it supposed to be a little clue?\u201d Dylan said.</p><p>\u201cYou kept having to change the plan, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Dylan continued. \u201cYou killed Roger and planted the evidence to frame Ewan. This last bomb was meant to kill Kate and Ewan, of course, but the sucker didn\u2019t go off. So you had to get in there and take care of it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwan\u2019s gun and his cell phone were in your pocket,\u201d Kline said.</p><p>\u201cI can explain that,\u201d Nate said.</p><p>\u201cCan you explain telling Kate that Reece had her sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he did . . . Ewan called me . . .\u201d</p><p>Kline looked at Dylan. \u201cWhew. He\u2019s dancing so fast, I can hardly see his feet. Can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a greedy son of a bitch, Nate,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cBut you made a big mistake. Remember what you said to me? \u2018I heard she turned it down.\u2019 Got me thinking. How could you have known that? Vanessa left before Kate changed her mind and accepted the inheritance. You heard it from Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnderson told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I assumed for a while anyway. Turns out Anderson has a great memory. He hadn\u2019t even talked to you yet. You see, Nate, my watch keeps real good time, and I know it wasn\u2019t more than ten minutes after we left the office that I talked to you. Anderson remembers your call, all right, but he swears it took at least fifteen minutes to wrap up his business with the police when they came to confiscate Roger\u2019s gun, and then he was summoned back to his office to accept your call. You know what? Anderson has the phone logs to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice guesswork, Dylan, but none of it will hold up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it will,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cVanessa will give you up.\u201d He nodded in her direction. \u201cLook at her. She\u2019s watching you, and if looks could kill . . . Well, let\u2019s just say she doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s your biggest fan right now. When she realizes what she\u2019s facing, she\u2019ll deal.\u201d</p><p>Talk about timing.</p><p>As Vanessa was being forced into the backseat of a police car, she erupted, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything! It was all his idea. I\u2019m innocent!\u201d</p><p>Everyone heard her.</p><p>Dylan\u2019s smile was genuine now. \u201cThere you go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty-three</p><p>Kate sat in the captain\u2019s office. Kline was on one side of her, Dylan was on the other, and she was being questioned by everyone but the mayor.</p><p>How had she known which wire to cut? He\u2019d told her. Who? The Florist. How had she known a bullet to the basket wouldn\u2019t force the explosion? Simple. She\u2019d dismantled it. She\u2019d cut the blue wire, then carefully removed the bottom panel and placed it in the drawer of the desk. Why had she done that? He had said it needed to be taken out. She didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>They wanted her to remember every word The Florist had said to her. First one law officer and then another asked her to start from the beginning. She repeated the phone conversation at least five times, but she still never lost her patience.</p><p>Dylan was amazed by how calm she was. She seemed to be taking it all in stride.</p><p>Had she tried to get out of the library? Of course she had, but she couldn\u2019t get the door unlocked. She\u2019d tried kicking it in, but the wood was solid and wouldn\u2019t give. She thought about going out the window and getting away before the bomb detonated, but she knew she would be unable to lift Ewan up and over the windowsill. He weighed at least one hundred and eighty pounds. She couldn\u2019t have carried him to safety, and trying to drag him would have been impossible.</p><p>Time was critical. Kate felt she had no choice. She had to take the basket apart.</p><p>They all knew she\u2019d had a choice. She could have run, saved herself, and the fact that she didn\u2019t consider leaving Ewan behind spoke volumes about her character.</p><p>Dylan was with her the entire time, trying to keep the questions to a minimum. Once he felt the police and the FBI had all the information they would need, he called an end to the interrogation and got her out of there.</p><p>Kate was grateful for the rescue. Her day thus far had been horrendous . . . and it wasn\u2019t over yet.</p><p>At exactly seven o\u2019clock, Kate and Dylan walked into the law offices of Smith and Wesson. For the next two hours, Kate politely listened to Compton\u2019s smug and condescending advisors and accountants give their reports. Dylan sat next to her with his arms folded, remaining silent while taking it all in.</p><p>The attitude of the men, dressed in their dark suits, white shirts, and conservative ties, was puzzling. They behaved as though the money belonged to them collectively, and they were simply humoring Kate by telling her what they had done in the past and what they would be doing\u2014with her inheritance\u2014in the future. There were forms they wanted her to sign, giving them permission to continue their financial guardianship, but all of them assured her she would receive annual reports that would keep her apprised.</p><p>After they had finished boasting, they witnessed as she signed the papers Anderson had prepared, formally accepting the inheritance. Once the transaction was complete, the attorney announced that there were no more stipulations, and all of Compton\u2019s wishes had been fulfilled.</p><p>The men began to gather their things in preparation to leave, but Kate motioned for them to stay seated as she rose to address them. First, she graciously thanked them for their work and their dedication, and then she told them that their services were no longer needed.</p><p>Nearly every chin in the room dropped.</p><p>Anderson maintained his composure, although he looked like he wanted to cheer.</p><p>One of the advisors jumped to his feet. \u201cWhat will you do with all that money?\u201d</p><p>Another stood and protested, \u201cCompton doesn\u2019t want you to squander his life\u2019s accumulation, and I\u2019m\u2014rather, we\u2014are concerned with your lack of experience in the financial arena\u2014won\u2019t you be doing exactly that? Squandering it?\u201d</p><p>Anderson put his hand up when the advisors all began to talk at once. \u201cWhat Miss MacKenna chooses to do with her inheritance is no longer your concern. You may send your final bills to this office, and I will review them.\u201d</p><p>In desperation, one of the men turned to Dylan. \u201cSurely you know what a mistake this is. Talk to her,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>His arms still crossed, Dylan leaned back in his chair and, with an amused smile, he simply shrugged.</p><p>The angry man\u2019s face turned the color of the red stripes on his tie. \u201cBut does she have any idea what she will do with\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kate interrupted. \u201cI do know.\u201d She gathered up the papers spread out on the table as she explained. \u201cI\u2019m giving it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . but . . .\u201d another man sputtered.</p><p>\u201cWho are you giving it to?\u201d a third man asked. He looked positively ill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have several ideas,\u201d she answered. \u201cAnd I will discuss them with my sisters before a final decision is made, but I\u2019m leaning toward a research facility. My mother died of a terrible disease,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m also considering a new cancer wing for the hospital in Silver Springs. However,\u201d she added, \u201cI do know this. Whatever the money is used for will have my mother\u2019s name on it. Leah MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>They looked horrified.</p><p>\u201cCompton will roll over in his grave,\u201d sniffed the man with the red-striped tie. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even consider her a part of his family.\u201d</p><p>Kate headed for the door, but she turned at the last comment. She thought for a second before answering. \u201cThank you. What a lovely thing to say.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Forty-four</p><p>Home never looked so good to Kate. The house was old and run-down, desperately in need of a new coat of paint and new shutters, but she still thought it was beautiful.</p><p>By one o\u2019clock in the morning she was pulling back the sheets and slipping into her bed next to Dylan. He was already sound asleep. She\u2019d taken a long, soothing shower. Exhausted now, she was certain she\u2019d be out the second her head hit the pillow.</p><p>She had to tug her pillow out from under him first. She\u2019d just gotten comfortable when the trembling started. Within seconds she was violently shaking. She couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong. The bed shuddered. If it had been on rollers, they would have been scooting all over the bedroom.</p><p>He came awake with a start. Lifting up, he squinted at her and dragged her toward him.</p> <p>Kate curled up against him, her head tucked under his chin. His body was warm and comforting.</p><p>\u201cSorry I woke you,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop shaking. I\u2019m not cold.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed her back. \u201cThe day is finally catching up with you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been operating on adrenaline and fear.\u201d</p><p>A minute passed, and then she whispered, \u201cAre you ever afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Dylan thought about Kate inside the house with a bomb and a cold-blooded killer. He\u2019d been damned scared then.</p><p>\u201cDylan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Pickle.\u201d</p><p>She heard him yawn. \u201cI was thinking . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted him.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI had to trust him. I had to believe what he told me . . .\u201d</p><p>He tried to ease her mind. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you trust Nate? The son of a bitch was a cop. You should have been able to trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not Nate,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Florist. I had to trust him.\u201d</p><p>Dylan propped himself up on one elbow and leaned over her, waiting for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI followed the instructions of a man who admitted to me that he likes to blow things up . . . oh, dear heaven . . .\u201d</p> <p>She put her hand over her eyes. The enormity of what she had been through was finally sinking in.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have a choice. Isn\u2019t that what you told me? You had to trust him.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t quite ready to be reasonable. \u201cYes, I remember telling everyone I didn\u2019t have a choice. You know what I didn\u2019t tell them about The Florist?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hand away from her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt a little sorry for him,\u201d she said. \u201cAm I crazy?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cYeah, maybe a little.\u201d</p><p>She thought about the basket of flowers and how terrified she\u2019d been when she\u2019d cut the blue wire. That thought jumped to another, and she suddenly was furious with Dylan.</p><p>He was trying to kiss her. She pushed him away. \u201cYou ran into that house knowing there was a bomb that could explode any second. You could have been killed! Why did you do such a stupid thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were inside. That\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes welled up. \u201cThe bomb squad was there. You should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were inside,\u201d he repeated firmly.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou take stupid chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that criticism before\u2014from you, as a matter of fact.\u201d</p><p>He tried once again to capture her mouth with his own, but she evaded him. \u201cWhen did I ever . . .\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIn the hospital in Boston after my surgery . . . maybe the day after. I woke up and saw you. It felt good, knowing you were there, but I couldn\u2019t figure out why. You were always such a pain in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time you came to Nathan\u2019s Bay, you did something to annoy me.\u201d</p><p>She could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cGive me an example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you got to the phone, and it was for me, you came up with the most outrageous stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cYou told Janey Callahan I\u2019d enlisted in the French Foreign Legion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe one time, but if she was stupid enough to believe that, then you shouldn\u2019t have been dating her in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost a lot of girlfriends because of you.\u201d He kissed her earlobe. \u201cBut the worst thing you did . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ignored me. Drove me crazy.\u201d He let out an exaggerated yawn. \u201cThink you\u2019ll be able to sleep after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to explain. His body was already covering hers.</p><p>Dylan walked into Chief Drummond\u2019s office at ten o\u2019clock the following morning. The chief was eager to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cShut the door and take a seat,\u201d Drummond said. \u201cI want to hear all about it. Did Hallinger have any inkling you knew?\u201d</p><p>Dylan placed the gun and badge on the desk. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. Then he sat down and told him how it had all gone down. When he was finished, he said, \u201cI never would have figured it out in time if you hadn\u2019t helped. I didn\u2019t want to go to Savannah PD on little more than a gut feeling, especially since he\u2019d worked for them.\u201d</p><p>Drummond nodded. \u201cWhen you asked me if you could run something by me, and you told me about that peculiar remark Hallinger made . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he heard Kate turned the money down,\u201d Dylan finished.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You were already suspicious. You just resisted the notion. All I did was help out a little. After forty years in law enforcement, I\u2019ve learned a thing or two, and one of those things is how to get information fast. It didn\u2019t take too many calls for me to get a buddy to check phone records and credit card receipts that put Nate Hallinger and Vanessa MacKenna in the same place at the same time. Looks like they had a nice little rendezvous in Canc\u00fan about six months ago.\u201d</p><p>Dylan continued. \u201cFinding out Vanessa was sleeping with Nate. That pretty much put the nail in the coffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jackman?\u201d Drummond asked.</p><p>\u201cThey had to let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLack of evidence, huh?\u201d</p><p>Dylan nodded.</p><p>\u201cCrying shame,\u201d Drummond said.</p><p>They talked about the case a few more minutes, and then Drummond changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be retiring soon,\u201d he said as he stretched his arms up and clasped his hands behind his head.</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay in the area, of course. It\u2019s too pretty here to leave.\u201d</p><p>Dylan agreed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I appreciate. Boston\u2019s another story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like to fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGreat fishing around here. Do you ever think about leaving law enforcement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We need men like you. What about a change of pace? We don\u2019t have many homicides or bombs going off here. Kate\u2019s going to be the talk of the town for years to come. She\u2019s quite a pistol, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I was saying, I\u2019m going to retire. I could probably hold on another six months. What do you think? Will that give you enough time?\u201d</p><p>Dylan was gone.</p><p>Kate was just waking up when she heard the front door shut. She bolted upright in bed. She heard a car start and was instantly furious. How could he leave without so much as a \u201csee you later\u201d?</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>She kicked off the sheet and jumped out of bed ready to run after him and give him a piece of her mind because he hadn\u2019t bothered to say good-bye. Fortunately, she came to her senses before she left the bedroom. Good Lord, she was stark naked. Wouldn\u2019t that be a memory to cherish? A crazed, shrieking, and na*ed ex-lover chasing him down the street.</p><p>He probably left her a note, she decided, but she wasn\u2019t in any hurry to read it. It would just break her heart. She took her time getting dressed and finally went downstairs. She walked past his garment bag, stopped, and turned back. Now she felt like an idiot. He hadn\u2019t left for Boston after all.</p><p>But he would leave today. He was all packed and ready to go, wasn\u2019t he? A note in the kitchen confirmed it. He\u2019d written the flight number and time on a piece of paper. The airline\u2019s phone number was written above it.</p><p>\u201cYou knew this was coming,\u201d she told herself.</p><p>She sighed. Yes, she\u2019d known, but that didn\u2019t make it any easier. How was she going to say good-bye to him? She was a wreck just thinking about it. It would be mortifying if she cried. Don\u2019t let me cry, she prayed. Plenty of time for that after he\u2019s gone.</p><p>It was ridiculous to worry about this a moment longer. He was leaving, and that was that. Breakfast. Yes, she\u2019d fix breakfast because that was what a normal, rational person would do. And when she was finished, she would start her day, and the rest of her life . . . her lonely, pathetic, stupid, I-don\u2019t-need-anyone life.</p><p>She grabbed a box of Cheerios out of the pantry and opened it. She didn\u2019t bother pouring some into a bowl. She stood at the sink looking out at the overgrown garden while she ate dry cereal.</p><p>How would Dylan handle their good-bye? With style, she supposed. Yes, style. He was a pro, after all. With all of his experience, he had to have the routine down pat. There had been so many women over the years he\u2019d kissed good-bye.</p><p>And now Kate was one of them.</p><p>How could she have been so stupid? This broken heart was her own fault. Dylan hadn\u2019t tricked her into falling in love with him. She knew what he was.</p><p>She\u2019d spent all those weekends on Nathan\u2019s Bay with Jordan and the Buchanans, and every weekend that Dylan and his brothers joined them, the phone never stopped ringing. The callers were invariably female, and they were always looking for Dylan.</p><p>It drove her nuts. And he was still driving her nuts.</p><p>Kate would concentrate on keeping her emotions under control until he left. Surely she could come up with something clever to say . . . and she hoped to be inspired any minute now. She heard the front door open.</p><p>\u201cKate?\u201d he called.</p><p>And there he was, standing in the doorway, looking almost too good to be out in public. No wonder women flocked to him. He was irresistible.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving,\u201d she blurted. Oh, boy, that was inspired.</p><p>\u201cIn a little while, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cPlease, no explanations are needed. I appreciate your help with . . . you know, the craziness, but now it\u2019s time for you to go home. Your life is in Boston.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkled. What was he thinking? And why was he so obviously amused? Good-byes weren\u2019t funny.</p><p>\u201cAnd my life is here,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m not going to move my company to Boston. This is where I belong. I watched that video, and I know I\u2019m nothing like Compton, but listening to him made me realize I don\u2019t want to be on the fast track, and I don\u2019t want to become obsessed with building my company. I\u2019ll expand, but at my own pace. However,\u201d she added, \u201cthere will be times when I\u2019m in Boston visiting Jordan, and we\u2019re bound to run into each other. It\u2019s inevitable. I don\u2019t want what happened between us . . . why are you smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to give me the \u2018that was then, this is now\u2019 speech again, are you?\u201d</p><p>Well, she wouldn\u2019t now. \u201cGood-bye,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to say.\u201d</p><p>She considered kissing him on the cheek and telling him she\u2019d miss him, but she decided not to. If she got too close, she\u2019d probably throw herself into his arms and start crying.</p><p>\u201cIs it my turn yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Here it comes, she thought. The smooth good-bye.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, bracing herself.</p><p>He was casually leaning against the door, acting as though he had all the time in the world to dump her. \u201cI used to hate pickles when I was a kid. It\u2019s an acquired taste,\u201d he explained. \u201cI love them now.\u201d</p><p>Now that, she had to admit, was a unique beginning.</p><p>\u201cAnd I call you pickle.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a quizzical frown.</p><p>He pulled away from the door. \u201cJeez, Kate, put it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you love lots of foods. You love black olives and pretzels and sweet corn and pizza and hot peppers and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Those are all really swell foods. But . . . I only love pickles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the strangest good-bye . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying good-bye. I\u2019m saying I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love . . . you what? No, you don\u2019t.\u201d She waved the cereal box around as she reacted. \u201cDon\u2019t say . . . you can\u2019t . . . \u201c Cheerios were flying everywhere.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I ran into you on Nathan\u2019s Bay, you interfered with my love life. You were such a pain. When you weren\u2019t screwing things up, you were acting like I wasn\u2019t there. I was so damned mad at you all the time, but I kept coming back for more. Then it occurred to me that I always made it a point to find out when you were going to be there for the weekend, and I\u2019d show up, too. Yes, I love you. It just took me awhile to figure it out. And when I did, I started calling you \u201cpickle\u201d just to make you crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I didn\u2019t much like being in love with you. For a long time there I thought you were ignoring me and it . . . unnerved me.\u201d</p><p>She pointed the box at him. \u201cWhat do you mean, you thought I was ignoring you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me, Kate. It took me awhile to figure that out, too. I think you\u2019ve loved me a long time. You just hadn\u2019t realized it yet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stepped toward her. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She was afraid to believe it. \u201cDo you tell all of your girlfriends you love them before you leave them? Now that\u2019s just mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill Murdock.\u201d</p> <p>She backed into the dining room. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill Murdock,\u201d he repeated, coming toward her. \u201cWhen she called the house, you told her I hadn\u2019t made bail yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather Conroy.\u201d He kept coming; she kept backing away. \u201cYou told her you were my wife, but you and I were keeping it quiet because we were first cousins.\u201d</p><p>Kate smiled. She\u2019d forgotten that one. \u201cActually, Jordan came up with that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStephanie Davis.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip. \u201cI don\u2019t remember her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t take her out because I had bubonic plague and was quarantined,\u201d he reminded.</p><p>\u201cThose constant phone calls were irritating people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey irritated your mother.\u201d</p> <p>He looked absolutely incredulous for a couple of seconds and then burst out laughing. \u201cMy mother?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI suppose they may have irritated me, too,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He was looking a little too arrogantly pleased. She wagged the cereal box at him. Cheerios exploded everywhere. A few landed in the chandelier above the dining room table. Two more landed in her hair. She had never behaved like this before, but then she\u2019d never felt like this before. Dylan trapped her in the corner. The only way out was through him. \u201cAnd why were you so irritated, Kate?\u201d Dylan asked.</p><p>She was afraid to believe him. He couldn\u2019t love her . . . could he? There was only one way to find out: commitment. If there was anything that would make him disappear, it was the truth.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you,\u201d she said.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t vanish. He just smiled. Shaking her head and frowning, she repeated. \u201cI love you. The door\u2019s behind you.\u201d</p><p>He planted his hands on either side of her and leaned down. His mouth was just an inch from hers when he whispered, \u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>On a glorious Friday afternoon, Kate\u2014with her sisters, Isabel and Kiera\u2014walked into the First National Bank of Silver Springs and happily ruined three lives.</p><p>It was a fine day indeed.</p><p>Following her instructions, Anderson had had a long chat with the new bank president, Andy Radcliffe, and had set up the meeting. There was quite a group assembled in Radcliffe\u2019s office. Leah MacKenna\u2019s former accountant, the weasel, Tucker Simmons, and his insipid wife, Randy, were waiting for what they believed was the transfer of Kate\u2019s company to them. Edward Wallace was also there. He was the loan officer who had added a few extras to the loan papers after Leah had signed them.</p><p>Chief Drummond was waiting for the sisters in the lobby and followed them into the office. Isabel and Kiera refused to sit. They stood with the chief by the door.</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t bother to introduce herself or say hello. She simply handed the president a file. \u201cInside you\u2019ll find loan papers my mother, Leah MacKenna, signed. You\u2019ll note she listed all of her assets. Now please read the copy of the original that\u2019s filed here at the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke into bank files,\u201d Wallace protested. \u201cThat\u2019s illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIllegal? Did you hear that, Chief Drummond?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>Radcliffe stopped Wallace from saying anything further. \u201cI pulled the files for Miss MacKenna.\u201d He turned back to Kate. \u201cNow, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see what was added?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhoever changed the document didn\u2019t even bother to imitate my mother\u2019s handwriting.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018And all other assets including the Kate MacKenna Company,\u2019 \u201d Radcliffe read. \u201cYes, there\u2019s no question this was added.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at Wallace. He jumped to his feet. \u201cI remember now. I had forgotten to add that little extra. I had done a search . . . yes, a search, and I found that Leah MacKenna was a partner in the Kate MacKenna Company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for interrupting, but who are you?\u201d Randy Simmons asked Kate.</p><p>Kate refused to look at the woman. Chief Drummond answered for her. \u201cShe\u2019s Kate MacKenna, that\u2019s who she is.\u201d</p><p>Randy grabbed her purse. \u201cI think we should leave now, Tucker. There\u2019s no reason for us to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit right back down,\u201d Drummond commanded.</p><p>\u201cMay I have a look at those loan papers?\u201d Tucker asked. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on. Leaning forward, he read the fine print and Wallace\u2019s notations.</p><p>He must have seen the incriminating proof because he suddenly stiffened. His head snapped back, and he discreetly but frantically signaled Wallace to stop talking. He was trying not to be obvious as he shook his head a bit, coughed to get his attention, and wide-eyed, shook his head again.</p><p>The not-too-subtle hint to keep quiet didn\u2019t register. Wallace plunged ahead, cocky now because he was certain no one could prove he\u2019d done anything wrong.</p><p>\u201cThis is all just a big misunderstanding. I added the Kate MacKenna Company to the list of assets, and I advised Mrs. MacKenna of the addition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou notified my mother,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>Tucker coughed and shook his head again.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI called her and advised her of the change over the phone, and she stopped by the bank to initial it.\u201d Turning to Radcliffe, he said, \u201cI like to be thorough, and I try to do everything by the book. You\u2019ll see at the bottom of the page I wrote down the date and time I talked to Mrs. MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoke to my mother?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>Tucker was doing everything but the wave to get Wallace to stop.</p><p>\u201cYes, I most certainly did speak to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been tricky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the date you wrote, you spoke to my mother three weeks after she died.\u201d Kate lost her composure then. \u201cMy mother was dying, and you knew it. She came to you for a loan to help her pay her medical bills. You saw an opportunity, and you took it. You hooked her up with Tucker Simmons and his wife, and the three of you had it all worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think Kate would just roll over and accept it?\u201d Kiera asked.</p><p>\u201cOr did you think that by the time she figured it out and realized what you had done, it would be too late?\u201d Isabel added. \u201cShame on you,\u201d she railed. \u201cOur mother would never have jeopardized Kate\u2019s company. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many others have you fleeced?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kate. I\u2019ll find out,\u201d Drummond said.</p><p>\u201cIf I lose my job because of these false accusations\u2014\u201d Wallace began.</p><p>Drummond interrupted him. \u201cI doubt you\u2019ll be able to do your job from jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker, take me home. Now,\u201d Randy pleaded.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be going home just yet,\u201d Drummond told her. \u201cThe prosecuting attorney has been busy all morning reading the evidence. I think he\u2019s going to have a few things to say about conspiracy charges first. Why don\u2019t you all come down to the station with me?\u201d</p><p>Drummond herded the unhappy suspects out of the bank.</p><p>Once the office was quiet, Mr. Radcliffe turned to Kate. \u201cI assure you the bank will give Chief Drummond its full cooperation in the investigation. We are also prepared to accept payment of your mother\u2019s loan with another loan\u2014an unsecured loan. If you\u2019ll drop by the bank tomorrow, I\u2019ll have the papers drawn up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it is I who should thank you,\u201d he answered. \u201cFirst National Bank is honored that you\u2019ve chosen us\u2014under Anderson Smith\u2019s supervision, of course\u2014to hold the funds for the charitable trust.\u201d</p><p>Kate and her sisters were smiling when they left the bank. The second they stepped outside, Isabel started laughing. \u201cYou just took out a loan and gave away millions of dollars. You wouldn\u2019t use any of your inheritance to pay Mom\u2019s loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have wanted me to,\u201d Kate explained.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do with land in Scotland?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter you graduate, go see it, and then decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Kiera? What will you do with the bonds you received?\u201d</p><p>Kiera shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet, but whatever I decide, it will have Mom\u2019s name on it.\u201d</p><p>They stood outside Kiera\u2019s car and waited while she dug through her purse for her keys.</p><p>\u201cHey, guess what?\u201d Isabel said. \u201cI heard the funniest news. Reece Crowell is engaged. Some European girl, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor girl,\u201d Kiera said.</p><p>\u201cHurry up and find the key,\u201d Kate urged. \u201cDylan is coming this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you set the wedding date, and am I in the wedding?\u201d Isabel asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t set the date, and yes, you\u2019re in the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were destined to marry Dylan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re so smart about men,\u201d Kiera said. She found the keys, and they were soon on their way home.</p><p>\u201cI am smart about men,\u201d Isabel insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to go out with Nate Hallinger,\u201d Kate reminded. \u201cHow smart was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered that man a beverage.\u201d Isabel was outraged.</p><p>Kate stopped paying attention to her sisters\u2019 conversation when they pulled into their driveway. She saw Dylan standing on the porch waiting for her. His flight must have been early. Excitement surged through her.</p><p>Giving away millions of dollars and taking out a huge loan seemed inconsequential now.</p><p>Dylan waved to her and smiled.</p><p>She had it all. </p> </body></html>"]
