He\u2019d been surprised at how handsome he was\u2014 how downright, fucking hot! Even though they\u2019d said he would be well-built and good-looking, Evan was still surprised at his size and muscles, and so damned turned on he hadn\u2019t really slept well since. This wolf was nothing like he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>The man they dragged past him was really large, at least six feet four, with an amazingly large, ripped body. Evan had never seen anyone like him before. Russet-colored, shaggy hair fell over his face, almost hiding his eyes, but as they passed him, the man had raised his gaze to sweep over him, and it felt like a red hot poker had been passed over his body. The wolf\u2019s eyes were an incredible shade of emerald green, an unusual color for a wolf, from what he understood. Wolves were usually darkhaired with dark brown, almost black eyes. This man\u2019s green eyes seemed to glitter at him from underneath all that hair falling down across his brow, and his lips\u2014good God, his lips. They were lush and full and sinful, and when he glanced over at Evan, he could have sworn the corners turned up in a mocking little smile.</p><p>Now as Evan sat across from his commanding officer, he tried his best to concentrate on what the man was saying about the wolf shifter. The offer he\u2019d made him was so incredible, Evan was having trouble wrapping his mind around it. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect for our requirements, Grant. We\u2019re offering you a chance to literally strike at the heart of these wolf creatures. How can you even think of refusing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see...from what I\u2019ve been told, they\u2019re vicious killers. My death might be a consideration.\u201d</p><p>The major leaned back in his chair and gave Evan Grant a hard stare. Quite obviously, he wasn\u2019t too amused by Evan\u2019s flippant attitude. \u201cThey don\u2019t kill their sexual partners, Grant. They dominate them. You\u2019d actually like that, wouldn\u2019t you? Isn\u2019t that what you enjoy sexually? Our investigations discovered you were in a relationship like that for over a year. We understand you\u2019re gay.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s flush was almost painful. He had always tried to keep his sexual orientation private, let alone the bit of kink he enjoyed in his private life. Living in the Bible Belt south, with very conservative parents and family, he had never chosen to make his sex life publicly known in any way. He\u2019d only just begun to recover from the break-up of the very serious relationship the major referred to so casually. There was no one special in his life at the moment. Sure, he\u2019d sometimes visited the big, anonymous clubs in places like Atlanta and Charlotte since Eric left, and he\u2019d done a few chats online, but he had no idea anyone had been watching him, spying on him. Damn! He still had no idea how the leadership had found out. His cheeks burned at the idea.</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably in the chair and raised his gaze defiantly. \u201cI could point out that you apparently have a strange idea about what being gay means. No, sir, I do not live any kind of BDSM lifestyle. I suppose it\u2019s beside the point to protest this intolerable intrusion into my private life.\u201d</p><p>The major returned his gaze. \u201cYou applied to be a Hunter, Grant. You didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be interested in every facet of your life? It may not be politically correct, but it\u2019s no secret our leader, Elias Winters, doesn\u2019t exactly have a warm feeling about gays, especially after what happened with his son, Logan. Look, our operation is top secret here. We need to know everything about everyone who\u2019s a member of our organization.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I refuse this so-called offer of yours?\u201d</p><p>The major shrugged. \u201cThen you refuse. You\u2019re only the first of many thatI\u2019m interviewing. We\u2019ve found these creatures to be insatiable, and our plans are to stud out this wolf-shifter to our other volunteers once he finishes with you. The more willing subjects we can have, the better. For our doctor\u2019s experiments, that is.\u201d</p><p>When Evan still sat nervously biting the inside of his cheek, the major continued. \u201cUp until now, we\u2019ve only tried the wolf bites, using some of our captured rogues with, shall we say, mixed success. Look, if you don\u2019t want to be involved, say so, though if you were really serious about joining one of the combat units, I could guarantee you a spot if you complete this assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Despite the fact that I\u2019m gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said Winters has a problem with homosexuals, but that doesn\u2019t mean he overlooks their value as soldiers in this war against the wolves. And Winters doesn\u2019t interfere with decisions I make about the men I choose for combat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly would I have to do again? Explain it to me one more time, because I\u2019m a little freaked out here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave sex with the captured wolfman. Of course, he\u2019d be in his human form. They call themselves shapeshifters. Look, I realize this is quite unconventional, but nothing about these creatures is exactly standard operating procedure. Most all of them are very powerful, very sexually active males. Handsome too, they tell me, if you like the overgrown, muscle-bound types. You may have heard of Logan Winters? Our commander\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a little. Didn\u2019t he live with the Dark Hollow pack as one of their...uh...mates? Until they killed him?\u201d</p><p>The major frowned. \u201cYes. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s true. He was their prisoner too, at one time, and the bastards forced him to mate with one of them, then assimilated him into their pack. We got our hands on him once, but lost him again and that time for good. They came for him and took him right out of our complex. Later we learned he was murdered by them, trying to escape. One of our top commanders, Major Dawson, was also brutally murdered, trying to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you want to pimp me out to one of them and expect me to sacrifice myself too? What good will that do?\u201d</p><p>At the major\u2019s stern look, Evan realized he may have gone a tad too far, using the word \u2018pimp.\u2019 But shit, this was his body the major was so willing to give over to a monster. What if the fiend decided to kill him instead of have sex with him?</p><p>\u201cGrant, I know this is unconventional, to say the least, and if there were any other way...the doctors tell us we have to get blood samples of the creatures\u2019 sexual partners for them. Something made Logan different from the subjects we have tested. He never shifted his form the entire time we had him here as long as he drank the blood of the wolf who mated with him. The others we\u2019ve experimented on have changed form during a full moon. We need to find out why Logan never changed and what the substance was in his blood that prevented it. How else can we do it? We\u2019ve tried to kidnap one of their mates, but it\u2019s not possible. They\u2019re too closely guarded. No, we need to create our own test subjects from a combination of the bite and the sex.\u201d</p><p>The major stood up and paced around the room. \u201cI assure you we\u2019ll keep this a controlled experiment. You won\u2019t be physically harmed in any way. Everything will happen here at the compound. Once the captive male...um...mates with you we can take blood tests, examine you. See what chemicals the bite excretes into your blood, if any. Possibly we can come up with some kind of antidote. If we\u2019d had one when we had Logan Winters back with us, we might have been able to save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have him back here at the compound for a while? Why didn\u2019t you take some of his blood then? And back up\u2014a few minutes ago, yousaid you\u2019d had \u2018mixed success\u2019 with the bites. What exactly did you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe did tests on Logan. And we found nothing, but Logan was bitten weeks before we got our hands on him. The chemicals could have already dissipated or been absorbed into his body. If we had a controlled experiment here in our facility, and we could test the blood immediately after the victim was bitten, then we might be able to find an answer. As to the last part of your question, nothing serious or fatal happened with just the bite to change our subjects. Many of them are in training now as a special force we call Wolfsbane. You\u2019ll join them after the experiment. For now, we just want more information about how the sex might change the experiments.\u201d</p><p>He stopped to perch on the edgeof his desk and lean forward. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Grant? If we find an antidote, we could possibly free all of the unwilling human victims of these monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, what if you don\u2019t?\u201d Evan ran a hand over his face. \u201cThen I\u2019m stuck being this \u2018test subject\u2019\u2014this mate thing forever?\u201d</p><p>The major looked annoyed. \u201cYou\u2019re not a blood mate, Grant. They\u2019re the only ones who get \u2018stuck\u2019 as far as we know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Logan Winters? Was he a blood mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan was a special case. They wanted to make an example of him because of his father.\u201d The major fixed him with a direct stare. \u201cLook, Grant, we finally have a shifter captive here ready for you. Our doctors are top notch. They\u2019re confident they\u2019ll find an antidote.\u201d</p><p>Evan was silent. This was all a bit much to take in at once. Something didn\u2019t ring true about all of this.</p><p>\u201cI realize this is potentially life-changing, Grant, and a huge sacrifice on your part, but think of what you\u2019ll be doing for humanity\u2014for those poor victims. As an extra incentive, the blood gives you more strength and agility, even makes you better looking, they tell me. Much longer life too, so it\u2019s not all negative. It will greatly advance your career here with us, I can promise you. We\u2019ll give you a little time\u2014think it over and make your decision. Meet the captive before you decide, if you want. Have a conversation with him. I can have you assigned to be one of his personal guards. Look, the mating is only for one night. What do you say? Will you do it?\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Evan nodded. This was what he\u2019d signed up for after all, the chance to be a hero, to make a difference. If this experiment could actually save some of the victims, how could he say no?</p><p>The major clasped his hand and slapped him on the shoulder. \u201dGood man! I\u2019ll get the paperwork processed right away. In the meantime, wait to hear from me, and we\u2019ll contact you just as soon as we find a test subject.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ushering Evan to the door, the major was all business now that he\u2019d secured his agreement. In no time at all, Evan found himself outside in the corridor, wondering what in the hell he\u2019d gotten himself into. An image of the shifter\u2019s beautiful, glittering, dangerous eyes popped into his head, and he got weak in the knees. Damn, this thing might just be the death of him after all.</p><p>Evan walked slowly down the hall toward the cell where the wolf was being held. Damn it, not just held\u2014he was being chained, half-starved, beaten and tortured. The major had informed Evan his wolf had been \u201ca bit combative.\u201d Their answer to his resistance was apparently to beat him half to death from what the other guards told him. Evan hadn\u2019t signed on for this kind of cruelty, and one of his first demands, he decided, would be to improve the captive wolf\u2019s living conditions. Strange how he already felt a crazy kind of possessiveness toward the wolfman.</p><p>It had been almost two weeks since his initial conversation with the major, followed by intensive physical and psychological exams. As promised, now that he\u2019d been cleared for the experiment, Evan had been assigned as one of his night guards so he could get to know and befriend him. He had been given the private number of the doctor in charge of the experiment and told to call when he was ready to begin the mating process. In the meantime, Evan had been encouraged to visit him, get to know him. He was told by the doctor in charge of the experiment that this would make it easier for him to have sex with the wolf when the time came. Evan shuddered just thinking of it. Whether the idea filled him with fear or longing, hedidn\u2019t want to examine too closely. After seeing the captive just the one time, he hadn\u2019t been able to get him out of his mind. Still, he was a little frightened. Logan Winters was dead at the hands of these creatures, not to mention countless numbers of Hunters. Evan quietly put his hand on the doorknob as he unlocked the door, and eased it open. The wolfman was chained to the far wall, and the light was so dim, Evan couldn\u2019t really see him. He could hear him though, his breathing slow and even in the small room, a few little stirring movements letting Evan know that the man was awake and aware of his presence in the room. He could smell him too\u2014not a bad smell at all, but something musky and sweet.</p> <p>Evan lit a small candle he\u2019d brought with him, not wanting to put on a light for fear of hurtingthe wolf\u2019s eyes after he\u2019d been so long in the dark. The other guards had been warned never to be alone with the wolf, and if he needed something they were to call for backup. Otherwise, they were to leave him strictly alone, and never go into the cell with him unless backup was waiting outside. Of course, that was for the other guards\u2014not for Evan. Evan had resisted as long as he could. He knew the wolf had been interrogated and tortured every day sincehe\u2019d been there.He had to wonder if this torture weren\u2019t some way to coerce Evan into mating with the wolf more quickly. He knew the brass was upset with him for taking time to get used to the wolf.</p><p>Evan had made no secret of the fact he hated the violent treatment of the wolf captives. When they had their last conversation, the major even implied that Evan\u2019s greater haste in doing thedoctor\u2019s experiment would end the daily suffering of the creature, and it was true hecouldn\u2019t continue to stand by and do nothing while this wolfman was tortured and beaten. Not in all good conscience. He abhorred this cruelty and didn\u2019t see any need to treat him like this.</p><p>I f he were being honest, it wasn\u2019t just his strong sense of right and wrong.He\u2019d never felt as drawn to anyone so quickly before in his life, sincethe first moment he\u2019d seen the huge man being escorted down the corridor to his cell.</p><p>When they\u2019d first brought the wolf shifter past his guard station in the basement of the huge Hunter\u2019s complex, he\u2019d been surprised at how handsome he was. Even though they\u2019d said he would be well-built and good-looking, he was still surprised at his size and muscles, and so damned turned on he hadn\u2019t really slept well since. This wolf was nothing like he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>The light from the candle now allowed Evan to just make out the prisoner across the room, his hands chained to hooks in the floor, along with his ankles. He had only a few inches that he could move in any direction, and he couldn\u2019t even lie down if he wanted to. All he could do was lean back against the cell wall, as he was doing now, though the pain of that contact on his whipped back must be excruciating.</p> <p>He was blindfolded, a strip of leather wound tightly around his eyes, so that even if he tipped back his head, he couldn\u2019t catch a glimpse of his surroundings. Evan knew from his recent training that this was more a form of psychological torture, denying the prisoner knowledge of his surroundings or of what was about to happen to him next.</p><p>The wolf sat quietly in his chains, waiting. As Evan walked a little closer, the man tipped up his chin, sniffing the air ever so slightly. Again, Evan wondered if, like an animal, the wolfman could smell him, his fear, his hesitation, his raging damn hormones, because goddamn, the man was gorgeous. Even in the dim light of the candle, his hair gleamed and the sun darkened skin of his chest looked silky smooth. Evan wanted to touch that skin so badly. He wanted to run his tongue over those dark brown nipples and tease them between his teeth. Fuck, admit it. He wanted to bang him like a drum.</p><p>Evan took a deep breath. Up close, the musky-sweet smell was even stronger. He stepped closer, keeping his voice low and steady.\u201cI\u2019ve brought you some food. Not that awful swill they\u2019ve been giving you, but some stuff I brought from home. Just some sandwiches and juice, but...\u201d His voice trailed off as the wolf made no sign that he\u2019d even heard him, just a brief tightening of his perfect lips.</p><p>Evan set the sandwiches down within reach of his hand and then quickly stepped back. \u201cI brought some aspirin too.It\u2019s there on top of the sandwiches. It\u2019s not going to help much, I know, but it\u2019s all I had at home.\u201d</p><p>Evan stood there for another second or two, feeling stupid. He began to back slowly toward the door.He\u2019d been a fool to come, but he\u2019d felt he had to do something. He knew the Hunters were the most hated enemies of the wolves\u2014the guy probably felt nothing but the deepest contempt for him. He might even be afraid to eat the sandwiches, thinking they were poisoned or something. As he backed slowly toward the door, Evan thought he should say something, anything to break this strange tension in the room.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not poisoned or drugged or anything. I wouldn\u2019t do that.I just don\u2019t like how they\u2019re treating you. It\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>The man still sat stolidly in the same place.Evan didn\u2019t think he\u2019d moved the whole time he\u2019d been in the room with him. Sighing, he turned and started out the door when he heard a deep, wellmodulated voice from behind him, so quiet he couldn\u2019t even be sure he\u2019d heard it.</p><p>\u201cJust how am I supposed to eat this? Should I lap it from the floor like the dog you people think I am?\u201d</p><p>Evan whirled around to face him, but he still hadn\u2019t moved, and he half wondered if he had hallucinated hearing the words.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He moved back to kneel beside the man.\u201cI don\u2019t think that, no.I mean that you\u2019re a dog, or anything. Can I feed it to you? Would that be all right?\u201d</p><p>The man sat so quietly that for a moment Evan thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer. Then just as Evan began feeling really foolish kneeling there by his feet, he inclined his head.</p><p>Evan felt unreasonably pleased. He quickly unscrewed the cap from the bottle of juice and took the aspirin first, holding the tablets to the man\u2019s lips.</p><p>When the tip of his tongue, his beautiful, pink tongue, came out between his lips and ever so slightly touched Evan\u2019s fingers as he accepted the aspirin, Evan felt weak in the knees. He had to sit down beside him.</p><p>Over the course of the next few minutes, Evan carefully held the sandwich halves to his lips for him to take a bite, and watched him while he chewed. Occasionally, his lips would touch Evan\u2019s fingers and once, his tongue. Each time it happened, the slight contact went straight to Evan\u2019s cock. God, he was so perfect, from his even white teeth to his perfectly sculpted jaw line, and his straight, aquiline nose that twitched from time to time ever so slightly, as if he smelled something he couldn\u2019t quite identify, though once he made a soft little moaning sound deep in his throat afterward, like he was moved by the scent in some way.</p><p>When he finished feeding him, Evan didn\u2019t quite know what to say or do. He got unsteadily to his feet.\u201cWell, uh..that\u2019s it. I can bring more tomorrow, if you like.\u201d</p> <p>The wolf didn\u2019t say anything. There was just a slight twitching at the corner of his mouth as if to indicate it was a stupid question, not really worth answering.</p><p>\u201cUh, okay, so see you later then.\u201d Evan turned and stumbled his way toward the door in the dim light, something about this man making him feel unsure of himself.</p><p>As he got to the door, he heard the deep tones behind him again.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said quickly and turned, feeling unreasonably pleased.</p><p>Evan retreated back to his guard station. Usually, third shift was very quiet, so he didn\u2019t have any real duties to perform. He could have stayed longer and the doctors would have been pleased for him to do so, but the wolfman made him feel nervous and off balance. When he was with him all he wanted to do was touch him.</p><p>Did the wolfman realize how he had affected him? Could a man who was half beast actually smell his raging hormones and the pre-cum that started leaking from his stupid cock the minute he smelled the guy? Because, oh yeah, the smell he\u2019d been noticing was radiating off the wolf, a crazy, delicious smell like cookies baking in an oven, for Christ\u2019s sake. He would have thought it was only his imagination, but he had to admit to himself that the odor was all too familiar\u2014he\u2019d been noticing that particular scent at his house for over two weeks, and even in his clean clothes he took straight out of the dresser drawer. Evan had no idea how that was even possible, but there it was. There it bloody well was, and he thought he might just be going out of his mind.</p><p>Evan didn\u2019t sleep well at all that day, and when it was time for his shift to start, he felt exhausted and overwhelmed. Yet he found himself eagerly looking forward to seeing his wolfman. Henderson, the guard he relieved, told him the brass had \u201cinterrogated\u201d the wolf for hours that day, and it had taken four of them to drag his body back into the cell when they were through with him.He was still refusing to say a word, though, about why he\u2019d been caught lurking around the compound before they captured him. The top brass feared some kind of attack, and had been trying to get him to confess whether or not he was a rogue or part of a pack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All Evan could think about while the guard was talking was how badly they might have hurt his wolf. Unthinkable\u2014he needed to stop it somehow, but could he really agree to the doctor\u2019s plan?He\u2019d fed him again earlier that afternoon, stopping by the guard desk in the middle of the day when he should have been home sleeping, pretending to have left something behind the night before that he needed. When Evan offered to stay while the day guard, Henderson, took a quick cigarette break, it gave him the chance he wanted.</p><p>He\u2019d sneaked in to check on him and was alarmed and concerned to hear his panting breaths and see the rapid rise and fall of his chest. That smell of his was tinged now with the coppery smell of blood.\u201cThey hurt you again,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s hesitation and then the man leaned forward, ever so slightly, his breath catching in his throat at even that slight movement. Evan caught his breath too at the sight of his bloody, ruined back. There were places where the blood had crusted over, but many of the stripes from the lashes still oozed bright red. The stripes were crisscrossed in a pattern that stretched from his shoulders to his waist, and Evan suspected that they trailed even further down past his jeans into his buttocks and thighs. The person who had wielded the whip hadn\u2019t been kidding around either. The cuts were deep and gouged into his perfect skin. The pain alone would have probably killed a human.</p> <p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said in horror, pity wrenching his stomach. Without thinking, he reached to touch him, and the man winced sharply away. Evan pulled his hand back and dug into his pocket.He\u2019d brought the aspirin with him before he left the house, and even though it was like bringing a knife to a gun fight, he thought they might be better than nothing at all. He grabbed his bottle of waterhe\u2019d brought with him and held the aspirin to his lips.\u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s not much, but swallow these.\u201d</p><p>The wolf turned his head toward him, and opened his mouth to allow Evan to place the aspirin on his tongue and give him a drink from the water bottle. Evan wondered what he might see in his eyes if he hadn\u2019t been blindfolded. Would he look at him with gratitude? With hatred? Hedidn\u2019t know, but he had to try to help him, no matter how the wolf might feel about him. The man turned his head back around and sank back against the wall, and Evan reluctantly left before the other guard came back from his break.</p><p>All that evening he worried about the prisoner\u2019s condition and when he returned at eleven o\u2019clock for his shift, he had not only food, but antiseptic cream and some extra strength pain reliever he\u2018d bought at the pharmacy on the way in. The pharmacist had promised it was the strongest you could buy over the counter.</p><p>The second shift guy he relieved said things had been very quiet, and the prisoner hadn\u2019t made a peep. As soon as he left, Evan grabbed a candle and tore off down the corridor. The sweet smell of the wolf was getting stronger all the time, so strong it was almost overpowering to him as he walked down the hall. As soon as he stepped inside, the wolf raised his face and sniffed the air slightly. Evan went quickly to his side and laid his hand upon his arm without even thinking about what he was doing. The instant he touched him, the wolf jumped and sharply drew back his arm as far as the chains would allow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Evan stammered. I didn\u2019t mean to...\u201d His voice trailed off, as he realized he had no idea how to finish that statement. What in the hell had he been doing touching him like that? This was a fucking werewolf, a monster, and he had to remember that fact. Another thought that he would soon be required to be fucked by this same monster quickly followed, but surprisingly, the idea didn\u2019t alarm him like it should. Instead it made his cock fill out and strain against his jeans.</p> <p>He cleared his throat and sat back on his heels.\u201cI brought you some cream for your back. If you\u2019ll let me, I\u2019ll put it on. It\u2019s just some antibiotic cream with a little pain reliever in it. Can I? Will you lean up a little?\u201d</p><p>The man hesitated for a long moment before slowly leaning forward and twisting to put his back to Evan.Evan opened the bag he\u2019d brought from home and first removed the still warm, wet washcloth he\u2019d brought with him, wrapped in aluminum foil. Carefully, he ran the cloth over the stripes, trying to clean off some of the dried blood. The wolf drew in a breath through his teeth as Evan worked, but never made any other sound. Next, Evan smoothed the antibiotic cream over the welts, trying to soothe him, and when he was finished, he sat back to survey his handiwork.</p><p>\u201cWell, that should help a little, but you really need to see a doctor.\u201d Evan heard how stupid the words were the second they left his lips, and he bit his lip, wishing he could call them back. Still blushing, he touched him softly on top of his shoulder.\u201cIf you\u2019ll slide down your jeans, I can take care of that too. The welts, I mean,\u201d he said, blushing furiously.</p><p>The wolf didn\u2019t move, and Evan thought at first he was going to ignore him, but then he lifted his hips and slid the jeans down to the top of his thighs. He wasn\u2019t wearing any underwear, and Evan thought for a moment his heart would stop\u2014shudder to a halt and quit.</p><p>The man was uncut, and the sight, while certainly not unheard of, was rare enough with the younger men he\u2019d been with to look a bit alien, even primitive. Not only was he enormous, long and thick, he was so hard he could hammer nails with his cock if he wanted to. Most strange of all, he had a strange roundish bulge around the base of his penis. It circled right around and caused his cock to have the circumference of a small baseball at its largest point. It sat right at the root, half hidden by his reddish bush of pubic hair. The doctors had told him about this knot and suspected some of the chemicals involved in the mating process came from this anomaly. It sounded kind of gross when they told him about it, but it wasn\u2019t at all. It was beautiful, like all of his wolf.</p><p>Evan consciously tried to tell himself to calm down and get his breathing under control. In a few more seconds, he was able to calm down enough to really see in the dim light that whoever had whipped his wolf hadn\u2019t confined the damage only to his back. He had seemed to take great pleasure in laying the lashes of the whip right across thewolf\u2019s penis and scrotum.</p> <p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Evan whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He reached out to touch the bloody stripes, feeling strangely out of control. That smell coming off his skin was clouding his brain, and he couldn\u2019t seem to think straight. He felt overpowered by it, as if he had to get closer, had to connect somehow with this beautiful creature.</p><p>Without any prior thought at all, he bent his head and pressed his lips to the head of his wolf\u2019s penis gently, pulling back the foreskin and using his tongue to swirl around the wide, silky smooth head, trying his best to kiss it better. Instead of flinching away, the wolf thrust his hips upward and a deep groan escaped his lips.</p><p>Evan\u2019s own hand turned traitor next and reached out to touch the wolf. He was hesitant at first, afraid he would cause him further pain, but he found his hand moving toward the knot. He couldn\u2019t have stopped it if he\u2019d wanted to. He took one finger and touched it, waiting for the wolf to pull violently away. Instead he pushed his hips up again into Evan\u2019s touch with a quick, urgent motion that both thrilled and terrified Evan. Evan moved his hand carefully up the shaft, thrilling to the response he received. When he reached the head, Evan\u2019s thumb rubbed back and forth across the slit, smearing the pre-cum leaking from it over the top.</p><p>The wolf cried out in pleasure and bit his bottom lip, moaning. Evan put his tongue down to the head and licked it. He tasted so sweet and salty at the same time. Evan licked his way slowly down his shaft, to the knot and let his tongue circle it gently. He sat back on his heels and then put his mouth over his length, trying to take it all in.He couldn\u2019t take it all, but he managed to get his lips down to the knot. Whenever his lips skimmed over it, nuzzling down with his nose, the wolf seriously went crazy, bucking his hips and making a sound half way between a moan and a growl. The sound should have frightened Evan, but it only made him more and more excited. He redoubled his efforts to give the wolf pleasure.</p><p>One of Evan\u2019s hands reached out to fondle and caress his poor, abused balls, as he took the wolf\u2019s cock into his mouth again. The wolf rocked his hips upward, thrusting his huge cock even deeper into Evan\u2019s mouth. Evan had sucked plenty of guys off before, but never had it been so intense, so incredible. He wanted nothing but to pleasure him, to make him cry out again from the mindless intensity. The wolf pulled at his restraints, and Evan knew he wanted to put his hands at the back of his head to hold him in place, but he didn\u2019t need to. Evan had no intentions of going anywhere.</p><p>Another deep thrust and the wolf was spilling into his mouth. Though Evan had rarely ever swallowed another man\u2019s spunk before, he wanted this wolf\u2019s in a way he wouldn\u2019t have thought possible.Condoms weren\u2019t necessary with a wolf, the doctor had told him, as they were mostly immune to human disease. His cum was salty, yet had a sweet taste that Evan could get used to. He swallowed it down and then raised his head to cover the wolf\u2019s mouth with his own, letting him taste himself on his lips.</p><p>The wolf kissed him back, but turned his head slightly to the side to whisper, \u201cBlindfold.\u201d Blushing, half afraid to remove his blindfold and look him in the eye, Evan hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The wolf\u2019s voice became firmer.\u201cEvan, take off my blindfold.\u201d</p><p>Evan reached out without any further thought.Then, with his hand halfway up to the man\u2019s head, he stopped and caught his breath sharply.\u201cWait. Howdo you know my name?\u201d</p><p>Another slight hesitation, a tightening of the luscious lips, then, \u201cTake it off, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Evan shook his head, seeming to wake as if out of a dream.He felt like he\u2019d been under some kind of spell and was just coming back to reality. He jumped to his feet and backed toward the door.\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. He took in the scene before him\u2014the man chained to the wall, his jeans pushed down onto his thighs and his magnificent cock still curving upward proudly, only now beginning to soften a little.What in God\u2019s name had he done? Evan turned and ran from the room, slamming the door behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Brett sighed and let his head fall back against the wall in frustration. He\u2019d been so close to getting Evan where he wanted him. If he could have gotten him to remove his blindfold, even for a minute, he might not have had to go through with this elaborate game. He could possibly have seduced him into untying him, and then he could have escaped with him. He had just enough play in the chains to pull his pants back up over his hips, and then he sank back, too wiped out to bother fastening them at the moment.</p><p>He cursed himself for trying to push the young man too hard. Evan seemed a little frightened of Brett whenever he allowed himself to think about what he was doing instead of just reacting. Brett had to remember to take things slow. He was too close to having what he wanted to blow this thing now. Brett\u2019s ears pricked as he heard the key turn in the lock again and the slight noise made by the door as the hinges squeaked open. He raised his nose in the air and sniffed as the pungent odor of his mate hit him. Evan was back.He\u2019d hoped he wouldn\u2019t be able to stay away long. He forced himself to be as still and non-threatening as he possibly could.</p> <p>Soft footsteps approached him slowly, and he sensed Evan\u2019s nearness. He remained absolutely unmoving, not wanting to scare his skittish mate. Finally he felt the heat radiating slightly from his warm body as Evan sank to his knees beside him, and a tentative voice spoke next to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back. I\u2019m sorry I ran out of here like that, but I got a little freaked out.\u201d He took a deep breath.\u201cListen, I never should have taken advantage of you like that. It was totally my fault and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Brett took a deep breath, almost afraid to speak and chase him away again. Instead he remained silent, allowing Evan to say whatever he needed to say.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me to treat you like that\u2014to do that to you when you were tied and helpless.\u201d</p><p>Brett shook his head and spoke up quietly.\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. You only thought to bring me comfort.I wanted it too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know my name?\u201d</p><p>Brett hesitated a moment, thinking of the most non-threatening way he could claim to have learned his name.Even if it meant being untruthful, he couldn\u2019t afford to have Evan panic and rush out again. Time was running out. He pushed his shoulders up slightly in a shrug and lied.\u201cI asked the other guard who you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Brett could hear the surprise and skepticism in his voice, but Brett kept his face stoic, revealing nothing.\u201cI didn\u2019t know he came in here to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Was that a hint of jealousy Brettdetected in Evan\u2019s tone? A thrill ran through him at the idea and he decided to test the theory a little</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHe came in yesterday and took off these cuffs from my ankles so I could stretch out my legs. I\u2019ve had such bad cramps\u2014he massaged my legsfor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenderson did that?\u201d Evan\u2019s tone was sharp. Brettcouldn\u2019t see him, but he\u2019d bet he had a deep frown on his face. He could plainly hear the displeasure in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cYes. He told me he\u2019d take my blindfold off later on today, just for a few minutes.\u201d He sighed a little.\u201cI guess I can wait until he gets here, since it makes you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Right away, he felt Evan\u2019s hands at the back of his head, untying and pulling off the blindfold. He blinked a few moments even though the light was dim, and then he was gazing directly into a pair of the most beautiful blue eyes he\u2019d ever seen. Of course, he\u2019d admired Evan from a distance\u2014even from a few feet away once when he\u2019d been at the guard desk as he was brought by on the way to his cell.He\u2019d never been this close, however, and Evan\u2019s beauty almost took his breath away.</p><p>He was young, and his skin still had a dewy freshness. His hair shone almost platinum blond, and those cornflower blue eyes\u2014they were now regarding Brett solemnly. Brett wondered what he was thinking. He tried to focus enough to smile at him.\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Evan looked down, fiddling with a piece of lint on his pants. His breath was coming more rapidly.\u201cWould you tell me your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brett,\u201d he replied softly.</p><p>\u201cBrett...\u201d The sound of his name on Evan\u2019s lips suddenly made Brett\u2019s crotch tighten. \u201cDo you...do you know what they have planned for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brett said quietly.\u201cThey\u2019re going to torture me again.\u201d He shrugged.\u201cIt\u2019s what they do here.\u201d</p><p>Evan shot his gaze up in shock.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. That\u2019s...that\u2019s...\u201d</p> <p>Brett gazed steadily back at him.\u201cDoes it bother you, little Hunter? I thought you Hunters hated all wolves.\u201d</p><p>Evan jumped to his feet and paced back and forth across the small room.\u201cNo, I hate this cruelty.I don\u2019t want you hurt like this!\u201d He ran his hands through his hair, looking frantic.\u201cGod, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could let me go.\u201d</p><p>Brett had spoken very quietly, but the words fell like a bomb in the quiet room. Evan stopped in mid-stride and stared at him, his jaw dropping open.\u201cNo...no, I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t just let you go. Besides you\u2019d never get out of here alive. They have armed security upstairs. No, it\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan, if you help me, I can get out of here. Let me handle the details.All you\u2019d have to do is get me out of these chains, and I\u2019d make it look like I overpowered you so you wouldn\u2019t get in trouble. Please help me, Evan.\u201d</p><p>Brett actually felt sorry for Evan as he watched him struggle with himself. He was so torn between wanting to please him on the one hand and do what he thought was the right thing and keep his oath to the Hunters on the other.</p><p>\u201cI know you swore an oath to obey the commands of the Hunter officers, but an unlawful order should be disobeyed, Evan. They should never ask you to violate your own moral code\u2014to be an accomplice to their war crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not at war.\u201d</p><p>Brett smiled.\u201cAren\u2019t we? Sure feels like it.\u201d</p><p>Evan flinched and lifted confused eyes to gaze into Brett\u2019s. His jaw tightened and he seemed to come to some kind of decision. Brett prayed it would be the right one. His next words dashed his hopes though.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you go.I\u2019m sorry. But I will help you\u2014I promise.\u201d He turned and this time ran from the room and Brett smiled to himself. His man had some backbone. He wondered how long it would take him to do what he was counting on him doing. Probably better to stick with the plan anyway. Brettdidn\u2019t think he had much longer to wait.</p><p>Evan had no idea, really, what he\u2019d gotten himself into when he\u2019d first accepted a friend\u2019s invitation a few months ago to come to a Hunter\u2019s assembly. He\u2019d been horrified and fascinated right away at the notion that such creatures as werewolves actually existed outside of horror movies. Not just existed, but thrived in large communities the Hunters called the Dark Hollow Clans throughout the southern Blue Ridge mountains. Once he found out the truth, he was hooked.</p><p>To be honest , he\u2019d been desperate to make a complete change in his life. After breaking up with Eric, a man he\u2019d lived with for over a year, he needed to get completely away from his old life and the apartment they\u2019d shared together. He\u2019d been totally blindsided by Eric\u2019s betrayal, but he\u2019d suffered through the black seaof depression he\u2019d had a hard time swimming out of. Without realizing it, he had ordered his whole life around Eric, and his loss made him feel as if he were floundering. It took a while, but once he managed to pull himself out, he\u2019d left everything and everyone he\u2019d known behind and had thrown himself into this new life. That was one reason he was so desperate to make a success of it.He couldn\u2019t stand to fail again.</p><p>If the wolfman \u2014Brett\u2014continued to try to talk him into letting him go, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be strong enough to keep turning him down. Brett was gorgeous and compelling, and most of all, he was right.They\u2019d probably wind up torturing and killing him in the end. Evan could at least put an end to this daily torture. He\u2019d figure the rest out later. Evan realized he\u2019d never been so attracted to anyone before in his life, surprisingly not even Eric.</p><p>He\u2019d contacted the doctor first thing the morning following his last confrontation with the wolf, telling him he\u2019d go through right away with the planned experiment.</p><p>The doctor in charge of the experiment was Dr. Cornsilk. A tall, dark haired man in his midthirties, he gave Evan a sympathetic look as he led him into the bedroom he\u2019d set up for the experiment.</p><p>\u201cNow if anything were to happen, there\u2019s a panic button in here, by the side of the bed. Anything too extreme, you understand, or if you\u2019re frightened for any reason. Push that and the guards will be in here immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Evan\u2019s voice sounded nervous even to his own ears.</p><p>He\u2019d thought it would take a couple of days to make preparations, but the doctor had surprised him by asking him to come in for a briefing immediately.</p><p>Evan glanced nervously at the big, king sized bed.\u201cWill we\u2014will he\u2014get started right away,then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I think so. He\u2019s been in captivity for a few days, and these creatures are quite insatiable sexually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what makes you think he\u2019ll give me a mating bite? What if he doesn\u2019t like me that way?\u201d</p><p>The doctor looked him up and down and smiled slightly. \u201cOf course we don\u2019t understand exactly how they make their choices for mates yet, but we\u2019ll cross that bridge if and when we come to it.You\u2019re a very nice looking young man. I think nature will take its course.\u201d</p><p>He patted Evan on the back when he blushed.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll have complete privacy with him. This room is even soundproofed, thus the need for the panic button. We don\u2019t think he\u2019ll try to hurt you in any way, but stand near the panic button when he comes in, just in case. This room is absolutely escape-proof too, so you need have no worries on that score. For the next two to three days, you\u2019ll be mostly alone with him, though I will be in to check you from time to time and bring the wolf food.From what we understand, he\u2019ll provide you with all the nourishment you\u2019ll need for the next few days.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evan sat down on the edge of the bed. The doctor laid a hand on his shoulder.\u201cReady? Don\u2019t be so scared. All of the victims we\u2019ve ever spoken to claimed to enjoy this experience very much, though I understand it can be quite\u2014intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntense like how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wolf\u2019s penis has that gland I told you about that encircles the base. Perhaps you\u2019ve seen it?It\u2019s called the bulbus glandis, which is present in most canine creatures. It was designed to ensure the females became pregnant when they received it inside them, and is always a part of the first mating. With males, apparently it provides extreme stimulation to the prostate gland, causing multiple and very intense orgasms. The first mating can take a long time, and you\u2019ll be \u2018tied together\u2019 for the duration.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid so, but only the first time. Are you wearing the anal plug I sent over for you last night?\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s face flamed as he nodded. Hell, yes, he was wearing it and it was damned uncomfortable. It took him almost an hour to get the thing inserted the night before, because it was so damn big he had to keep stopping, and then trying to shove it a little higher. Once he\u2019d finally got it in, he could barely walk.He\u2019d managed to get to sleep, but he couldn\u2019t wait to remove the thing.</p><p>\u201cIt should have helped to stretch you properly for this first experience. If he has relations with your afterward, his glandwon\u2019t be..um...inserted. You have experienced anal sex before, you told me.There\u2019s lube in the drawer. Oh, and insist he use plenty of it.\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded, his face flaming again.</p> <p>The doctor smiled.\u201cNo second thoughts? Cold feet?\u201d When Evan shook his head, he patted his shoulder and went to the door, stopping with his hand on the knob.\u201cI\u2019m about to bring him in.Get ready.\u201d</p><p>The first thing Brett saw when he walked in the door was Evan, standing by the bed nervously.He wasn\u2019t in his Hunter green uniform, but was wearing simple jeans and a t-shirt. Nothing simple about the way they fit his body though. The t-shirt hugged his torso, showing off every lean muscle, and the jeans...God, they were sinfully tight, and left little to the imagination. The idea that he\u2019d been wearing them in front of other men made Brett furious. Soon, baby. Soon I\u2019ll tell you what you can wear on that gorgeous body, and it won\u2019t be anything to show yourself off to anyone but me. Brett wanted him out of those jeans and naked on that bed just as fast as he could get him there.He willed himself to slow down and take his time. After all, they\u2019d have a lifetime together.</p><p>He was standing next to the head of the bed, near what Brett knew must be a panic button. Dr. Cornsilk had explained the set-up carefully. He stopped a few steps inside the room and let his eyes sweep up and down his boy. Brett had to play this game with him just right, if he was to believe it. He set his shoulders and made his voice harsh.</p><p>\u201c You? What are you doing here? What\u2019s all thisfor?\u201d</p><p>Brett saw Evan wet his lips and drop his eyes downward.\u201cDidn\u2019t they tell you?\u201d \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>Evan stared back up at him, his eyes very large and blue. He was breathing through his mouth and looked scared to death.</p> <p>\u201cThey want you to...to mate with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo mate with me. It\u2019s an experiment. They think you might secrete something in my blood either with the mating bite or the\u2014the gland thing on your...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d He sauntered over to the bed as Evan backed away. He flopped down on the bed on his back. A little smile played around his lips.\u201cWhat makes them think I\u2019d mate with you?\u201d</p><p>The heat rose to Evan\u2019s cheeks. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, of course. They can find you someone else if the idea of having sex with me is so repugnant to you.\u201d</p><p>He started for the door, but not before Brett saw a hurt look in his eyes. Brett called out to him from the bed.\u201cStop right there.\u201d Evan hesitated, then turned slowly around to look at the man.\u201cBringyour ass back over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t feel like bringing my assback over there?\u201d</p><p>Brett smiled.\u201cPlease, Evan, would you please move your sweet little ass back over here?\u201d</p> <p>Evan hesitated, giving the wolf a dirty look, his blue eyes flashing. In the end, he walked slowly back toward the bed, his feet moving like they were stuck in quicksand. But he was coming, and that was the important thing.You\u2019ll learn to follow my commands more quickly in the future, sweetheart. Brett gave him plenty of time, holding out a hand to him as he got closer. He took his hand and pulled him down onto the bed to sit beside him. Brett noticed he winced a little when he sat, and leaned to the side. What was going on with his little Hunter?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t want to mate with you, sweetheart. I just wondered what made them come up with the idea? And what made you agree to it?\u201d</p><p>Evan ventured a look directly up into his eyes and answered the first part of his question, ignoring the last. \u201cThey told me Elias Winters is trying to come up with an antidote for the blood match thing.Winters says it\u2019s too late for his son, but maybe it will help someone else if they can get their hand on another mate. They think it must be something from your gland, or something in the bite. They think if you...mate with me, then they can check my blood afterward. See what they find.\u201d</p><p>Brett put back his head and laughed.\u201cWell, good luck with that one! I think we might be as happy to find that antidote as the Hunters are.\u201d</p><p>Evan tilted his head.\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause some of us think it\u2019s a damned pain in the ass. The Blood Match is no respecter of sexual orientation, or age, or desire or anything else. You just see someone or smell them, more accurately, and that\u2019s it. No matter how illsuited you might be for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blood mate has a unique odor to the other mate. Sort of sweet.Hard to explain, but it\u2019s compelling.It draws us in and won\u2019t let us go. Then,after the mating bite, it\u2019s impossible to ignore, no matter what.Like I said, a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they\u2019re already mated to someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean\u2014they could be. There have even been a few rare cases of three people sharing the match. Unless they\u2019re into m\u00e9nage, one of them is screwed.And wolves don\u2019t share! Don\u2019t even get me started about the human equation. My alpha Marco has a human mate.He\u2019s a brat and nothing but trouble. They fight all the time and then make up with embarrassingly loud sex. The human is gorgeous and smart, but to my way of thinking he takes way too much effort. Always running away or storming off in a huff. Our beta has a human mate too. Both of them lead their mates a merry chase. It\u2019s stupid. My mate will never be allowed to act that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t like humans? I\u2019m guessing you would never mate with one. So where does that leave me?I guess they can\u2019t make you mate with me.\u201d Evan\u2019s voice seemed a little hurt, and Brett mentally chastised himself. He was talking too much. What was there about this human that had him spilling his guts to him and saying way more than he should have?</p><p>\u201cNo, I like humans all right.I didn\u2019t mean to give that impression. Some of them are quite beautiful and sweet.Hell, they\u2019re all interesting. And Ican\u2019t help who I mate with\u2014that\u2019s the point, sweetheart.\u201d He lifted his hand to the side of Evan\u2019s face. \u201cLike you, for instance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? But I\u2019m not your blood mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says?\u201d He reached out and took a lock of Evan\u2019s hair in his fingers, rubbing it against his thumb gently.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? How can that be? I volunteered to do this. When they first approached me, you hadn\u2019t even been captured yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you think I allowed myself to be captured?\u201d</p><p>Evan looked stunned. His mouth opened and closed. Alarmed, he started to stand up, but Brett pulled him back down, lying back against the pillows and holding Evan across his chest as he looked down at him.\u201cListen, baby. I know this is hard to understand. All this is a set-up, all right.But it\u2019s my set-up. Dr. Cornsilk is one of us.He\u2019s related to the wolves, though not by blood. He\u2019s the stepson of a wolf. Thewolf\u2019s human mate was a widow, and he lived with the clan since he was a baby. He infiltrated the Hunters years ago. He\u2019s only one of several people we have on the inside here.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s face was almost blank in shock. His mouth opened and closed several times. Brett smiled and put a finger to his lips.\u201cShhh...they\u2019re in deep cover, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you telling me this? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you because I know you\u2019ll never get a chance to tell anyone. I\u2019m taking you out of here with me, Evan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Evan cried out in alarm and this time he made it all the way to his feet before Brett pulled him back down and across his body.</p><p>Brett put a hand to his back and began rubbing gently.\u201cDon\u2019t get scared, honey. I\u2019m right here and nothing is going to hurt you. I did all this for you.\u201d</p><p>Evan straightened up, pushing Brett away.His face registered surprise and skepticism. \u201cI\u2019m not scared, I\u2019m confused! You\u2019re saying you allowed yourself to be captured to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. First, I guess, you need to know that mostall of what you\u2019ve been told about my people is lies.We\u2019re not monsters. We don\u2019t prey on humans, or go out looking for trouble of any kind. We only want only to be left alone to live our lives.We\u2019ll defend ourselves if attacked, and we protect what\u2019s ours, but I think that\u2019s different from being a monster, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded very slightly, but Brett could see that he was listening carefully.</p><p>\u201cAnd this experiment thing is not about what they told you at all. You were set up too, sweetheart. These bastards know just enough about the wolves to be dangerous. They know that once we mate with a human or even bite them, they have to feed from us. From our blood. If that doesn\u2019t happen, they become feral creatures, half wolf, half men.That\u2019s what they had planned for you, sweetheart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evan\u2019s eyes grew wider and he tried to pull away. \u201cNo! I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d</p><p>Brett shrugged.\u201cSuit yourself, but it\u2019s the truth. Elias Winters wants to create a new breed of soldier.He thinks he\u2019ll be able to create a squadron of feral Hunters to fight us. He even has a name for the plan\u2014Operation Wolfsbane.You were to be the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I believe any of this? You\u2019re lying!\u201d</p> <p>Brett tightened his grip on Evan\u2019s arm.\u201cWatch your mouth, love.I\u2019m a lot of things, but I\u2019m no liar. I\u2019m a gamma in the Dark Hollow Wolf Pack.That\u2019s sort of like a soldier. Rank and file, you know?It\u2019s pretty large\u2014three branches of the family spread out all over these mountains. That\u2019s what we are, I guess. A family. Many of us are related, and since we have the same ideas about marrying cousins that you humans do, we have always brought in humans to mate with us, if other wolf packs weren\u2019t around or we couldn\u2019t find our mate among them. We don\u2019t force our mates, though, or almost never. The beta of our pack did take a captive Hunter as his mate, but that was so they wouldn\u2019t have to execute him. I understand they\u2019re very happy now.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Evan looked up and nodded.\u201cHe\u2019s still alive? But you\u2019re talking about Logan Winters. He was...is the son of our leader and went missing over a year ago. We were told he was dead, murdered by the wolves.\u201c</p><p>\u201cA total lie put out by his crazy father.I\u2019ll introduce you to Logan if you want. We hate the Hunters, but we\u2019re not murderers. Besides, he\u2019s the beloved pet of the beta of our pack. Why would we kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beloved what? Wait a minute\u2014you hate Hunters? Do you hate me because of who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not! Totally different situation, honey. Logan was a soldier, part of a Hunter squad that attacked the alpha and almost killed him. They also shot the mate of the battle commander. As the son of old Elias, Logan was totally brainwashed too. It took our beta a lot of work to get that shit out of his head. No, those Hunters put themselves in a bad situation and they were well armed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill, I\u2019m a Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.Luckily you haven\u2019t been one for very long, though I do have to question your judgment in joining up to start with.We\u2019ll have to talk about that little lapse. No, I\u2019m not crazy about the idea of your being a Hunter, but I can\u2019t hate you, honey. Blood match, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me, Brett?I\u2019m confused! How did you find me? I never saw you before that night they brought you past the guard station!\u201d His voice was becoming a little hysterical, rising higher and higher.</p><p>Brett took Evan by the shoulders and gave him a little shake. He calmed down some, though his eyes widened at Brett\u2019s action. He seemed to all at once realize he was half lying across the body of a very aroused wolf, and he squirmed uncomfortably, trying to move away from Brett\u2019s erection. When he licked his lips, the tip of his pink tongue darting out between his luscious lips, Brett was almost done for.</p><p>Brett closed his eyes and bit his own lip.\u201cGoddamn, man, you\u2019re going to have to stop squirming around and looking at me likethat. I\u2019m hanging on by a thread as it is.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Evan stilled, almost holding his breath until Brett got control.\u201cSorry,\u201d Evan said with a tiny smile. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to get you all...you know...aroused.\u201d Another deep breath and Brett started again.</p> <p>\u201cYou know I was only capturedbecause of you, Evan.\u201d</p><p>He looked startled as his gaze bored into Brett\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI first saw you in that little steak place in Brevard. You know the one with the cowboy theme?\u201d At Evan\u2019s nod, he continued. \u201cYou were with a group of Hunters, and I could smell you all the way across the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmellme?\u201d</p><p>Brett chuckled.\u201cNot because you stink, honey. To me you smell absolutely delicious. Like something sweet.Have you ever noticed that about me?\u201d</p><p>Evan turned his head as he thought about it.\u201cYes, a couple of times when I came in your cell. I thought I was going crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will get even more intense after I bite...uh, after we mate. That smell is a sign of our blood mate. Some chemical in our blood\u2014somewolves say it\u2019s supernatural\u2014calls to us when we see our blood mate, the one we\u2019re fated to be with forever. Wolves mate for life, and we only get one blood mate. Well, that\u2019s the theory, anyway.For me, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? No, you must be mistaken!\u201d Evan shook his head in disbelief. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one knows. Anyway, I have to tell you I was pissed at first.Now don\u2019t get upset again, but I didn\u2019t want a human and especially not a Hunter. I actually struggled against it\u2014that was before Imet you.\u201d He had to stop and drop a kiss on Evan\u2019s face because of the hurt look that had lodged there.\u201cOnce I met you, I was totally hooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met in the prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I went back to Brevardto try to find you, but you\u2019d moved inside the complex and rarely came out.I got inside...\u201d He stopped again at Evan\u2019s look. \u201cYeah, we can get in the barracks if we need to. It\u2019s not so heavily guarded, and people are always leaving the back entrance unlocked. Very careless. Since Logan joined the pack...let\u2019s just say we know more now. I went to your roomand looked around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the smell in my room came from! It was you!\u201d Evan had a slightly accusing look as he realized why his clothing and underwear and even his bed smelled like Brett.</p><p>Brettblushed. \u201cYeah, it was me. I lay on your bed, sat at your computer, sniffed at your clothes. The more I saw you and smelled your scent, the more I had to be near you. The blood mate thing is a bitch, baby.It drives you crazy!\u201d</p><p>Evan smiled a little, seeming to be fascinated by the story as Brett continued.</p><p>\u201cI live with the North Carolina wolf pack. They have a big lodge called Mountainwood. I\u2019m sure you know about it. We\u2019re the largest pack. Sometimes we\u2019re called the Mountain Pack, and we\u2019ve had a lot of Hunter attacks.\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded. \u201cYes, we know exactly where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So anyway, Dr. Cornsilk had alerted us to the latest harebrained scheme of Elias Winters. Wintersdoesn\u2019t really give a shit about Logan, you know.He\u2019s just pissed because he\u2019s ashamed to have a son mated to a male wolf\u2014a powerful beta, at that. Marco, our alpha, called a meeting and I sat in as one of the gammas. That\u2019s when I came up with this plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that after you saw me in Brevard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of days after, yeah. I got an idea to use their own plan against them. I convinced the alpha to get Dr. Cornsilk to suggest you for the experiment, and I allowed myself to be picked up outside the compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know they\u2019d pick me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I was in your rooms, honey. I saw your internet browser.That\u2019s when I knew you were gay. Cornsilk used that to help get you chosen. To Winters, you were more expendable than a straight Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby, but it\u2019s true. That\u2019s the kind of shitoutfit you joined up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was so dangerous for you to be captured like that. And they beat you!Wasn\u2019t there some other way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, but it was also a chance to see the inside of this operation and claim my mate right under their noses. Too good not to go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty damn arrogant.\u201d He looked upinto Brett\u2019s eyes..\u201cSo you actuallythink I\u2019m your...bloodmate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t just think it, I know it. AndI have to tell you, it\u2019s forever. I\u2019ll never let you go once we\u2019re mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean you\u2019ll never let me go? I just agreed to let you fuck me, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brett pulled his body tight against his possessively. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Evan. Get used to it. Everything you knew is about to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange? W-What do you mean? The major told me some stuff and so did Dr. Cornsilk. Is it all true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably\u2014you\u2019ll be stronger and faster and even more gorgeous. You\u2019ll have to...uh...drink my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t do that!It\u2019s like a vampire.\u201d He struggled to get up again and move away, but Brett held him down again until he collapsed with a defeated sigh and a dirty look at Brett. \u201cDamn it, let me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not until you listen. The blood drinking is only once every couple of weeks once you settle in, and it will tastegood to you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, settle in? You mean, like forever?That\u2019s bullshit! I don\u2019t even know you! You even saidyou don\u2019t much like humans. I\u2019m just something this blood match thing forced on you. Go find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because I\u2019m hooked doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like it. We both still have free will to reject each other if we wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I want to!\u201d Evan cried out, pushing against Brett\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cHush. It would make you miserable. We could do it, but I promise you that you\u2019ll be sorry. You were all I thought about in my cell once I met you. I spent most of my time thinking about you, wondering when you\u2019d be back, hoping you\u2019d come soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Evan shook his head. \u201cNo, I-I can\u2019t think straight. That damn scent radiating off you makes me feel almost drunk. What are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust loving you, sweetheart.\u201d He touched Evan\u2019s face again. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. Pretty blond hair, big blue eyes. And this body...you were made just for me.\u201d Brett drew his face down to kiss his lips.</p><p>The second their lips met, a spark flew straight to Brett\u2019s cock. He deepened the kiss, licking at the seam of Evan\u2019s mouth until it fell open. He filled it with his plundering tongue, and swept over the inside possessively, mapping out his territory.\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered urgently against his lips, moving his hands down to wrap around Evan\u2019s rigid cock, straining against the material of his jeans and pushing eagerly against Brett\u2019s hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBe mymate, darlin\u2019,\u201d Brett looked down in Evan\u2019s face. \u201cSay yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Evan said in a dreamy, breathless tone, his eyes closed.\u201cI-I mean...I don\u2019t know...I just want to be close to you, to feel your arms around me. Damn it, what\u2019s happening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what you want, what you need, baby. Just leave it all up to me.\u201d</p><p>Evan took a deep breath and fluttered his eyelashes open.\u201cY-Yes, I want it. I want you.\u201d</p><p>Brett smiled and tilted up his chin with his knuckle.\u201cThen let\u2019s take off those clothes, sweetheart.I\u2019ve been wanting to make love to you since that last night in my cell.\u201d And it was true.He hadn\u2019t been able to get Evan off his mind for more than a few minutes at a time. Damned blood match! Yet he knew it was more than just the blood match. His kindness in caring for him, bringing him aspirin and sandwiches, even antiseptic cream for the lash marks on his skin. Then when Evan put his sweet tongue on his skin\u2014good God, Brettthought he\u2019d lose his mind.</p><p>Brett pulled at their clothes until they were bare, and then he reached for Evan, who was half swooning on the bed beside him, drawing him closer in his arms again. He was so near to having his mate now, andhe didn\u2019t want to do anything to scare him away.</p><p>Pulling Evan\u2019s body on top of his, he ran his hands down over his rounded ass, grinding his body into his groin. His hand drifted down to his rim and stilled as he made contact with the butt plug.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Brett pushed Evan back and peered into his face.\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Moving Evan off to fall on the mattress, Brett rolled him to his side, his hands busily prying apart the crevice between Evan\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>He touched the end of the plug sticking out of Evan\u2019s formerly tight little hole, making Evan shiver as it jiggled against his prostate. Brett chuckled.\u201cWhat the hell have you done to yourself, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Evanstruggled to move away from Brett\u2019s confining hands, but gave up after a few seconds when Brett made itclear he wasn\u2019t going anywhere until this new development had been thoroughly explored.\u201cEvan?\u201d</p><p>Evan slumped, his whole body going red and hot with embarrassment.\u201cDamn it, it\u2019s a plug. Dr. Cornsilk said to wear the damn thing until we mated.He said it would make it easier for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Brett moved it again, teasing Evan and making him jump and gasp.</p><p>\u201cStop, Brett.Let me take it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want it out, honey?\u201d he jiggled it again and tapped on the end of it.\u201cIt\u2019s in there nice and tight. Does it feel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s miserable.\u201d Brett tapped it again. \u201cOh God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, hold still, babe. I\u2019ll take it out.\u201d Brett grasped the end of the plug and pulled it gently, unable to resist wiggling and twisting it just a little on the way out. Evan squirmed and breathed hard through his mouth.</p><p>\u201cLet me up, Brett. Please.\u201d</p><p>Brett rolled him back over on his back, tossing the plug on the bedside table.\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going, sweetheart? Like you said, the plug has you nice and ready for me.\u201d He reached for Evan\u2019s rigid cock and ran his hand up and down the shaft, making Evan twist and groan. He leaned down and parted Evan\u2019s lips, letting his tongue go inside the other man\u2019s mouth to play. A prickling need was building up in Brett\u2019s body and he couldn\u2019t hold back much longer.He bent down and tasted the tip of Evan\u2019s dripping cock.</p><p>A strangled moan escaped Evan\u2019s lips and he arched his back as Brett swallowed him, teeth and tongue working over his shaft. Evan tried to retreat a little, the sensations maybe too intense, but Brett hauled him back, holding him by the hips.\u201cMine!\u201d he growled and put a finger under his hips and into his crease.</p><p>When he stuck the finger deep inside and crooked it over his sweet spot, Evan was overcome and his hips bucked wildly.\u201cI\u2019m coming! God, I can\u2019t stop!\u2019</p><p>\u201cCome for me, darlin\u2019, come in my hand.\u201d Evan\u2019s body twitched, and he arched up, almost screaming in ecstasy. Brett put his mouth back over his straining cock and caught every drop in his mouth, keeping the suction up until Evan was squirming and moaning.</p><p>Brett turned him over and trailed hot kisses down his back, while his fingers went underneath him, holdingEvan\u2019s chest tightly, tweaking at his nipples. Evan was sagging, already seeming drunk with Brett\u2019s lovemaking, but Brett was far from being done. He moved down his back and his tongue bathed and teased at Evan\u2019s abused and stretched entrance. Evan\u2019s hole began to quiver and pulse, and Brett smiled in anticipation.\u201cSee how your body responds to me, baby?That\u2019s because you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p> <p>Evan trembled and clutched the pillow under his head while Brett opened the drawer next to the bed and pulled out the lube. He lavished it over his cock and Evan\u2019s hole. Evan writhed and bit into the pillow he held to him so desperately. The gamma wolfpulled Evan\u2019s hips up to put his ass in the air. Thick fingers in his ass had him groaning, yet pushing back for more.</p><p>\u201cEven after that plug, this is gonna hurt.Push back as hard as you can, okay?\u201d</p><p>Brettpushed the head of his cock into Evan\u2019s ass slowly, making him drop his head to the mattress, his dick softening at the pain.\u201cYou\u2019re stretched pretty well, but you\u2019re tense. Relax, baby.I won\u2019t move much at first. Just get used to feeling filled up with me inside you. My cock is pretty thick, so the knot is not too much bigger.We\u2019ll take this nice and slow.\u201d He reached around and pumped Evan\u2019s dick with his fist, his thumb rubbing across the sensitive slit.</p><p>\u201cThis is it, baby. You\u2019ll belong to me, now. I own you..\u201d He began to move slowly, thrusting deeper and deeper. Evan thrust back against him, tentatively at first and then stronger as he became more excited.</p><p>\u201cFuck me, Brett. Harder!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, baby. But you don\u2019t need to come just yet. Not until my knot is inside.\u201d He began to work it slowly in, stretching Evan\u2019s hole. He reached for more lube with one hand and worked it around his gland. Evan screamed and tried to pull away, but Brett held him tightly to him and pushed him from the front back onto his cock.</p><p>Then, with a sudden plop, it was in and Evan screamed again.\u201cI can\u2019t! I\u2019m tearing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,you\u2019re not. Be still and push out.\u201d He licked the back of Evan\u2019s neck and bit down hard, sinking his teeth into the soft flesh. Instantly Evan relaxed, and Brett knew he was experiencing the rush of pleasure the bite brought to mates. Evan moaned in ecstasy and pushed out and back onto his cock, his ass now seated against Brett\u2019s groin. Brett held the bite for a long time, and then pulled away, leaving a mark that would be a permanent scar on the back of Evan\u2019s neck. He licked at it to sweep away the blood and help the pain, then held tightly to his mate for the orgasms that would by now be slowly building in his body.</p><p>The bulbus glandis brought on extremely intense multiple orgasms, bathing the prostate in chemicals and creating a steady pressure against it. Most mates didn\u2019t stay conscious for all of the orgasms, and once Evan\u2019s started, they were so extreme, Brett thought he would soon pass out.</p><p>He screamed and clawed at the bed, trying to alternately get away from Brett and then to reach back to him for comfort. Brett held on as tightly as he could, crooning to him and kissing him, unable to pull out until he was finished. Once inside, the gland had swelled even more and wouldn\u2019t release for a long time yet. All Brett could do for his mate was comfort him. After about the fourth or fifth intense orgasm, Evan slumped in his arms. Brett checked his pulse and kissed him tenderly, but there was nothing else he could do. He was tied inside his mate and couldn\u2019t pull out without injuring them both. He checked Evan\u2019s cock and it was still rigid and straining, though no more semen remained in his balls to pump out. Even in his unconscious state, his hips still jerked and thrust. Finally after almost thirty minutes, the thrusts slowed and Brett could feel a softening in his gland.</p><p>Evan was awake and had been for some time, too exhausted to move or do much more than moan occasionally. Brett pulled and his cock came out with a plop. Immediately, he rolled Evan over and saw his eyelids fluttering. He bit his wrist and held it to his lips.\u201cDrink, baby. Drink as much as you can.It will help you.\u201d</p><p>At first the blood ran down his chin and onto his chest, but finally he latched on and sucked. His eyelids fluttered and once he looked up into Brett\u2019s eyes. He was so beautiful with his red lips and blue eyes it almost took Brett\u2019s breath away.</p><p>Once Brettwas sure he\u2019d fed enough, he pulled his wrist away and turned Evan over on his side, pushing down his still reaching arms, and spooning him. Once Evan stopped moaning and trying to turn back over to get to him, he finally let the exhaustion overtake him and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>Brett felt almost too exhausted to sleep, the ordeal of the past few days still keying him up with adrenalin. Eventually, the soft snores of his mate and the comfort of his soft, warm body in his arms relaxed him and he drifted down into dreams of running under the moon, howling with his brothers.He didn\u2019t know how long he slept, but he came instantly awake as Evan was pulled roughly from his arms.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Groggy with sleep, Brett sat up rubbing his eyes. He saw two men wearing the green uniforms of the Hunters pulling an unconscious Evan from the bed and dragging him to the door. He roared in anger and tried to leap from the bed when a huge net was thrown over him, making him claw and growl as he felt himself shifting into his wolf.</p><p>Dr. Cornsilk stepped into his line of vision, holding up his hands. \u201cStop, Brett. No one is hurting him.I\u2019ll be with him every minute, and I promise you we\u2019ll bring him right back.\u201d He turned and hurried for the door to follow Evan.</p><p>Some of what the doctor said filtered through to Brett \u2019s brain, but hewasn\u2019t able to completely stop his shift. He felt his claws ripping at the net, shredding it so he could leap free and hurl himself against the locked door over and over. The heavy steel door sustained a few dents, but held against his onslaught. Slowly, he came back to himself and his claws and hair retreated back to his body. He was furious and restless though, pacing up and down in front of the door.He\u2019d known they would do this, take Evan away to test him like this, but he hadn\u2019t been prepared for how it would feel. It was agonizing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door opened quickly and Evan was shoved inside, still wearing a hospital gown, barely able to stand on his own two feet. Brett caught him in his arms, ripping away the gown and picking him up to carry him to the bed. As Evan rolled his head back and forth on the pillows, whimpering in need, his erection hard and urgent, Brett examined every inch of him. He found the place on his arm where they had drawn his blood and he licked at it to heal it. Satisfied his mate was in good condition, he pulled him back into his arms and took his throbbing cock in hand, pumping it hard and giving him release while he kissed his neck soothingly. Evan came in seconds and once he was spent, he turned toward Brett to throw his arms around his neck and bury his face in Brett\u2019s neck. He held on as tightly as he could, while Brett held him close and rubbed his back.</p><p>Over the next few hours he fed him again and made love to him twice. He finally settled him down and was able to snatch a few hours of sleep for himself, dreading the next time they would come for his mate.He couldn\u2019t stay here much longer. As soon as Evan was able to travel, he\u2019d get him out of this place and take him home. At the very least, they could make it to Mountainwood. Once there, Evan could rest and assimilate into his new life.</p><p>Late in the evening, a soft knock on the door came, and Dr. Cornsilk opened the door. Brett immediately tightened his hold on the sleeping Evan.\u201cNo. He\u2019s been through enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to take him, Brett.Calm down.\u201d</p><p>Brett pulled the covers over his mate and sat up on the side of the bed, turning to face the doctor.\u201cSorry, but it\u2019s been hard on him.I\u2019ve had to give him a lot of my blood,and I\u2019m a little lightheaded myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a tray sent in to you. It will do you good to eat and drink something.I\u2019ll give you some iron supplements too.\u201d He held up a hand at Brett\u2019s protest. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt, and it\u2019ll make me feel like I\u2019m doing something to help.\u201d</p><p>Brett shrugged.\u201cHow were the tests? Do they show anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo soon to tell yet, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll show a thing. I\u2019ve tested my own blood for years and never found anything.\u201d The doctor had been mated for the last few years to a female wolf who lived in the Dark Hollow pack. His home was in the mountains, about fifteen miles away from the wolf lodge, and his mate spent most nights with him, careful to sneak in only at night to circumvent any prying into his personal life. They were well respected in the wolf community for sacrificing so much for the good of the pack. After so many years, the Hunters barely bothered checking him anymore, other than routinely, but he was still careful to keep his cover.</p> <p>He nodded over at Evan.\u201cHow is he? Did he have any problems with the knot? Do I need to examine him?\u201d</p><p>Brett shook his head.\u201cNo, he\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve checked him. The orgasms were pretty bad, so they took a lot out of him.He\u2019s responding well to the blood.By this time tomorrow, I\u2019m getting him out of here.\u201d</p><p>The doctor nodded.\u201cI\u2019m staying at the complex until the experiment is over, so I\u2019ll be around. The guardswill come for him again tomorrow evening around five o\u2019clock. They mean to separate the two of you then. You have to make your move.Be ready for them.\u201d He glanced over at Evan.\u201cHe should be better by morning.\u201d</p><p>Brett nodded and the doctor left. As he sat on the bed, he went over his escape plan in his mind. If everything went according to plan, he\u2019d soon be on his way back to the mountains and away from the hated complex. He lay back down and gathered Evan in his arms. Just a few more hours, baby. Then no one will ever take you away from me again.</p><p>The next afternoon, Evan awoke, stretching his arms over his head and reaching for Brett. Brett must have showered earlier that morning as he now sat on the bed next to him, still wearing the same filthy jeans he was captured in.</p><p>\u201cHi, beautiful. Feeling better?\u201d He took Evan in his arms and kissed his neck gently. \u201cYes, I guess...I feel surprisingly good.Sore,\u201d he said, blushing,\u201cbut good. What time is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout three thirty. You need to get up and take a shower, sweetheart. The guards will come soon.\u201d</p><p>Evan looked down at himself for the first time. Crusty bits of dried cum covered his stomach.\u201cOh God. Yeah, I\u2019d better do that. He went to bounce from the bed and shuddered to a halt as the soreness really hit him.\u201cDamn. I can barely walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hot shower will help, baby. Hurry now, before they get here.\u201d</p><p>Evan hobbled into the bathroom as quickly as he could, feeling the burn deep inside. Good thing that knot thing only happened on a first mating and then rarely after that, he thought. His ass would never hold up. He hesitated then, his hand still soaping up his chest as he realized what he\u2019d just been thinking. This was a one-time thing for him, no matter what Brett had said. He was a Hunter, and had no intention of becoming Brett\u2019s bloodmate. They\u2019d come to extract him soon, and he\u2019d probably never even see Brett again, and that\u2019s the way it was supposed to be. So why did the idea make his chest hurt and his stomach churn with nausea?</p><p>He stood under the shower spray for a long time, relishing the feel of the hot water on his sore muscles. He scrubbed at himself and washed his hair with the shampoo the complex had provided. He got out and toweled himself dry, then wrapped the towel around himself and went back in to Brett.</p><p>Brett looked up and smiled at him, his green eyes lighting up. He pointed to the towel. \u201cTake that off. When I get you home, you\u2019ll be naked most of the time in our rooms.\u201d</p><p>Evan pulled the towel away and dropped it on the bed, stepping between his legs.\u201cGet me home? Look Brett. This is just a one-time deal.I like you and you\u2019re good looking and all, but I\u2019m not your bloodmate.\u201d Brett sighed.\u201cEvan, we\u2019ve been all through this. Yes, you are. We\u2019re mated now and you belong with me. We\u2019re getting out of here, and I\u2019m taking you with me to the mountains. You\u2019re just feeling confused, baby. You\u2019ll feel better when I get you away from here.\u201d He smacked Evan\u2019s ass lightly. \u201cNow get dressed before those asshole guards come in and see you again. This time I might have to rip off their faces for putting their hands on you.\u201d</p><p>Evan stepped over to retrieve his jeans from the floor and pulled them on, then slipped his T- shirt over his head.He needed to find some way to get through to Brett. He didn\u2019t want to go anywhere with him. Did he? He turned back to Brett and held out his hands.\u201cBetter?\u201d</p> <p>Brett growled at him.\u201cNot much.They\u2019re too damn tight. Oncewe\u2019re back at the lodge, you won\u2019t wear something so tightagain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous, much? You keep saying when you get me home, but I\u2019m trying to explain to you that this is just a temporary thing. I mean, I only agreed to this as an experiment. I appreciate the sentiment and all, but my life is here with the Hunters. Besides, what do you have in mind? You think they\u2019ll just let you walk out of here? We\u2019re stuck in here till they let us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience, baby. We\u2019re leaving tonight. I told you that you belong to me now, and you agreed, remember? You\u2019re not thinking straight. If you don\u2019t drink my blood, you\u2019ll become feral and play right into their hands. Unless you wantto be in their fuckin\u2019 feral army?\u201d</p><p>At the confused, yet horrified look on Evan\u2019s face, Brett nodded. \u201cRight. Get your shoes on.They\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! No, Brett. Promise me you won\u2019t do anything crazy.Don\u2019t hurt anybody!\u201d</p><p>Brett nodded solemnly.\u201cI promise.\u201d And he meant every word. He had no intention of hurting anyone\u2014if they didn\u2019t mess with him. He only wanted to get out of there with his mate.</p><p>\u201cBut what...\u201d A slight noise at the door made him turn around quickly, and that was when Brett moved so fast it was frightening.</p><p>He wrapped one strong arm around Evan\u2019s neck, the other around his waist, pulling his back and hips up close to his body. Brettcould feel Evan\u2019s sweet body nestled against his crotch and a strong feeling of protectiveness washed over him. His scent clogged Brett\u2019s nostrils, and it was all he could do not to take him down to the floor and make love to him.</p><p>\u201cBe still, Evan. Look scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Evan said in a choked voice. \u201cLet me go, Brett!\u201d He didn\u2019t know what was going on, and he really didn\u2019t think Brett would hurt him, but this violence scared him more than a little. He put both hands around Brett\u2019s strong forearm and tried to pull it down from his throat. He couldn\u2019t budge it, and that was when apprehension and anxiety overcame him. What if this had all been a lie? What if the Hunters were right and he wanted to kill them all? His throat went dry and he struggled in earnest.</p><p>The door opened and the guards came in.</p><p>Brett was amused to see the guards do an almost comical double take and then quickly draw their weapons.</p><p>\u201cStop right there,\u201d one of them yelled frantically, as the other one went for his assault rifle and took up a position behind the door.\u201cRelease that man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d Evan managed to yell as Brett made his way almost casually across to confront them. He still gripped Brett around the throat and waist, but was totally unarmed. Brett hated using Evan as a shield this way, but there was no other choice if he was to get them both out of there alive. They had to believe that Evan was his prisoner.</p><p>\u201cShoot and I\u2019ll snap his neck before I die,\u201d he said in a low, menacing voice. \u201cI promise you, I\u2019ll take him with me.\u201d</p><p>Evan gasped at the words and began to struggle harder, forcing Brett to tighten his grip around Evan\u2019s neck. In his peripheral vision, he could see Evan\u2019s face growing alarmingly red, and his legs stopped moving as he was deprived of oxygen. Horrified that he might have hurt his mate, he loosened his grip just a bit, but the sight of Evan\u2019s slump was enough to make the guards back off.</p><p>\u201cLet him go!\u201d one of them yelled.</p><p>Brett laughed shortly.\u201cNot fuckin\u2019 likely! Now back off and put your weapons down or I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could hear the guards\u2019 sharp intakes of breath at the words, and felt Evan\u2019s heart thumping wildly in his chest. His mate was frightened of him!Surely he knew Brett\u2019s rough voice was only for the guards\u2019 sakes.Their only chance lay in making the guards think he\u2019d go through with it.</p><p>There was a tense silence as the guards tried to figure out what they should do next. Brett yelled at them.\u201cI said put the goddamned guns down or I\u2019ll kill this worthless human! Do you think I won\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>He tightened his grip slightly again and Evan choked, clawing at his arm in a vain attempt to get air. He kept up the pressure for about tenseconds, or until he was sure he had the guard\u2019s attention before easing off. This time Evan collapsed over his arm, and Brettsaw that he\u2019d passed out, probably as much from fear and anxiety as from the grip he had on his throat. He pulled his body up more securely and watched the guard drop their weapons.</p> <p>Backing up a few steps, he called out to them.\u201cSlide those rifles and cell phones over here. Now!\u201d</p><p>They put them on the floor and quickly slid them toward him. He laid Evan on the floor carefully, his eyes never leaving the guards and picked up the rifle closest to him.\u201cGet in that closet over there,\u201d he said tersely, nodding toward it.</p><p>They scrambled over to get inside, and he closed the door on them, dragged a chair over with one hand to jam it in the door handle and called to them.\u201cYou can save your breath, boys. This room is sound proof. Sleep tight. Somebody should be along by morning.\u201d</p><p>Brett chuckled and went back over to Evan. He was waking back up and flinched when Brett pulled him back into his arms. It killed Brett to see it, but he had to make it look good to protect the doctor, not to mention Evan if anything went wrong. He dragged Evan out into the corridor, looking around quickly, spotting the security cameras right away. Once he escaped, they\u2019d be sure to pore over the tapes, so he had to make it look good. He held Evan up with one arm around his waist, but made sure his toes were dragging the ground, so it would look at lot rougher than it actually felt to Evan. Evan was making breathy little moans that tore at Brett\u2019s heart. He hated having to scare him this way.</p><p>He wanted to whisper reassurancesin Evan\u2019s ear, but this had to look real. Evan\u2019s body was limp as Brett dragged him up the steps and out into the main corridor. Moving with supernatural speed, Brett made it down the hall to the central lobby, completely surprising the guard on duty there.</p> <p>He stepped out of the shadows with Evan in one arm and an AK-47 cradled in the other. \u201cThrow your weapon over here, and I might not kill you both.Cell phone too.\u201d</p><p>Caught completely by surprise, the guard took one look at Evan\u2019s panicky expression and put his phone and handgun on the floor, sliding it over to Brett. Brett bent over to pick it up, motioning with his head to a nearby broom closet.\u201cGet in there.\u201d</p><p>The guard quickly complied and Brett closed the door, then with one hand pulled a big display case over in front of it.</p><p>He smashed the phone casually with his foot then gathered up the gun. Holding both guns in one arm and Evan in the other, he again moved with supernatural speed, tearing out the door and runningtoward Evan\u2019s car. He already knew from his investigations into Evan\u2019s routine exactly where he parked it every day. He put Evan in the front seat beside him, buckling him into a seat belt.He found Evan\u2019s car key on the ring in the dash, started the car and drove quickly toward the gate.</p><p>The guards, no doubt recognizingEvan\u2019s car, stepped out routinely to check him. With the gate still closed in front of him, Brett floored the gas pedal. As the guards jumped to get out of his way, he slammed through the gate, smashing the front of Evan\u2019s car, but tearing through and out onto the highway and freedom.</p><p>Driving swiftly down the road, the wind in his hair and his mate beside him, Brett experienced complete exhilaration. The adrenalin pumping through his body made hair sprout out on the back of his neck and his claws extend. Evan was slumped beside him, the only movement the rapid rise and fall of his chest. When Brett started to shift, he suddenly opened big blue eyes to gaze directly at Evan.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t react at all for about three seconds, and then it hit him\u2014he was alone in his car with a big, bad wolf already about a quarter way through a shift, and it seemed to be the last straw for him. He startled violently, unsnapping his seat belt and shying away from Brett as far as he could. He probably would have jumped from the car had Brett not been using the childproof locks.When he saw he couldn\u2019t get out, he backed up against the door as far as he could and stared wild eyed at Brett.</p><p>Brett tried his best to force his wolf back down.He couldn\u2019t speak very well when he was shifting, so he stayed silent, concentrating on calming down until he felt his claws retracting. Finally, he felt as if he could articulate normally and turned toward Evan, who was clearly panicked and almost in shock.</p><p>\u201cSettle down, baby,\u201d Brett said, keeping his voice steady and low-pitched.\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Evan simply kept staring at him, his breathing ragged and harsh. He wet his lips, looking as if he wanted to say something. At first nothing came out, and Brett winced, cursing himself for not knowing his own strength when dealing with him. He must have hurt his throat. It had been so long since he\u2019d been this intimate with a human he\u2019d forgotten how fragile they could be. Evan tried again, and this time his voice came out, though hoarse and slightly cracked.</p><p>\u201cYou already did. W-where areyou taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared.I\u2019m taking you to the wolf pack.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s big blue eyes opened even wider than Brett thought possible.\u201cJust let me go, okay? Please\u2014put me out here on the side of the road, and I won\u2019t tell them anything. Just let me go!\u201d</p><p>Brett could see he was quickly becoming hysterical, so he pulled him away from the door and slid Evan over toward him.\u201cCalm down, damn it,\u201d he said sternly.\u201cI told you I\u2019m not going to hurt you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me go, Brett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?You\u2019re my mate. I told you I\u2019d never let you go!\u201d</p><p>Even though his back was now pressed against the seat instead of the door, Evan was clearly a wreck. His hands were clenched so tightly they were white, and his eyes were wide and staring. Brett musthave scared him more than he\u2019d thought when they made their escape. Of course, it hadn\u2019t helped that he\u2019d seen him as less than human for the first time.</p><p>His voice came again, this time speaking to him like he was some kind of beast he was trying to calm. \u201cI helped you, remember? I wasn\u2019t the one who hurt you, Brett.If you\u2019ll let me go, I swear Iwon\u2019t say anything. Just stop the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you, damn it!\u201d Brett yelled at him and he watched Evan shut his eyes tightly and bite his lower lip.\u201cPlease, baby, be calm. Of course I remember,\u201d he said softly, cursing himself for losing his patience. He was scaring him pretty badly. He had to remind Evan of his earlier feelings. And he really needed to feed him again.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Evan\u2019s hand snaking slowly down toward his boot. It occurred to Brett he might have a weapon hidden in that boot.</p><p>\u201cEvan,\u201d he said, trying to defuse the situation, \u201cwhy are you so scared of me? I know you saw me partly shifted, but you know who I am. It was all that adrenalin, honey.I\u2019m back now, and I won\u2019t shift again. I promise.I told you I won\u2019t hurt you, sweetheart. I\u2019m your mate.\u201d Brett glanced over at him.\u201cYou weren\u2019t so scared of me before, back at the complex.\u201d</p><p>Evan was silent, biting his lower lip and looking down. His hand continued to move downward whenever he thought Brett\u2019s attention wasn\u2019t on him.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Evan. What\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t an animal back at the complex\u2014I forgot for a while what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?What I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fucking werewolf!\u201d He shuddered and cast another frightened glance over at Brett. His hand had reached his boot, and now swung upward wildly, holding a wicked looking switchblade. Brett\u2019s reflexes were lightning fast. His hand flashed out and struck Evan\u2019s wrist, knocking the knife andEvan\u2019s wrist away at the same time, causing Evan to cry out and clutch his wrist to his chest his face filled with pain, while Brett fought for control of the car. Brett cursed loudly. He had miscalculated his strength again. Damn it!He\u2019d wind up hurting his own mate if he wasn\u2019t more careful with him.</p><p>A road was coming up to the left\u2014or more of a grassy track, really, leading off up the mountain. Brett suddenly turned off the headlights and veered into the small, deeply rutted path. Evan cried out in fear and bounced on the front seat, grasping desperately with his good hand at the dash. Brett drove up the track at what must have seemed a breakneck speed to Evan. Actually, wolves could see quite well in the dark, and he knew every crook of this trail. He was aware of Evan ricocheting back and forth from the back of his seat to the dash, crying out in alarm. Brett threw out his arm protectively to hold him in the seat. He pulled the car over and cut the engine, turned in his seat and hauled Evan roughly into his arms.</p><p>Evan\u2019s face was right up against his, and Brett briefly registered how terrified he looked before he bent his head and took his lips in a searing kiss.He thrust his tongue inside Evan\u2019s mouth, sweeping it over his lips and the inside of his mouth, teasing with his teeth, holding him there until Evan went limp in his arms.</p><p>He allowed him to fall back against his arm then and look up at him with glazed-over eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you!Let me see it.\u201d He pulled Evan\u2019s wrist toward him and felt around it as gently as he could.\u201cDamn, it\u2019s bruised pretty badly, sweetheart, but it\u2019s not broken. Still, I\u2019d like to get you to one of our doctors right away.\u201d</p><p>He bent down and kissed his wrist, then turned to his lips, licking at them until they fell open. He whispered into his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. I forget sometimes how fragile humans can be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evan closed his eyes.\u201cIt hurts like hell, damn it! And what do you mean, fragile?\u201d He struggled a little to get away, but Brett\u2019s arms were like steel bands around him. He slumped in defeat and moaned a little.</p><p>\u201cTake off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake off your shirt. I have to make a sling for your wrist.\u201d He opened the car door and dragged Evan\u2019s unresisting body along with him, leaning him up against the car. Evan took it off awkwardly, using only one hand and handed it over to Brett. Brett tore it in a long strip to make a sling. \u201cThis trail plays out up ahead, so I have to run with you for a while. Hook this around your neck and put your wrist in.\u201d</p><p>Evan followed his directions sullenly, his lips white with pain.\u201cWe\u2019ll be going pretty fast, so just close your eyes and hang on.When we get to the top of this hill there\u2019s a small cave I know about and we\u2019ll stop to rest for a while.I can\u2019t take the time to do anything for you right now in case they\u2019re after us. Hang on, baby.\u201d He bent down and kissed his lips again. Evan didn\u2019t pull away, but he closed his eyes and flinched. Brett pulled him closer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flinch away from me.\u201d He bent Evan back across the hood of the car, taking him down until his feet were off the ground and he hung suspended by Brett\u2019s weight. Brett ground his erection against him. \u201cYou\u2019re mine now, Evan. I will touch you whenever I want. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded slightly, a frown still creasing his brow, but Brett let him down to stand on his feet.\u201cOkay, I know you\u2019ll hate this, but I have to carry you. You\u2019d never be able to keep up.\u201d He swept him up in his arms and began to climb, concentrating on the terrain around him, comforted by the smaller, warm body in his arms. Evan strained away from him as he climbed rapidly up the hill, and though Brett could still feel his heartbeat racing, he seemed to have calmed down marginally, at least. Whenever Brett held him close in his arms, he seemed to be calmer, even though he knew he was angry and frightened, trying not to show it. Okay, he was pissed because of his wrist. Not surprising, and not a problem either. He hated for him to be in pain, even temporarily, but as soon as he got him somewhere safe, he would feed him so he would heal more quickly. As a matter of fact, he planned on biting his wrist when they stopped to rest. It would provide a temporary pain relief.</p><p>The night air on the mountain became cooler as they climbed, and he snuggled Evan closer to his body for warmth.Soon they\u2019d be at the cave he remembered near the top of the mountain. He could already hear the stream splashing against the rocks leading up to the little falls near the cave. He headed toward the stream now, shallow enough that it only came up to his knees. After moving along in the water for about twenty minutes, he came out onto the bank some ways upstream, hoping it would be enough to throw off any dogs they might set on their trail.</p> <p>Evan had roused when they walked through the stream, and Brett was aware of him gazing steadily up at his face with curiosity and something else. Fear? Anger?He couldn\u2019t quite figure out all the emotions the young man was feeling yet. Brett already felt a strong mating bond with him, butit wouldn\u2019t be fully forged for a couple of days. Once they\u2019d fully bonded, he would be able to read every emotion, even read his mind at short distances. He glanced down at his pretty face once to make sure he was okay and saw that he was still fairly calm. Once he got him to the privacy of the cave, he\u2019d explain things to him. He hoped Evan would forgive him for scaring him so badly.</p><p>He hoped he wasn\u2019t still having second thoughts because of his training as a Hunter. Brett wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d come to be a Hunter, but he wouldn\u2019t hold it against him. He hadn\u2019t always felt that way. As a matter of fact, when he first learned his mate was aHunter, he\u2019d been furious and vowed to live alone the rest of his life rather than take him on. His alpha, Marco, had merely shaken his head at him.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to do it. You won\u2019t even be able to stay away from him for long. The magic in the blood match is strong.You\u2019ll only wind up making yourself miserable. Go see him again. Try to talk to him and see what kind of a man he is.If you condemn him just because he\u2019s a Hunter, then you\u2019re no better than they are.\u201d</p><p>Brett ran a hand through his hair miserably.\u201cIt\u2019s not only the fact that he\u2019s a Hunter, Marco. He\u2019s human too! I never wanted anything to do much with humans, you know that. No offense intended to Nicky, but all the human pets seem a little crazy to me. Unpredictable, ill-mannered, defiant\u2014they can\u2019t settle into life as a Werekin very well, and it only causes problems for any wolf who tries to tame them.\u201d</p><p>He glanced sideways at his alpha, hoping he hadn\u2019t said too much. It hadn\u2019t been long since Marco and his human mate, Nicky, had reconciled after Nicky and Ian\u2019s mate, Logan, ran away and hid out for two weeks.They\u2019d almost been captured by Hunters and had worried their mates half to death. Since then, a lot of changes had been made to allow the pets more freedom. Some of the human pets were even being trained in various support positions in their small army. Even with all the changes there were still loud, contentious arguments between Marco and Nicky regularly, usually followed by even louder sex.</p><p>Marco smiled at his gamma.\u201cYes, Brett, humans are unpredictable. Definitely ill-mannered and defiant, or at least Nicky is.They\u2019re also loyal, brave, beautiful and passionate. Not a bad trade-off, all things considered. Go see your human up close before you make a decision. Talk to him.Give him a chance. You owe it to yourself, because without a doubt he\u2019s also the love of your life.\u201d</p> <p>Brett made a dismissive sound, but nodded his agreement to try.He\u2019d come down to Brevard to see his blood mate the next day.He\u2019d been almost arrogant, thinking that he must have overestimated his attraction. No one could look that good and smell so sweet. It was impossible. When he found that Evan had moved into the Hunter compound, and there was no way of getting in to find him, he\u2019d been surprised at how furious he\u2019d felt, and how determined he was to get him back.</p><p>He could hear the roar of the small falls as they neared the cave, and he set Evan down on his feet to shimmy out of his jeans.Brett nodded at Evan\u2019s jeans. \u201cBetter take those off and roll them up in a tight bundle. We have to go behind the falls and the spray will wet you clean through. When we get inside there you\u2019ll want some dry pants, because it might be cool.\u201d</p><p>Evan stepped back and instinctively raised his hands.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not taking off my jeans. I\u2019ll just take my chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for God\u2019s sake, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t seen you naked. Take them off, or I\u2019ll do it for you.Stop acting like some stupid little virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop treating me like one! All right, I\u2019ll take them off, but because I\u2019ve changed my mind and I think it\u2019s a good idea. Not because you tell me to, or becauseI\u2019m scared of you.\u201d</p><p>Brett simply stared at him with an unreadable expression on his face and waited.</p><p>Evan tightened his lips, toed off his shoes and jerked angrily at the button on his jeans, awkwardly trying to push them down with one hand. Brett made a sound of impatience and pulled his pants down and helped him step out of them. He pulled off the makeshift sling and stood looking him up and down when he had him naked before shoving both his own jeans and Evan\u2019s clothes into his hands.</p><p>\u201cTry to hold them close and tucked underyour body so they won\u2019t get so wet. I\u2019ll take us up as fast as I can.\u201d He picked him up, threw him over his shoulder and took off up the hill, climbing to the cave.</p> <p>The stream came from farther up the mountain and where it cascaded down the hill, a rockfall sometime in the past had left only a small hole for the water to flow through. It had created a small waterfall as the water rushed through and hit the rocks below. To get to the small cave, they had to pass right by this cascade and the spray would totally soak them.</p><p>Brett climbed steadily up the jagged rocks to reach the small opening of the cave. Once inside, Brett put Evan back on his feet and began to gather some dry twigs and wood left in the far back corner by previous visitors. This was a spot well known to the wolves, and they often spent the night here if they were caught out late on the trails. He snatched up his jeans, finding them only a little damp, pulled them on, and then got a fire started. After a few minutes he sat back on his heels to watch Evan. He had put on his jeans too, and now knelt by the scant blaze, holding out his one good hand and shivering slightly. Brett was pretty sure Evan was aware of his steady regard, but refused to look up at him directly. As Brett watched, he cradled his wrist to his body, his face white with pain.</p><p>He stood up and walked over to him.\u201cStand up, Evan. Please.\u201d</p><p>Evan stood and looked at him nervously. Very slowly, so as not to spook him, Brett reached out and took his wrist.\u201cWhen I was in the cell, I yearned for you, you know. Every minute. And when you came in the door and took care of me, I was so grateful. When you fed me, and put medicine on my back, I wanted nothing more than to hold you in my arms and show you how grateful I felt. Let me help you now, Evan. This might hurt a little, but I only want to help.\u201d</p><p>Evan looked confused, staring up at Brett as he slowly brought his wrist to his mouth. Quickly, before Evan could react, Brett sank his teeth into his wrist, fastening onto it as Evan screamed in fright and pain, sinking to his knees and trying his best to twist away. Brett followed him to the floor of the cave. He knew he was scaring Evan again, but this was the only way he knew to help ease the pain. He pulled his teeth out and licked the marks while Evan panted for breath.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Evan was furious, his face deep red with outrage.</p><p>Brett looked down at him calmly before he spoke. \u201cIn a minute, your wrist will be numb. Can you feel it working?\u201d Brett waited until he finally nodded sullenly.\u201cGood. It\u2019s all I could do to help, baby. When I get you to the pack, the doctor can look at it.Now you\u2019re going to drink some of my blood, so it will heal quickly.\u201d He reached out with one finger and ran it along his cheek. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Evan said, nodding. He gave Brett a searing glance.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to drink your damn blood.I\u2019ll just take my chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember giving you an option. Why in hell are you acting like this? Are you scared of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you blame me?\u201d He put his uninjured hand over his face and sighed.\u201cSince I woke up, you\u2019ve threatened me, choked me, hurt my wrist and now bitten the hell out of me. Damn right you scare me!\u201d</p> <p>Brett smiled down at Evan, aware his heart was still racing, though it was slowing down.</p><p>\u201cI only did those things to make the guards believe I hated you and would kill you if I had to.I had to make it look good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you succeeded. I sure as hell believed you.\u201d</p><p>Brett folded his legs and sank down beside him, picking him up and pulling his legs around him so they wrapped around his waist, bringing their bodies together and making Evan sit in his lap. Evan pushed back against his chest with his good hand, but soon realized it was futile. He gave up and sagged in his arms, his head dropping down against Brett\u2019s chest.</p><p>Brett loved the feel of his sweet body so close to his.He rubbed his hands along Evan\u2019s back and tenderly kissed his neck as he trembled. He bent lower to whisper in his ear.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you,darlin\u2019. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>Evan raised his gaze and whispered back. His voice was almost frantic. \u201cOh hell, I love you too. Is it because of that thing in my blood, like the doctors said? What the fuck am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>A little laugh was startled right out of Brett\u2019s throat. \u201cWhat are yougoing to do?\u201d He rubbed little circles across his back.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I don\u2019t know what to do! I can\u2019t be in love with a wolf. I can\u2019t! And now I\u2019ve let you mate with me! What the fuck am I doing? I must be crazy!\u201d He shuddered and dropped his head down on Brett\u2019s chest. \u201cShit! What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>Brett was actually at a loss. He decided to stay quiet and let him calm down a little. Continuing to rub his back, he kissed him on the sides of his neck, making him arch his back and moan. His cock strained against his jeans and rubbed on Brett\u2019s stomach and Evan squirmed to get comfortable sitting on Brett\u2019s now-rigid cock.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you at all. You\u2019re just about perfect as far as I can tell. Sweetheart, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on in your head, but let me feed you and calm you down some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking permission, sweetheart.\u201d Ignoring his protests, Brett bit into his wrist and pressed it to Evan\u2019s lips. He tried to twist away for a few moments but Brett followed his every move with his wrist. Huffing in defeat, Evan allowed Brett to put his wrist to his mouth. He latched onto it and soon closed his eyes to suck.</p><p>Brett watched him as his eyelids fluttered again, and he became intoxicated with the blood. Evan moved his hand down to the bulge in his jeans and rubbed his hand against his erection. Smiling, Brett unbuttoned his jeans and pulled down the zipper, pullingEvan\u2019s cock free. It sprang forward, a dark red color, with a beautiful blue vein throbbing up its length. Brett pushed Evan\u2019s hand away and concentrated on it himself using long, slow strokes that made Evan hump against his hand. Brett rubbed his thumb over the sensitive head and dipped down into his slit, smearing pre-cum all over the head and down the velvety smooth skin. Evan sucked harder, making Brett\u2019s own cock throb and ache.</p><p>Brett increased his speed and Evan sucked even harder, the blood dripping out around the corners of his mouth as he tried to take too much in. Soon Brett would have to pull away, but for now, he wanted Evan to come all over his hand.\u201cCome for me, sweetheart. You know you want to. Come,baby.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s head fell back and he screamed as he came, shooting cum all over his stomach and lap as well as Brett\u2019s. \u201cYell out my name, baby, because I\u2019m the only man you\u2019ll ever be with again.C\u2019mon,honey, give it up for me.\u201d</p><p>Teasing him, Brett stroked and milked his cock for every last drop.</p><p>\u201cBrett! Oh my God, Brett, please!\u201d he yelled hoarsely, more than a little drunk with the blood and the pleasure.The movement of Brett\u2019s hand over his softening cock must have been almost painful now.</p><p>\u201cPlease what, darlin\u2019? No, I\u2019m still not feeling it. Who do you love baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhn, you! Please!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince you ask so nicely...\u201d</p><p>Evan collapsed on Brett\u2019s chest as he crooned to Evan and kissed his neck, sucking in the skin and bringing up a blood blister, marking and claiming him as his own.</p><p>Evan was already sleeping deeply when he laid him down on the floor of the cave and went outside. The moon was riding high in the night sky, casting its silver light on the water and the rocks. He needed to shift to help his own healing and also to hunt.He hadn\u2019t eaten much in the days he\u2019d been captive. The only food that had been palatable to him had been Evan\u2019s sandwiches and the food the doctor had managed to bring in to him. He crouched down on the ground and let himself shift to his wolf. He sprang from the rocks and ran into the woods, feeling the strength and the power flowing through his body. He felt exhilarated. He looked up and saw the full moon. Perfect! He had done it!He\u2019d gone into the lion\u2019s den, found his mate and claimed him. A surge of sheer sexual power ran through his body, and he put back his head and howled.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cDamn good to see you, man!\u201d Casey slapped Brett on the back and pumped his hand in greeting.\u201cWe got a little worried that it was taking too long. Thought we\u2019d have to break in there and bring you back out.\u201d</p><p>Brett snorted. \u201cNo problem, Casey.I was practically on vacation in there.\u201d Casey, Brett had told Evan, was the battle commander of the North Carolina Dark Hollow Pack. Like most of the wolves he was big and handsome. He laughed out loud at Brett\u2019s swagger. Casey looked to the man Brett held tightly by the hand.\u201cThis must be Evan.\u201d He looked him up and down.\u201cVery nice to meet you, Evan. Welcome to our home.\u201d He turned and gestured behind him to a smaller man, standing quietly by his side.\u201cThis is my mate, Rory.\u201d</p><p>A cute young man with curly brown hair stepped forward. Like the other wolves, he was muscular and well built, but not so tall. He was more human-sized, like Evan. His eyes were kind as he smiled at Evan.\u201cI know this is all new for you. Let us know if we can help you with anything.\u201d</p><p>Evan held out his hand to shake hands with him, but Rory shook his head slightly and stepped back. Brett pulled his hand down.\u201cNo, Evan. You don\u2019t touch the other wolves.\u201d</p><p>Evan felt confused. What? No touching? He felt like a child whose hand had been slapped. He flushed when Brett looked back up apologetically to Casey and Rory.\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Rory waved his hand.\u201cNo problem. Brett, would you let him come with me to find him some clothes, or would you feel more comfortable with one of the pets taking care of him?\u201d</p><p>Brett shifted his feet uncomfortably.\u201cUh, he\u2019s still pretty nervous. Maybe...\u201d</p><p>Casey laughed out loud at the expression on Brett\u2019s face. \u201cNo worries, Brett. I know exactly how you feel.\u201d He put his arm around Rory\u2019s waist and pulled him to his side.\u201cI didn\u2019t want my mate out of my sight for weeks.\u201d</p><p>Evan was fascinated to see the color rising in Rory\u2019s cheeks. Was he blushing? A wolf?</p><p>Brett made a dismissive noise.\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I\u2019m tired, that\u2019s all. I want to get a little rest, and then later this afternoon I can deal with his clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, no problem. You can use the guest room until we can make you a new assignment. You can\u2019t very well keep him in the barracks. Rory and I have to go out to the training field, but Marco will be home soon.He took Nicky down to buy art supplies.\u201d Casey nodded to Evan. \u201cNice to meet you, Evan.\u201d He looked back up at Brett.\u201cVery sweet for a Hunter, Brett. You have him almost trained already.\u201d He waved, taking Rory by the arm and leaving by the front door.</p><p>Quietly fuming, Evan pulled Brett around to face him.\u201cTrained? Is he kidding? What a jerk.\u201d</p><p>A melodious voice behind them made Evan whirl around.\u201cHe is a big jerk\u2014always has been. He doesn\u2019t mean anything by it, though. He just can\u2019t help himself. Don\u2019t let him bother you.\u201d Standing near a back entrance was a handsome young blond, his blue eyes twinkling. He was wearing almost sinfully tight black leather pants and a black T-shirt. Next to him, a large wolf, darkly handsome, was loaded down with canvasses and packages.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Nicky. I\u2019m the mate of the alpha, Marco.\u201d The young blond stepped forward, holding out his hand.\u201cYou must be Evan.\u201d</p><p>Evan shook his hand hesitantly, glancing up at Brett to see if he reacted to his touching this young man, but he was smiling and greeting the other wolf. What the hell?</p><p>Nicky, sensing his confusion, lowered his voice conspiratorially.\u201cIt\u2019s because Rory and Casey are both wolves, so pets can\u2019t touch them and vice versa. It\u2019s okay for me, because I\u2019m another pet. Stupid wolf rules.\u201d</p><p>Evan laughed, a little startled by the candidness of the young man. His mate, the alpha of the pack, apparently, stepped up beside him, having put down all the packages.\u201cNicky, I\u2019m going to want to have a word with you about your attitude this morning, just as soon as I have a chance.\u201d</p><p>He gave the young blond a stern look and Evan watched in fascination as the young man dropped his gaze, looked up through his lashes and said, \u201cYes, Marco, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The big, handsome wolf turned to Evan.\u201cI\u2019m Marco, Evan, and I see Nicky has already introduced himself. I know this must all be confusing to you, and you both look exhausted.I\u2019m glad to see you both in one piece. I must admit I was worried about this scheme of yours, Brett.\u201d</p><p>Brett smiled.\u201cAs you see, we\u2019re fine, and I took my little man here right out from under their noses.\u201d</p><p>As Marco and Brettlaughed, Evan and Nicky exchanged glances over the \u201clittle man\u201d remark. Nicky\u2019s rolled eyes and look of disgust when the two wolves weren\u2019t looking had Evan trying desperately to hold back his laughter. Nicky looked Evan up and down and drew him off to the side while Brett was still conversing with Marco.\u201cYou look ready to drop. Make him give you some real food to eat, and I\u2019ll send up some clothes for you. We have jeans and leathers\u2014 whichever you prefer. I think Brett is pretty old school so he may want you in leathers.\u201d He looked down at his wrist.It didn\u2019t hurt anymore, but Evan still held it at an odd angle next to his chest.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your wrist?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrett hurtit.\u201d</p><p>At Nicky\u2019s look of outrage, Evan smiled again.\u201cIt was my fault, really. I pulled a knife on him, and he was trying to knock it out of my hand. He forgot his own strength\u2014he didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d</p><p>Nicky turned around and addressed Marco.\u201cEvan needs to see the doctor, Marco. His wrist may bebroken.\u201d He looked pointedly at Brett.\u201cSeems Evan didn\u2019t quite get out in one piece after all.\u201d</p> <p>Brett tightened his lips.\u201cSorry, Evan, of course you need to see the doctor right away, but it\u2019s not broken. Just bruised.\u201d He looked pointedly at Nicky until again, Nicky dropped his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve apologized over and over for it.\u201d Brett said, takingEvan\u2019s arm and nodding to Marco. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you later this afternoon, sir. If you\u2019ll excuse us, I need to get Evan downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take him,\u201d Nicky said. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll bring him right back to your room, Brett, after the doctor looks at it.\u201d</p><p>He took Evan\u2019s other arm, and Brett looked for a moment like he might get into a tug of war withthe alpha\u2019s pet, but finally he dropped his hand and smiled tightly.\u201cThank you, Nicky. Very nice of you.\u201d</p><p>Nicky drew Evan away, and Evan couldn\u2019t stop himself from looking back over his shoulder a bit longingly at Brett, who seemed a bit tense and nervous watching Nicky lead Evan away.</p> <p>Nicky took Evan down a flight of stairs to a large corridor with rooms opening off each side.</p><p>Evan looked around himself in wonder.\u201cI had no idea this place was so huge. It\u2019s more like a big hotel than a lodge. That big room upstairs is massive.\u201d</p><p>Nicky smiled and looked around at him.\u201cIt is big, isn\u2019t it? I forget what it must look like to newcomers.We\u2019ve had to add on a lot this past year or so. All the smaller branches of the pack have come together and moved in here because of the Hunter threat.\u201d They came to a small door marked Clinic and Nicky took him inside. An older man came forward to greet them and examine Evan\u2019s wrist.</p><p>He made Evan get up on the examining table, pronounced the wrist a little sprained, but already healing and then turned away to go find a wrap for it in a large store room off the examining room.</p><p>Nicky, who\u2019d been leaning against the wall, watching curiously, now came over to sit near Evan.\u201cYou know, Evan, Brett seems to be a lot like Marco and Casey and all the other wolves in this pack.Old school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you said that once before. What does thatmean?\u201d</p> <p>Nicky leaned back in his chair.\u201cMost wolves are old-fashioned and domineering. They like their pets nice and submissive. When I first came here a little over two years ago, Marco hauled me around on a leash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Brett try to do that to me? I\u2019d hate that!\u201d</p><p>Nicky smiled.\u201cThe leash? No, they don\u2019t do it anymore. I put a stop to most of that, at least. He might want to collar you. Some peoplelike it, and others hate it. Doesn\u2019t much matter, because it\u2019s up to your wolf. They used to have some ideas about mates going feral if they weren\u2019t controlled and restrained. They don\u2019t do that anymore, unless, of course, your wolf is oldfashioned.\u201d He looked at Evan with interest.\u201cAll the wolves are a little dominant by nature. Sometimes they get really lucky and their blood mate turns out to be a submissive.\u201d He shrugged.\u201cAt least in the bedroom. Nature is kind to them, I guess. I must admit, I am a bit submissive myself at times, but just not all the time, like my wolf wants me to be.\u201d He laughed a little and ran his fingers around his neck.He wasn\u2019t currently wearing any kind of collar, but Evan wondered if he didn\u2019t wear one at private times with his wolf.</p><p>\u201cThe collar is more of a warning to other wolves that you\u2019re taken,\u201d Nicky continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a pride thing for them.Like I said, they\u2019re all very controlling, but it\u2019s just a big bluff. Brett won\u2019t hurt you\u2014he couldn\u2019t, even if he wanted to. Ofcourse, like with your wrist, they don\u2019t always know their own strength. So you have to set some hard limits with him. Especially if you like to play it a little, shall we say, rough in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>At the look of horror on Evan\u2019s face, Nicky laughed. \u201cMarco and I had some issues last year and again just a couple of months ago.He\u2019s been tightening up on me a little lately. That little remark he made about having \u2018a word\u2019 with me. That\u2019s code for he\u2019s probably going to spank my ass for me later on tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Evan said, laughing and blushing furiously.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll probably love every minute of it. It\u2019s just sexual play for us. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be too blunt, but I wish I\u2019d had someone to talk to when I first came. Look, I\u2019m telling you this, because you can expect it to be the same for you.I\u2019m crazy about Marco and he\u2019s really good to me\u2014protective, and sweet, and gives me whatever I want.Still, he\u2019s the boss, or so I let him think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do that.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky rolled his eyes.\u201cTell me about it. I ran away a couple months ago to prove a point to Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d Nicky grinned. \u201cI got some of what I was asking for, but I\u2019ve kind of been on lockdown ever since.He\u2019s tightened way up with me in other wayssince then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, don\u2019t be scared of Brett.I can see how crazy he is about you, and he\u2019d never hurt you on purpose.It\u2019s like ingrained in their DNA or something. He won\u2019t harm his mate. Not really. You might get a spanking or two\u2014actually they can be kind of hot.\u201d He winked at Evan, and Evan had to laugh at him again.\u201cJust remember that you\u2019re dealing with a very dominating personality.They can take some teasing, and Lord knows I\u2019ve been an awful brat at times, but be careful.Don\u2019t push him too far. I\u2019ve made that mistake with Marco in the past.\u201d</p><p>The doctor returned with a type of tight bandage and wrapped it around his wrist, gave him some instructions and let him get down from the table. The wrap was lightweight and actually felt pretty good on his wrist, giving it extra support.</p><p>As they walked back down the hall, Nicky nodded toward it.\u201cYou won\u2019t have to wear it long.Their blood gives us fast healing abilities. Just one of the perks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there others?\u201d Evan realized his tone sounded a bit bitter, and he blushed. Nicky stopped and turned to him, looking amazed at the question.</p><p>\u201cOh hell, yes. I probably said too much, but I wanted you to understand. Despite everything, wolves are gorgeous and sweet, and wonderful lovers.Hell, they\u2019re hot as fuck, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed. Wolves mate for life, and he\u2019ll love you more than anyone ever has. You love Brett, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel\u2014I feel like I have to be with him, and God knows I\u2019m attracted to him. I only wonder if it\u2019s just the chemicals from the bite and the blood.\u201d</p><p>Nicky regarded him curiously.\u201cYou\u2019re overthinking this. Maybe because of your Hunter background. When Logan first came, he felt the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan Winters? So he really is still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I told you, Evan, they\u2019d never hurt us. They love us too much. Just be patient with Brett, and he\u2019ll come around. You really hold the majority of the power, you know. Most subs do, regardless of what it looks to the outside world. The wolves spend all their time just trying to make us safe and happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd controlled...\u201d</p><p>Nicky smiled.\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he led Evan upstairs and then to a long hallway off the large main area. \u201cFirst door on the left is the guest room. Brett\u2019s probably already in there. If not, have a shower and relax. I\u2019ll have those clothes sent over if Marco hasn\u2019t already taken care of it. See you tonight at dinner.\u201d</p><p>Evan opened the door and went in, seeing Brett stretched out on the bed already, half asleep. He roused when Evan came in and held out a hand to him. Evan went over to sit beside him and Brett took his wrist and gently inspected it. He kissed it and looked up at Evan soberly.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I hurt your wrist, sweetheart. Even if you were about to skewer me with that wicked little switchblade of yours.\u201d</p><p>Evan smiled and lowered his head.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have cut you. I only wanted to make you let me go.\u201d He reached out and ran a finger along Brett\u2019s bare chest. \u201cI think I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Brett pulled his head down for a kiss.\u201cIf you had really wanted to leave, I\u2019d have taken you back. It would have killedme, but I\u2019d have takenyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you, Brett.Not ever.\u201d He leaned over and kissed his lips, and sighed. \u201cCan I get my things from the barracks? Like my laptop and my iPod and clothes and stuff? You said you could get in there if you needed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,if we need to, but that\u2019s too great a risk just for your stuff. I\u2019ll buy you some new clothes and a new iPod, and whatever else you want.Ashville\u2019s not too far from here, and we can go up there and get whatever you need, okay? No computers, though. Or cell phones. You can use the computerin the common areas, because they\u2019re censored, but until Winters backs off a little, we\u2019re keeping a low profile online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my parents will be worried about me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite them a letter and I\u2019ll get it sent off right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA letter? Snail mail?Why can\u2019t I have my cell phone? Damn it, it\u2019s like the fucking Dark Ages around here. My mom will want to talk to me...besides, the Hunters know where your lodge is located. It\u2019s not exactly top secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know where we are, but not our numbers or where we have our traps set up, or what kind of munitions we have, or who our contacts are in Brevard. They try to raid us all the time, but why do you think we\u2019re still here? Because of our safeguards and our rules.They\u2019re in place for a reason.No, I\u2019m sorry, honey, but it\u2019s the best I can do for you right now. When things get a little better, I\u2019ll take you to see your parents if you want, but not for a while. For now, just send the letter and your mom can write you back if she wants.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn, I feel like a prisoner.\u201d He caught an intense gaze from Brett and flushed a bit.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.I love you, and I don\u2019t want to leave. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s all so new and strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to get used to, honey, but give it a chance. Lie down here beside me and rest until dinnertime. We\u2019ve both been through a lot in the past day or so. You\u2019ll feel better about things once you\u2019ve settled in.\u201d</p><p>Evan allowed himself to be pulled down beside Brett, but he wasn\u2019t too sure about getting used to things and feeling better about them in a few days. As a matter of fact, he already felt a little stir crazy. Brett rolled over and put a heavy leg across his thighs and snuggled his face into Evan\u2019s neck. His lips brushed softly against his throat. A feeling of such passion and love for the man swept over him that it left him a little shaken. Well, damn.</p> <p>He snuggled in a little closer to Brett, feeling Brett\u2019s large erection brushing his thighs. Maybe he could get used to some of it after all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to help Logan with the self-defense training for the other pets. Please, Brett. Marco has approved the training, and it\u2019s for the good of the pets. I\u2019m going to go crazy sitting around here doing nothing all day.\u201d</p><p>Brett folded his arms over his chest and frowned. \u201cSo if you\u2019ve made up your mind, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter what I think about it.\u201d</p><p>Evan stood his ground, glaring back at Brett, only dropping his gaze when it became clear Brett was growing more irritated.\u201cOf course it matters! Please, Brett.I don\u2019t want to fight with you over this, but Idon\u2019t want to sit at home like your little bitch.\u201d</p><p>Brett drew back, astonishment on his face.\u201cI never said that! I never treated you like my bitch, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo? What about how you acted when I got that letterfrom Eric last week?\u201d</p><p>Brett pressed his lips together and narrowed his eyes, saying nothing.</p><p>When Evan sent his mother a letter letting her know he was okay and telling her where he was, he got back two replies, one from his mother and one from his former lover, Eric. Brett had been furious, throwing the letters down on the sofa beside him and glaring down at him.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is Eric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The name still made him flinch a little, and of course Brett picked up on that immediately.</p><p>\u201cWho is he? What is he to you? Where the fuck do you know him from? Why is he writing to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute, Brett, give me a chance to answer!He\u2019s an old boyfriend and I have no idea why he\u2019s writing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen it. I know you\u2019re dying to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re dying to find out.\u201d He blushed a little when Brett growled low in his throat.\u201cPlease calm down. I don\u2019t want to open it with you looming over me. Go sit over there onthe chair and I\u2019ll see why he\u2019s writing.\u201d</p><p>With a long, warning glare in his direction, Brett went over to the chair and plopped down in it, leaning forward a little.</p><p>Evan shook his head, by now used to these little displays every time another man so much as looked at him. He\u2019d found it best to try and ignore Brett until he finally realized what an ass he was being and apologized, wanting make-up sex. This was the tactic Evan was using now.</p><p>He opened his mother\u2019s letter first and read it eagerly, scanning over it to see if his family had suffered any retaliation of any kind from the Hunters. They were fine, if worried about him, and his mother was full of questions about when she could meet this new man in his life and whether or not he was being treated well. Apparently the Hunters had notified her of his \u201ckidnapping\u201d and made her think he was in the hands of a killer, so her relief at knowing he was fine came through loud and clear, with only a hint of skepticism. She told him she\u2019d feel better when she could talk to him and see him in person so she could make sure he wasn\u2019t being coerced to say he was all right.</p><p>While Evan was reading his mother\u2019s letter, he was aware that Brett was fuming and fidgeting around in his chair. He had to admit he loved the fact that Brett was so damn jealous of him. Eric had never seemed to care much one way or the other. Evan sort of enjoyed making Brett suffer just a little, but he knew he was pushing it a bit. Later, when Brett took him to bed, Brett always made sure to leave no doubt in his mind about exactly whom he belonged to.</p><p>Deliberately dragging it out as long as he could to make his man suffer, he took another sip of his soda before finally opening the letter from Eric. Evan could almost feel the waves of fury emanating off Brett.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean by an old boyfriend? In high school? Or more recently? Was he your lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Brett, he was my lover up until about six months before you and I met. I did have a life before that, you know.I wasn\u2019t a monk. Eric and I were together for about a year and then he cheated on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he left you? Does that mean you still have feelings for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, I don\u2019t have feelings for him at all.As intense as you are, I don\u2019t have room in my head for anybody but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not,\u201d Brett mumbled, still glaring across at him as he read his letter. The letter only expressedconcern for him, saying he\u2019d read in the newspapers that he\u2019d been kidnapped by some kind of homegrown terrorists, and was so relieved when he\u2019d called Evan\u2019s mother,and she\u2019d told him the truth. He gave him his new cell phone number and asked him to call. He hinted that he had an exciting new job,and he\u2019d love to tell him all about it.</p><p>Evan looked up from the letter and over at Brett. His handsome face was creased with worry.\u201cWhat is it? What did he say?\u201d</p><p>Evan tossed the letter over to him, not wanting to cause him any more pain.\u201cNothing, love. Nothing at all. Read it for yourself, and then throw it in the trash. I have no interest in his phone number or anything else he has to say. You have nothing to be jealous about, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Brett caught the letter, jammed it in his pocket and came over to wrap his arms around Evan.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I guess I can be alittle jealous sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Evan laughed out loud.\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just so crazy about you\u2014I can\u2019t get enough of you, no matter how many times we make love.I love you so much, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, sweetheart.\u201d He put his head back and let Brett claim his mouth. Brett pushed him down on the sofa and started pulling at his jeans. Evan smiled, knowing Brett had to reclaim his mate whenever his jealous rages overcame him. Since Evan usually got fucked into the nearest available surface whenever that happened, he wasn\u2019t complaining too much.</p><p>Brett pulled his own jeans down, freeing his cock and pressing it against the length of Evan\u2019s. He bent to push Evan\u2019s mouth open, scraping his teeth against his mate\u2019s hot tongue. Brett pushed Evan\u2019s shirt up and began working his nipples, one at a time, licking and biting. His hand moved down to massage Evan\u2019s balls, not roughly, but not exactly gentle. Their cocks continued to rub together, driving Evan wild with desire.</p><p>All of Evan\u2019s senses felt filled up with Brett. His mouth was being attacked, his cock stimulated and his balls still being massaged by Brett\u2019s talented fingers. He felt like he was drowning in a flood of sensations.</p><p>Brett pulled his head back from Evan\u2019s mouth long enough to whisper, \u201cLube?\u201d It took Evan a couple of seconds to process what he was asking, and then he nodded.\u201cUm, on the end table, I think, where you left it last night.\u201d</p><p>Brett reared up and reached behind him, finding it and squeezing some onto his fingers. He began to rub it over his cock, knowing Evan was watching, taking his time. He bent down and lifted Evan\u2019s leg, setting his calf on his shoulder. He leaned in then and spread the lube slowly over Evan\u2019s sensitive skin. He slipped in one finger, teasing it in and out as Evan bit back a moan.</p><p>\u201cFeel good, darlin\u2019? Right there? Hmmm?How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Brett,\u201d Evan groaned hoarsely. \u201cAre you going to fuck me or talk me to death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little of both if you don\u2019t watch that smart mouth.\u201d Brett chuckled and pushed in another finger deeply, working it in and out. Evan flinched at the invasion of two fingers, and Brett pressed up, searching for his sweet spot again. He found it and Evan arched up with a deep guttural sound.</p><p>\u201cGettin\u2019 tight again, sweetheart. I might have to make you wear that plug again for me.\u201d He slid his fingers in and outat the same time he palmed Evan\u2019s cock, drawing his hand down over the length. He slid his thumb over the slit and Evan began to spurt, straining for breath and coming all over Brett\u2019s chest and his own stomach.</p><p>Brett milked Evan\u2019s orgasm, pumping his cock with his other hand as he guided his cock to his entrance and slid inside. His cock went in deep at the first thrust, then slowed down, sliding all the way in with a slow stroke and then pulling back out, setting up a rhythm that drove Evan crazy.\u201cHarder. Do it!\u201d Evan urged him, and after only a few strokes, Brett came with a deep groan, pulling Evan closer and then collapsing on top of him.</p><p>He lay there for a few moments, his bodybetween Evan\u2019s strong thighs, his head on his chest, trying to get his breath.He levered himself up and nipped at Evan\u2019s nipple as he rose, causing him to jump in surprise.\u201cDamn it, Brett. You\u2019re such an asshole.\u201d</p><p>Brett turned him over and slapped his butt three times in rapid succession.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Evan cried out.</p><p>\u201cApologize or you\u2019ll go over my knee, smart ass.\u201d</p><p>Evan rapidly swallowed down the sharp retort on his lips and looked over his shoulder at him as meekly as he could.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Brett.\u201d</p><p>Brett leaned over and kissed and licked the red marks on his skin.\u201cYou know you love it,\u201d he said, moving toward the bathroom to get a warm washcloth.</p><p>Evan sighed deeply, still feeling the burn and ache on his tender ass and the boneless, languid feeling that he\u2019d just been well and truly fucked. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cGod help me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evan came back to the present, and looked back over at Brett, who was standing beside him brooding quietly as Evan pulled out his new camo outfit and his boots from the closet.</p><p>\u201cThis is such bullshit, Brett. I\u2019m doing this thing, and unless you plan to lock me in this room, you need to just go back to work and let me get ready.\u201d At the look on Brett\u2019s face, Evan took a backward step. He made himself drop his gaze.\u201cPlease, Brett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I thought locking you in this room would do any good, I\u2019d have already done it.Don\u2019t push your luck, Evan.Go ahead with this if you must, but if you get hurt, don\u2019t complain.\u201d Brett turned and strode toward the door without even saying goodbye to him.</p> <p>He\u2019d never left him before without kissing him goodbye, and Evan felt a momentary twinge. However, where this training was concerned, he had to reassert himself and not let Brett get away with his shit. Being jealous and possessive was one thing, but trying to control him and tell him what he could and couldn\u2019t do was quite another.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m training with Logan, starting today, Brett.I won\u2019t get hurt,\u201d Evan called after him.</p><p>Brett turned at the door and started to say something and then apparently thought better of it. He tightened his lips though and thrust out his jaw belligerently.\u201cIf you do, don\u2019t come crying to me.\u201d</p><p>Evan rolled his eyes.\u201cThey\u2019re pets, Brett\u2014mostly women and children and a few young guys, not sumo wrestlers. How the heckam I going to get hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember what I said.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I definitely will. No crying to you\u2014check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass. I think your friends are a bad influence on you.\u201d Brett growled, turning on his heel, slamming the door behind him and leaving Evan alone in their room. Evan turned wearily back to the closet and started getting dressed in a pair of camos that Logan had sent over when the door suddenly opened again and Brett marched over to him and pulled Evan in his arms, leaning him back so far Evan had to stick a leg out to keep his balance. Brett kissed him so hard he left him breathless, then still holding him in the same position Brett growled at him again. \u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>He straightened him back up and stormed out of the room again, leaving Evan blushing and smiling, shaking his head. Life with Brett was always interesting. Most days now, Evan felt like he was walking a tightrope between wanting to please Brett and wanting to just be himself. The two didn\u2019t always match up very well.</p><p>Once he finished dressing, Evan went out to the little training area Nicky made Marco set up by the side of the lodge. Nicky and Evan were already there, along with about twenty-five young men and women, all dressed in their new green and tan Woodland camo outfits supplied by the pack. They were standing around laughing and joking until Logan stepped forward.</p><p>Logan had changed greatly since his days as a Hunter, and Evan had seen plenty of pictures of him during his time in training with them. They used to use him at the Hunter complex as a kind of warning of what could happen to you if you were captured. Inthe pictures he\u2019d been a nice-looking, fairly buff young man of average height and size. Now the man who stood before him was more than just good-looking. He was downright movie-star gorgeous. He was much bigger too, lean in the stomach and waist, but his chest and shoulders were larger, and he seemed to have grown a couple of inches. He looked tougher, like the kind of man you wouldn\u2019t want to face in a fight.</p><p>Nicky stood behind him, and despite the fact that his face was as beautifulas a girl\u2019s, with long, thick eyelashes and all that curly, golden blond hair, he, too, had a body that was manly, toned and muscular. They looked like Hollywood extras or models. Evan wondered if he would look like that one day.The doctors had told him he\u2019d get bigger and better-looking once he was mated to a wolf, and now he was beginning to believe it.</p> <p>Logan fixed the crowd of young people with a serious look.\u201cI know most of you are here because the alpha told you to come, but this is serious business. No one wants to become a victim ofviolence, but we\u2019re at war with a smart, relentless and determined enemy. They want you and the wolves annihilated, wiped off the face of the earth.\u201d He looked around to see if his message was being taken seriously and saw that it was. A few of them were chewing nervously on their lips and were standing closer to each other.</p><p>\u201cThe leaders of The Hunters have decided the best way to do this is to fight us with feral creatures. As you may have heard, Nicky here, our alpha\u2019s mate, once became such a creature because he went without blood too long. This is the method they intend to use on you if they can catch you.And make no mistake, they\u2019ll be after you.\u201d He fixed them with another hard stare and continued.\u201cSo why is it that these predators, these Hunters, are so successful against people like you? They rely on the fact that you tend to think of them as having already won. You can\u2019t defend yourself against someone that\u2019s already succeeded in your mind, and if you\u2019re concerned at all with yourattacker\u2019s well-being, you\u2019ve already given him the only advantage he needs to win. Raw, unadulterated violence is the Hunter\u2019s best weapon, because it terrorizes your mind as well as your body.</p><p>\u201cThis is not marital arts.There\u2019s nothing pretty about what we\u2019re going to teach you. Prepare yourself to get down and dirty, and you\u2019ll walk away with your life. Are you guys ready to get started?\u201d</p><p>Evan found himself nodding right along with the rest of them. Damn, this sounded like fun. Logan had already been teaching Nicky some of these techniques, and he\u2019d asked for Evan in this first training class because of his former training. He knew it would kick in once he\u2019d learned a few of these techniques, and he could be a big help.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t kidding about the violence of the techniques, though. Over the next hour, Logan showed the pets how to gouge, kick, stomp, and generally maim any attacker foolish enough to try something with them. He was aware that a few of the wolves had gathered to watch from a distance. When they broke for a few minutes, he spotted Brett coming up to stand beside Casey. The two of them exchanged a few words, and Evan noticed the disapproving looks on both their faces.</p><p>Nicky came up beside him and followed his gaze with a smile.\u201cThey don\u2019t like it because they think we might use some of these techniques on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can they be so shortsighted?\u201d Evan said with a shake of his head.\u201cCan\u2019t they see how this can help them in the long run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they can\u2019t,\u201d Nicky replied. \u201cIt hurts their pride for them to admit they need any help in protecting their own mates. Kind of a slap in their faces, you know?Marco hates it too, but he\u2019s smart enough to know he has to let us train for the good of the pets. Plus he made a promise to me,and he won\u2019t go back on it.\u201d He slapped Evan on the back and followed his gaze over to where Brett was staring at him.\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on him. This is all really new to them, and they do just want to protect us.We have to show them they\u2019re wrong. Prove it to them so they\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do we do that?\u201d</p><p>Behind them, Logan said \u201cAn exhibition fight, maybe? To show our skills?\u201d</p><p>Nicky shrugged.\u201cFight who?If we fight against each other, they wouldn\u2019t be impressed. If it we fight against some of them, and they lost, they\u2019d say it was because they were afraid they\u2019d hurt us so they pulled their punches and let us win.\u201d</p><p>Evan spoke up.\u201cWhat if we fought against our own mates?\u201d</p><p>Nicky held up a hand.\u201cHell, no. I did that once, and never again. He took it as a challenge to hisleadership and told me if I didn\u2019t submit to him, he\u2019d lose the respect of the pack. So I had to get down on my knees to him and totally submit. Even offer him my throat. Not pleasant. Especially since I thought at the time that he might rip it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Nicky, that was because you two were in the ancestral ring.Ian told me about it,\u201d Logan said.\u201cMuch too public a challenge, and Marco was right.If he\u2019d been defeated by his own pet, he would have lost the respect of all the wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it more private. Ian has already agreed to let me fight beside him if the time comes. He said he wants me by his side so he can protect me. What about Marco? Will he let you fight alongsidehim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Nicky scoffed. \u201cHe has a plan to put me in one of the safe rooms downstairs, along with all the other pets\u2014Brett will put you there too, Evan\u2014and then we\u2019ll wait there till they defeat the Hunters and come for us.If they were to lose, then the guards they\u2019ll put in there with us have orders for no one to be taken alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Evan said quietly. \u201cWe\u2019d be sitting ducks\u2014helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Nicky said bitterly. \u201cI\u2019d rather go out fighting any day. How can I get Marco to change his mind and let me stay near him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake a wager with him\u2014he won\u2019t be able to resist, especially if you make it worth his while,\u201d Logan suggested.</p><p>\u201cA wager? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikeif he wins, you\u2019ll do something for him\u2014something submissive that he\u2019d love. But if he loses, he\u2019ll have to let you stay near him if the fight ever comes to us. Then make damn sure you win.\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked skeptical.\u201cMarco outweighs me by forty pounds of pure muscle. What the heck can I bet with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet him you can beat him in a wrestling match in your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked at Logan as if he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cWhat part of \u2018forty pounds of muscle\u2019 do you not understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember what I told the pets the first day\u2014if you already think he\u2019s going to win, then you\u2019re already defeated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to try to gouge Marco\u2019s eyes or knee him in the balls. I don\u2019t want to try to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded.\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not willing to try that on Brett either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t\u2014just put them on the floor.That\u2019s all you have to do. A little martial arts move. I can show you how it\u2019s done,\u201c Logan said with a little smirk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Nicky said. \u201cYou said Ian had agreed to let you fight alongside him. Did you do that to Ian?\u201d A slow grin spread over his face.\u201cYou did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged.\u201cMaybe. We may have had a private little wager going on. Maybe with an extra little something to sweeten the pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Nicky asked, fascinated.</p> <p>\u201cYou remember when they found us at the cave? When I woke up, Ian was so furious and crazy he told me I was going to spend thirty days naked in bed. Of course, he backed off that later, but it never quite sat right with me. So I wagered that if I put him on the ground, he\u2019d spend an entire weekend naked in bed, and I could have my wicked way with him as often as I wanted to.If he won, I\u2019d do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Nicky said. \u201cYou fucked him?You did, didn\u2019t you? Wait a minute\u2014didn\u2019t Ian have a stomach virus a couple of weekends ago\u2014we didn\u2019t see him for two days.\u201d</p><p>Logan just smiled wickedlywhile Nicky\u2019s mouth dropped. \u201cWas that it?\u201d Nicky laughed so hard he had to lean against Evan for support.\u201cOh my God, I\u2019d like to do that to Marco. Especially the topping thing.You really think I could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you can, Nicky, and I think you should. Just be sure you\u2019re ready when you do.\u201d</p><p>Nicky got a wicked little smile on his face.\u201cOh yeah. I can definitely handle this. Logan, I think you need to show me some moves.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cNicky, I really don\u2019t want to discuss this anymore,\u201d Marco said irritably. It was just after dinner and Nicky had been relentless the whole time he was eating. Nicky could exasperate Marcomore than anyone he\u2019d ever met. He loved the young man so much it frightened him sometimes, but he could also get under Marco\u2019s skin like nobody he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to discuss it because you know I\u2019m right, and you don\u2019t have a good answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fighting the Hunters, either by my side or not. It\u2019s ridiculous and out of the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous?\u201d Nicky narrowed his eyes and cocked his head.\u201cHow do you mean that, Marco? Do you mean that it\u2019s ridiculous to suppose that I could defend my home and my family? Do you think so little of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Nicky, you know what I mean. I\u2019m not about to let you get yourself hurt or worse fighting trained soldiers. With guns! You can get mad all you want and call me all the namesyou want, but I\u2019m not going to allow it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not really asking your permission, Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Nicky!\u201d Marco stood up, trying to be as large and intimidating as possible, but Nicky had seen it all before and was not overly impressed.</p><p>He jumped to his feet and stared right back at him.\u201cDamn it, Marco! Don\u2019t cuss at me, and don\u2019t try to throw your weight around. You can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>He bent over at the waist to put his face right up to Nicky\u2019s. \u201cYou wait and see if I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll take a lot from you, Nicky, but one thing I won\u2019t compromise on is your safety. If I have to tie you up and throw you in that safe room I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>At a standoff, Nicky crossed his arms over his chest.\u201cWhat if I could prove to you that I can take care of myself? That I don\u2019t need you to protect me?\u201d</p><p>Marco rolled his eyes.\u201cHow are you going to do that, Nicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy challenging you to a fight.\u201d Nicky smiled archly at him, as Marco waved his hand and turned away.</p><p>\u201cAgain?That didn\u2019t work out so great the last time, did it?\u201d He smiled but got only a stony stare in response.\u201cLook, Nicky, I\u2019m not going to fight you, baby.It wouldn\u2019t exactly be a fair fight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, really? And why is that?Because you think you\u2019re so much better a fighter than I am?\u201d</p><p>Marco sat down on the sofa and put his hands behind his head.\u201cWell, yeah. That and the fact that I wouldn\u2019t want to hurt you, so I would pull my punches. I wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to hurt me either. Or would you like to kick me and gouge out my eyes like Logan is teaching you guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, baby,\u201d Nicky said, standing in front of him. \u201cI\u2019d never want to really hurt you. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll just put you down on the floor and keep you there untilI let you get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how do you plan to do that?\u201d</p><p>Nicky shrugged.\u201cI can\u2019t give away my secrets, but l\u2019ll bet you I can, and I\u2019m so confident I can do it, I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>It was Marco\u2019s turn to narrow his eyes.\u201cHow would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t do as I say,then I\u2019ll-I\u2019ll get up every morning and cook breakfast foryou, and I\u2019ll never bring up the subject of fightingalongside you again.\u201d</p><p>Marco looked skeptical.</p><p>\u201cI promise!\u201d Nicky held up a hand to swear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get up every morning at six o\u2019clock? To cook?\u201d Marco\u2019s highly dubious tone instantly made Nicky furious.</p><p>\u201cWell, if I lost the bet I would, but I won\u2019t have to because I\u2019ll win.\u201d Nicky snapped back at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Marco stood up and walked lazily toward Nicky.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you have to promise to let me keep training and fight at your side if it comes to an allout war. No safe room!I\u2019d rather die\u2014you know I can\u2019t stand closed places, and not knowing if you were alive or dead\u2014it would kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, I appreciate all that, sweetheart, but...\u201d</p><p>Nicky held up his hand.\u201cWait. I\u2019m not through. If I do this, I also get to have sex with you any way I want to tonight.\u201d</p><p>Marco smiled and reached for him.\u201cNot a problem, sweetheart. We don\u2019t have to do all this silly fighting for that.\u201d</p><p>Nicky allowed Marco to kiss him for a few minutes and then pulled back.\u201cAny way I want to.Promise, Marco.\u201d</p><p>Marco sighed.\u201cOkay, any way you want to. Now can we get on with this? I have some things I need to do before bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sure. I have some things I need to do before bed tonight too. So stand up, and come at me.Just like you\u2019re going to hit me.\u201d</p><p>Smiling a little, Marco stepped forward with an arm upraised. Nicky stepped forward, just as he\u2019d seen Logan do, and with his left hand struck Marco a light blow to his Adam\u2019s apple. Marco stopped dead in his tracks, got a surprised, choking look on his face and grabbed his throat. Nicky moved his left hand down to his shirtfrontand pushed on Marco\u2019s chest as hard as he could. At the same time, he bent over and stuck his righthand between Marco\u2019s legs, grabbed his belt from the back and yanked hard.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Marco stared down at him.\u201cWhy did you hit me in the throat?\u201d</p><p>Desperately, Nicky repositioned himself, pushed again on Marco\u2019s chest as hard as he could while sticking his hand between his legs and grabbing his belt. Marco stood solidly still, staring down at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cIs something supposed to be happening?\u201d Marco asked.</p><p>Nicky straightened back up and glared at Marco.\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to fall down on your back, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, smiling.\u201cShould I do that for you now, baby? Will you come with me?\u201d</p><p>He pulled Nicky in his arms and sat down on the floor, then lay on his back with him still tightly wrapped in his arms. Nicky tried to pull away and finally sagged against his chest.\u201cNo, damn it.I was supposed to be on my feet with you on your back.\u201d He pouted a little.\u201cI was going to fuck you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Marco raised his eyebrows with interest.\u201cOh? Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019d let me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Sounds good to me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-but Logan says Ian hates it and Loganmakes him do it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Marco put back his head and laughed.\u201cWell, that\u2019s fine for Ian, but I like you any way I can get you. Sounds pretty sexy to me.\u201d He leaned up and kissed Nicky.\u201cHey, did you want me to dislike it? I can resist and everything, if you want me to.\u201d</p><p>Nicky laughed.\u201cIdiot! Okay, yes, I want to fuck you very much. Pull those pants off, buddy, and I\u2019ll go get the lube.\u201d</p><p>He jumped up and ran to the bedroom and just when he found it and was on his way back, Marco called out, \u201cOh and Nicky? I think I\u2019ll have bacon and eggs tomorrow, baby. Eggs over easy, please.\u201d</p><p>Nicky stalked back into the room and glared down at him.</p><p>Marco smiled back up at him, unable to resist teasing him.\u201cDid you think I forgot our bet, baby? No way.I\u2019m going to enjoy every minute of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it didn\u2019t work at all?\u201d Evan asked.</p><p>\u201cHell no!\u201d Nicky looked up sullenly at Logan and Evan, who was having a hard time trying to look totally supportive and not smile at all.\u201cThe big gorilla. I did exactly like you told me, Logan.It was like trying to push over a damn tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, did he at least let you top him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. If you can call it that. He was just full of helpful little hints and directions. Talk about a backseat driver.\u201d</p><p>Evan put a companionable arm around Nicky\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t have any fun, Nicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I didn\u2019t say all that. Sex with Marco is always fun. Hell, it\u2019s fantastic. It wasn\u2019t so great, though, when I had to get up this morning at five-thirty to fix his breakfast. Oh, and he rubbed it in too.\u2018Can you bring me some juice, Nicky? Next time don\u2019t cook my eggs quite so long, Nicky. Can you make pancakes, Nicky?I think I\u2019d like some sausage tomorrow too, Nicky,\u2019\u201d Nicky said in a mocking, sing-song voice.\u201cHe\u2019s such an asshole!\u201d</p><p>Evan smiled.\u201cWell, he did win the bet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot helpful, Evan,\u201d Nicky said.</p><p>Nicky looked down at his watch and frowned.\u201dIt\u2019s almost nine o\u2019clock. You guys please come help me. Marco decided to get cute and invite over his council for a breakfast meeting at nine. He wants me to cook.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Evan looked shocked.\u201cHe wants youto cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I kind of volunteered you two as waiters. C\u2019mon, Logan, don\u2019t look at me like that. You got me into this mess with your \u2018Ah, go ahead Nicky, you can do it.If you think you\u2019re defeated, you alreadyare,\u2019 bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Logan laughed.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll help. You coming, Evan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,yeah, I want to make sure Nicky doesn\u2019t poison all of them. I\u2019m still kind of partial to mywolf.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Nicky was still making pancakes, pushing his curly hair off his hot face and shooting dark glances at Marco every chance he got. Evan and Logan were doing all they could to help by serving and washing up, but if looks could kill, Marco and the entire council would already be laid out dead on the floor, Evan thought with amusement. Around the table sat Marco, Ian, Casey, Rory and Brett. Evanhad just finished pouring coffee in everyone\u2019s cups, and was now leaning against Brett, who was there in his new role as Lead Gamma. Rory had recently given up the post to help Casey in his job as Battle Commander. Logan had already started on the mountain of dishes while Nicky was at the stove, finishing up another batch of pancakes for Marco.Somehow, Evan didn\u2019t think this new job of Nicky\u2019s would last much longer after today, no matter what the bet had been.</p><p>Ian pushed back his chair and took a big sip of his coffee.\u201cThank you, Nicky, that was delicious.\u201d The distinct growling sound that came from Nicky\u2019s direction seemed to surprise even Marco.</p><p>\u201cUh, Nicky...honey, you don\u2019t have to keep cooking. I think everyone is full now.\u201d</p><p>Nicky slammed his spatula down and whirled around to face Marco.\u201cWell, if they\u2019re not, they ought to be.It\u2019s like trying to feed a herd of horses.As far as I\u2019m concerned, the kitchen is closed. If anybody else wants anything, they can damn well fix it themselves.\u201d He turned off the stove and perched himself on one of the stools at the bar, lips stuck out in a full-on pout. Evan watched in fascination.</p> <p>A bit red-faced, Marco turned back to his guests and cleared his throat.\u201cOkay...well...now where were we?Oh yes, Ian, you were about to give us the latest report from Dr. Cornsilk.\u201d</p><p>Marco was interrupted by the loud banging of pots as Nicky, who had now moved over to help Logan, began to slam pots and pans around in the sink.</p><p>\u201cNicky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not doing anything...\u201d Nicky\u2019s voice was unrepentant, but he did stop banging things around.</p><p>\u201cWhere was I?\u201d Ian asked.\u201cOh yes, he sent this over yesterday, I believe. Apparently there was real uproar after Brett escaped with Evan. Elias Winters was furious. Dr. Cornsilk has only been working with this Operation Wolfsbane for about five months now, and he still doesn\u2019t have full access to all the records from before he was assigned to the project. After all the leaks and escapes recently, Winters is really tightening up. Dr. Cornsilk may not be able to bring us many more reports for a while or it will jeopardize his position.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded.\u201cUnderstandable. We should let him lie very low for a long while. He was too close to Evan\u2019s situation not to be under suspicion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ian said. \u201cAnyway, he said there have been rumors that some of the soldiers in this Operation Wolfsbane of his are already at a secret camp somewhere in the mountains, but nobody knows exactly where. We thought Evan might be the first of them, but apparently they\u2019ve been training there for months\u2014much longer than we\u2019ve known about before now. And one more thing\u2014some of the rumors say the men are already feral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Casey said, speaking up for the first time. \u201cIt can\u2019t be true. How would he manage to keep them alive? If it were, we could really be in some trouble. If Winters set them loose on innocent humans, people will be sure to blame us.We could be in serious danger here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not jump to conclusions,\u201d Marco said. \u201cBrett, while you were being held captive, did they ever bring in any more soldiers other than Evan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I wasn\u2019t there long. They took a lot of my blood, but that\u2019s about it. That and the whippings,\u201d Brett said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cSo we have no reason to think this is true, necessarily. They took a lot of Brett\u2019s blood, but surely not enough to feed a whole group of feral soldiers. Like Casey said, they would have died soon without blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not necessarily,\u201d Nicky said, looking over his shoulder as he helped Logan wash dishes.\u201cI mean, Gabe certainly didn\u2019t die, and he said he\u2019d been bitten for over a year before Zack found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Marco\u2019s tone was sharp in the suddenly quiet kitchen.</p><p>Nicky turned.\u201cUh...nothing.I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d He turned back around and started busily swiping at a dish.</p> <p>\u201cNicky? Are you talking about the Georgia Alpha\u2019s pet? Gabe? What do you mean he was feral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have misunderstood me. I said he went sterile. A real shame...so young too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Marco.\u201d Nicky turned and Evan saw tears standing his eyes. He threw down the dish towel he\u2019d been using, and squared off to face his mate. \u201cI\u2019m tired and I\u2019ve been working since I got up this morning at five thirty! My back hurts and my feet hurt and my fingers are all pruney. And now you\u2019re yelling at me!\u201d</p><p>Evan had to smother a smile. No one, including Marco, had raised his voice to Nicky, but Nicky was playing this like an Academy Award winning actor. He even let his lower lip tremble just a bit.</p><p>Evan could see every wolf at the table flinch. This was the kind of behavior that raised their hackles but also brought out every protective bone in their bodies. Evan knew each and every one of them was dying to go over and comfort Nicky and tell him it was going to be fine. They probably also wanted very badly to put him across their knee.</p><p>Marco recovered first. Probably, Evanfigured, because he\u2019d had so much experience with Nicky\u2019s wiles. He stood up and advanced on Nicky, stopping only inches away. Apparently unable to resist, he pulled him into his arms to comfort him but still held his gaze with a stern look.</p><p>\u201cSettle down, sweetheart. Tell me what you know about Gabe, and stop trying to distract me. I know you\u2019re tired, and you can go lie down in a few minutes, but now you\u2019re going to explain what you were talking about.\u201d</p><p>Nicky fiddled with the buttons on the front of Marco\u2019s shirt and sighed. \u201cOkay. You know, Gabe the Georgia pack\u2019s alpha\u2019s mate? Zack\u2019s the alpha, right? Well, Gabe and I were talking about how they met, you know, just passing the time, and he told me he was feral for about a year before Zack found him and mated with him.He said he didn\u2019t like changing at the full moon, or whenever he got too upset, but other than that, it wasn\u2019t too bad.\u201d</p><p>Marco tipped his chin up.\u201cNicky, are you sure of this? Be serious, now, and don\u2019t lie about this.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at Marco in amazement.\u201cI never lie, Marco.\u201d His voice was so hurt, so sincere and innocent that Evan was stunned for a moment. Nicky was playing Marco like a virtuoso plays a violin. Evan settled back to watch the master work.\u201cGabe told me. He was feral for a year after that wolf bit him and killed his mother. He said he changed at the full moon or if he got too stressed out. Like that time with me, remember? Only you thought I would die if you didn\u2019t give me all that blood.\u201d He shrugged.\u201cGuess you were wrong.\u201d He patted Marco\u2019s chest a little to take the sting out of the words.\u201cGabe said he just went to sleep and then woke up the next morning back to normal.Until the next time.\u201d</p><p>Still holding him, Marco turned to Ian. \u201cWhy would Zack not have given us this information? We need to contact Zack right away and get him and Gabe up here to verify all of this. We need to question Gabe more too. Find out if he ever attacked anyone and how he controlled his urges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Nicky cried. \u201cGabe told me that in confidence.I don\u2019t think he wanted anyone to know. I would hate for anyone to think I was a gossip or I spread rumors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for that,\u201d Rory said, laughing. \u201cThat train left the station a long time ago. Good job, Nicky.\u201d</p><p>Nicky made a fist and tried to get to Rory, Marco\u2019s nephew, and a young man with whom he\u2019d always had a close, but somewhat contentious, and teasing relationship. Marco held onto Nicky and raised his eyebrows at Rory in censure. Rory smiled and dropped his gaze.</p><p>Nicky turned back to Marco.\u201cYou can\u2019t say anything, Marco, or Gabe will know I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart, but this is too important. I won\u2019t tell him how we found out, okay? Zack should have told us months ago. Any information we can have about the ferals is vital now.\u201d</p><p>Ian jumped up from the table.\u201cI\u2019m on it\u2014I\u2019ll call Zack right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell him we heard about it, and ask them to come prepared to stay a few days,\u201d Marco called after him.He finally released Nicky, who tried hard to catch Rory\u2019s eye. Failing, he sat down at the counter, somewhat subdued.</p><p>Rory spoke to Marco as he sat back down at the table.\u201cSince Nicky went feral once, why not let him go again?He\u2019s always wanting to fight, so this would be his big chance. He and I could finally face off in the ancestral ring, man to man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Nicky asked.\u201cI could do that but where would we find the other man in your little scenario?\u201d Nicky sneered at him as Rory started out of his seat, and this time it was Casey\u2019s turn to pull his mate back down.</p><p>Marco frowned at both Rory and Nicky. \u201cWill you two stop it?In fact, let\u2019s just adjourn for now and meet later when we know for surewhen Zack and his mate are coming.\u201d</p><p>Everyone got up and filed outside, including Logan and Evan, who called out a promise to Nicky they\u2019d help him clean up later on. As the door closed behind them, Evan heard Marco telling Nicky he needed to \u201ctake him back to bedroom for a while to have a little talk.\u201d Chuckling, he walked down the hallway to catch up with Brett, who\u2019d gone ahead to check the little box that held their incoming mail. He found Brett standing thoughtfully in front of the box, holding a letter in his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, babe. Are you ready to go back to our room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m ready, all right,\u201d Brett turned a furious face toward him. \u201cReady to find out why this son-of-a-bitch thinks he can keep sending letters tomy mate!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Brett? Is that my mail? Let me see.\u201d Brett turned his back on him and walked quickly down the hall to their room, Evan behind him, half running to keep up with him. Brett slammed the door back on its hinges and threw himself down on the sofa, glaring up at Evan. He held up the letter and then flipped it over to him contemptuously.\u201cHere. Read it if you want to, and then I\u2019m writing a return.\u201d</p><p>Evan caught the letter, shaking his head at the display of jealousy. \u201cYou have no reason to act like this, you know. Ididn\u2019t do anything. I certainly didn\u2019t ask him to write to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so calm.\u201d</p><p>Evan raised his eyebrows.\u201cThis is your idea of calm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knowsyou\u2019re with me, damn it. Why does he keep writing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea. Eric is flirtatious and thinks he\u2019s charming.\u201d Evan opened the letter and sat down beside him so he could read it along with him.\u201cLook, let\u2019s read it together\u2014you\u2019ll see I haven\u2019t been secretly corresponding with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need to do that. I trust you\u2014it\u2019s this guy I don\u2019t trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Evan ripped into the back of the letter and began to read.\u201cDear Evan\u2014I know I should have thought of this sooner, but since I got your mother\u2019s letter, all I can think about...\u201d Evan\u2019s voice trailed off, and he got a dumbfounded look on his face.\u201cOh God...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brett pulled the letter out of Evan\u2019s hand and continued to read. \u201c...since I got your mother\u2019s letter, all I can think about is you, sweetheart. I made the biggest mistake of my life letting you go, and I know it now. Please come back to me...\u201d The timbre of Brett\u2019s voice dropped at least an octave as he read, and his eyes started to glow. He crumpled the paper in his hand and glared unbelievingly at Evan. He turned slowly back to the letter, straightening it out, then holding it up out of reach and pushing Evan back as he made a dive for it.\u201cAll I can think about are your luscious lips, and your sweet little ass I fit into so perfectly. You were mine first, and you\u2019ll be mine again. All you have to do is get away from him and then call me and tell me where to meet you.Waiting for you, my little bunny.\u201d Brett turned an incredulous, stunned gaze on Evan.\u201cHis little bunny? His fucking little bunny!Oh my God! I\u2019ll show that motherfucker whose goddamn bunnyyou are!\u201d</p><p>He jumped to his feet, murder in his eye, and began to pace back and forth like a wild animal. Evan had seen him shift once before and he thought he was near that state again. His claws came out as he gripped the letter and hair began to sprout on his chest and face. With his already glowing eyes, he was a frightening sight to behold. He picked up a vase from beside the sofa and threw it against the wall and then he put his fist into the wall next to it, shattering the drywall and causing bits of plaster and insulation to float around the room. He picked up a chair next and bounced it off the door, splintering the legs and looked around for something else to throw as the door suddenly flew open, and Casey and Rory stood looking in with concern.</p><p>Evan knew what they must be seeing\u2014him cowering on the couch with his arms over his head to avoid the flying debris and Evan, half-shifted, wildly looking around for more objects to toss around the room. They only hesitated a fraction of a second before Casey made it over to Brett and put him in a headlock, while Rory, ignoring pack law, threw Evan over his shoulder and ran out of the room with him. He put him down outside when he saw Logan hurrying toward them.</p> <p>\u201cLogan, watch out for Evan!\u201d Then he rushed back in to help subdue Brett. Evan made one attempt to go back in, worried that Brett might be hurt, before Logan took him out to the main room and sat him down.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t hurt him. They\u2019ll just stay with him until he calms down. Did he shift?\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded. Logan smiled and patted his arm.\u201cA wolf in full tantrum mode is pretty scary. He didn\u2019t hurt you, did he?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Evan folded his trembling hands together.\u201cNo, the furniture and walls got the worst of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in hell happened?\u201d</p><p>Evan put his head in his hands.\u201cI got a letter from my stupid ex-boyfriend asking me to come back home to him.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s eyes opened wide.\u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and he was saying stuff about my body and he c -called me his little bunny.\u201d</p> <p>Logan looked astonished for a moment and then convulsed in laughter, leaning over and holding his sides.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Evan, I\u2019m not laughing at you, really. I just got a sudden image of Ian\u2019s face if I got a letter like that. God, to a wolf, that\u2019s justifiable homicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t led him on, Logan, really. The last letter I got I just threw away. Brett saw me throw it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Brett has left the building right now, Evan, or his rational self has. From the sound of things in there, he\u2019s now in full wolf mode.\u201d Brett could see reinforcements running toward their room as snarls, loud thuds and shouts drifted down the hall.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon with me, and let\u2019s go upstairs.We need to help Nicky anyway, and you can\u2019t go back in there anytime soon.You\u2019ll just remind him how much he wants to kill yourex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Nicky and Marco...\u201d he trailed off as he saw Marco sprinting down the steps on the way to their room, barefoot and still fastening up his jeans.Evan\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cNow Nicky will be pissed off too.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked speculatively after Marco.\u201cOh, he finished his uh...business with Nicky. Why do you think he\u2019s the last to arrive?\u201d Laughing at the look on Evan\u2019s face, he pulled him up the stairs and over to the alpha\u2019s quarters.</p><p>Rapping his knuckles on the door as he entered, Logan called out.\u201cNicky! Evan and I are here. Get decent and come out to the living room.\u201d</p><p>Nicky appeared a few moments later, blond hair tousled and sticking up all over his head, cheeks reddened from Marco\u2019s beard, and still managing to look gorgeous.\u201cWhat\u2019s all the commotion downstairs?Marco took off out of here like the place was on fire.\u201d</p><p>Logan told Nicky about the letter and he chuckled sympathetically.\u201cFirst time he partially shifted in front of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the second,\u201d Evan said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t like it any better.\u201d</p><p>Nicky plopped down on the sofa and put his bare feet up on the coffee table.\u201cThey\u2019ll get him calmed down in a few minutes. Now before they get here, tell me about this guy who wrote the letter.Were you guys together long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little over a year. We met in college and moved in together for a year or so after we graduated. He cheated on me almost from the beginning. The last time was with another friend of ours, and I walked in on them. It was an ugly breakup and I don\u2019t even know why my mother talked to him about me. She was angry with him for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter the devil you know...\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Anyway, she\u2019s the one who gave him my address.\u201d He wrung his hands together for a moment, realized what he was doing and jammed them in his pockets.\u201cWill they punish him now? They wouldn\u2019t hurt him, right?\u201d</p><p>Nicky snorted.\u201cMore likely help him plan your ex-boyfriend\u2019s murder. No, they\u2019ll just calm him down some, empathize with him, slap him on the back and tell him not to take it out on the furniture next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrett won\u2019t go after my ex or anything, will he? I mean, they wouldn\u2019t really m-murder him...would they?\u201d</p><p>Logan laughed and shook his head.\u201cNo, Evan, don\u2019t worry. He should be perfectly safe so long as he stays away from the compound. That\u2019s not to say Brett won\u2019t have a word with him if he keeps bothering you, but they\u2019re not savages.\u201d Nicky rolled his eyes, and Logan smiled at him.\u201cWell, not totally.\u201d</p><p>Nicky cocked his head to one side as they heard loud voices on the stairs.\u201cOh hell, here they come. Logan, you can help me with the dishes.Evan\u2019s going to be busy for a while.\u201d</p><p>Evan stood up and backed toward the kitchen.\u201cOh no, he\u2019s not coming near me. He scared the shit out of me just now. What if he starts thinking about it again and starts to shift all over again?\u201d</p><p>Logan patted his shoulder sympathetically.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go with him. Tell Marco if you want to stay here for a while.\u201d</p><p>Nicky shrugged.\u201cYou can, but Marco may not want to get involved in this one. My advice is just to go with him. Let him fuss over you and apologize and have his way.If you don\u2019t he\u2019ll just get even more jealous and think you don\u2019t want to be with him.\u201d</p><p>Marco came in the room, followed by a somewhat subdued Brett, who was back to his human form. Brett came immediately over to Evan and put his arms around him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey. Are you okay?I didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p><p>The minute Evan saw him, his handsome face creased with worry and concern, he melted and allowed Brett to pull him into his arms. What was there about these wolves that made them so compelling and hard to resist? Other than the fact that they were beautiful. And sexy. And hot as fuck.</p><p>Murmuring to him, Brett drew him to the door. Evan looked back over his shoulder in time to see one of Nicky\u2019s eyelids drop in a slow, deliberate wink.</p><p>Brett led him downstairs and back to their room. He watched Evan look around the main sitting area to see that the debris of the chair and vase had been cleaned up and the room straightened. The pets they called in from the clean-up crew worked pretty fast. He wondered if this kind of losing control thing happened often enough with a wolf that they had the clean-up down to a science. Maybe all the wolves needed to learn a little better self-control. Okay, make that definitely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brett wasted no time either, turning to kiss his mate the minute he closed the door behind them and then walking Evan backward to the bed until the backs of his knees hit the mattress. He let his hands fall to thefastening of Evan\u2019s jeans, and then he pushed Evan down to pull off his shoes and tug his jeans, underwear and socks off in one practiced pull. His own jeans hit the floor beside Evan\u2019s, and he picked Evan up with one arm around his waist to move them both farther up onto the bed.</p><p>Unable to help himself a moment longer, he dragged Evan closer and gave him a hard and possessive kiss. Too hard. Evan could taste a hint of blood on his tongue as his lips jammed againstBrett\u2019s teeth, and he made a loud cry of alarm. Instantly, Brett drew back, looking at him with concern. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, baby! I\u2019m having a hard time being gentle.\u201d He seemed to make himself fall away from Evan onto the bed beside him to give himself a minute to gain control. He glanced over at Evan and the tears gathering in his eyes must have shamed him</p><p>\u201cI should have left you alone for a while. I should do it now. I should get up off the bed, apologize and go for a run or something.I\u2019m sorry, babe.\u201d Evan leaned ove r him and kissed him gently. Brett\u2019s mouth was hot, his sweet tongue slipping past Evan\u2019s lips to touch his tongue and sweep over the inside. Brett opened his arms and drew him in closer, tasting him. He rolled Evan back under him and pushed his knees up. Evanknew this wasn\u2019t going to last very long\u2014Brett was too keyed up, wanted to possess him, to own him too much. Brett reached blindly for the lube on the table beside the bed and smeared some on his cock.</p> <p>Trying hard to slow himself down, he took a deep breath and eased one lubed finger inside Evan, desperate but still unwilling to hurt him without stretching him a bit first.Evan\u2019s thighs opened wide, giving him access. For a moment their eyes met and rather than the possessive rage he thought he might see in Brett\u2019s eyes, he saw a haze of lust before his eyelids closed again. Evan\u2019s mouth squirmedas Brett\u2019s finger probed inside him, locating the spongy gland he was searching for. Brett swept his finger over it and Evan came undone, arching his back and gripping his knees until his knuckles turned white as hiscock spurted cum onto Brett\u2019s chest.</p><p>Before he even finished, Brett pulled out his finger and replaced it with his cock, plunging inside and fucking his lover hard.Evan moved his hands to Brett\u2019s shoulders and clutched him just as hard, clenching his teeth and taking everything Brett had to give.</p><p>Passion and love filled him at the sight of Brett\u2019s beautiful face so close to his. This man was his, and he wanted him to mark him as his own. He felt Brett sink his teeth into his neck, hoping to leave such a mark. Evan turned to give him more access, leaning toward him, baring his neck. Brett pulled back afterward and licked at the bite, noting the teeth marks with apparent satisfaction.</p><p>He pushed into Evan\u2019s body, embedding himself as he emptied his seed into him. Evan felt his body go lax as he collapsed on top of Evan and finally pulled away, falling off to the side and pulling Evan with him.</p><p>Brett lay on his back for a long time, trying to catch his breath, stroking Evan\u2019s back. Evan rolled off after a while and moved shakily to the bathroom. After a few minutes, Brett got up and came in to find Evan staring at himself in the mirror. Brett walked up behind him and put his arms around his waist. Evan leaned back into him and closed his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d \u201cYes, I was just admiring your handiwork.\u201d He opened his eyes and put a hand to his throat, where the full set of teeth marks were already standing out against his pale skin.</p><p>Brett touched the marks with his fingertips.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you, love.\u201d</p><p>Evan smiled back at him in the mirror.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I kind of like it because it marks me as yours.\u201d</p><p>Brett groaned and pulled him even closer, feeling his cock hardening again at the words.</p><p>\u201cOne thing I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Evan said, peering at himself more closely. \u201cYeah? What\u2019s that, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell he called me his bunny? And then you did it too. What is there about me that screams rabbit?\u201d</p> <p>Brett smiled, his hands roaming over Evan\u2019s body. \u201cWell, you\u2019re soft and warm and cuddly and awfully cute.\u201d</p><p>Evan made a sound of outrage and tried, not very hard, to pull away. He arched a look over his shoulder at him.\u201cDo wolves eat rabbits?\u201d</p><p>Brett kissed his neck again.\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cC\u2019mon bunny rabbit,\u201d he said, pulling him back toward the bed. \u201cLet me see how you taste, and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The big Ford pickup holding the alpha of the Georgia branch of the wolf pack and his mate pulled up in front of the lodge. Zack, the big Alpha got out first and was joined by his mate, Gabe. Evan stood to the side next to Rory, watching them greet their alpha and Nicky who had come out to meet them. Zack looked a lot like Marco, actually, both a little larger than most of the other wolves with dark brown hair and the high cheekbones of the clan. He knew a lot of the wolves were related, and wondered if these two were cousins or something and decided they probably were.</p><p>Gabe, on the other hand, looked like Nicky with dark hair. Where Nicky\u2019s hair was blond, his was shiny black. His skin was fair, like Nicky\u2019s, and they were about the same size and both had toned, muscular chests tapering to slim waists. When he turned, however, his eyes were much lighter blue than Nicky\u2019s and were striking with his black hair and eyelashes. He was wearing a bit of eyeliner too, making the contrast even more remarkable. He wore a wide gold choker necklace around his neck that Evan was fascinated by. He\u2019d been in enough gay bars to know that necklace was a collar.</p><p>Nicky drew him over to where Evan and Rory were standing. \u201cGabe, you remember Rory, of course, and this is a new member of our pack, Evan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Evan.You\u2019re very pretty,\u201d he said and then laughed at Evan\u2019s shocked expression. He held up his hand to show off a wide gold band studded with diamonds. \u201cI\u2019m happily married, honey, so you have nothing to worry about. My big stud keeps me very satisfied.\u201d He turned to wink at Nicky.\u201cBut I\u2019m not dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will be if Zack catches you flirting,\u201d Nicky said, smiling. \u201cC\u2019mon in and have some lunch.I warn you, there\u2019ll be an interrogation afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who let it slip, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Gabe asked. Nicky blushed and Gabe put his arm around his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. Never was to me, but Zack wanted it kept quiet. It was his cousin, Tim, who bit me, you know, and killed my mother. I think he was pretty ashamed of that for his family\u2019s sake. Then too, a lot of the Werekin have some strange ideas about becoming feral, thinking we\u2019re wild and unpredictable most of the time other than just at the full moon. No matter how much we feed.I don\u2019t think he ever even considered the Hunters. We don\u2019t see nearly as much of them as you do over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently the Hunters have made some of their own soldiers feral, according to one of our sources,\u201d Rory said. \u201cThey\u2019re experimenting with synthetic blood, maybe to gain better control, and trying to figureout a way to duplicate the mating bite to see how it factors in.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looked surprised.\u201cWe hadn\u2019t heard about all that. What\u2019s the point with the feral soldiers?Would they use them in an attack?\u201d</p><p>Nicky sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be happy to tell your alpha about my experiences.\u201d</p><p>From behind them, Marco spoke up.\u201cGood, Gabe.I\u2019m glad to hear it. Zack and I have just been talking about it. I understand he was only trying to protect you by not telling us about your past. Nicky faced negative commentstoo after his change.\u201d</p><p>Nicky shrugged. \u201cYes, some.It didn\u2019t help that I shifted in front of the whole pack. It\u2019s mostly forgotten now that they see nothing happens to me at the full moon.\u201d</p><p>Gabe shuddered.\u201cThank God, right? I hated it.\u201d</p><p>Zack came around to his side and pulled him close. Gabe smiled up at him and they all walked toward the dining hall off the main room. Tables had been set up there for the visitors and soon everyone had filled their plates at the small buffet set up on the side of the room.</p><p>Evan and Brett sat at a long table near the back. After he finished, Evan leaned against his mate.\u201cDo you think Gabe is nice-looking?\u201d</p><p>Brett glanced up and then back at him.\u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous. Not as gorgeous as you, of course, but then nobody is.\u201d</p><p>Evan smiled at him.\u201cGood answer.\u201d Brett leaned down to kiss Evan and then went back to shoveling in his lunch. Since the incident with the letter, Brett had been extra-attentive to Evan. He\u2019d written a letter to Eric and let Evan read it before he sent it off. It was a very nice letter, considering how angry he\u2019d been, and it simply stated that Evan was not interested in receiving any more letters, as he was now quite totally and irrevocably involved with someone else. Namely him. He asked that he refrain from sending anymore letters, and he would refrain from rearranging his face. Evan thought it was a pretty nice letter, all things considered, and gave his permission to send it.</p><p>As the meal drew to a close and the various members of the pack went back to work, Marco and his group still sat at the table and he motioned for Brett and Evan to come over and join them. Marco introduced Brett as his lead gamma, and while he shook Zack\u2019s hand and exchanged a few words, Evan slipped down to the end of the table where Nicky, Logan and Gabe were sitting, still laughing at some of Gabe\u2019s outrageous stories of his adventures as a feral creature before he met Zack.</p><p>\u201cOne night,\u201d he told them, \u201cI\u2019d had one too many...okay I\u2019d had eight or ninetoo many,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cBut I was dancing and having a good time in one of the gay bars off Ponce de Leon Street in Atlanta. I\u2019d kind of let the days slip up on me, and didn\u2019t even realize it was supposed to be a full moon that night. I was doing a few drugs, and smoking pretty bad in those days, and I don\u2019t mean cigarettes. Anyway, I let this guy talk me into going out back for a quick blow job. So there I was, on my knees, doing my thing, you know, out in the alley. All of a sudden the clouds parted and this big, beautiful moon came out and I looked up and saw it. I could feel the change coming over me, so I was trying to get away from this dude so I wouldn\u2019t accidentally hurt him. He was an asshole, really, so when he realized I was stopping he put his hand on the back of my head and pushed me back on his dick. Then he looked down and got a good look at what had his dick in its mouth.\u201d He held his sides and fell back in his chair.\u201cYou should have seen his face.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evan was a little shocked but had to admit it was funny. He was laughing along with them when Brett came up beside him. His lips were a little tight, and he pulled Evan out of his chair a little too hard.\u201cGo back to the room, baby and I\u2019ll be along in a few minutes.\u201d When Evan didn\u2019t move, but just looked at him curiously, he took his wrist and pulled him along to their room. Rather than embarrass himself by resisting, he went along, but when Brett tried to put him in the room, he pulled away.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Brett?I was talking with my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard some of that and I don\u2019t like that kind of talk around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Brett? I\u2019m not twelve. Gabe\u2019s an interesting guy\u2014I mean,he\u2019s a lot more open about his sexualitythan I ever was, but I like him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, if he was mine, I\u2019d bust his little butt for him. He\u2019s the alpha\u2019s mate now, and he disrespects Zack by talking about putting his mouth on other guy\u2019s dicks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t done it , and you too for that matter.Hell, just this morning....\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough. What we do in private is our business.We\u2019re mates. No, you stay away from that guy.\u201d</p><p>A rush of anger swept over Evan. He was tired of always being treated like a child.\u201cYou mean stay home like a good little wife? Fuck you, Brett.I\u2019m going back to talk to my friends.\u201d He took off down the hallway and made it about five steps before one big hand took his arm and another swatted his ass so hard it lifted him off his feet.</p><p>He whirled around with his mouth open and Brett backed him up against the wall, putting a hand on either side of his head.\u201cFuck me, huh?If the alpha didn\u2019t want me in on this discussion, I\u2019d take you in there and show you who\u2019s going to get fucked. Now you go back in the room and wait for me,or I\u2019ll put you over my knee right here. You don\u2019t talk back to me, understand? Nicky and Gabe are both wild, and I don\u2019t like their influence on you. We\u2019ll talk about this when I get back.\u201d</p> <p>Huffing angrily, but knowing he would carry out his threat, Evan didn\u2019t dare say the words trembling on his lips, but did give him one more searing look and stalked back to their room. Once he got there, he was so angry he paced up and down for several minutes before hurling himself into a chair. About ten minutes later, a knock came on the door and the door opened to reveal Nicky. \u201cHey, Evan, I was worried about you.You...uh, left so abruptly.\u201d He regarded him sympathetically.\u201cBrett\u2019s pissed, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Evan said. \u201cThat jealous, controlling, infuriating jerk! He spanked me on my ass and told me to stay away from Gabe.\u201d</p><p>Nicky smiled and nodded.\u201cYeah, I could have guessed. I saw that he overheard Gabe. But Gabe is really a nice person. He was a small-town boy from Alabama when he was attacked and his mother killed right in front of him.He woke up to find that he\u2019d been turned into this monster, and there was no one around to explain to him what had happened. Most people would have probably killed themselves, but he\u2019s really strong. He left his home and started working construction jobs wherever he could find them, just bumming around, with no home and no one to love him. When the urges came on him, he went up into the mountains to hide and stay away from humans because he didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody. That\u2019s where Zack found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, he must have been scared out of his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he was. I was terrified when it happened to me, and Marco found me in only minutes. Gabe went for a whole year. Sure he drank too much and partied too hard. Maybe it was sort of like anesthesia, in a way, to help him forget about everything. I hope Brett will lighten up and let you guys be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning not to carewhat Brett thinks. He\u2019s acting like an idiot and if he tries to hit me again, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really mean that. I know how you feel, Evan, believe me, but in his mind, he was just laying down the law by giving you a swat on the butt. Did he tell you he never wanted to marry a human? He told Marco they were way too much trouble. Jealous as he is, I can see why he\u2019s having such a hard time.\u201d He patted his arm.\u201cJust don\u2019t fight him so much.If you do, he\u2019ll dig in his heels.\u201d</p><p>Nicky got up and went to the door.\u201cI\u2019ve got to head back. Marco wants to question Gabe and the council has some questions for me too. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d He left and Evan was left alone to worry about what Brett would do when he got home. It made him even angrier that he was worried about it. Since when had Brett become his boss? He had to put a stop to this and right away. He needed to lay down a few laws of his own.</p><p>He got up and prowled around the room, feeling defiant and restless. He went over to the wastebasket, dug around a minute and pulled out the letter from Eric. When he\u2019d watched Brett answer the letter the day before, Evan had caught a glimpse of more writing at the bottom of the page that he never got a chance to read.He didn\u2019t want to say anything at the time to further upset Brett, but he had to admit to a little curiosity about what else Eric had said. In his current defiant mood, he decided to get the letter out of the basket and look at it again before the trash went out in the morning. Finding it, he walked back over to the sofa and opened it back up scanning down to the bottom of the page.</p><p>I have a new job, Evan. Elias Winters himself called after you were taken, and asked me to join the Hunters. He said he wanted me for a special operation called Wolfsbane. By the time you get this, I should already be training.</p><p>Evan jumped back to his feet in shock. Elias Winters had recruited Eric! He was going to make him a feral creature, at war with the wolf pack. Why would he do such a thing? Was Wintersangry over what he must have thought was Evan\u2019s defection and betrayal? It had to be some kind of sick revenge thing. Another sudden idea made him stop dead in his tracks. What if he thought he could lure Evan back this way?</p><p>He had to warn Eric.Even though he didn\u2019t love Eric anymore and hadn\u2019t for a long time, he couldn\u2019t stand by while Winters did that to someone who used to be important to him. Hell, he couldn\u2019t stand by and let it happen to anybody if he could stop it. Somehow he had to get word to him. He had to warn him.He\u2019d tell Brett\u2014he\u2019d know what to do.</p><p>The door opened and Brett came in, filling up the room with his presence, like he usually did. Before Evan could open his mouth, Brett looked from the letter in Evan\u2019s hand, back up to his face. He looked so surprised and hurt all at the same time that Evan panicked and thrust the letter behind his back.\u201cBrett! I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be back so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Brett\u2019s voice was low pitched and quiet. He took a step further into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s that behind your back, there, Evan? Catching up on a little correspondence?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Oh, this?\u201d So much for his fine words and earlier defiance. The minute Brett walked in the room, Evan felt like a stupid kid again.</p><p>He pulled the letter from behind his back, feeling the heat rise to his cheeks.\u201cBrett, I can explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Okay, this should be good. Go ahead, Evan. Explain why I walked in to find my mate poring over his old boyfriend\u2019s love letter.Rereading the part about his cock up your ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Brett! Don\u2019t be so crude. It\u2019s not like that at all. I just remembered that there was a part at the end of Eric\u2019s letter I didn\u2019t read, and I was kind of curious, you know. Then too, I was kind of mad at you...\u201d</p><p>Brett started walking toward him.Evan couldn\u2019t stop himself from backing up. Trouble was he had nowhere to go as his legs were up against the sofa. Brett walked up to him until he was almost touching him, making Evan stare up at him. He reached out and took the letter from Evan\u2019s nerveless fingers, ripped it in half and let the pieces fall down between them.</p><p>\u201cSo you thought you\u2019d get back at me by taking up with your lover? Is he what you want, Evan? Do you want to leave me and go to him like he asked you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I don\u2019t want him. I just told you, I was finishing his letter. Why are you acting like this?\u201d</p><p>Brett stepped away from him and sat down in the chair across from the sofa, just staring at him. Nervous, Evan went over to stand in front of him. Almost automatically, it seemed, Brett opened his knees to let Evan stand close.</p><p>\u201cI found something in his letter, Brett. I was coming to find you to tell you about it when you came in. Eric says in his letter that he was recruited by Elias Winters.\u201d</p><p>Brett looked up at him and shrugged. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Didn\u2019t you hear me? Elias Winters recruited Eric.Doesn\u2019t that strike you as odd? He\u2019s going to make Eric feral!You told me that\u2019s what he was doing with gay men. We have to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about your lover, Evan.Although it\u2019s pretty damn obvious you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling him my lover, damn it! Of course I care, like I would about any human being, and likeyou would if you weren\u2019t being such a dick.\u201d</p><p>Brett\u2019s lips tightened and he turned his head away, refusing to even look at him. Evan was at a loss. He stood for a moment and then turned away in defeat. Maybe if he wrote a letter and got Nicky to mail it for him...</p><p>Before he got more than two steps away, Brett grabbed his wrist and pulled him into his lap. He landed with a surprised chuff of breath as Brett covered his mouth fiercely and plunged his tongue into Evan\u2019s mouth. He kissed him literally breathless and then pulled Evan up so close to his chest he was squirming to get away and get some air. Finally, Evan held him away and looked deeply into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Evan. Damn it, I don\u2019t like acting so crazy, scaring you, and pushing you away. I hate it, but I can\u2019t seem to stop it. The thought of you leaving me\u2014I couldn\u2019t stand it, baby. I\u2019m not lettingyou go!\u201d He pulled him back to his chest again, but Evan got both hands up in time to push him away a bit.</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of going anywhere. I love you too, but you hit me and made me come back in here like a kid or something. Ithas to stop, Brett.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brett stared at him moodily, but his head did drop in a barely perceptible nod. Evan smiled and cupped his face in his hands.\u201cYou have nothing to worry about, sweetheart. I never loved Eric anywhere close to the way I love you, and I\u2019m not going to suddenly start wearing makeup and acting like Gabe, because I happen to like his company. I mean, damn, give me some credit. I just barely met the guy.\u201d</p><p>Brett remained quiet, content to just hold Evan in his lap, apparently and rub his knuckles absently across Evan\u2019s rapidly growing erection. \u201cUh, Brett? Either take care of that or stop handling it, please.It\u2019s getting uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since entering the room, Brettsmiled. \u201cI\u2019d love to, baby, but I have to get back to the meeting. They just broke for a few minutes, so I came here to check on you. I wanted to apologize.\u201d He blushed a little, and Evan leaned in to kiss him again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come back in there with me? They\u2019re still in the main hall and a few other wolves and pets are listening.That way I can...\u201d His voice trailed off, and a slow blush stained his cheeks again.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, yeah, in a way. I like to look at you, and I want to show you I\u2019m sorry about what I did, you know, earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpanking my ass? Sending me to my room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said I was sorry about that.\u201d Brett\u2019s red cheeks looked as if they might become permanent, so Evan put him out of his misery by smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cActually you didn\u2019t, but that was a nice apology for you, so I\u2019ll take it. I still want to talk about this Eric thing. I have to warn him, Brett. Or you can do it, whatever. It may be already too late, but I have to at least try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, showing just a trace of his earlier bad temper at the mention of his name again.\u201cI\u2019ll tell Marco and he can figure out a way to get word to him, if it\u2019s not too late already.\u201d He pointed a finger in Evan\u2019s face. \u201cYou stay away from him though. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Evan leaned forward and took Brett\u2019s long finger in his mouth, swirling his tongue over the back side and sucking it inside.Brett\u2019s eyebrows rose, he made a funny, choking sound and lifted Evan up in his arms as he strode toward the bedwith him, Evan\u2019s legs wrapped around his waist.</p><p>Laughing, Evan said,\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t have enough time.\u201d</p><p>He threw Evan down and began jerking on the fastenings of his jeans.\u201cI don\u2019t, so get those clothes off.\u201d As Evan wiggled out of his jeans, his erection popped free of his tight pants and bounced off his stomach.</p> <p>Brett watched in fascination and he swallowed hard a couple of times. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t going to take much time at all,\u201d he said, as he dived into the bed after him.</p><p>The meeting was already in full swing as they entered from the back of the room. Evan found a table where he could watch and listen and still not be too conspicuous as he eavesdropped, though he noticed several other Werekin in the room, doing the same thing. Brett slipped in and sat at the end of the table with the other council members, receiving a slight raising of the eyebrow from Marco.</p><p>\u201cGlad you could join us, Brett.\u201d He waited until Brett mumbled an apology and then focused his attention back on Gabe, who was being questioned by the council. He was sitting by his mate, Zack, who had a protective arm around him, and Gabe looked a little nervous.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to tell you, Marco. Tim bit me, that\u2019s about it. He killed my poor mom, and left me for dead there in that rest stop.If it hadn\u2019t been for the state patrolman following the trucker in there, he probably would have killed me too.\u201d</p><p>Zack spoke up beside him. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly true, honey. Before he died, Tim said he wanted you for his mate.Your mother just got in the way.\u201d</p><p>Casey leaned forward.\u201cIf that\u2019s what he was trying to do, then why didn\u2019t he mate with you?\u201d</p><p>Gabe bit his lip and looked helplessly at Zack, who immediately pulled him closer and spoke up.\u201cHe did. Or at least he tried to. He was in the middle of it when the patrolman arrived and heard Gabe\u2019s screams. Tim never got a chance to finish, and that\u2019s all either of us is going to say on thatsubject.\u201d He glared around the table at all of them and there was an awkward little silence.</p><p>Marco cleared his throat.\u201cOf course. That does raise some questions though, and I wonder if even the\u2013uh\u2014brief contact was enough to make a difference in his ability to survive. Most of our oral traditions passed down by the family say that if a person is bitten by a wolf and not cared for with the blood, then they die.Period.\u201d</p> <p>Ian shook his head.\u201cMaybe not true, Marco. Logan said Winters had been conducting some kind of experiments for a while before he came to us. He could have been making ferals all this time, using rogue wolves and other captive wolves to turn them. When I was in their prison, I overheard them say they were going to use my bite for the next batch of recruits. I had no idea at the time what that meant.\u201d</p><p>Gabe shrugged.\u201cAll I know is nothing happened with me. At least, I never got sick or anything. It scared the shit out of me the first time I shifted. I was alone at my house after my mom died, and I woke up in the middle of the night and it\u2014happened. I could feel my body changing and my first thought was to call 911, but my mouth wouldn\u2019t work right. So I ran outside to drive myself to a hospital. I looked up and saw the full moon and just...went. Shifted into this creature you guys call feral. I was so freaked out I just took off running. I had this urge, you know? To just run under the moonlight. I ran till I dropped. Then I guess I passed out or something, because I woke up the next morning and I was myself again.\u201d</p><p>Nicky, sitting next to him, shook his head.\u201cGod, you must have been so terrified.\u201d</p><p>Gabe smiled.\u201cI was. I was scared out of my mind the next night, but it didn\u2019t happen. Then I was beginning to think I\u2019d dreamed the whole thing when it happened again at the next full moon.That\u2019s when I packed up my old truck and got the hell out of there. Just left and never went back.I was afraid I\u2019d wake up some time after I changed and find out I\u2019d killed somebody. Maybe even some of my friends or neighbors.I mean, I\u2019d seen the werewolf movies. Scary shit.\u201d</p><p>Zack said, \u201cI found him not quite a year later, camping out in one of the national forests near my land. Actually, just over the line into my land. He smelled a little like a wolf, and I knew he was some kind of Werekin.I just couldn\u2019t figure out exactly what he was. I gave him the mating bite shortly after that, and fed him my blood.He\u2019s never changed since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you feel when you changed into the feral creature, Gabe?\u201d Ian asked.</p><p>\u201cNot bad, really. At least not after the physical change itself, which hurts like hell. Then mostly angry, bitter, kind of mad at the world in general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way I felt too,\u201d Nicky said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in that state long before Marco tackled me,\u201d he glanced up at Marco.\u201cBut I do remember feeling so angry. Just furious, really, like I wanted to hurt somebody.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded.\u201cSo these feral creatures would be fierce soldiers, if Winters could find a way to control them.Maybe that\u2019s why he wanted to experiment with the mating bite, thinking that might be a way.\u201d</p><p>Ian spoke again.\u201cOne thing I don\u2019t understand. What happened to Tim? What made him go after Gabe that way?Was there an autopsy done on his body?\u201d</p><p>Zack looked uncomfortable.\u201cYes, but it was inconclusive. No brain tumors or drugs or anything in his system. We really have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Marco shook his head.\u201cSomething doesn\u2019t add up. I knew Tim, and remember him well. He left your pack for a while when he turned twenty-one and came to us. He worked for a while in the mines. He was a nice kid, bright and smart. The person I knew would never have done what he did to Gabe and his mother.It\u2019s unthinkable.\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked up at Marco\u2019s words and straight at Zack. \u201cHe left for a while? Why did he leave your pack and come to Marco\u2019s, Zack? That\u2019s a little odd, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>When Zack hesitated, Marco said, \u201cIt was because he was an alpha wolf. Isn\u2019t that right, Zack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does that make?\u201d Nicky asked.</p><p>\u201cThere can only be one alpha of a pack, Nicky.\u201d All eyes shifted down to Casey as he spoke up.\u201cThat\u2019s why I had to become the battle commander when I joined your pack. It was a good compromise for me, because I love fighting and training soldiers, but it wouldn\u2019t have worked for everybody. That\u2019s why so many rogues are actually alpha males. And why so many strong alpha wolves get captured by Winters and his Hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered about that,\u201d Nicky said thoughtfully.\u201cThere are an awful lot of them roaming around, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Marco said. \u201cMany of them aren\u2019t happy if they can\u2019t lead a pack, so they wind up leaving and trying to find a new place for themselves.Is that what happened to Tim, Zack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We were both alphas and when the time came for a new leader, we both wanted to lead the pack. We had to fight for the position in the ancestral ring. I won, and Tim never completely got over it. Finally, he left to go to you. When he came back two years later, he was quieter, more subdued. I gave him a council seat.Did everything I could to keep him satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Marco said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t with us for two years. He left after a year and said he was going back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he never made it.\u201d A puzzled silence dropped over the table. Zack looked confused. \u201cHe told us he\u2019d been with you the whole time. If he wasn\u2019t with you, then where...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElias Winters,\u201d Nicky said quietly. \u201cWhat if he got him and used Tim in his experiments and tortures?\u201d He turned toward Marco, who had put a warning hand on his arm.\u201cWell, it\u2019s possible, Marco. It would explain the missing time, plus the change in him when he returned. If he did things to his mind, it might even explain why he attacked Gabe and killed his innocent mother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat could be an explanation, I guess. I never questioned him all that much after he came back,\u201d Zack said thoughtfully. \u201cI thought it would be best to leave him alone and let him find his own way.God, if that\u2019s true, what the hell did Winters do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d Ian said. \u201cWhen they had me, they had just begun injecting things into me. Logan objected, saying it might taint my blood, and they were feeding it to him, so the injections stopped. Who knows what might have happened if it hadn\u2019t been for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any way to prove whether or not Winters captured Tim? I wonder if the people we have on the inside would recognize a picture of him? Do you have any recent pictures of him, Zack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy aunt, his mother, would have some. I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s forgiven me for killing him\u2014if I\u2019ve forgiven myself, for that matter\u2014but if this might be a chance to at least partially clear his name, or explain what happened,I\u2019m sure we could get them from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Marco leaned back in his chair.\u201cAs soon as you can get those, I\u2019ll contact our inside sources.I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve answered all the questions we had about ferals, but we\u2019ve made a start.Does anyone else have any questions they\u2019d like to bring up?\u201d</p><p>Casey spoke up.\u201cI have one, actually.It\u2019s always been rumored that once a pet has gone feral, they\u2019re never exactly the same. They\u2019re wilder, harder to handle. Would you agree with that, Zack?\u201d</p><p>Marco glared down the table at Casey, angry over the implied insult to both Gabe and his own mate, Nicky.</p><p>Zack didn\u2019t seem to take offense though, particularly. He put a fond hand on Gabe\u2019s thigh. \u201cWild, unpredictable, passionate and beautiful\u2014those are all adjectives I\u2019d use to describe Gabe. It\u2019s true we had a few problems at the start of our relationship, but that\u2019s only to be expected from a human pet.He wears my collar now and my ring on his finger. That\u2019s usually more than enough to remind him who he belongs to. If not, I take whatever steps I need to. Does that answer your question, Casey?\u201d</p> <p>Casey nodded with a grin on his face, and from where Evan sat, he could see the remark madeboth Gabe and Nicky\u2019s faces flush red, and they looked angry. The meeting was breaking up. Marco, Casey, Ian and Brett all came over to speak to Zack and all of them looked pointedly at the wide gold collar Gabewas wearing while, to Evan\u2019s mind, Zack preened like a peacock. While the wolves talked, Gabe and Nicky quietly got up and walked out of the large room, their heads together. Evan got up to meet them.</p><p>Nicky spoke first.\u201cHi, Evan. Did your master let you out for a few minutes?\u201d At Evan\u2019s look of surprise, he shook his head and smiled at him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just so damned mad at Casey\u2019s question and Zack\u2019s answer.\u201d</p><p>Evan shot a look at Gabe, but he smiled and nodded in agreement.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s my man. Insufferable, conceited, full of himself\u2014pretty typical wolf behavior, I\u2019d say.\u201d All three of them smiled, and Gabe touched his collar self-consciously.\u201cI went into this whole thing kicking and screaming, especially the whole domination thing, but now I kind of like it.The collar\u2019s pretty and kind of makes me feel protected.But I\u2019m probably different from you guys. I like a little kink myself, and I like it when Zack goes all Dom on me. I have a feeling Nicky would hate it.\u201d</p><p>Nicky touched the collar too, and looked thoughtful.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t wear it. I\u2019ve worn them before when I first cameand much uglier than this one, but for me, it represents what I\u2019ve been fighting against for a long time. It would please Marco,but it wouldn\u2019t be real for me. It represents real submission, and I don\u2019t have that. What about you, Evan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t wear it either. I really like the rings though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,hell yes, they\u2019re gorgeous. I noticed Zack was wearing one too, for all his talk about \u2018he\u2019s wearing myring.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Gabe smiled and put a companionable arm around both Nicky and Evan.\u201cI have an idea, boys. A way to get back at Zack for his little remark about the collar and your wolves for how much they admired it. Will you help me?\u201d Nicky looked eager and laughingly nodded his head. Evan pulled back a little.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about this. What kind of lesson exactly?I don\u2019t want to make Brett mad at me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese collars they think control us so much\u2014what if we all wore one and yet acted completely out of their control? Let them know that when the collar goes on, our so-called good behaviorgoes out the window.\u201d</p><p>Just then Brett called out.\u201cEvan!\u201d</p><p>Evan turned to see him standing near the hallway to their room, his face scowling because he was talking to Nicky and Gabe. He snapped his fingers at him.\u201cOver here! Now!\u201d</p><p>Back to this shit again? Evan turned back to Nicky and Gabe, his face dark with outrage. \u201cCount me in, Gabe, whatever it is. I think my mate could use a little lesson too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Brett could hear the music from the moment they stepped out of the room, loud country music, the raucous kind with a boisterous, urgent beat. Nicky had picked a country-western theme for this party and it sounded like he already had it in full swing.Brett hadn\u2019t wanted to go to theparty in honor of Zack and Gabe, but he didn\u2019t exactly know how he could get out of it gracefully either without pissing Marco off.Reluctantly he\u2019d taken a hot shower and tried to get all the paint off his fingers, clean up and look respectable for the evening.He\u2019d been working hard all day, priming and painting over at the new addition, and he wasn\u2019t in much of a party mood.</p> <p>Evan looked happy, though, as he stood by the sink shaving, a skimpy towel wrapped around his cute ass. Tempting, very tempting. Brett sighed.He\u2019d like nothing better than to curl up on the sofa with a cold beer in one hand and Evan\u2019s cock in the other tonight. He certainly didn\u2019t feel like dancing, or watching the two alphas\u2019 pets shaking their asses this evening, like he knew they probably would be.</p><p>Really, it was plain embarrassing. Both young men were gorgeous, if a little too flamboyant for his taste. If they got out there tonight dancing around and grinding their hips, what was a redblooded young wolf supposed to look at? Better not be his alpha\u2019s mate, if he knew what was good for him. Besides, he\u2019d much rather look at his own mate\u2019s shapely hips, and he could do that just as well at home.</p><p>Evan passed him on the way out of the bathroom, tossing him a flirtatious little glance as he went, pulling the towel off at the door so he could get a good look at that shapely little ass. Damn, now he had a raging hard-on to contend with on top of everything else. He turned a blast of cold water on for as long as he could stand it, and then got out of the shower and dried himself off.He peered at himself in the mirror for a moment, decided he didn\u2019t really need a shave, then used the blow dryer for a few minutes on his mane of auburn hair. He walked out to the bedroom and stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p>Evan was wearing perhaps the tightest pair of leather pants he\u2019d ever seen. He must have lain down on the bed to get them zipped. He\u2019d paired it with a black t-shirt, also skin-tight, and a pair of black boots that laced up the front and went all the way to his knees. His blond hair was a little tousled and held in place with a touch of hair gel. He looked hot as hell and he knew it. He turned and gave Brett a little smile, and just as Brett opened his mouth to tell him to take off that fuck-me-please outfit, he whipped out a black leather strip from the dresser and held it out to Brett.\u201cWould you like me to wear this too, babe?I saw how much you admired Gabe\u2019s collar.\u201d</p><p>Brett took the leather strip in his hands and looked up at Evan wonderingly. \u201cReally?\u201d Brett\u2019s mouth had gone instantly dry as his cock raised up again so fast it almost bounced. He had a hard time talking as he took it from his mate, and when he finally managed to speak his voice came out hoarse and ragged.\u201cWhat...um...what made you decide to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I noticed how much you admired Gabe\u2019s gold collar. What is it you like about them so much, Brett?Are they like a symbol of something for you?\u201d He angled another coquettish look up at him.\u201cYou do like the way it looks, don\u2019t you, Brett?\u201d</p><p>Brett nodded and cleared his throat. \u201cOh hell, yeah. Yeah, I like it.\u201d He stepped forward and buckled the thin leather strip around Evan\u2019s throat, running a finger under it to make sure it wasn\u2019t too tight. Then he bent down and trailed kisses down his throat, stopping just above his collarbone, where he sucked the tender skin up into his mouth to raise a mark. When he pulled away, he was happy to see a little hickey placed strategicallybeneath the collar where it couldn\u2019t be missed or mistaken for anything else.</p><p>Evan clapped a hand over his neck and pushed Brett away. \u201cDamn it, Brett!\u201d Brett just smiled and slapped him on his ass as he walked to the bed to pick up his own clothes, jeans and white, long-sleeved button-up shirt. He pulled on leather cowboy boots to complete his outfit and stood up, holding out his arms.\u201cHow do I look, sweetheart? Do I look l country enough for this party of Nicky\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201c Well youact like a redneck, that\u2019s for sure.Come on, let\u2019s go to the party. I feel like dancing tonight.\u201d</p><p>Brett followed him, but the first hint of unease hit him as he walked along behind his mate, his ass swinging along provocatively in his too-tight leather pants. When they walked into the main room, he was distracted at first by the dim lights, the loud music and the large number of people in the room. Evan slipped into the crowd and Brett lost sight of him right away, but he saw a table where Casey was sitting with Rory and made his way over to it. They were both eating from the buffet tables, so before he sat down, he walked over to fill a plate. He was starving and hadn\u2019t eaten since early that morning, so for a while all his focus was on the food laid out for them on the buffet. He looked around again for Evan, but didn\u2019t see him right away. He filled his plate and sat down with Casey and Rory.</p><p>\u201cYour boy\u2019s looking good, Brett,\u201d Casey nodded across the room. \u201cHe and Nicky could almost be twins.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brett jerked his attention up to where Casey was pointing. Evan was standing with Nicky near the little dance floor, and he could see they were dressed almost exactly alike. Same leather pants, black t-shirt and laced up boots. Nicky, too, was wearing the little strap of leather around his neck. Since both the good-looking men were blond and about the same size, they almost did look like brothers. Two more people joined them and Brett felt steam rising. It was Gabe and Logan, wearing the exact same outfits and sporting the little black leather collars. They looked like some kind of little gang, and the twinges of unease he\u2019d felt earlier became full pangs of alarm. What the hell were they planning?</p><p>The music started, some loud twangy party song about rowdy friends\u201cgettin\u2019 down\u201d, and all four of the men pulled off their t-shirts and threw them on a nearby table. They stood in a little circle and started to dance, but not just regular dancing. This dancing was dirty, raw and hot as hell. All of them gorgeous, young and buff, they were thrusting their hips at each other and generally looked like they were having sex on the dance floor.</p><p>Casey started laughing and looked over at Brett, who had half-risen from his chair.\u201cBetter tighten up on that, Brett, before somebody else does.\u201d</p> <p>Brett threw down his fork and stood all the way up, shooting a look of pure fury around him. He saw everybody\u2019s attention had been drawn to the four young men, and he didn\u2019t at all like the kind of attention they were getting. A few of the unattached young gammas were pointing and nudging each other and one or two even moved over next to the group and were dancing alongside them.One of them looked up and caught Brett\u2019s eye as he stalked toward them, froze and melted back into the crowd. The other one made the mistake of standing behind Nicky, making a motion like he was humping him.</p><p>Nicky pushed him away and climbed up on a table to dance. Evan climbed up beside him. With wicked looks directed at their respective mates, they both slowly unsnapped their tight pants and began to pull them ever so slowly down their hips. Before Brett could arrive, the young gamma, who was practically salivating by now, had been thrown halfway across the room as Marco arrived on the scene. He then turned, snatched Nicky off the table, and strode off the dance floor with him.</p><p>The music stopped as people started trying to gather close to see what was going on, and jostled each other excitedly as the wolf mates arrived. Zack and Brett arrived at the same time, each one snatching up their mates in their arms. Brett saw Ian looming over Logan with his hands on both Logan\u2019s wrists, but he wasted no time with anyone else. He had problems of his own.</p><p>He\u2019d thrown Evan over his shoulder to take him from the room, and Evan was making his displeasure known. Yelling and trying to raise up off his shoulders, Evan was furious, but no more so than Brett.He swatted Evan\u2019s backside hard as he took him to their room and threw him down on the bed. Evan tried to jump back up and Brett pushed him back down again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you think you were doing, Evan? You made a spectacle of yourselves! All of you! Whose brilliant plan was this anyway?Nicky\u2019s? Gabe\u2019s? And you were stupid enough to go along with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave me alone, Brett. How dare you drag me out of there like some kind of fucking caveman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I dare? You belong to me, damn it!I\u2019ll do whatever I want to with you!\u201d</p><p>Evan opened his mouth in surprise.\u201cStop saying that! I belong to myself, not you!\u201d He reached up and unbuckled the collar from around his neck and tossed it on the bed.\u201cI wore this tonight to show you it\u2019s a bunch of crap. My wearing a stupid collar means nothing to me. You don\u2019t control me. I\u2019m your mate, and I love you. But I\u2019m not your possession. It\u2019s fine for Gabe, because he and Zack have that kind of relationship.It\u2019s something Gabe wants. But this collar is something you want because of your pride.It has to be about both of us or it\u2019s meaningless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Nicky both were flaunting your bodies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was, then it\u2019s mine to flaunt! I can do whatever I want, Brett,and you don\u2019t control me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you want, huh?I don\u2019t control you? I think it\u2019s time to explain a few things toyou, Evan.\u201d He leaned over the bed and began to take off Evan\u2019s boots.\u201cDon\u2019t fight me, Evan,\u201d he said as he started to struggle and kick. \u201cI\u2019ve let you get away with far too much, and it\u2019s over. As Casey told me, it\u2019s time for me to tighten up.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky was having a second cup of coffee when Logan tapped on the door and came in. \u201cIs the coast clear?\u201d he asked with a smile. At Nicky\u2019s nod, he came all the way inside and sat at the bar beside him.\u201cIs Marco still mad? \u201cOh hell, yes, but he\u2019s alway s mad at me about something, though I must admit this one is worse than usual.It wasn\u2019t the dancing that pissed him off so much\u2014he\u2019s seen me do that before and even joined me on the dance floor. He hated me unsnapping my pants. I tried to convince him I was only teasing, but he wasn\u2019t buying it. He says I\u2019m \u2018an instigator\u2019 again too. Heck, it was Gabe\u2019s idea, I only went along with it. Although I guess I did go a little too far.\u201d He dipped his head in embarrassment.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ian huffed and puffed about it for a while, but it\u2019s pretty much blown over now. He was not too pleased about the leathers and the collars. He said some of the older human pets still wear them, and we shouldn\u2019t make fun of things we don\u2019t understand. I can see his point, but that wasn\u2019t what we were doing exactly. I mean, Gabe\u2019s a submissive who wears his all the time, and that\u2019s his choice. I respect that. I stilldon\u2019t like it when it\u2019s forced on someone, and I didn\u2019t much likeCasey\u2019s and Zack\u2019s attitudes about human pets and collarswhen you told me,\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI tried to explain to Marco it was just a joke, but he said it wasn\u2019t funny to a lot of people. Brett got really mad at Evan, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Have you talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Brett\u2019s got him locked down in his room. Marco told me to stay out of it, but I was actually getting ready to go check on him. You want to go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I have time. The selfdefense class doesn\u2019t start for another hour yet. Can we get in to see him?\u201d</p><p>Nicky smiled.\u201cI have the passkey. I stole it off Marco\u2019s key ring this morning. C\u2019mon, Brett should be at work by now.\u201d</p><p>They walked downstairs down halls that were mostly empty this time of day until they reached Brett and Evan\u2019s door. Using his key, Nicky opened the door.\u201cAnyone home?\u201d he called softly. There was no answer, and he glanced over at Logan uneasily.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019s done somethingto him, do you?\u201d</p><p>Logan laughed.\u201cNicky, you\u2019re so dramatic. Let\u2019s look in the bedroom.\u201d Logan eased open the door and they saw Evan sound asleep on the bed, one hand over his head and cuffed to the headboard.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Nicky crossed over to the bed and sat down beside Evan, shaking him gently. He never moved. He was naked and had bite marks on his neck and shoulders. Nicky shook him harder and finally one eye opened just a little.</p><p>\u201cWhassa matter?\u201d Evan said in a weak voice. \u201cSleepy...\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked up at Logan.\u201cDamn Brett!He\u2019s been feeding him too much. Probably fucking him half to death too, the asshole.Look over in that drawer for a key to this cuff.\u201d Logan opened a few drawers until he found another cuff and a key. He used the key to unlock Evan and he chafed his reddened wrist in his hands, while Nicky sat fuming. \u201cThis is bullshit, Logan. I\u2019m getting him out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, calm down. He\u2019s not hurt, and yeah, it looks like Brett\u2019s been feeding him too much, probably to keep him calm. We may just need to stay out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t stay out of it. Look at those marks on him. This is what Marco did to me when I first came. He used to feed me too much blood to make me sleep all the time, and he locked me in cuffs a couple of times.The wolves used to claim it calmed pets down to be \u2018controlled\u2019 and put in restraints. I hated it then and I hate it now.It\u2019s why Marco and I almost broke up, and I thought I\u2019d managed to put a stop to this kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least go get Marco and tell him about it.If he\u2019s really changed the laws, then he\u2019ll back you up.You don\u2019t need to get between a wolf and his mate without Marco\u2019s support.\u201d Nicky set his jaw firmly.\u201cI\u2019ll tell Marco, just as soon as I get Evan out of here. Help me with him, Logan.I\u2019m taking him home with me.\u201d</p><p>Brett stood in front of Marco, anxious and tense about Evan. He wondered where he was and if he was okay. What was Evan thinking? Did he hate him now? Was he asking to leave? He finally became aware that Marco had asked him a question.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Uh..sir? I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you if you put hands on him, Brett? Did you hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Brett replied indignantly. \u201cI would never hurt Evan! I-uh-I took his clothes off. He didn\u2019t like that too much.\u201d He shifted his feet.\u201cAnd I made him drink blood, but I never hit him at all.Did he say I hit him?\u201d His tone was incredulous, and Marco shook his head. \u201cNo, but I wanted to ask you to make sure he wasn\u2019t trying to protect you.\u201d Marco sat back in his chair and gazed at him sternly.\u201cHe did have bite marks on his neck.He said you\u2019d been having a lot of sex with him too.\u201d</p><p>Brett could feel a flush come over his whole body. It was true he\u2019d gotten a little possessive and carried away the last couple of days.Okay, a lot carried away, and he\u2019d planned on coming home that afternoon after work and releasing Evan and trying to patch things up between them. He\u2019d always heard from the older wolves that feeding the human pets would calm them, and Evan had needed a lot of calming down after he stripped his clothes off him the other night. They said to tie him up or put him in cuffs and it would help him to regain his temper.Boy, they\u2019d been wrong about that. When he\u2019d tied Evan up the night before,he\u2019d practically tried to claw his eyes out and kicked him off the bedbefore he\u2019d managed to subdue him. After he\u2019d cuffed him that morning, he\u2019d had to feed him again just so he could leave for work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco was speaking to him and he tried hard to focus. \u201cI used to feel the same way you do, Brett. I almost lost Nicky a couple of times because I was too stubborn to really hear what he was saying to me. I tried to just bluster my way through an argument. Hell, I still do from time to time. I used the fact that I was bigger and stronger than he is to try to make him do what I wanted him to do.It didn\u2019t work, Brett, and it won\u2019t work with Evan.\u201d</p><p>Brett looked down at his feet for a long moment and then back up at the alpha. \u201cCan I see him?I won\u2019t\u2014I mean I don\u2019t have to touch him. I just need to see him, Marco. I need to see if he hates me for what I did.\u201d</p><p>Marco sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t think he hates you, Brett, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll come home right away, either.I\u2019ve already spoken to both Nicky and Logan for their parts in this. Both of them are independent and strongwilled, and they\u2019re veterans by now at fighting with their mates. They never should have allowed Evan to get so involved, as new as he is to Werekin life, and as new as your relationship is.\u201d He took a deep breath and stood up.\u201cThere was no excuse for it, but no excuse for your behavior,either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, Alpha. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Marco gestured to him. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll let you see him and talk to him. He\u2019s still a little confused.I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll face punishment for your treatment of him, Brett.It\u2019s time for the older wolves and for some of the younger ones, too, to realize that things have changed. They can no longer hide behind tradition to make excuses for abusive behavior.I\u2019ll talk to Ian and decide on a fitting punishment for your actions.In the meantime, I don\u2019t suppose it would hurt for you to see Evan for a few minutes, if he agrees.\u201d He left the council room and led him down the hall to his quarters.</p><p>\u201cStay here and I\u2019ll see if he\u2019ll agree to see you.\u201d Brett stood in the hallway, feeling miserable and torn. On the one hand, he needed to see Evan almost as much as he needed air to breathe. On the other, he was ashamed and afraid. What if Evan didn\u2019t want to see him? Or worse, what if he told him he hated him and rejected him as his mate?</p><p>Marco came back to the door and gestured for him to come in. Heaving a sigh, he stepped inside the door. Evan was reclining on the sofa, covered by a blanket, and Nicky had been reading in a chair next to him. Nicky scowled at Brett when he walked in, but Brett\u2019s attention was focused on Evan. He had scooted to a sitting position and was picking at little pieces of lint on the blanket, looking down to avoid eye contact with Brett.</p><p>Marco motioned for Nicky to come with him, and they both stepped outside to give the couple some privacy. Brett noticed right away how nervous Evan seemed. He perched himself on the arm of the sofa to give him some space.</p><p>For a moment, neither of them said a word. Brett reached out cautiously to touch Evan\u2019s foot under the blanket, but he pulled it away sharply. Brett pulled back his hand, literally at a loss for words. He gave a little ragged sigh.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d For a moment he thought Evan wasn\u2019t going to answer. Still looking down, Evansaid, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to come back, though.\u201d</p><p>Even though he knew he was going to say those words, they still speared right through him. \u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d He stood up\u2014he had to get out of there before he did something stupid, like fall to his knees and beg him.\u201cIf-if you need me for anything, just tell Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Evan said shortly, ripping his heart out with those two little words.</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay...well...\u201d He backed toward the door, afraid to say another word in case he started crying. He could feel the tears clogging up the back of his throat now, threatening to burst out and embarrass him completely. He had to ask the question though that was uppermost in his mind. He swallowed down the tears and forced the words out.</p><p>\u201cDo you...have you rejected me, Evan?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence and Brett allowed himself to feel a bit of hope that Evanhadn\u2019t said yes immediately. His next words dashed that hope.</p> <p>\u201cNot yet. Not officially, but I don\u2019t think we have any future, Brett. You never really wanted a human mate in the first place. You told me so several times. You need someone who will let you boss them around,and I need someone who will respect me.\u201d</p><p>Brett turned blindly toward the door, incapable of saying anything more. Evan was his life. He couldn\u2019t live without his mate. He couldn\u2019t live without his soul. He fumbled for the door handle when he heard Evan speak softly behind him.\u201cAren\u2019t you even going to say you\u2019re sorry?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to face him, but he couldn\u2019t speak. If he did, the sobs would burst from his throat.\u201cSorry,\u201d he finally choked out, then turned and took off through the door and ran down the hall, passing Nicky and Marco on the way but unable to even speak to them.He saw Marco\u2019s face filled with concern and then he was back inside the council room, slamming the door behind him.He couldn\u2019t stand to face anyone right now.</p><p>He wished he was outside in the woods. He could pull his clothes off and shift to his wolf. He wanted only to get away. There was no way he could stay, knowing how much he\u2019d hurt his mate\u2014how he\u2019d ruined the best thing that had ever happened to him. He\u2019d lost him for good, it seemed. He put back his head and howled with the pain, the disappointment and the shame, and then he slumped down at the council table. He knew Marco was coming to mete out his punishment. He hoped he would be banished, sent far away.He couldn\u2019t stay and watch as Evan took up with someone else. It would, quite literally, kill him.He\u2019d rather be banished, and stay in his wolf form.He wouldn\u2019t feel the pain quite so keenly then. He closed his eyes and let the pain crash down on him.</p><p>Nicky leaned over Marco\u2019s shoulder as he read his email from the inside contacts at the Hunter complex. Marco had forwarded the picture of Tim that Zack had sent him to several of these contacts over the last few days and almost all of them recognized him as a young wolf who had been held captive at the prison complex for over six months. None of them were in a position to know what was done to him, but atleast they\u2019d confirmed his presence. It was a part of the puzzle of what had happened to Tim to turn him into a rapist and murderer.</p><p>\u201cHave you told Zack yet?\u201d Nicky asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m forwarding everything to him. It might give his parents comfort to know about it, but it could onlycause them more pain. Hard to say.\u201d Marco turned around to face his mate.\u201cWell, I guess I better go see Evan.You\u2019re coming with me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course. It will be hard for him to feed from someone else this first time. I want to be there for him.\u201d Nicky sat down in Marco\u2019s lap and kissed the side of his neck. \u201cThanks for doing this for Evan.Rory offered too, but I don\u2019t think Casey really liked the idea much\u2014jealous pig that he is.\u201d</p> <p>Marco smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t mind, sweetheart. I just wish we\u2019d hear something from Brett. I\u2019m worried about him. Tomorrow will be two weeks since anyone has seen or heard from him, and it\u2019s just not like him. When I sentenced him to thirty days in jail, I never thought he\u2019d just take off like that.Brett\u2019s the kind of man who makes mistakes, yes, but faces up to them. This behavior is unlike him, but then I\u2019ve never seen him so distraught and upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan\u2019s a wreck. He won\u2019t admit it but he is. He\u2019s scared to death that Brett will never come back, or that something has happened to him.We\u2019d have heard if Winters got him, wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve alerted all out contacts, even got word to Dr. Cornsilk. No one has seen any sign of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid, stubborn wolf! Why would he just run away like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, from what Brett told me, Evanreally didn\u2019t give Brett much hope he\u2019d forgive him. Brett said he was going to reject him as his mate.\u201d</p><p>Nicky blew out a skeptical breath. \u201cLike he cared. Evan said he hardly even said he was sorry, and then only after he prompted him to. I wonder if he even cared about what he did to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see him after their talk, Nicky. I did. He was practically destroyed. He cared deeply, believe me.I think his heart was broken, and I\u2019m afraid something may have happened to him.\u201d</p><p>A little gasping sound by the door made them both look up to see Evan standing just inside the door.He\u2019d overheard what Marco said. His face registered a direct hit, and he swayed on his feet. Nicky jumped up to put a hand on his shoulder and guide him into the room.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Evan.He\u2019s coming back, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t, Nicky? I was so damn mad at him when he came to see me, I couldn\u2019t even stand for him to touch me. I was awful to him\u2014really hateful. He thinks I hate him now, so there\u2019s no reason for him to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just giving him some tough love, and it\u2019s what he needed. He had to realize how serious it was and how much he hurt you emotionally. It was the only way for the two of you to ever make it work between you. You remember what I told you the first day I met you?He\u2019s a wolf, and wolves mate for life. They have all these stupid wolf laws, but that\u2019s one I always liked. That\u2019s one I could always get behind.\u201d</p><p>Evan gave Nicky a shaky little smile. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Nicky smiled at him encouragingly.\u201cCome on over here now and you can feed from Marco.It won\u2019t taste as good to you as Brett\u2019s does, but it will nourish you.\u201d</p><p>A knock on the door interrupted them, and Nicky went over to open it. It was Ian, and he looked serious and a little grim. He glanced over at Evan and then back at Marco.\u201cIt\u2019s Brett, Marco. Dr. Cornsilk has gotten word to us. The Hunters have had him for over a week and the doctor just discovered it and has managed to get in and see him.They\u2019ve been experimenting on him, Marco.Dr. Cornsilk says he\u2019s afraid they\u2019ve completely destroyed his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to move quickly if this is going to work. The doctor said the Hunters think Brett has outlived his usefulness now,and they\u2019re ready to execute him. \u2018Put him out of his misery,\u2019 as they put it.\u201d Casey slammed his hand down on the table in front of him, contempt for the Hunters and their cruelty twisting his lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe still have to be smart about it.\u201d Marco stood up and paced around the council room that was packed, not only with all of his advisors, but all of Zack\u2019s advisors as well. Zack and his entire clan had come to help as soon as they learned of Marco\u2019s plan.</p><p>Marco had declared an all-out war on the Hunters, and further declared that it was time to end this thing once and for all. His desire for peace and need for privacy all these years to escape detection by the outside world had forced his clan to simply defend themselves from the Hunters\u2019 increasingly vicious attacks. Elias Winters and his psychotic behavior had finally driven him too far. They would attack the complex and destroy it, along with Winters and anyone else in his command who resisted. If any of the Hunters wished to put down their arms, and becomeWerekin, they\u2019d be spared. Otherwise, the wolves would take no prisoners. They hadn\u2019t started this war, but they could no longer stand by and allow their families to be in danger. The wolves had had enough.</p><p>Deciding against the safe rooms in the basement, Marco had moved all of the older pets and the children to Zack\u2019s lodge, along with some of the older men and teenaged boys to act as protection. Everyone else would be in on the fight\u2014even the pets who wanted to help. This last provision had been hard won for Logan and Nicky and the others, but an impassioned plea by Evan had finally turned the tide in their favor. It was his mate who had been injured, he argued, and he was going in after him, regardless of what anybody thought. When Logan, Nicky, Gabe and all the other human pets backed him, the wolves had finally given in.</p> <p>\u201cLike I said, we have to be smart about this thing. They have plenty of firepower so we\u2019re not going to rush in, guns blasting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a plan,\u201d Casey said confidently. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this in mind for a long time, but we were hoping we wouldn\u2019t have to use it. We still want to avoid exposure, so we\u2019re going to have to make this look good to any outsiders. That\u2019s one reason we\u2019ll take no prisoners. Each person who surrenders must become Werekin. All the feral soldiers will be given blood as well. It looks like our community is about to experience a huge growth spurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Casey?\u201d Evan asked quietly. He was standing between Logan and Nicky and this was one of the first days he\u2019d wanted to be around other people. The thought of what Brett was going through, and not knowing if he were alive or dead had taken its toll on him, and he was pale and had lost a lot of weight, even though both Ian and Marco had been feeding him as often as he would allow.</p><p>Casey turned toward him.\u201cWe\u2019re going to use the tunnel that Ian, Rory, Nicky and Logan used the night they helped Ian escape from the complex.\u201d</p><p>Logan frowned.\u201cSurely they would have destroyed that tunnel by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t,\u201d Casey replied.\u201cAccording to our sources, they did seal it off with a heavily locked and bolted steel door at the end that comes out on the mountainside, and they have it guarded now, but they kept it as an escape route for themselves if their compound walls are ever breached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how can we get inside if it\u2019s so secured?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cSimple. Our guys on the inside.When we send the signal, they\u2019ll overpower the guards and open the door.We\u2019ll be there to waltz right in,\u201d Casey said.</p><p>Meanwhile, to keep their attention focused somewhere else, Zack and I will take a small group of four and come in the front gate,\u201d Marco said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be hiding in Dr. Cornsilk\u2019s car and come in right under their noses. When he lets us out, two of us will go immediately to Elias Winter\u2019s quarters and take him prisoner. If he resists, we\u2019ll kill him. Another two will go to the other general\u2019s quarters and secure that area. We\u2019ll cut off the head of the snake right away and hope the body flounders. Our boys will be coming in the tunnel and going from building to building. We\u2019ll go in quietly and have the element of surprise on our side. It\u2019ll be just like the Trojan horse.\u201d Casey turned to Rory.\u201cRory, I\u2019d like you to lead a small group to the prison cells and find Brett, and anyone else they may be holding.\u201d He cast a quick glance at Evan.\u201cFrom what I understand about his condition, you may have to subdue him, because I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll know you.Take at least two more wolves with you in case he puts up a fight.\u201d He turned to Evan and smiled at him.\u201cYes, I know,Evan, you\u2019ll want to be with them too. Of course, and you can take Nicky with you.\u201d</p><p>Nicky frowned.\u201cBut I thought I could go with Marco...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance, baby,\u201d Marco said. \u201cWhere I\u2019ll be is too damn dangerous, and besides, Evan will need you.No, I\u2019ll take Zack and Ian and...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d Logan said quietly. \u201cI have the right to be there, Marco, when you go after my father. I\u2019ll be able to keep up just fine.\u201d He glanced over at Ian as if to gauge his support, but Ian was smiling warmly at him.</p><p>Marco considered it gravely for a moment. The pack had never willingly put a pet in such jeopardy before, but Logan had a point. After all the things his father had done to him, he did deserve a chance.\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, nodding.\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure our contacts are in place and we\u2019ll attack at dawn tomorrow. Any questions?\u201d He looked around the table, but found only determined faces staring back at him.\u201cAll right, get some rest. See you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Logan was pressed up t ight against Ian\u2019s big body in the trunk of the doctor\u2019s car. He could feel the slow, steady heartbeat of his mate,and it calmed him. Soon now, they\u2019d be passing through the checkpoint at the gate, and he had to be ready. Zack and Marco were folded up between the back seat and the floor board under some blankets, and he knew it had to be uncomfortable for them.The guards rarely stopped Dr. Cornsilk\u2019s car, but if they did, they had to be ready.Logan\u2019s finger rested lightly on the safety of his assault rifle as he felt the car slow to a stop. He could hear some muffled conversation and a snatch of a short laugh. Then the car started up again, and he breathed a deep sigh of relief.He felt Ian\u2019s hand on his thigh, gripping him tightly in reassurance, letting him know he was there and would protect him with his life.</p><p>Logan felt the same way toward Ian and pressed his body back into him for a second. He felt a soft kiss graze his temple and smiled to himself. How many other soldiers about to go into battle stayed up half the night making love, he wondered? The time spent with his lover had strengthened and sustained him through the night, and he felt ready to face whatever he had to this morning, no matter how difficult.</p><p>The car came to a stop and in a few seconds, the trunk opened so they could crawl out. They stood stretching for a moment before following Marco\u2019s hand signals and moving into the building that housed the generals. Marco had the codes to the door and punched them in quickly. Once inside, Marco and Zack nodded to show they were headed to the upstairs quarters of Elias Winters\u2019 next in command while Ian and Logan moved quietly to Winters\u2019 door.</p><p>Breathing a quick prayer that Winters hadn\u2019t changed his keypad code, Logan punched it in , and they flung open the door and dived inside, each one rolling to either side of the door before jumping back to their feet. As expected, Winters had heard the slight tones of the keypad and had been ready for them, firing the pistol he kept on his night stand and missing Logan by inches. Logan had actually felt the breeze of the bullet as it passed his face.</p><p>Before Logan could make another move, Ian had fired, striking Winters in the chest. He fell back against the pillows and lay still, his face drained of color. Logan approached the bed cautiously and stood over his father. He was aware of shouts coming from the hall and Ian running to secure the doorway. Winters opened his eyes and stared directly at Logan.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cI might have known it would be you, you bastard.\u201d \u201cYour bastard,\u201d Logan said quietly.</p> <p>Winters gave a short bark of laughter, but Logan could see the light fading from his eyes. \u201cI wonder if that\u2019s even true. Your mother always was a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather, don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what? Speak the truth? She was a filthy whore, and I\u2019m glad I killed her. You didn\u2019t really think she died in any car accident, did you? She wanted to protect her little sissy boy. Well,I showed her and I\u2019ll show you too! Nobody gets the best of Elias Winters! Nobody!\u201d He raised the gun he still had clutched in his hand and pointed it straight at Logan\u2019s heart.</p><p>Before Winters could make a move, a red spot of blood blossomed in the center of his forehead, as Ian killed him with a single shot. He pulled Logan into his arms and pressed his face against his chest.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart, but he had it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Logan said softly. \u201cI thought I could do it, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one expected you to\u2014nobody\u2019s that strong.\u201d Ian turned him away from the bed. \u201cC\u2019mon. let\u2019s go find Marco.\u201d They found Marco coming down the stairs, pushing the general, his hands tied in front of him. Marco looked a little shaken, and Zack was behind them speaking urgently on his radio.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Marco?\u201d Ian noticed the paleness on Marco\u2019s face and was a little alarmed.</p><p>\u201cSome bastard surprised me on the way to the general\u2019s bedroom. Came out of nowhere and jabbed me with a hyprodermic needle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hypodermic needle? What was in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. Not poison, thank God, or I\u2019d be dead by now. Probably some of their crazy concoctions\u2014like most of them, it didn\u2019t work. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m sure it was nothing, just made me feel a little woozy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and he didn\u2019t live long enough to tell us much. I\u2019m afraid I just reacted when I saw him stabbing at Marco. I killed the son-of-abitch.\u201d He looked remarkably unrepentant as he turned to Marco. \u201cThey\u2019re inside the compound, Marco,\u201d Zack said with obvious excitement. They\u2019ve already secured two buildings with minimum casualties and Hunters are surrendering all overthe place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny word on Nicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory\u2019s group has entered the prison building. Only minimal resistance, with a few casualties\u2014Nicky\u2019s not one of them,\u201d he said quickly at the look on Marco\u2019s face. \u201cHe and Evan and Gabe are on their way down with Rory andthe wolves to find Brett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Marco said softly as Ian slapped him on the back. \u201cNever again,\u201d he said with a laugh, shaking his head.\u201cI\u2019m a nervous wreck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve done well so far, though,\u201d Ian said with pride, looking at Logan. \u201cYou have to admit that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do admit it,\u201d Marco said. \u201cBut I still wish this was over with so I could get my hands on him again.You do realize what this means, don\u2019t you, Ian? From now on, Nicky will want to sit in on all our council meetings.\u201d</p><p>Ian regarded him with horror as Logan stood beside them and smiled a little as he leaned against the wall.</p><p>Evan followed Rory and the other two gammas down the dark, familiar hallway of the prison where he\u2019d first seen Brett only a few months ago. Then he\u2019d been shackled to the floor in chains. He wondered what condition he would find him in this time. They checked each cell as they went down the hall and found them empty until they reached the third door down. From within they could hear what sounded like an animal in pain, howling and whimpering. The sound made the hair stand up on the back of Evan\u2019s neck. Nicky squeezed his arm reassuringly as they waited for Rory and the others to get the door open. When they did, all three of the wolves rushed inside and over to a figure chained to the wall. Evan caught a glimpse of something not quite human and couldn\u2019t be sure if it was Brett or not.</p><p>They wrestled with the creature, forcing him to the ground and trying not to hurt him, though he fought them desperately. One of the big gammas got the creature in a headlock so that Rory could inject him with the sedative prescribed by Dr. Cornsilk. It took almost five minutes for it to calm him down enough so that some of the hair and claws receded from him and Evan was finally able to recognize Brett. He ran over to him, but he saw no recognition on his face as he growled at him from beneath the press of arms holding him down. Evan put a hand on his thigh and spoke to him softly, calling his name, but he shut his eyes tightly and screamed so loudly Evan drew back his hand.</p> <p>Finally, the sedative took full effect and Brett\u2019s big body relaxed into a deep sleep, only twitching occasionally. They picked him up carefully and carried him outside to lay him on the grass. There was a kind of controlled chaos all around them as Evan knelt down next to Brett and held his hand, with Nicky by his side.Evan was shocked by Brett\u2019s appearance. He was filthy and gaunt, with almost purple shadows under his beautiful eyes, now sunken and hollow. There were deep cuts all along his arm, which were crusted with blood, swollen and infected. He was burning with fever, and his body jerked from time to time and shuddered.</p><p>Dr. Cornfield arrived to examine him and immediately called Marco over. Marco warmly glanced once at Nicky and then focused all his attention on the doctor. \u201cI need to get him to the clinic right away, Marco. I wish I could take him to the hospital, but I know it\u2019s impossible. We\u2019ll need to transfuse him as soon as possible with alpha blood.\u201d Marco nodded.\u201cYou\u2019ll have three of us as donors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He\u2019s going to need it.\u201d Marco ran off to obtain transport and Dr. Cornfield looked</p><p>over at Evan for the first time. \u201cHe\u2019s bad, Evan. He\u2019s only made it this long because he\u2019s so young and strong. After I transfuse him and get him stabilized, I can find the records to see what they\u2019ve been injecting him with.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Evan. I\u2019ll do the best I can.\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded as Nicky grasped his shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019ll make it. Just keep telling yourself that and don\u2019t give up hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he will, Nicky. He has to\u2014I don\u2019t think I can live without him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop pacing, Evan . You\u2019re beginning to make me nervous,\u201d Nicky said, trying to concentrate on his painting. He was working at an easel set up in his and Marco\u2019s quarters. It was the first time Evan had ever seen him work, though he\u2019d heard that he was a really good artist.</p><p>Evan stood behind him for a few minutes, looking at his painting. It was a landscape of a mountain view in a picture he had taped to the top of his easel. It was beautifully done, and Evan was a little amazed that Nicky had painted it. Nicky was a great guy and had been a good friend to Evan, but he never seemed to be serious about much of anything, always making jokes and fooling around. Nicky always surprised him when he displayed just how smart and talented he really was.</p><p>Six weeks had passed since the night at the Hunters \u2019 complex. The total number of Hunters who had decided to surrender and join them that night numbered seventy-five, including the feral soldiers.They had decided to divide the numbers up by three, with a third going to live at Zack\u2019s home in Georgia, a third going to the alpha in Tennessee, and the rest living in a big encampment near Mountainwood. The young gamma male and female wolves had been encouraged to find a mate among their numbers and quite a few had done so. The rest were being supplied with blood from the other wolves on a rotating basis until a mate could be found for them. Marco grumbled that he felt like he was running a dating service these days instead of a pack.</p><p>Ironically, the general who had been captured was one of the first to find a mate. An older widower from Zack\u2019s pack had asked for him. Now that he was Werekin, they had to accept him and not make fun of him, but Logan was finding it hard not to be just a little gleeful that the previously homophobic general was now the mate of a wolf, and from all accounts, very happy.</p><p>The most worrisome problem, of course, had been Brett. When Evan was finally allowed to see him after a few days of intensive treatment, he had still looked terrible, and had gazed at Evan with no recognition evident on his face.</p><p>The doctor had discovered the records showing the various chemicals that he\u2019d been injected with, an assortment of acids and poisons. He said the only treatment was the alpha blood and they gave him as much as he could hold.After about a week, he\u2019d begun to show improvement and his recovery had been steady after that. He knew who Evan was, but he still wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze or talk to him, turning his head to the wall whenever Evan came in.</p><p>Evan wanted to throw his arms around him, and tell him how much he loved him, but Brett was somehow distant and unyielding. Evan contented himself with sitting by him quietly and holding his hand occasionally when he\u2019d allow it. Evan went to see him less and less though, thinking Brett preferred him to stay away and not wanting to make him uncomfortable.</p><p>Marco walked in and Nicky turned to smile at him. He came over right away and dropped a kiss on his lips, rubbing a hand over his shoulders. Evan couldn\u2019t help wishing that he had a close relationship like that with his own mate.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Evan,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s Brett today?\u201d Evan dropped his gaze. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know, Marco. I haven\u2019t been to see him today. Yesterday when I came in to see him, he gave a big sigh, like, oh God, not him again.I think I\u2019m just making him miserable.He obviously doesn\u2019t want to see me.\u201d</p><p>Marco made a sound of exasperation. \u201cI think this has gone on long enough, damn it. Evan, come with me.I\u2019m putting a stop to this right now.\u201d</p><p>Marco turned and strode off, obviously expecting Evan to follow him so he trailed along behind him down the stairs to the basement clinic, where Brett was.</p><p>As they walked in, Brett sat up in bed and looked from Evan back to Marco with a little apprehension. He swallowed hard and nodded at them.\u201cAlpha, Evan, how are you both this evening?\u201d</p><p>Marco folded his arms and gave Brett the look he usually saved for Nicky when he was doing something outrageous.\u201cBrett, have you decided to come back to the pack and take up your duties here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Alpha, if you\u2019ll have me. I know I\u2019ve shirked my duties as lead gamma, and ruined all that, but I\u2019ll come back in any capacity you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about that later. First there\u2019s a little matter of thirty days of jail time you owe me.You\u2019ve been confined in here for two weeks. I\u2019ll count that toward your time. If the doctor says you can be released, then I\u2019d like you to start the rest of your time tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Brett flushed a deep red and looked down.\u201cYes,Alpha, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve been so ill, I\u2019m going to allow you to serve the rest of your sentence on house arrest.Evan, here, will be your jailer.\u201d</p><p>Evan and Brett both turned looks of astonishment on Marco, but he stared steadily down at Brett. Without turning from Brett, he addressed Evan.\u201cEvan, you are not to allow him out of your room for the full two weeks, is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014yes sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And Brett, you will do everything Evan tells you to do, is that understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlpha, I\u2014uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you questioning my ruling, Brett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I was just going to say that Evan might not...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan?\u201d Marco said. \u201cDo you have a problem with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s settled. I\u2019ll go talk to the doctor and then get someoneto help move you.\u201d He turned on his heel and left them alone together, with an awkward silence between them. Evan knew Marco was trying to help, but help what, he wondered. Brett was so cold and distant. His mind seemed to be a thousand miles away as Evan sat waiting beside him. Evan wondered what he\u2019d been doing the past week he\u2019d spent away from him. Maybe it had been a relief not to have to be with his mate\u2014a human mate, that he\u2019d never wanted in the first place because humans were too wild and unpredictable. Wasn\u2019t that what he\u2019d said?</p><p>When the silence between them went from awkward to excruciating Brett finally spoke. Not looking directly at Evan, he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do this, don\u2019t feel you have to. I can talk to Marco and probably get you out of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind. I mean, I want to help you, Brett.I\u2019d much rather have you at home than in some jail cell after all you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>Brett glanced up at him for the first time, his eyes dark and sad.\u201cI really fucked things up between us, Evan, and I want to tell you how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Evan said, surprised at the depth of hurt he saw in Brett\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay, but I want you to know I tried to make things right. When I first left here, before I ran into those damn Hunters, I tried to figure out what I could do to give you back your old life.The fact is, you have to feed for the rest of your life, and there\u2019s not anything I can do about that, unless the doctors really do come up with an antidote or a synthetic substitute. Until then, I promise I\u2019ll always make myself available to give you what you need\u2014you have my promise on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-uh...\u201d Evan was at a loss for words. Brett was talking like he was going to leave again. Did he hate him so much he couldn\u2019t wait to get away from him again? It sure sounded like he was giving him his freedom\u2014a freedom Evan didn\u2019t want.</p><p>\u201cI found Eric for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>Brett looked up at him almost shyly.\u201cI said I found Eric for you. Hehadn\u2019t gone yet to be a Hunter, so I told him to stay away. I told him exactly what they would do to him, and he\u2014he thanked me, and said he wouldn\u2019t go anywhere near that place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Evan said softly. \u201cBrett, that was very kind of you to do that. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him you were free now, and he said he still wants you back.\u201d</p><p>Evan sat very still.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, say that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you, baby, I mean, Evan, and I told him I\u2019d bring you to him. Of course, that was a few weeks ago, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019d still do it. He-he seemed like a pretty nice guy, Evan. It could be just the same for you. Well, almost the same. It\u2019s the best I can do to fix things, you know? To get things back to the way they were. Just as soon as these two weeks are up, I can help you pack up,and we can get started back down the mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really? Can\u2019t wait to get rid of me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean that. What\u2019s the matter, baby\u2014I mean, Evan? Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you just now telling me all this, Brett? I sat here with you almost every day the first week until you made it plain you didn\u2019t want me here anymore. You never once mentioned any of this.\u201d</p><p>Brett looked confused.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, Evan. My mind has been kind of mixed up, you know, and I just remembered some of this.And I don\u2019t know why you thought I didn\u2019t want you here. Inever said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t say much of anything, actually. Just turned your face to the wall most days and ignored me.\u201d</p><p>Brett looked embarrassed.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to give you that impression. All I could remember at first was that last time I talked to you was when you told me...you told me you didn\u2019t want to be with me and that you rejected me as your mate. I figured you were coming to see me to be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an object that you and Eric can pass back and forth between you, Brett.\u201d</p><p>Brett looked amazed.\u201cI know that, honey. I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I never told you I was rejecting you as my mate.I told you I hadn\u2019t made up my mind yet. You\u2019re tired of me, so you\u2019re taking me back to where you found me like some puppy you don\u2019t want anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Brett cried.\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all! I was only trying to make things right again for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ever think of asking me how you could do that? Did my wants and needs ever enter into the equation at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they d id, Evan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Because all I ever wanted after that mess was a sincere apology, which you apparently were unwilling to give me, and so terrified by the idea of it, and of us, that you ran away from me. I had no idea if you were ever coming back, and then we got the news that Winters had you and they were torturing you. Ian said...he said you were out of your mind, and do you have any idea how I felt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Evan, of course, I\u2019d come back. I was coming back when those Hunters got me. I was sort of distracted, you know, and I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I ran right into them.\u201d</p><p>Evan simply stared at him saying nothing for a long moment.\u201cI was so worried about you,\u201d he said softly.\u201cI thought you stayed away on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan, I can\u2019t stay away from you. That\u2019s the whole point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did a pretty damn good job of it. And how dare you take it upon yourself to decide who I am going to spend the rest of my life with?I told you I didn\u2019t want Eric. Did I stutter? How can you treat me like some stupid puppy you just take back to the pound and forget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut baby...I thought we established this.\u201d Brett leaned forward and took his hand. He gazed into his eyes very solemnly.\u201cYou\u2019re not a puppy at all.You\u2019re mybunny.\u201d</p><p>There was the briefest moment of stunned silence and then Evan looked into those big, green eyes and burst into laughter.\u201cIdiot!\u201d he said, punching him on the shoulder. When he stopped laughing, he fixed him with a hard stare.\u201cDo you or do you not want me as your mate?\u201d</p><p>Brett looked at him blankly, blinking his eyes rapidly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question, Brett.Do you want me or not?\u201d Evan folded his arms and stared straight into his mate\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Brett looked so confused he almost took pity on him. Almost.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I want you.Evan, I\u2019ve been such an idiot. I almost threw everything away, and I hurt you. It was the last thing I ever wanted to do.I didn\u2019t blame you for hating me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hate you,\u201d Evan said. \u201cExactly. I just wanted you to realize what an idiot you were, and apologize.Why didn\u2019t you say you were sorry that day in Marco\u2019s apartment when you came to see me?\u201d</p><p>Brett looked down at his lap.\u201cI thought you were leaving me, baby. I was so hurt I couldn\u2019t even talk. I thought my life was over.\u201d He raised his eyes to meet Evan\u2019s.</p><p>A long silence fell between them as they stared at each other. Finally, when it dawned on Brett that Evan was waiting for him to make the next move, he smiled broadly at Evan and started to move toward him. He caught himself halfway and drew back.\u201cCan I kiss you, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou damn well better.\u201d</p><p>Brett almost lunged toward him and pulled him over into his lap. For the next few minutes, he kissed every available surface and then breathlessly, he picked Evan up in his arms and took him to the bed, laying him down almost reverently. Evan began scooting out of his clothes and Brett took his off at record speed, then lay down beside him to just gaze at him, like he couldn\u2019t believe it was actually happening. Evan never wanted to kiss anyone so badly in his life.</p><p>Brett seemed to recover and trailed a hot line of kisses down Evan\u2019s neck ending at his nipples. He spent some time licking and nipping at them before he slid lower down his body. He moved his tongue over the head, lapping at the drops of pre-cum forming there.</p><p>Unable to wait any longer, Evan said, \u201cOh, God, do something!\u201d</p><p>Brett laughed and pulled Evan\u2019s legs up and licked at his entrance. He inserted a finger and stretched him carefully. Evan tried to stop his trembling and make this good for his lover.</p><p>\u201cLube?\u201d Evan asked, and Brett looked wildly around the room finally spotting a jar on a nearby table. He reached for it and quickly spread it over his cock. Unable to wait a second longer, Evan pulled Brett down inside him and he pushed until he was all the way in. Evan loved the little whimpers and sweet sounds he made as he held himself there. Then once there he waited, as if letting Evan get used to him again and savoring the sensation of Evan\u2019s tight hold around him.</p><p>Evan punched him on his shoulder again.\u201cHey, do something. Move!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like this,baby?\u201d he moved his hips back and forth, nailing Evan\u2019s prostate until he writhed against him in a frenzy of need. Brett wrapped his hand around Evan\u2019s cock and pumped it in concert with the movement of his hips.\u201cCome for me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Evan came, his cock and balls and whole body spasming as Brett worked him and then Brett was crying out as he came too, filling him full of cum.He bit down on Evan\u2019s neck as he climaxed, perhaps needing to claim him again in some way. Evan screamed and clung to his shoulders, boneless, lost in the sensations flooding his body.</p><p>Brett collapsed on top of him and Evan breathed in his scent deeply, loving the smell and feel of him. Not moving from inside him, he bit into his wrist and held it up in an offering to Evan\u2019s lips. Evan smiled and pulled it to his lips greedily, sucking down the sweet, hot blood and looking up at Brett through his lashes occasionally to make Brett gasp and slowly harden again.</p><p>When he was done, Brett fucked him again, unable to help himself, and Evan wrapped his legs around his waist and held on tight. This time when he finished, he fell off to the side, almost unable to breathe. Evan followed him over and threw a leg over him and wrapped an arm around his waist.</p><p>He wondered idly what could have happened to Marco and decided he had left them alone for this very reason. Probably waiting outside for us to finish, he thought, chuckling to himself. Evan knew he really did need to move before someone came in. He had to get his man home and then keep him prisoner for the next two weeks. He imagined Brett naked in their bed, totally dependent on him for a while. Not that he would make him suffer. No, on the contrary, he would be a benevolent jailer and keep his prisoner well satisfied. The idea made him harden all over again.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d Evan said contentedly and snuggled his cheek against Brett\u2019s chest.</p><p>*The End* </p> </body></html>"]
