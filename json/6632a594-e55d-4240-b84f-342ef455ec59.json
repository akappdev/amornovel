Nothing happened and she looked down at the screen. \u201cNo signal,\u201d she muttered and tossed it into the passenger seat. Of course not, she was thirty miles outside of Holland Springs, North Carolina. And that, according to her Garmin, was smack dab in the middle of nowhere.</p> <p>Rose had two choices: wait; or drive to town and get help.</p><p>She should wait. It was the decent thing to do, and eventually someone would come along. State troopers loved to patrol this stretch of highway that the locals referred to as a speed trap.</p><p>Tapping her fingers against the dash, she muttered, \u201cAny minute now.\u201d</p><p>A vulture landed and poked at the arm.</p><p>Bile rose in her throat, then pity flooded her heart. He, judging by the large shape she thought it to be a man, might have a family at home. Missing him. Worrying and out of their minds for him.</p> <p>Before she could question her sanity, she\u2019d unbuckled her seat belt, thrown open the door and now stood at the edge of the road. Staring.</p><p>Steeling her nerves, she strode to the field. Her foot slipped on mud made by last night\u2019s rainstorm and she hit the ground with a splat. Cold water and mud seeped through her shorts, jolting her. This was ridiculous. No one in their right mind would even think of checking out a dead body, but something inside of her insisted that he wasn\u2019t dead.</p><p>She tracked another vulture as it landed. It too began pecking, but at a bare foot. Glancing to the right, she breathed through her nose, trying to calm her racing heart. Tire tracks and footprints intermingled along the ditch bank. Deep gashes in the soft earth held puddles of water. Was he a victim of a hit and run?</p><p>A third vulture landed.</p><p>Those ugly things had always disgusted her, even more so because of their \u2018nature\u2019s garbage disposal\u2019 reputation. Pushing away from the ground and running at the birds, she waved her arms and shouted, \u201cGo away! Shoo, you nasty things. Shoo!\u201d</p><p>After a good ten minutes the vultures decided that either he wasn\u2019t worth it or she\u2019d made it impossible for them to properly digest. She dropped to her knees in the loamy soil a few feet away from the body, panting and waiting for the stench of rotting flesh to hit her.</p> <p>It never came.</p><p>She turned and the wind whipped her corkscrew curls around, blinding her to the man sprawled over rows of dirt.</p><p>He groaned and her mouth dried out.</p><p>Rose shoved her hair out of her face. Feet. She could handle looking at his feet. Another groan and this time his pinky toe moved.</p><p>Oh God! Was that a death twitch?</p><p>Finally, she made her gaze travel to his chest. No other spot but there. The tattered remnants of a button-down shirt rose and fell with shallow breaths.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive!\u201d she shrieked, scrambling to her feet and running to him. She stopped just inches from the body. His golden hair was matted down and dirt smeared his face.</p><p>His face.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Alexander Romanov\u2019s lids slitted open, revealing moss green eyes glinting with pain. \u201cSorry to disappoint,\u201d he rasped, his British accent more pronounced than usual. He groaned again.</p><p>\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d She dropped to her knees, searching his beautiful face. But for a cut at the corner of his mouth, it was unmarred. His body, however, was an entirely different story. Almost every exposed inch had a shallow cut or bruise. It looked as though someone had used him as a punching bag. \u201cWe need to go the sheriff\u2019s office and make a report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cGot into a row with some mates and lost.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips at him. \u201cMaybe you should rethink your circle of friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that under consideration.\u201d A ghost of a smile appeared and then he coughed, a spasm of pain covering his face.</p><p>She sat back on her heels. \u201cAs nice as you were to me yesterday, I should leave your sorry tail out here to rot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, love,\u201d he said as his eyes closed and the skin around his mouth turned white, \u201cCouldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we discuss this later?\u201d Once again his green eyes focused on her, and the need to help him, really anyone in pain, negated the desire to leave him wallowing in his own misery.</p><p>Rose scanned the field. To her left it lay empty, not even the Johnsons\u2019 fluorescent green tractor was around. To her right there were woods but it wasn\u2019t deer season, so she couldn\u2019t flag down a hunter.</p><p>She sighed in resignation. \u201cEither I can go get help, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He struggled to rise, managing to get into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he waved her question away with his hand. \u201cHelp me up, Rosebud,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She raised her brows and crossed her arms. \u201cAsk nicely, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Sasha,\u201d he\u2019d said with a wicked grin, \u201cAll my friends do.\u201d</p><p>Well, Sasha sure had a funny way of treating his friends. Why couldn\u2019t someone else have found him? She had enough going on in her life without this. Him.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d</p><p>Sasha grunted. It was harder than she thought. He hated asking anyone for anything. He hated being helpless.</p><p>As she leaned forward to help him, black curls tumbled onto his blood, dirt and God-only-knew-what-else-covered chest. He had the urge to shove her away, desperate that this filth not touch her. Not even the silky tips of her hair.</p><p>The scent of night blooming jasmine drifted to him, displacing the odor of violence. He breathed deeply, then scanned the road. He found her Jeep up the small incline. \u201cFour-wheel drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I think that between the two of us, we can get you to it. The closest hospital is fifty minutes away, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no hospital. It looks much worse than it is.\u201d Turning to his good leg, he put most of his weight on it, then tried the other. A fresh wave of pain rose over him and he had to clench his teeth from crying out.</p><p>Rose\u2019s arms came around him, her slight form a human crutch. Suddenly, she stood, ramming his dislocated shoulder back in place.</p><p>His vision blackened, stars sparked and he shouted, \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Breathing through his nose, he fought down the nausea.</p><p>She looked up, her eyes shadowed. Did she feel any pity for him? Anything at all? Did he want her pity? Oh, good God, this was quickly turning into a let\u2019s-talk-about-our-feelings moment. Although it was all in his head. Yeah, because having conversations with oneself is entirely sane.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take you to your cousin\u2019s house?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not home and I don\u2019t have a key.\u201d And as things stood, he wasn\u2019t welcome there.</p><p>Her arms tightened around him. \u201cCan you still make it to my Jeep?\u201d</p><p>Nodding once, he began to hobble towards the small SUV. Of course, he could do this.</p><p>He\u2019d done it before.</p><p>The ride into the backwoods town of Holland Springs wasn\u2019t as bad as he thought. It was worse. Every pothole and bump served to remind him of how his new motto of \u201cJust say no\u201d got the living hell beat out of him.</p><p>However, there were just some things a man didn\u2019t do. Like be a sperm donor for some eighty-year-old nutter with a twenty-year-old trophy wife because he needed an heir for his empire. No matter how painful the consequences.</p><p>Now that he\u2019d been properly punished, he\u2019d get some time off before his uncle tried to persuade Sasha to his way of thinking again. And next time, Sasha knew, Vladimir would pull out the big guns.</p><p>\u201cI need to change, and you need a shower,\u201d Rose said, wrinkling her nose as she parked the Jeep behind her store. \u201cThere\u2019s a bathroom on the second floor you can use. The store used to be a house and there\u2019s a studio apartment upstairs. We mainly use it for storage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can wash me up next time, dear.\u201d He gave her a suggestive smile and tried to wiggle his brows, but it hurt too damn much to follow through. Moving his shoulder experimentally, he opened the door and braced for a sharp pain, but there was only a dull ache.</p><p>By the time he managed to get out of Rose\u2019s Jeep, she had the back door propped open. Exhausted, he waited for her to come to him, her sweet body his personal rock of Gibraltar.</p><p>\u201cLean on me.\u201d</p><p>Lean on her? He wanted to crawl all over her, caress every curve and take her to bed\u2014the way he\u2019d wanted to a month ago.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a few steps,\u201d she coaxed. \u201cYou can do it.\u201d</p><p>Eventually, they made it up the stairs and to the bathroom. He leaned against the wall as she prepared the shower and brought in a chair from the other room.</p><p>\u201cThought you might need this.\u201d She stood there, one hand on the chair and the other at the base of her throat.</p><p>He sank down on it gratefully, almost too weary to undress himself. But pride made him shoo her from the room, then he pulled his cell phone from his pocket, texted his uncle and got a reply a few seconds later. He had forty-five minutes to be ready. Sooner than Sasha thought it would be.</p><p>He placed the cell phone behind the faucet of the bathroom sink. How considerate of Vladimir to have Sasha\u2019s old cell phone replaced with a new one. Grimacing, he made his fingers work the buttons of his shirt and pants. Getting his damn trousers off was the hardest part and he nearly asked Rose to help him.</p><p>\u201cI need to go get you some clothes. I\u2019ll be right back, okay?\u201d she called out as he stepped into the tub, one agonizing limb at a time.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d Hot water hit his face, making the cut on his lip sting. He stood under the shower head until it become a dull throb. Until his battered and bruised body began to relax. He must have fallen asleep standing up, because the next thing he knew, Rose was calling his name. His eyes popped open.</p><p>\u201cSasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Rose.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound fine. Rose peeled off her muddy clothes and shoved them into a plastic grocery bag. She dropped the bag by the door to the stairs and shivered in the air-conditioning. Quickly dressing in the middle of the makeshift storage room, she pulled on a pair of faded jeans and a green t-shirt she\u2019d found in the back of her jeep, not quite sure what do with the very naked man showering only a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cRosebud, I need you,\u201d he yelled at the same time she heard a loud thunk.</p><p>Throwing open the bathroom door, she skidded to a halt when she saw his wavy outline through the shower curtain. She placed a hand on her chest. \u201cGood grief, I thought you fell.\u201d</p><p>He slid the curtain to one side, a mischievous grin on his gorgeous face. \u201cI dropped the soap. Care to get it for me?\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cPick it up yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you need to take a shower, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had mud all over your very nice bottom,\u201d he pointed out, the compliment making her flush.</p><p>\u201cI changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame, I was so looking forward to you joining me,\u201d Sasha said as he bent over to pick up the bar of homemade soap. He stood, propping himself against the window above the claw-foot tub and gingerly moved the soap over his skin. Steaming hot water ran down his body, washing away the suds, blood and grime, revealing his lean, muscular form. The large cross tattoo on his bicep contracted and expanded with his movements. Gold nipple rings flashed in the morning sun.</p><p>Heat flared in the pit of her stomach. She\u2019d kissed those rings. Put her lips around them and tickled his nipples with her tongue. She whirled around to face the sink. And the conveniently placed mirror above it.</p><p>\u201cGenerally, I shower alone.\u201d Generally...Really, couldn\u2019t she have just said I always shower alone or\u2014better still\u2014kept quiet?</p><p>He raised his brows, a slight smile at his lips. \u201cAnd the other times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart woman to play it close to the vest. I\u2019ve always loved an intelligent female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love women\u2014period.\u201d</p><p>He turned, giving her a full view of his tight butt and she ogled him in the mirror. Most of what she\u2019d thought to be bruises on his body turned out to be dried mud, but all the shallow cuts needed to be treated.</p><p>\u201cLike the view?\u201d</p><p>Yes! She wanted to lick him up one side and down the other. \u201cI\u2019m only making sure you don\u2019t pass out. Do you know how hard it is to get blood stains out of woven rugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour concern is heartwarming,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cJust hurry up. I\u2019ve got other things to do.\u201d She crossed her arms. Apparently, it was her go-to gesture of the day.</p><p>\u201cIt was your idea, remember?\u201d Their eyes met in the mirror and he chuckled when she looked away, the sound making her heart flip. \u201cI think you like watching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you like being watched,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cBy you? Absolutely.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. A small pot of ointment containing calendula flowers and almond oil sat on the edge of the sink. It was one of Carolina Dreams\u2019 biggest sellers for the men and women who worked two towns over at the paper mill. They swore by its healing properties.</p><p>He turned off the shower and stepped out, wrapping a towel around his lean hips. \u201cYou can dry me off if you\u2019d like,\u201d he said, peering through his lashes at her and making her fingers itch to do just that.</p><p>Did he ever quit being so...him? \u201cI\u2019d like for you to hurry up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRepetition is a sign of distraction, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d She pointed to the chair she\u2019d brought in earlier.</p><p>He gave her a lazy smile, doing as she asked. \u201cI\u2019m ready for your tender ministrations.\u201d</p> <p>She grabbed the small jar, determined to approach him in a completely clinical manner. \u201cTristan\u2014Dr. Reed gave me some clothes and a pair of shoes for you to change into. He said you could keep them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d His mouth flattened.</p><p>\u201cNice guy.\u201d Rose stepped closer and applied the lightly scented ointment to his shoulders first, following the lines and contours of sinew. He was pure muscle, smooth skin over iron. She wanted to touch him everywhere he didn\u2019t need the ointment. She traced the cross tattoo on his bicep. The broad planes of his back were next.</p><p>After applying more ointment, she gently kneaded it in, and he made small sounds of pleasure. She took her time, rubbing and kneading from left to right. Up, then down.</p><p>But she knew she\u2019d eventually have to face him. She peeked over his shoulder. His hands were clenched into two fists and rested on his muscular thighs. Her eyes widened when she saw the outline of his very large erection under the towel.</p> <p>Swallowing, she rubbed harder.</p><p>\u201cNails, love, watch your nails.\u201d He bent over slightly and put his hands in his lap.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Taking a deep breath, she walked around to the front of the chair. She expected a flip remark or even a smug grin, but he remained completely silent and wore a serious expression as she positioned herself between his legs.</p><p>The first pass over his chest had her blood racing through her veins. On the second, her knuckles skimmed one of his nipple rings and her blood turned to molasses. Nothing could stop her from touching him again. Her fingers lightly stroked his chest. A soft dusting of toffee-colored hair tickled her skin as she traced the ever-narrowing trail that disappeared under...Her hand froze. She looked away, willing herself to leave the room. Or even step away from him.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t move. The realization that his large hand had clamped around her wrist hit her and she almost dropped the jar. \u201cDid my nails get you again?\u201d she asked, her voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said thickly, \u201cI can manage from here.\u201d He plucked the jar from her hand, and she ventured a glance at his face. His cheeks were flushed and his nostrils flared slightly. His talented tongue licked at his bottom lip.</p> <p>She inched closer, wanting to kiss that full bottom lip. To take it between her teeth and tug.</p><p>\u201cYou can go now, Rose,\u201d he said, breaking the spell she was under.</p><p>Somehow she managed to straighten and walk out of the bathroom without looking back.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, she helped him down the stairs and to the back door.</p><p>\u201cBe sure to thank your doctor friend for the clothes and shoes,\u201d Sasha said as he held the door open for her. Dismissing her help with a shake of his head, he limped only slightly to the sidewalk.</p><p>Despite the grimace of pain he didn\u2019t mask quickly enough from her view, Rose knew better than to feel sorry for him.</p><p>He cursed and leaned over, resting his hands on his thighs for a moment before standing and turning to face her. The lines around his mouth were white.</p><p>Well, maybe she felt a tiny bit sorry for him. \u201cHere\u2019s your phone.\u201d She held it out and he grabbed it, sliding the cell into the back pocket of his borrowed jeans. \u201cYou left it in the bathroom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A black Mercedes idled at a discreet distance, but in the small town of Holland Springs an unfamiliar and expensive car at any distance warranted gossip.</p><p>He took her by the hand, his eyes mysterious and compelling. \u201cI know this is a day too late, however, I want to apologize, Rose. You deserved better than the silent treatment I gave you. It was rude and uncalled for. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the silent treatment?\u201d She tilted her head to one side.</p><p>His jaw worked for a moment. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry for ending our date so abruptly. But I won\u2019t apologize for what happened before then. I enjoyed spending time with you. It was...\u201d His eyes shifted, looking behind her and becoming hard as peridot gemstones. \u201cAnyway, you\u2019re an extremely generous woman to help me.\u201d</p><p>She might have helped him, but she wasn\u2019t ready to forgive. Or forget. \u201cI would have helped anyone in that situation.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wry smile, his thumb stroking the pulse of her wrist with a continuous lazy glide. \u201cSo, this is good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think two holidays spent in Holland Springs is enough, don't you?\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cHave a safe trip.\u201d Gently tugging her hand away, she left him standing there.</p><p>She walked inside her store, closing the door and leaning against it, her heart pounding in her chest. Blowing out a breath, she nodded once and sank to the floor, the dissipation of adrenaline leaving her body limp.</p><p>It really was for the best that he wouldn\u2019t be back. No more surprise visits or using his siren\u2019s voice to ensnare her like she was one of those sea-faring sailors of yore. No more spontaneous dates or kissing, or...She let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>Sasha Romanov was completely out of her life. For good.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Three months later</p><p>There were very few days Rose wished she were an actual witch, but today was one of them.</p><p>Thursday had started out innocuous enough: delivering packages to Alden\u2019s; emailing confirmations for new orders while feeding Ivy; shoving strawberry yogurt down her own throat; and then, opening Carolina Dreams for business at ten.</p><p>But today.</p><p>Today, she\u2019d been busy dusting the inside of the store\u2019s windows and had gotten a glimpse of a tall, lean form that made her palms sweat and her knees weak.</p><p>A flash of Sasha Romanov\u2019s killer smile as he inspected Retro Dayz, the store for sale across the street, made her jaw tighten.</p><p>If she possessed the power to poof him back to jolly old England or some other exotic location, like the deepest depths of hell\u2014she would. Gladly.</p><p>He\u2019d lied to her.</p><p>Sasha had said he wasn\u2019t coming back.</p><p>But there he was.</p><p>And here she was, staring at him through her store\u2019s front window like an Old Navy mannequin.</p><p>She threw down the dust cloth and crossed her arms. But really, what could she expect from someone like him, someone allergic to honesty and decency?</p><p>The afternoon sun slanted through the autumn leaves of the ornamental trees lining the street, highlighting his head like a halo. As if he was an angel sent to her small town. All the single women (and quite a few of the married ones) would be completely thrilled he was back.</p><p>But only if one liked disheveled golden hair, sexy green eyes and bronze skin accentuating lean muscles wrapped up in the latest Tom Ford creation. And Rose, most certainly, did not.</p><p>Liar, a little voice inside her head whispered.</p><p>Rose rubbed the gold cross she always wore, stroking it between her thumb and forefinger. It had been in her family for generations. Local legend claimed that in 1795, Poppy Holland had bewitched a visiting preacher with her violet eyes and special brew of strawberry wine. Only a woman in league with the devil would be gifted with jewelry from a married man, making the first witch with the last name Holland thusly tagged.</p><p>That had been the start of the whispers, innuendos and flat out name-calling. Just last week, Maisy Perry had referred to Rose as a home-wrecking witch for looking at her fianc\u00e9 and declared that she would never, ever step foot in Carolina Dreams again.</p><p>But just like always, Maisy had been forced to eat her words when she\u2019d needed love advice. (And her monthly supply of cellulite vanishing cream.)</p><p>Rose hadn\u2019t gloated. She never gloated. She never cried or yelled. She never insulted anyone back. But she wasn\u2019t a damn saint. She did it privately, where no one could hear her. Where not even her sisters could hear her. Well, Skye anyway. Summer had taken off\u2014again.</p><p>Rose\u2019s family was falling apart. Whether by distance or death, everyone she\u2019d grown up with was disappearing. Most likely the women here were thanking their lucky stars Summer was gone. Most of the upstanding citizens of Holland Springs viewed her family as a necessary evil. After all, the town was named for them and the legend of the springs was a draw for tourists. Not to mention that said spring was located on Holland land.</p><p>Sasha laughed, his white teeth flashing as Jemma Leigh Jackson preened and flirted. Tall and curvy with blonde chunks of hair framing her face, the bubbly real estate agent wore a plaid kilt and high heels that showcased her long legs to perfection. Jemma Leigh was beautiful, fashionable, and every other \u2013able word that a man like Sasha would appreciate. Words that summed up a woman like Rose could never be. Her body was average everything, she didn\u2019t care that much about fashion, and generally styled her hair to stay out of her face.</p><p>The tinkling of a bell snapped her out of her daze and Rose turned to see her baby sister, Skye, breeze through the front entrance, apparently finished with her morning visit to the retirement center. She stopped to prop their sunny yellow door open.</p><p>\u201cGuess who bought Retro Dayz?\u201d Skye asked, her hazel eyes shining. She smoothed the blue sweater she wore over the waistband of her flowery, ankle-length skirt.</p><p>Rose let her necklace fall back in place. \u201cZoe Ambrose?\u201d The novelist was the clothing store\u2019s biggest customer. Maybe its only one. But because of Zoe\u2019s successful career and unflagging loyalty, the shop had stayed open far longer than anyone thought possible. Hippie chic wasn\u2019t exactly all the rage here.</p><p>Skye laughed. \u201cNo. It\u2019s someone you\u2019d never guess. Not in a million years.\u201d Her dark eyes slanted to the side and Rose followed her line of sight. Jemma Leigh placed a manicured paw on the sleeve on Sasha\u2019s tailored button-down. Of course, he gazed at her like she was the only woman in the world.</p><p>Rose had the urge to throw something at them.</p><p>Suddenly, Jemma Leigh winced and rubbed the top of her head. Then Sasha did the same. They began dancing around as acorns started falling like rain from the tree. A little gray squirrel ran down the trunk, twitching its tail as a second, larger squirrel chased it.</p><p>Suppressing a satisfied smile, Rose cast a cool look at her sister. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t care who buys it as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with our bottom line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t mind that Alexander Romanov bought it,\u201d her sister said with a sly smile. \u201cRumor has it he\u2019s going to open a bridal store.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s tongue grew thick in her mouth and she had to swallow a few times before she could speak. \u201cWhat?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cAnd guess who\u2019s looking for a place to live around here, too?\u201d</p><p>Rose grabbed her cross and rubbed it like her life was depending on it. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me since I suck at guessing.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I saw Alexander this morning at Daisy\u2019s bakery and he happened to mention that he was looking for a place to rent. So, I told him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease say you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a furnished room available at Strawberry Grove\u2014and it included meals,\u201d her sister finished with a satisfied smile. She recoiled at the look on Rose\u2019s face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014we don\u2019t know him...well,\u201d she replied lamely, schooling her features. Sasha tended to make her forget who she was and how she was supposed to act. And Skye didn\u2019t know they\u2019d been on a date. Heck, no one knew, and Rose intended to keep it that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you could get Christian Romanov to vouch for him.\u201d Skye brushed a thick fall of auburn hair off her shoulder and lifted her brows a couple of times. \u201cBesides, I would think you\u2019d like a British invasion.\u201d</p><p>Actually, she\u2019d already been invaded by him. Almost. \u201cWhy would you?\u201d</p><p>Skye grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re not as discreet as you think you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spied on me?\u201d Rose couldn\u2019t keep her cool fa\u00e7ade from slipping.</p><p>\u201cNo, one of my roommates texted me a picture of the hottest guy she\u2019d ever waited on in her life. Guess who was his date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think to mention that?\u201d Rose pressed her fingers to her eyelids, then let her hands fall to her sides.</p><p>\u201cI thought that if you wanted me to know, then you\u2019d tell me.\u201d Skye swatted at one of the wind chimes hanging from the ceiling.</p><p>A happy tune played, then abruptly stopped as Rose glared at it.</p><p>Skye frowned. \u201cSorry, I was only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>Help her what\u2014find a man, or pay the bills? Rose sighed, then smiled gently at her sister. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Besides, I doubt it would meet his standards.\u201d She silently prayed that she was right.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I think your place would be absolutely perfect,\u201d a low male voice drawled.</p><p>Sasha grinned at the back of Rose\u2019s curly black head, watching as her spine stiffened and her shoulders squared. She turned and he braced for the impact.</p><p>Rose\u2019s ocean-blue eyes stared right through him, her pretty face making him suck in a breath. He was at a loss as to what to say next. So, as to not look like a complete and utter fool, he stayed silent.</p><p>As did she.</p><p>\u201cOkay...I\u2019ll just be over here rearranging something.\u201d Skye strolled over to an antique hutch and began to move the merchandise around.</p><p>Sasha blinked in surprise. He\u2019d nearly forgotten the youngest Holland sister was in the room. Hell, he forgot everything when Rose was anywhere near him\u2014especially when she was in his arms. She was...dangerous.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go stay with your cousin,\u201d Rose suggested, her stubborn jaw clenching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe newlyweds are currently in Majorca, blissfully happy. And even if they were home, I\u2019m not about to put up with all the bloody talking about their feelings. It\u2019s not healthy for a man.\u201d He peered at her through his lashes.\u201cLooks like your place is the only one that will meet my needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe room\u2019s no longer for rent,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cA shame, really. I was looking forward to playing house with you, Rosebud,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She blinked twice in rapid succession, the only indicator that what he said had bothered her. \u201cYou said you were leaving for good.\u201d Her fingers went to the necklace at her throat. And there was the second sign.</p><p>\u201cYou must have misunderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I said.\u201d He also knew she had a wine-colored birthmark in the shape of her namesake that rested on her inner right thigh. He\u2019d traced its outline with his tongue until she\u2019d pleaded with him to stop teasing her.</p><p>Rose frowned. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd it didn\u2019t include the words: I\u2019m leaving for good.\u201d Although he would have preferred that to be true.</p><p>Her perfect lips thinned and she let go of her necklace. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head to the side, trying to convey all innocence. \u201cI\u2019m being punished for helping right a wrong,\u201d he lied. Okay, so the helping right a wrong and being punished wasn\u2019t a lie. However, it wasn\u2019t the real reason he was here, not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cKarma works that way,\u201d Rose said.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s rarely Karma, more like the powers that be.\u201d</p><p>The town\u2019s sheriff, David Turner, walked into the store, tipping his hat at the sisters. \u201cLadies.\u201d He barely acknowledged Sasha. \u201cRomanov.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSheriff,\u201d Sasha said. It was rare that a minion did anything on time, but maybe David Turner wanted to get this rather nasty deed over with.</p><p>Rose\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cI thought Missy didn\u2019t need any more body butter for at least another month.\u201d</p><p>Skye gave the sheriff a big grin. \u201cHave you been eating it again, David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissy\u2019s fine.\u201d He tugged at his collar, an uneasy look passing over his face. \u201cThis is for you,\u201d he added, handing Rose a white envelope. \u201cSorry, honey.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff made a hasty exit and took off in his patrol car.</p><p>Sasha watched Rose closely as she opened it and read the official letter\u2014one that he had his family\u2019s attorneys craft\u2014from the town\u2019s tax administrator. Her face went white as the paper she was holding before color suffused her cheeks with bright pink.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Skye asked, her voice rising.</p><p>Wordlessly, Rose handed it to her. She looked past him, out into the street and he felt the urge to comfort her. Guilt sprouted inside of his gut, threatening to grow before he ruthlessly squashed it. It was one of many emotions he couldn\u2019t afford.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s this possible?\u201d Skye\u2019s lips were bloodless. She crumpled up the paper and threw it at the door. \u201cTen years worth of back taxes because of a mistake in status. How can they do this?\u201d She leaned against the antique hutch, her hazel eyes overflowing with tears. \u201cHow can we make next month\u2019s tuition payment, the rent, and everything else?\u201d</p><p>Rose opened and closed her mouth. Her eyes followed suit. When they opened again, Sasha was startled to see resigned defeat in them. He\u2019d expected her to take charge. To march down to the tax office and demand they fix it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a job cleaning McMansions at the beach again.\u201d She stared at the window.</p><p>Again? When had she ever done that?</p><p>Skye shook her head. \u201cWhat about Ivy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Ivy?\u201d He really should have investigated her family himself. Relying on others for information was proving to be mistake.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to find a renter after all,\u201d Rose said with a defeated sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Skye gestured in his direction, but Rose was already shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his hip against the nearest counter and tried to take control of the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m the quiet sort. No pets and I don\u2019t smoke.\u201d</p><p>The two women ignored him.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m excellent at meal preparations. Never leave the seat up either.\u201d</p><p>Skye crossed her arms over her chest and glared at Rose. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you surprised about this letter?\u201d</p><p>Rose said nothing.</p><p>Her sister\u2019s hazel eyes rounded. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d keep something like this from me!\u201d</p><p>Rose planted her hands on her hips. \u201cYou would\u2019ve dropped out and God knows one of us needs to have a college degree. One of us needs to have a future away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Rose\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jumping in, he said, \u201cI agree. I\u2019m willing to pay whatever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off your high-horse and rent the damn room to Alexander!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy high-horse? I\u2019m the one who\u2019s been supporting this damn family since I was sixteen,\u201d Rose said, her cheeks flushing.</p><p>Skye lifted her brows slightly. \u201cNo one asked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this later, okay?\u201d Rose asked through clenched teeth. He was surprised that she had any enamel left with the way she ground them into each other.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Skye huffed.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Rose agreed.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t see why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019d talk later.\u201d</p><p>Skye snorted. \u201cYou just want to have the last word.\u201d</p><p>Rose made a face. \u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies, can we agree to disagree?\u201d They both opened their mouths, but he raised a finger. \u201cWith a nod, if you please, my head is about to explode.\u201d</p><p>To his relief they did as he asked.</p><p>He glanced to the right and groaned. Just what he needed\u2014Jemma Leigh Jackson sashaying her way across the street. It had been relatively easy to chat her up, and she\u2019d been a veritable treasure trove of information as she filled him in on all the gossip he\u2019d missed since the last time he was in this backwards little town.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a man look at Jemma Leigh like that before,\u201d Skye said.</p><p>He swung his gaze back, Rose\u2019s lovely face filling his vision. \u201cIf one is going to pretend to wear designer, one must get a decent knock-off.\u201d</p><p>Rose gave him a skeptical look. \u201cJemma Leigh is a former Miss North Carolina and all you can say is that she needs better clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust calling it like I see it, dear.\u201d And he could always see the flaws in others. Clothing, make-up, personality...It didn\u2019t matter. He appraised Rose, watching as her beautiful eyes glittered and narrowed at him. Well, not always.</p><p>\u201cI hate it when a man\u2019s all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cTry egotistical.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his stance and heard the click of heels on the sidewalk. \u201cLet the insanity commence,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cBe nice, Alexander,\u201d Rose warned.</p><p>\u201cHi, girls.\u201d Jemma Leigh pranced inside Carolina Dreams with a friendly smile on her face as she waved. Then she waved at him and he waved back before he could help himself. \u201cYoo-hoo, Alexander! You didn\u2019t say what time you\u2019d pick me up Saturday night, silly man!\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t said because he hadn\u2019t agreed to anything. He didn\u2019t have the time or inclination to get involved with anyone. For the past six months he hadn\u2019t been involved with anyone but a woman with eyes the color of the Mediterranean at dawn, until he came to his senses and left before things could go further.</p><p>\u201cOh, that. Right, well...\u201d He shot her a sheepish smile. \u201cCurrently, I find myself in need of permanent transportation.\u201d That much was true. His driver would be leaving town this evening.</p><p>Jemma Leigh laughed like that was the funniest thing she\u2019d ever heard in her life. Skye muttered something about needing to do some office work. Rose said nothing, merely faded into the background. Or at least tried to. There was no way he\u2019d ever forget she was in the room. He could identify her by scent alone. Night blooming jasmine. Subtle but powerful.</p><p>\u201cOh you! I\u2019ll pick you up in my truck. Daddy just had it painted for me. Bright pink with my name written on the tailgate.\u201d She leaned forward and pressed her hand beside her lip-glossed mouth. \u201cJust in case I lose it in the Wal-Mart parking lot.\u201d Jemma Leigh winked.</p><p>Oh, good God. \u201cWasn\u2019t that brilliant of him.\u201d Searching for the best possible way out, he thought of a few choice phrases that could nip this in the bud. But none were very nice. And Jemma Leigh struck him as a genuinely nice person.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Jemma Leigh, but Alexander is moving this weekend. He\u2019s our new renter,\u201d Rose said, surprising the hell out of him. She moved to stand beside him, so close that her arm brushed against his.</p><p>\u201cKnew you couldn\u2019t resist me,\u201d he murmured while mentally reviewing the list of all the reasons why he shouldn\u2019t touch her, shouldn\u2019t kiss her plump lips when they parted for her sweet tongue to dart out and lick at the bottom.</p><p>\u201cJemma Leigh doesn\u2019t need another heartbreak,\u201d she whispered. Then she raised her voice and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you have plans with Jeremy Stafford that night? I heard he was taking you out to eat at Owen\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh\u2019s smile faded. \u201cBut he smells like fish.\u201d</p><p>Rose sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s a fisherman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jemma Leigh\u2019s sigh echoed hers.</p><p>\u201cI bet if you gave him this\u2014\u201d Rose walked to a display case and grabbed a sage green bottle, \u201c\u2014and told him you\u2019d love if he wore it for you Saturday night, he\u2019d smell heavenly.\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh squealed and hugged Rose so hard Sasha heard her grunt. \u201cYou\u2019re the bestest. How much do I owe you?\u201d</p><p>Rose stepped back and gave her a shy smile. \u201cConsider it a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did believe all those rumors about your family,\u201d Jemma Leigh said, pulling out her cell. \u201cI\u2019m going to tweet this right now.\u201d With another wave, she sashayed out the way she came in.</p><p>The sound of a baby crying interrupted the ensuing silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her,\u201d Skye called, walking to the back of the store.</p><p>About a million things passed through his mind at once, but the only thing that came out of his mouth was, \u201cWho\u2019s \u2018her\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Skye held the baby in her arms and walked to Rose.</p><p>Rose lifted her chin and took the infant. \u201cThis is Ivy and she\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>If there had ever been a time he\u2019d have liked to reconsider his current occupation as executive assistant to the destroyer of lives, this was it. Sasha resisted the urge to bang his head on the counter. Not only was Rose responsible for this store\u2019s success and her sister\u2019s college tuition, but she had a baby to support. A baby. With black curls and skin the color of cinnamon.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter?\u201d Probably the most ridiculous question he could come up with, but it would have to serve.</p><p>Rose nodded, their eyes meeting. Unable to withstand the questions lingering in his gaze, she looked away and pressed a kiss to the top of Ivy\u2019s head. The baby blinked up at her with sleepy brown eyes.</p><p>Skye jiggled some keys. \u201cAs entertaining as you two are, I\u2019ve got to get back to Greenville. My shift starts at seven.\u201d She quickly gave Rose and Ivy a kiss and hug before slipping out the back.</p><p>\u201cAlone at last,\u201d Sasha drawled, a self-satisfied smile on his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you really here?\u201d Shifting Ivy in her arms, she reached for the open sign, flipped it around and locked the door.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve locked me in.\u201d He took a step closer and she took one back. \u201cPlanning to keep me as your love slave, Rosebud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me that, Alexander.\u201d Her birthmark throbbed as if in anticipation. She could still feel his wicked tongue tracing the outline of it.</p><p>He smiled and took another confident step, the motion of his lean body reminding her of a panther. By the time he quit walking, she was against the door, holding Ivy between them.</p><p>Slowly, he lowered his head. She sucked in a quick breath and turned her face away. His breath was hot on her neck, the tiny hairs on her skin standing at attention. The heat of his skin caressed hers and she half-expected\u2014and to her mortification, half-hoped\u2014to feel his lips.</p><p>Holding Ivy tighter, she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSweet Rose, I\u2019ll need a contract and a spare key.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the delicious heat her body had been absorbing was gone. She opened her eyes to find Sasha standing a couple of feet away, rifling through his wallet. He pulled out some money and held it out to her. \u201cSkye said rent\u2019s five hundred a month. Here\u2019s the deposit and I\u2019ll get the rest out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her nose to Ivy\u2019s head, steadying her nerves before she spoke. There was no way she would ever let him know how much he still affected her. \u201cGive me about fifteen minutes to print out a contract and pack everything up. Then you can follow me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He began striding to the back of the store.</p><p>She followed him to her office. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I told Jemma Leigh, I need a car.\u201d His was expression unreadable as he turned to wait for her to catch up. That was the worst thing about Sasha. She could never trust her instincts when it came to him. But she needed the money.</p><p>\u201cFine, you can ride with me when we\u2019re done,\u201d she said grudgingly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held out his arms. \u201cLet me hold her while you get everything together.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. He didn\u2019t strike her as the paternal type.</p><p>\u201cFine, do it your way.\u201d He held his hands up.</p> <p>She looked down at Ivy and then back at him. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more.\u201d He gave her a friendly smile and hopped to sit on one side of her desk.\u201d I completely understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually no, but I thought it was the best thing to say at the time,\u201d he said with a small shrug. He placed five hundred dollars on her desk and began to whistle.</p><p>She wanted to laugh at him. At her entire situation. But she was afraid that her laughter would turn into hysterical crying and she wouldn\u2019t be able to stop.</p> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>Rose turned on the radio and popped in a Mozart CD when they hit the outskirts of town. Ivy\u2019s pediatrician, Dr. Reed, had told her it was good for babies to listen to classical music. It made special connections in their developing brains. Made them smarter. God knew Ivy needed an advantage due to her last name.</p><p>Abruptly, the strains of \u201cSerenade in G Minor\u201d stopped. She glanced over at Sasha. He stared at her with a grim look on his face. \u201cMore of a Bach fan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAre we there, yet? We\u2019ve been driving for days,\u201d he complained, making her smile.</p><p>She turned left onto Strawberry Grove Lane, the long winding drive welcoming her home. \u201cOnly five more minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said as her home came into view. \u201cI never thought we\u2019d get here.\u201d</p> <p>The pre-Civil War house had been built in 1820 for the second Poppy Holland by her adoring lover. The two-story double-balcony structure faced the Pamlico Sound and was framed by oak trees with heavy boughs of Spanish moss in their branches. Off to the side stood a greenhouse surrounded by a carefully tended garden.</p><p>After parking, they got out of the Jeep and she moved to the back passenger side to get Ivy.</p><p>Rose unlatched the baby\u2019s carrier from its base, stealing glances at her new tenant as she did. However, his profile revealed nothing, and as they walked to the entrance, she began to judge the exterior from an outsider\u2019s point of view.</p><p>Peeling paint, a sagging front porch and missing rails greeted them. Shutters hanging on by their last nails threatened to decapitate an unlucky bystander. Cobwebs decorated every nook and cranny.</p><p>Her cheeks began to burn and she walked faster, the gravel crunching under her shoes. Maybe she should have sold the place when she had the chance\u2014before she had told the real estate agent to stick it where the sun didn\u2019t shine.</p><p>Damn stubborn pride.</p><p>But that\u2019s what kept her from collapsing on the floor when she read the letter from the tax office. It really hadn\u2019t been a surprise, but the grace period had been shortened from six months to three. She was thankful that it hadn\u2019t been reduced to one. A move that she wouldn\u2019t put past Lorelei Collins, Holland Springs\u2019 tax administrator, not after this new development.</p><p>The sins of her mother were being visited on Rose and her sisters in triplicate. As usual.</p> <p>Sasha knew Rose was embarrassed as hell, the tightness in her shoulders and rigid posture giving her away. He could make it easier on her. He could say something witty and charming, putting her at ease. Then again, she didn\u2019t like it when he was charming. She smiled when he was snarky and biting. Or when he was real.</p><p>And if he didn\u2019t watch it, he\u2019d end up talking to her about long walks on the beach and his pet peeves.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re ready for Halloween,\u201d he said.</p><p>She paused and he grabbed the car seat from her, following as she made her way up the rickety front porch steps. He rather hoped they would hold his and Ivy\u2019s combined weight. The steps creaked ominously, but held. Good God, this place needed a major face lift.</p><p>\u201cAt Strawberry Grove, we\u2019re ready twenty-four-seven, three hundred-sixty five days a year,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFavorite holiday, eh?\u201d</p><p>As the door opened, she stepped inside and gave a low laugh. Darkness enveloped her and the hair on the back on his neck stood up. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard, Mr. Romanov?\u201d Her voice was low, seductive. Bewitching.</p><p>\u201cHeard what?\u201d Unease pricked at his spine, making him unable to step inside with a defenseless baby.</p><p>Lights in the foyer flickered to life, but Rose stood no where near the twin lamps sitting on a table under a large gilded mirror. Instead she stood at the base of a grand staircase, her ocean-blue eyes mysterious. A black cat rubbed against her ankles and meowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a witch.\u201d</p><p>Unable to help himself, his mouth dropped open. \u201cA what!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only teasing.\u201d The expression on her face was anything but playful. She gestured for him to follow her up the stairs. \u201cYour room\u2019s up here. Bring Ivy and I\u2019ll give you the grand tour before I fix supper.\u201d</p><p>Like a man caught in a riptide, he had no choice but to be swept along. The door closed behind him. He risked a backwards glance. The cat now sat by the door, its tail twitching.</p><p>The antique stairs groaned with his every step as he made he followed her. The interior of Rose\u2019s house was in better shape than the outside. Marginally. Faded wallpaper peeled at corners. Washed out carpets covered the second story landing. Ornate sconces flickered on and off as they ascended. He stopped to take a look out of a porthole-shaped window. A crescent moon reflected in the still black waters of the sound.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d Rose asked and he nearly jumped out of his skin.</p><p>Jesus. This house was making him mental. He gave Rose a wicked smile. \u201cNot for months\u2014at least with a partner.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open, then she closed it with a distinctive snap. Turning away from him, she said, \u201cYour room is at the end of the hall. There\u2019s a bathroom two doors down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I wash your back first, dear?\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but ask now that he was in control of the situation.</p><p>She didn\u2019t falter in her stride, nor did she glance back. \u201cWe eat supper at six thirty. There\u2019s no cable or internet, but there\u2019s a land line in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need it. My phone has all the apps I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no signal out here,\u201d she said, and he could have sworn there was a smile in her voice.</p><p>How the hell was he supposed to communicate with the outside world? Oh, right, he was in the middle of nowhere and shouldn\u2019t expect modern conveniences like running water or fire. \u201cI could buy one of those boosters, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bad for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, technology is the very devil,\u201d he muttered under his breath.</p><p>She moved gracefully down the hall, her arm rising and falling every so often. More lights magically illuminated as she passed. He spied a switch plate on the wall. He touched it with the tip of one finger as he passed by. A sharp stab made him jerk it back. Faulty wiring at its finest.</p><p>Ivy let out a whimper and the black cat following Rose turned back to look at him. \u201cWhat? You think I made her cry?\u201d he asked, tilting his head down to stare into eyes that were remarkably like its owner.</p><p>\u201cBlackbeard won\u2019t answer you,\u201d Rose said.</p><p>He snapped his head up, but he hadn\u2019t been aware she\u2019d stopped. She reached out to grab him. He managed to place the carrier on the floor as he stumbled, the weight of his body pushing her back against the wall. Night blooming jasmine filled his senses and he leaned closer, seeking the softness of her skin. The tips of her fingers pressed into his arm and he welcomed the dull bite of her nails.</p><p>Her eyes drew him in, calling to him as he pressed his body against hers. Full breasts flattened against his chest and the cradle of her rounded hips welcomed his.</p><p>Desire flared. He grew hard and instinctively rocked against her. She undulated against him. The smallest of movements but it felt as if she had caressed his entire body. His erection surged. He cupped the back of her neck, her loose curls like the finest of silks against his palm.</p><p>\u201cRose,\u201d he whispered, inching closer to her mouth.</p><p>She sighed, her plump lips parting as she lifted her mouth in offering. Her luminous eyes closed, the thick lashes fanning her perfect cheeks. He was almost there. Almost could taste the sweetness of her lips.</p><p>He traced the curve of her jaw with his thumb.</p><p>Ivy cried out.</p><p>Jerking back, he said, \u201cI think she wants\u2014needs\u2014you.\u201d</p><p>As though in a daze, Rose slowly blinked up at him, her eyes heavy-lidded. The baby let out an ear piercing wail and Rose started. \u201cI-I have to feed her,\u201d she stammered as a dull flush crept up her face. She slid past him, the sound of her retreating footsteps echoing in the hallway.</p><p>Breathing heavily, he rubbed the back of his neck. What the hell had he been thinking? Oh, that was too easy. He hadn\u2019t. Instead he\u2019d gone full-out caveman on her. Again. Although in her store, he\u2019d done it to shake her up a little. Okay, to be really honest he\u2019d done it because of pure male ego. He\u2019d had to know if she was still attracted to him.</p><p>He leaned his head to one side and then the other, trying to relieve the pent-up tension. His raging hard-on let him know that it wasn\u2019t working. He\u2019d been celibate by choice for months now.</p><p>Brilliant forethought.</p><p>A door shut. Rose\u2019s? He wondered if it was locked. Of course it would be locked, especially to him. He\u2019d already hurt her once before, and it didn\u2019t matter he\u2019d apologized, because he had lied to her about coming back and he was lying to her still. She was right not to trust him.</p><p>That would have to change.</p><p>Sasha scrubbed his face with his hand. Dinner, or supper as she called it, would be him at his best. At his non-groping or -ogling best. He would eat, make small talk, help with the washing up, get his luggage from her Jeep and go straight to his room. Alone.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t here to seduce her. Hell, he wasn\u2019t here to get laid by anyone. He had a job to do. One that turned his stomach when he\u2019d been given all the details. One that had kept him up at night when he\u2019d made his own suggestions to help further things along. Never before had he loathed his talent for manipulation\u2014at least not at this magnitude.</p><p>From now on, it would be pure business for everyone involved. It would require a little finesse and a whole lot of double-talking, but there were some things a man needed to do. Some things a man needed to stand up for.</p><p>God, he needed a lie down.</p><p>He turned the glass doorknob and went into his room.</p><p>Rose took a deep breath and then another, trying to steady her nerves as she fixed a bottle for Ivy. Sasha living here wasn\u2019t going to work. It couldn\u2019t. He was too damn male, too damn attractive, and she was too much of a damn fool when it came to him.</p><p>She\u2019d almost let him kiss her.</p><p>Agreeing to let him live here had so not been because of jealousy (or so she tried to convince herself.). It was because she needed the money and because she couldn\u2019t let Jemma Leigh get hurt for the hundredth time. Plus, Rose knew without a doubt that Jemma Leigh and Jeremy belonged together.</p><p>As a Holland, it was Rose\u2019s duty to give love advice. To nudge it along. Even if she\u2019d rather bash them over the head and yell, \u201cWake up, you idiots!\u201d.</p><p>Ivy wailed.</p><p>Rose shook the bottle, mixing the warm water and powder together. \u201cIt\u2019s coming, honey.\u201d Scooping her up from the crib, Rose pressed a kiss to the baby\u2019s forehead and teased the silicon nipple into Ivy\u2019s mouth. Love and a deep commitment to giving this child the stability she never had swelled inside of her.</p><p>\u201cSweet baby,\u201d she crooned, sitting down in the chair that had rocked the first Poppy Holland born in the New World. Rose hummed, the familiarity of their routine giving her a sense of peace.</p><p>Ivy grunted and sucked harder, making Rose laugh. \u201cGreedy little thing.\u201d</p><p>Blackbeard meowed and Rose focused on him. The cat\u2019s gaze seemed to be disapproving. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. We need the money.\u201d He let out a growl. \u201cLeave if you don\u2019t like it, but who else is going to put up with you?\u201d</p><p>The feline rose and stretched, sauntering from the room in a way that only a spoiled cat secure in his position could.</p><p>As Ivy ate, Rose kept one eye on the clock. She still had supper to fix. Sasha\u2019d given her a funny look when she\u2019d said that. Maybe she should have said four course dinner. That was language he understood\u2014the snob.</p><p>She let out a little giggle. Wonder what he\u2019d think of cheese grits and sliced ham with biscuits? He\u2019d probably look at her with those sexy green eyes and say something scathing. Or outrageous.</p><p>Secretly, she liked those sides of his personality. \u201cIdiot,\u201d she chided herself. It was his charming side that made her distrust him.</p><p>As Rose patted her on the back, Ivy let out a lusty burp. Rose held her close, snuggling with her until the baby had fallen fast asleep. She knew this was spoiling her, but Rose couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Ivy made her happy. Every little new gurgle and sound. Every little wiggle and grunt. Not that Ivy wasn\u2019t work; she was. At first Rose had been terrified. Terrified of holding her wrong, feeding her wrong, accidentally drowning her in the bath or not waking up at night when she cried. Most of all she was afraid that she wasn\u2019t mother material. That there was something in her DNA that made her unfit to parent.</p><p>What was worse, she knew that time was running out. Her sister, Summer, would return and then Rose would be alone again. It was her destiny.</p><p>Actually, it was more like a curse.</p><p>\u201cSupper\u2019s ready,\u201d Rose called out as Sasha strode into the kitchen. She sat down at the kitchen table and helped herself to the meal she\u2019d prepared. He sat down with her, loading up his plate and placing a napkin in his lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour house is trying to kill me,\u201d he muttered before taking a savage bite of buttermilk biscuit. \u201cNearly electrocuted myself in the loo.\u201d He chewed the rest and she watched his throat work as he swallowed. \u201cThen the damn lights went off just as I started down the stairs. Hit me head a half dozen times on God-knows-what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look fine,\u201d she said. There wasn\u2019t a hair out of place. He looked exactly like a male model. Dressed like it, too. The stark lines of his shirt emphasized the sculpted lean muscles underneath.</p><p>He gave her a sexy grin and winked, making her heart pound. \u201cGlad you think so.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes. Good grief. Maybe he should\u2019ve been the actor instead of his cousin. She said nothing and began to eat. Polite conversation was most likely expected, but for the life of her, she couldn\u2019t think of a single thing to say.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ivy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSleeping.\u201d She stirred her grits around with her spoon. Normally, she loved eating them, but tonight they tasted like paste.</p><p>\u201cAnd Skye?\u201d</p><p>She looked across the table at him. \u201cShe went back to Greenville, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow often does she help you?\u201d He took a sip of water and set the glass down.</p><p>\u201cEvery Thursday.\u201d She bent her head again, studying the cracked Formica top as she chewed on a piece of salty ham. Little gold stars winked back at her under the pendant light fixture. Never before had the condition of her home bothered her. But now, with this man, sitting in her kitchen, the old inadequacies of her childhood resurfaced at an alarming rate.</p><p>\u201cI have a friend who\u2019d love your house. Maybe I should invite him out here. He directs horror movies, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She snapped her head up. He thought her home belonged in a horror movie?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said with a snap of his fingers, \u201ca Halloween party. Fancy dress. No, no. A masquerade with costumes. Can you imagine how many people could fill up this place? And the dark corners are perfect for a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she managed to say without choking. There was no way in hell he was turning her home into some kind of haunted house for his friends\u2019 perverse pleasures. She grabbed her glass of water and washed down the bite of meat.</p> <p>He looked at her quizzically and stroked his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed friends? Or parties? Don\u2019t remember that bit in the rental contract. In fact, I reckon it\u2019s not legal. You can\u2019t keep a man away from his mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in the stupid contract. It\u2019s-it\u2019s the rules. My rules. Take it or leave it,\u201d she said flatly, unable to take his teasing.</p><p>His mouth dropped open, reminding her of a catfish at the end of a fishing pole. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d She stabbed a helpless piece of ham with her fork.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying you six months in advance rent tomorrow. Surely, you could relax them a bit, eh?\u201d</p><p>There was nothing she wanted to relax for him. She couldn\u2019t even relax in her own house, and he\u2019d only been there for two hours.</p><p>She jumped to her feet, bumping the table and overturning the salt shaker. Out of habit, she grabbed the shaker and shook some salt into her right hand, throwing it over her left shoulder when she was done. \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll drive you back to town and you can find another place to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! Where do you think you\u2019re going? \u201d Sasha reached for her as she rushed past, but Blackbeard growled at him.</p> <p>\u201cSic, Blackbeard, sic,\u201d she hissed, and the black cat pounced.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>The tone of his voice made her stop mid-stride in the most glorious storm-off in history. Sliding over the left side of the hallway, she peeked around the corner, waiting to see what he would do next.</p><p>He knelt down, trying to unhook the cat\u2019s claws from the hem of his pants. \u201cDon\u2019t you know this is Prada, you mangy cur?\u201d he asked, clearly exasperated.</p><p>She gasped in outrage. Blackbeard was the cleanest cat in Holland Springs.</p><p>\u201cNot the shirt, too. Get off,\u201d he said, his voice rising again, \u201cIt\u2019s a McQueen before Burton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, the shirt, too,\u201d Rose mocked softly. As if Blackbeard knew or cared about fashion designers.</p><p>Sasha looked up at the ceiling of the kitchen as though pleading for help. She took a step forward, almost giving away her hiding place. If Sasha so much as looked at her sweet kitty cock-eyed, she\u2019d smother him in his sleep tonight. With a rock.</p><p>\u201cLook here, Blackbeard, I\u2019d invoke parley, but I seriously doubt your superior would give me any quarter,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cShe\u2019d cut me into tiny pieces with a butter knife, I suspect.\u201d Gently, he stroked the cat\u2019s back. Blackbeard sheathed his claws and purred.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good puss,\u201d he said as the cat laid on its side.</p><p>\u201cTraitor,\u201d she muttered. Whirling away, she strode to the stairs and made her way to Ivy\u2019s room. Sasha was good with animals. Even ones that stuck their claws into him and ruined his pricey clothes. So what? Blackbeard was notoriously fickle with his affections, she mentally argued. Besides, he probably knew she was watching him.</p><p>After checking on Ivy, she shuffled to her room. She changed clothes, trading her faded jeans and long-sleeved t-shirt for a cotton nightgown. A velvet robe that had belonged to the fifth Poppy Holland hung on the back of her door. She pulled it on and tied the sash into a loose knot.</p><p>The baby monitor\u2019s lights flashed as Ivy snored in her sleep.</p><p>Rose glanced at the antique clock on her bedside table. Ten minutes had passed. Shouldn\u2019t he have stolen her car to drive himself back to town? Gravel should be shooting into the air right about now, tires spinning and engine gunning. But the only sound that greeted her was the occasional call of wintering swans.</p><p>She walked to the French doors and opened them, letting in a crisp autumn breeze. It blew at her robe and lifted her hair. Stepping out onto the balcony, she shivered. Her toes curled, trying to get away from the cold wooden planks.</p><p>Out of habit, she searched for her star. The one she wished upon as a child. Every night, she would wish that she and her sisters would be good enough for their momma to stay home. But after Rose\u2019s sixteenth birthday, Azalea Holland never came back. And Rose had sworn she\u2019d never wish again.</p><p>The star twinkled, tempting her to take a chance. She wished...Rose shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in you,\u201d she whispered, backing away.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Last night had been the ultimate in dinner disasters. He\u2019d insulted his hostess, cursed at her cat and gotten himself kicked out. To make matters worse, he was sure she\u2019d left him here to walk back to town. When he had checked this morning, her Jeep hadn\u2019t been in the drive.</p><p>Sasha jogged down the formerly grand staircase, dodged a lazy Blackbeard sunning in the foyer and headed into the kitchen.</p><p>Sure he hadn\u2019t risen before eleven-thirty, but he\u2019d stayed up until three am, assuming every position humanly possible to get the barest of signals for his cell phone to work. At one point he\u2019d leaned so far over the balcony that he\u2019d nearly fallen. The lure of one bar had been that tantalizing.</p><p>A note partly hidden by a crystal bowl full of strawberries greeted him on the badly cracked kitchen table.</p><p>Had to run some errands. Help yourself to breakfast or lunch. I\u2019ll be back at 1.</p><p>P.S. Thank you for cleaning up supper.</p><p>Did this mean he could stay, or that she\u2019d be driving him into Holland Springs proper when she got back? Taking a bite of a particularly juicy strawberry, he turned the note over, searching for what he wasn\u2019t sure. A signature, perhaps. But he knew it was her stationery. The initials RPH were engraved at the top in an elegant script. Surprisingly, the paper was excellent quality. She did seem to like pretty things. Like crystal bowls and hand-painted patterns on heirloom china.</p><p>But she, most assuredly, did not like her home being made fun of. Almost as much as he didn\u2019t like being told what to do. There were too many people treating him as a puppet on a string as it were. Two more years and he\u2019d be free. In the meantime, he had to keep his mother in the best medical facilities possible. So...he played his uncle\u2019s game. He did it well in any case. A natural born charmer, though liar would be more apt.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck.</p><p>There was a spring hidden on this property, and it was up to him to find it. To get a sample and send it off to his uncle\u2019s lab in Helsinki. And not that ridiculous only-true-love-can-find-it spring either. Anyone with a maps app and a good signal could find that one.</p><p>Hell, Rose had taken him to that spring. Her hand in his, walking in the forest after midnight. The night sky had been saturated with stars, the breeze with her perfume.</p><p>Eating the last bite of strawberry, he threw the cap away and grimaced. There was no use thinking of that night. However, he had to find a way to get Rose to show him the real spring.</p><p>The front door opened and closed.</p><p>\u201cHullo?\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me and Ivy.\u201d Rose trudged into the kitchen. Dark circles shadowed her eyes and his gut clenched.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back early.\u201d He took the carrier from her and set it on top of the table. \u201cDidn\u2019t sleep well?\u201d</p><p>She washed and dried her hands. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>He managed to work the straps and locks. Ivy made gurgling noises and threw out her arms, starfish-shaped hands opening and closing as he lifted her out. \u201cHappy to see me, sweetheart?\u201d Ivy\u2019s dark brown eyes were solemn. She turned her head and nuzzled his shirt. He looked up at Rose. \u201cI think she\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Rose took Ivy from him. \u201cShe\u2019s always hungry,\u201d she said with affection and the baby smiled up at her.</p><p>A tightness settled in his chest. \u201cAbout last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. You can stay,\u201d Rose said, pre-empting his apology. \u201cWe need the money and for once I won\u2019t let my...pride get in the way.\u201d Her ocean-blue eyes met his and he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cCare to show me around your house? We were slightly distracted last night.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose, her brows drawing together. \u201cYou corner me in the hallway and call it a slight distraction?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNo, I call that fun.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou better call it not happening again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I thought it was one of the perks of living here.\u201d It really was fun to tease her. To try to make her react to him. He\u2019d bet she was one hell of a poker player. She rubbed the gold cross at the hollow of her neck. Now that would be a dead giveaway of a bad hand. But he\u2019d probably be the only one to know that.</p><p>\u201cCould you hold Ivy while I fix her bottle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He held out his arms, once again settling the baby in his arms. \u201cWhere\u2019s her father?\u201d</p><p>Rose rummaged through the cabinets, finding the parts of the bottle she needed and putting it together. \u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he wasn\u2019t expecting that answer. Something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cI expect you would, as Ivy\u2019s mother and sole supporter. Shouldn\u2019t you take him to court for child support?\u201d</p><p>Shaking the bottle of powdered formula and water, she turned and leaned on the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s not really any of your business, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t, but men should take care of their responsibilities. And Ivy was a responsibility that Rose was shouldering alone. \u201cSasha,\u201d he corrected, adjusting his hold on Ivy. \u201cHand me the bottle and I\u2019ll feed her.\u201d When she hesitated, he said, \u201cYou look dead on your feet, love. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, she was a woman who didn\u2019t want to cut off her nose to spite her face and handed him the plastic bottle and a cloth. \u201cFeed her half and then burp her. Then feed her the rest and burp her again.\u201d She showed him how to hold the bottle so Ivy didn\u2019t suck in air and have a tummy ache. Wanting her to stay close, he began to make up ridiculous questions.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she wants something stronger like bourbon? Or what if she demands I take her shopping? I can\u2019t stand Baby Gap. The clothes are juvenile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be,\u201d Rose laughed as she straightened. She walked to the living room and sat down on a sofa that had seen better days. \u201cJust do what I showed you and you\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m going to be right here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>The next thing he knew, Ivy had sucked down half of the formula and soft snores were coming from the direction of the couch. \u201cLooks like mummy needed to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Ivy burped her agreement.</p><p>The sound of shouting woke him up from a dead sleep. Blackbeard dug his claws into his chest and hissed.</p><p>\u201cOff, damn cat,\u201d he growled. Blackbeard jumped off the bed, using his pectorals as a spring board. That would leave some marks. He rubbed his chest before sitting up and rolling his shoulders.</p><p>Rose shrieked his name.</p><p>He jumped up and ran out of his room, nearly colliding with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do with my baby?\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Rose, calm down.\u201d He gently grabbed her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCalm down?\u201d She jerked out of his grasp. \u201cI wake up to find Ivy missing, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in her crib.\u201d</p><p>Rose brushed past him and he followed.</p><p>\u201cShe was here the whole time?\u201d she asked as he entered the room. Rose stood at the side of Ivy\u2019s crib, her hand at her throat and rubbing her cross pendant.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou fell asleep, she fell asleep and then I fell asleep with that damned cat of yours. It all seemed appropriate at the time. However, I refuse to do it again. Blackbeard\u2019s an unaccountable and unrepentant bed-hog.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rose looked as if she couldn\u2019t decide between crying some more or laughing. Possibly she was mulling over how to best kill him. \u201cYou did this so I could take a nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d he said with a quick shrug of his shoulders.</p><p>She nearly toppled him over with her hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d she breathed, \u201cThat\u2019s the nicest thing anyone\u2019s done for me in the longest time.\u201d Her hands wound tighter around his neck and he lifted his own to hug her back. To feel her sweet curves. To pull her closer , wanting to sweep her up into his arms. Into his bed.</p> <p>Get a hold of yourself, man. She\u2019s not for you. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I thought you took Ivy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t leave you a map with an \u2018Ivy is here\u2019 sticker on it.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and sniffed, tightening her grip even more.</p><p>He gently pried her arms from around his neck. Or at least tried to. \u201cYou can let go of me now, Rose. I have a great affinity for oxygen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d he wheezed.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Cheeks pinkening, Rose stepped away and pulled him out of the room. \u201cClose the door,\u201d she whispered and he laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>He closed the door gently and turned to face her. \u201cYou charge up here, screaming and carrying-on, and now you\u2019re worried about being loud.\u201d He shook his head, a smile playing on his lips.</p><p>Tonight, I\u2019m going to fix you the nicest sup-dinner ever.\u201d Rose felt so well rested that she wanted to sing and dance. Amazing what a few hours of good sleep did for a person who\u2019d been living on adrenaline alone for over a month.</p><p>The sun shined brightly through the window near the stairs, highlighting the wall behind Sasha.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d he said, his eyes avoiding hers. \u201cI have plans.\u201d</p><p>Plans? Then it hit her. \u201cOh! You have a date.\u201d She gave him her brightest smile. \u201cI hope you have a great time. You should go to Wilmington. They have lots of great restaurants there, but you already know that. The one you took me to was really good. So was the view.\u201d She clamped her mouth shut to stop babbling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a business dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a silent partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d she asked, not really believing him. She had seen pictures on the internet of him at parties with very important people. People who controlled banks and industries, according to the articles beneath those pictures. So who in the world would he want to talk to in Holland Springs? And she still couldn\u2019t figure out why he was here in the first place.</p><p>Sasha did have family living here, but it made no sense that a man like him would actually choose to be in a small town like hers.</p><p>\u201cI do plan to have some old friends down, but in the meantime, I want to get some local support from the town\u2019s leaders.\u201d</p><p>Local support? Her stomach roiled. \u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand on the small of her back and guided her down the hall. \u201cMayor Jackson for one, and Harrison Collins.\u201d</p> <p>She forced herself to keep walking at a reasonable pace. \u201cYou\u2019re meeting with Harrison Collins tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the mayor. Extremely nice lady. Must be where Jemma Leigh gets it,\u201d he said, not seeming to notice her extreme discomfort. \u201cAren\u2019t you the least bit curious about what I\u2019m going to do with Retro Dayz?\u201d He paused at the top of the stairs and looked at her, expectation written on his face.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re planning,\u201d she replied lamely. She was more concerned about who he was meeting with tonight. A very specific who.</p><p>A wry grin appeared. \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, Rosebud.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the cross at her throat and rubbed. His eyes narrowed in on her actions and she let go of it. It fell back into place, the heated gold warming her skin. \u201cSkye said you were opening a bridal store.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lifted, and then he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the funniest thing I\u2019ve heard in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think you\u2019d love telling people what not to wear,\u201d she muttered as they descended.</p><p>\u201cOh I do, but in this case, I\u2019ll be telling people what to wear for a job interview,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJob interviews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might come as a shock, but I plan to help out the people of Holland Springs. I want to open a store where women and men can come for appropriate business attire and get interview pointers.\u201d</p><p>Flabbergasted, all she could do was ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a flippant smile. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing better to do.\u201d</p><p>So this was a hobby for him. Was she one of his charity cases? It didn\u2019t matter; she needed the damn money.</p><p>Silently they walked to the kitchen. He followed her to the back porch. On the way out, she grabbed Ivy\u2019s baby monitor and clipped it to her pocket. After scooping up the basket she always kept by the back door, she walked to the chicken coop to gather eggs.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Turning to look at him, she swung the basket from side to side. \u201cGetting eggs for the last time.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at the chickens pecking at the ground. \u201cTonight\u2019s dinner?\u201d</p><p>She opened the chicken coop and began to gather the eggs. \u201cNo, I sold them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you usually sell your chickens?\u201d</p><p>No, she loved all the animals that lived at Strawberry Grove. Even the stinking chickens. She could see his very nice, very expensive boots as he paced. Her own Wal-Mart specials were faded and scuffed.\u201cThe Johnsons made it worthwhile,\u201d she said, sidestepping his question.</p><p>\u201cThey have a farm?\u201d he asked, unwilling it seemed to just let it go.</p><p>\u201cYes. It was their field I found you in that time.\u201d The euphoria from having a well-deserved nap was wearing away. The reality that she was selling everything she owned just in case she couldn\u2019t keep her home and land replacing it faster than she liked.</p><p>\u201cOne more question.\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t he leave her the hell alone? \u201cWhat?\u201d she snapped, then immediately regretted it. She needed to be cool Rose. Reasonable Rose.</p><p>Silence greeted her and she stood up, searching for him. Maybe he\u2019d left. Her shoe brushed against something soft and one of the chickens began to squawk. \u201cSorry, Colonel Sanders,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBehind you.\u201d</p><p>She spun around and found him leaning with one hip against the door.</p><p>\u201cI need to go into town. Can I borrow your Jeep since Ivy\u2019s asleep?\u201d</p><p>Taking the Jeep would leave her stranded. The only other vehicle on the property was an old Chevy truck parked in the barn. It had quit working ten years ago when Skye had poured grease in the gas tank in an attempt to make it environmentally friendly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to return it.\u201d</p><p>Something in his tone made her reconsider saying no. \u201cJust replace the gas you use.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her thoughtfully. The wind brushed at his hair, lifting the burnished gold strands.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she added, slipping past him and making her way back to the house.</p><p>A hand on her arm almost made her drop the basket, but then his hand moved to cover hers and kept the basket from falling.</p><p>\u201cIs there any way I can help you, Rosebud?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of his mouth. Or the small freckle at one corner that she wanted to lick. He also had some on his nose, light in color, but if one was close enough...If a woman was able to get past his very kissable mouth, she could find them. Count them. Tease him about them, before kissing each one.</p><p>Heat pooled in places she\u2019d prayed were dormant when it came to him. Her body vibrated, throbbed. The woman that she\u2019d buried deep inside of her wanted a man\u2019s touch, a man\u2019s kiss and demanded to be let out. No, not a man\u2019s touch. Sasha\u2019s. And that woman could think of a dozen ways he could help her. Although none of them were sane and some of them probably weren\u2019t legal in North Carolina.</p><p>She licked her dry lips. \u201cPaying me rent in advance is enough.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t. And she couldn\u2019t ask him to loan her a hundred thousand dollars, could she?</p><p>\u201cHave it your way, but if you need something, all you have to do is ask. I won\u2019t think less of you.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so sincere that she couldn\u2019t stop herself from blurting, \u201cCheesecake.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together and his chin dropped. \u201cCheesecake?\u201d</p><p>She almost told him to forget it, but the woman who wanted him also wanted a decadent dessert that she hadn\u2019t been able to eat in what seemed like forever. \u201cI would like some cheesecake.\u201d She dug the keys out of her pocket and placed them in his free hand.</p><p>\u201cThen cheesecake you shall have.\u201d</p><p>They stood there, hand in hand, not moving, and yet Rose could feel gravity slipping away.</p><p>He leaned closer and she couldn\u2019t stop staring at his sensual lips as they moved. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounded in her throat. \u201cFor you to be careful.\u201d With her Jeep she wanted to add, but for some reason her teeth and tongue refused to cooperate. She made her focus widen to encompass his entire face.</p><p>Sasha blinked, as if he couldn\u2019t quite discern the meaning of her words, and let her go.</p><p>Rose fled to the house.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Sasha drove back to Strawberry Grove in his newly purchased Mercedes CLS63. For the life of him, he couldn\u2019t figure out why he\u2019d opted for a family car when a two-seater roadster was more to his liking. More to his lifestyle.</p><p>Actually, he could explain it all. He was out of his bleedin\u2019 mind.</p><p>On the passenger side sat three different styles of cheesecake. He wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted light and fluffy, dense and rich, or whatever the hell else the bakery shop owner, Daisy Barnes, had in her store. And what was it with these women and their flora and fauna names? Lily, Daisy, Iris...Petunia. Okay, so there hadn\u2019t been a Petunia, but he had distinctly heard a mother shout, \u201cStop, Birch!\u201d at a boy teasing his little sister.</p><p>Or perhaps that was the name of the tree she wanted to get a switch from to \u201cpaint his back porch red.\u201d At least Sasha was able to indulge his sweet tooth and eat a cupcake topped with sprinkles while he was there.</p><p>He adjusted his mirrors and glimpsed a flash of blue lights in the reflection.</p><p>\u201cBloody great.\u201d He pulled over and reached for the required documents. Taking another look in his side mirror, he muttered a second curse. Sheriff Turner was headed his way with a rather disgruntled look on his face.</p><p>A single touch of a button had the window automatically rolling down as the sheriff leaned over. \u201cLicense and registration.\u201d</p><p>Handing it over, Sasha kept his mouth shut and waited. He rather thought that asking what the problem was might end up with a \u2018don\u2019t-tase-me-bro\u2019 moment.</p><p>\u201cYou know why I pulled you over?\u201d</p><p>Sasha had a very good suspicion as to why. \u201cTo see if it really can parallel park by itself?\u201d</p><p>Turner didn\u2019t crack a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate being used in this little scheme y\u2019all got going. Rose Holland is a nice girl. She and her sisters were sweet to Missy when everyone else talked about my Yankee of a wife.\u201d</p><p>No surprise there. She\u2019d helped him out, too, hadn\u2019t she? Put her sweet hands on him and eased his troubles for a while. He gave the sheriff an arrogant glare. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize upholding the law was a scheme.\u201d</p><p>Turner flung his license and registration back at him. \u201cMen like you never get what they really deserve in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen like me keep doing what they\u2019re doing because it works,\u201d he said, checking his reflection in the rear view mirror and running his hand through his hair. Or because they have no other choice. No way out. But he wasn\u2019t about to share that information. He fiddled with his cufflinks. \u201cNow, are we finished?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff looked like he wanted to say more. Hell, he looked like he wanted to arrest him. Instead Turner adjusted his hat. \u201cYou\u2019re free to go. Watch your speed.\u201d</p><p>Sasha gave him a smart-ass salute and was on his way. A minute later, his phone vibrated and he cut on the Bluetooth. \u201cHullo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound the spring?\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t he be here longer than five seconds? \u201cUncle Vladimir, so nice to hear from you. I\u2019m perfectly fit and living at the Hollands\u2019 home. Thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>His uncle grunted. \u201cAnswer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want the one that\u2019s already been found?\u201d Sasha asked. It would be a hell of lot easier to buy that tiny slice of Holland land than to search the entire property for what was rumored to be the original spring that fed the second. For some reason known only to God, satellite images of Rose\u2019s home and the surrounding property were inconclusive. So that left Sasha to do it the old-fashioned way.</p><p>\u201cToo many impurities. We have two months, Alexander. Two. After that Nahalah Industries cuts funding.\u201d</p><p>His uncle must be in a panic. Vladimir had uttered more than three words without insulting him. Sasha made a left at the stop sign and sped up. \u201cI\u2019m meeting with the mayor of Holland Springs and the president of the largest bank in town tonight.\u201d It was the only bank in town, but it really didn\u2019t matter. \u201cThey seem to be on board with the town acting as the U.S. headquarters of Nahalah. Only I have to convince them that jobs will be a part of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them five hundred.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s stomach plummeted even as his car accelerated beyond the speed limit sign\u2019s posted number. Five hundred jobs against one woman\u2019s ancestral lands. Her home. One that despite the multiple offers she\u2019d received, she\u2019d refused to sell. Perhaps sending that jackass of a lawyer with the real estate agent had been a mistake. He gripped the steering wheel hard, hating this. Hating himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVisited your mother today. She remains stable,\u201d Vladimir said, as though he was speaking about the weather. And not about a woman who was in a coma.</p><p>Fury tried to break free, but Sasha clenched his jaw and kept everything he wanted to say behind his teeth. Finally, he allowed, \u201cShe remains at St. Francis?\u201d He had to know she was safe. That his uncle had not exercised his rights set forth by Sasha\u2019s father\u2019s will and moved Phoebe to Childer\u2019s Asylum. To a guaranteed death sentence.</p><p>His uncle chuckled, the sound not at all reassuring. \u201cAs usual, Alexander, where she remains is entirely up to you. So I wouldn\u2019t recommend playing the hero with Ms. Holland.\u201d</p> <p>Sasha barked out a laugh. \u201cI always prefer the villain\u2019s entrance and exit. There\u2019s something to be said for style.\u201d He scanned the road, looking for the small green sign that marked Strawberry Grove\u2019s gravel path.</p><p>\u201cEight weeks, and if all goes according to plan, I\u2019ll allow you to visit your mother.\u201d Vladimir ended their call.</p><p>Allow? Sasha wanted to rip the steering wheel from the dash. He wanted to smash and break everything in sight. But it would do no good. He cut the engine and slumped down in the leather seat, waiting for calm.</p><p>He eyed the house in front of him as the sun set and the windows reflected the light. Inside waited a woman who wanted nothing from him but cheesecake. Cheesecake. Yet here he was, sitting in his car and planning how to strip of her house, her land. Her defenses.</p><p>Her clothes.</p> <p>Good God, he had to stop thinking about that. \u201cDammit,\u201d he muttered. He rubbed the back of his neck. Maybe he should shag someone. It couldn\u2019t be anyone around here, of course. No need for Rose to know about his activities.</p><p>He shook his head. Why did it matter if she knew? \u201cOh, for the love of God.\u201d He grabbed the desserts from the passenger side and quickly got out of the car.</p><p>The soft strains of country music played in the background as he came through the back door. The glow of the kitchen light illuminated Rose. She stood at the sink, washing dishes and humming along. Ivy babbled as she lay on a mat nearby.</p><p>It was a scene so perfectly domestic and cozy that he stopped mid-stride and stared. And stared some more.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t this be something to come home to every night? To actually look forward to, because there was a person, a family waiting for you. Until this moment, he couldn\u2019t remember what that felt like.</p><p>And it was for the best that he strike it from his mind.</p> <p>Clearing his throat, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what you liked, so I got every kind Daisy Barnes had.\u201d Sasha placed the cheesecakes on the counter.</p><p>Rose stopped washing dishes long enough to glance at him, the beginnings of a smile transforming her face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>His formerly bad mood vanished with the appearance of her beautiful smile. He would bring her cheesecake every day for a month if she\u2019d keep looking at him like that.</p><p>Walking over to Ivy, he knelt down to tickle her foot. She cooed and swiped at a brightly colored fish and octopus hanging from a mobile over her head. \u201cWhat is this thing? And do they make one for adults?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a play gym for babies. Ivy can roll around and try to grab all the things that catch her eye.\u201d Rose joined him, her dainty feet with their unpainted toenails entering his side vision. Well, he certainly wanted to grab the things that caught his eye.</p><p>He looked up at her. \u201cBaby shower present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkye and I went in together and bought it for her\u2014Ivy, that is.\u201d Her pretty eyes gazed into his for a moment, then looked away.</p><p>\u201cHow old is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She stepped back and he stood, watching as she began vigorously wiping down the cracked-top kitchen table with a dish cloth.</p><p>\u201cJust curious,\u201d he said lightly, shadowing her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some cheesecake?\u201d She made her way back to the cabinets, tossing the cloth on the counter and pulling out plates.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you answer me? State secret?\u201d He touched her shoulder. A fork clattered to the floor. Well-worn jeans tightened over her perfect bum as she bent to scoop it up. Then she tossed it into the sink and yanked open the silverware drawer, pulling out a clean fork.</p><p>Black corkscrew curls tumbled down her back and around her shoulders, shielding her face from him as she opened and cut into one of the cheesecakes. \u201cAlmost five months,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>There was no way the baby could be hers, not biologically anyway. \u201cSo Ivy is your what?\u201d</p><p>Blackbeard jumped on the counter and Rose scooped him up in her arms, turning to face Sasha as a wealth of emotions played across her face. Without knowing it, she was beginning to trust him. This was going to be easier than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>At that very moment Sasha didn\u2019t know who he hated more: himself, his uncle, or the townspeople willing to sell out one of their own.</p><p>\u201cSummer\u2019s daughter. I\u2019m taking care of Ivy for her.\u201d</p><p>Of course she was. Hell, Blackbeard had probably been some half-dead animal she found on the side of the road and nursed back to health. She supported her family. She\u2019d taken him in to spare Jemma Leigh\u2019s feelings.</p><p>Men like him shouldn\u2019t be allowed to roam the earth. He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019re keeping secret\u2014a cure for world hunger? Energy crisis? Perhaps you run an orphanage in the greenhouse?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged lightly, but her face was somber. \u201cIt\u2019s what family does. Summer wasn\u2019t ready to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>He walked up to her and gently tugged at a loose curl. It wrapped around his finger. \u201cBut you were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes life doesn\u2019t give you a choice. Besides, I love my sisters, even when their choices affect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes everyone assume Ivy\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>Rose shook her head. \u201cMost people know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest?\u201d</p><p>A broom propped against the wall fell to the floor. Blackbeard hissed and Rose jumped. \u201cOh no,\u201d she whispered and grabbed her cross.</p><p>Sasha carefully unwound the lock of hair from around his finger. \u201cFalling housekeeping equipment means something, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompany\u2019s coming.\u201d Impossibly wide eyes narrowed. \u201cWho did you invite to my house?\u201d</p><p>Only the town board\u2019s lawyer, Jason Everett, but Sasha hadn\u2019t actually invited him to her house. He was joining Sasha\u2019s business dinner. \u201cI had to get your Jeep back here somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you need to get someone to drive it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Gone was the sweet smile that minutes earlier had him happy as a lunatic. Thinking like one, too.</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest and moved to the side, leaning one hip against the counter. \u201cI drove it here. Got your money as well. Want it? All you have to do is pick the right pocket of my trousers. I recommend starting with the front one.\u201d He winked at her, but she didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Instead, she placed Blackbeard on the floor and reached for Ivy, her movements jerky and hurried. She muttered something under her breath, but he couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying. Then she left the kitchen. Without the damned cheesecake he\u2019d brought her.</p><p>He followed, his long strides easily keeping up with her much shorter ones. \u201cWill you tell me what this is all about?\u201d</p><p>Black hair streamed out from her head as she turned a corner, her palm supporting Ivy\u2019s neck. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a dinner to go to?\u201d She jogged up the stairs.</p><p>He glanced at his watch before taking the stairs two at a time. \u201cI have an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take you longer than that to get ready,\u201d she said, opening Ivy\u2019s door.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with looking good. Now slow down and talk to me.\u201d He stopped in the doorway and watched as she changed the baby, put pajamas on her, and sat down in the rocking chair.</p><p>The wooden floor creaked as it moved.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she said, the vulnerable look on her face making him blurt out the truth.</p><p>\u201cJason Everett.\u201d</p><p>She blinked twice rapidly then looked away. \u201cI need to get Ivy down for the night. Please, close the door behind you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Sasha shrugged into a cashmere overcoat as a knock sounded on the door. He opened it and Jason Everett slipped inside before Sasha could stop him.</p><p>Jason scanned the foyer as if he was expecting something\u2014or someone. \u201cWhere\u2019s Rose?\u201d he asked, confirming Sasha\u2019s suspicions.</p><p>\u201cAbove stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go say hi.\u201d</p><p>Jason started for the staircase, but Sasha put a hand up to stop him. He flashed an easy grin that didn\u2019t match the rising tide of jealousy flooding his body. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to get her baby to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer baby?\u201d Jason laughed. \u201cI know for a fact that it\u2019s her sister, Summer\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Sasha clenched his jaw. Ivy wasn\u2019t an it. \u201cIvy is the baby\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cReady to go? We\u2019re meeting Brenda and Harrison at Market House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d</p><p>But Jason made no move to leave, only lingered in the foyer, his dark eyes never straying from the top of the stairs. \u201cYou sure she won\u2019t be coming down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d Sasha fished his keys out of his pocket and pressed the unlock button on his key fob several times.</p><p>\u201cThis place is like a living nightmare, but the perks of living here have to be worth it.\u201d A knowing smile covered the lawyer\u2019s face.</p><p>Sasha managed to maneuver Jason outside before he locked and shut the door behind him. \u201cIf by that you mean a cat that hogs the bed and a house out to get me\u2014yes.\u201d</p><p>The Mercedes easily handled the twists and turns of the back roads as they made their way to Wilmington. Sasha tried to keep the conversation light, but all he could think about was the hunger he\u2019d seen in Jason\u2019s eyes. That damned smile.</p><p>As they waited at a deserted intersection for the light to change, Sasha turned to him and asked, \u201cHow well do you know Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntimately.\u201d Jason grimaced. \u201cAlthough that ugly-ass birthmark on her thigh was almost enough to make me reconsider.\u201d</p><p>Sasha quickly calculated how much recovery time he would need if he drove his car into the nearest tree, making sure that the passenger side took the brunt of the crash. Unfortunately, the car\u2019s safety features would prevent Jason from being seriously hurt.</p><p>\u201cYet you persevered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than one way to screw a Holland.\u201d Jason leaned forward to fiddle with the multiple buttons of the sound system.</p><p>\u201cObviously things didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one of us.\u201d Jason pulled out his cell, running his finger over the screen.</p><p>Sasha\u2019s fingers tightened on the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white. \u201cCried yourself to sleep over the break-up, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot away just in time. She thought it was more serious than it was. I had to stop her from embarrassing herself with the L-word.\u201d Jason shuddered. \u201cEnough time\u2019s passed since then, and judging by her lack of dates, it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s not over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Sasha clenched his teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d figured I\u2019d try to patch things up. Take her flowers or some kind of shit women like. Shouldn\u2019t be too hard to convince her, since I was nice about the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jason nodded. \u201cI even took her to a real nice restaurant on our last date to break the news to her.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he bet the bugger did. \u201cSo she wouldn\u2019t cause a scene,\u201d Sasha murmured. Would the bloody light change already? He had to get to dinner before he did bodily harm to his lawyer.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Rose wasn\u2019t living up to her reputation. You do know about the Hollands\u2019 reputation?\u201d</p><p>The slowest light in history finally changed to green and Sasha hit the gas. \u201cSorry, not up-to-date on all the gossip.\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed. Too bad it wasn\u2019t one that sounded creepy and warned women away from an ass like him. Everett was tall, fit and had a mega-watt smile. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that the Holland women have always had a way with men. Married, single\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter. They never marry the babies\u2019 daddies. Hell, I\u2019m willing to bet Summer doesn\u2019t even know who her kid\u2019s dad is.\u201d</p><p>According to Rose, Jason would win that bet. \u201cLots of women make a go of it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery Holland woman makes a go of it alone. No strings and no emotional attachment. It\u2019s the best damn thing about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for Rose,\u201d Sasha said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a weird one in every bunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Skye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chubby chaser.\u201d</p><p>Sasha glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not into fat girls,\u201d Jason clarified. He cracked his knuckles. \u201cRose was pushing it, but Summer wasn\u2019t around. So I settled.\u201d</p><p>The lawyer would never know how close he came to needing an oral surgeon tonight. Just as Sasha applied the brakes and began looking for a secluded spot, Jason pointed out Market House. Sasha pulled the Mercedes up to the curve and parked.</p><p>Two valets rushed over, opening their doors.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bar on Fifth that has the hottest cocktail waitresses. We should hit it up after dinner,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>Sasha nodded, tipped the valet, and followed Jason into the restaurant. \u201cWe should.\u201d But they wouldn\u2019t. If Sasha had his way, Jason Everett would be walking home tonight. There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell Sasha would spend the rest of his night with the asshole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason checked in with the hostess, then turned to Sasha. \u201cLooks like they beat us here.\u201d He craned his neck. \u201cThere they are. Brenda\u2019s the blonde in the corner sitting with the guy wearing glasses.\u201d</p><p>Brenda Jackson, the mayor of Holland Springs, rose to her feet as soon as she spied them, waving Sasha and Jason to her table. Tall and willowy like her daughter Jemma Leigh, she exuded warmth and charm. \u201cAlexander Romanov, what a delight,\u201d she said, her friendly smile reaching her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to put a face with a voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely to meet you in person, Brenda.\u201d Sasha extended his hand and shook the mayor\u2019s, then the bank president\u2019s. Harrison Collins removed his glasses and tucked them into the inside pocket of his jacket. Sasha couldn\u2019t help but think that he\u2019d met him before. It didn\u2019t matter. He had a job to do. He gave his dinner companions a brief smile and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get down to business, shall we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Hollands won\u2019t sell Strawberry Grove,\u201d Harrison said, his gray eyes emotionless in the candlelight as Sasha and Jason sat down at the table.</p><p>A guilty flush covered the mayor\u2019s face. \u201cI still don\u2019t like the idea of putting those poor girls out on the street. Where would they go?\u201d</p><p>Jason tipped his glass back and took a swallow of wine. \u201cThey can live in the apartment over the store. It\u2019s only Rose and that kid of Summer\u2019s living in the house, anyhow.\u201d</p><p>Brenda frowned and picked at her salad.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard a job count yet. How do we know that they won\u2019t build the plant and bring their own people over? I\u2019m not taking it to my board for consideration until we have concrete numbers,\u201d Harrison said.</p> <p>\u201cGood point. It\u2019s hard to persuade people to get behind seizing someone\u2019s land for the \u2018common good\u2019 if there aren\u2019t any jobs. Looks bad to the press, too, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to advise the town council to vote for it without good reason.\u201d Jason looked at Sasha. \u201cWhat\u2019s the latest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNahalah is guaranteeing five hundred jobs. Ones that pay well and have excellent benefits,\u201d Sasha said, ignoring the sharp stabs of guilt.</p><p>Harrison smiled. Something started to click in Sasha brain, but the man\u2019s next words obliterated the thought. \u201cLooks like Rose\u2019s loan is coming due soon\u2014in full\u2014and if she can\u2019t pay...\u201d He raised his brows and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLoan?\u201d Sasha asked, his glass of water hovering inches from his mouth. This was quickly becoming ridiculous. First he\u2019d been caught unaware about the former job, then the baby, and now a business loan.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think she got the money to start Carolina Dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Harrison, people have been coming to the Hollands for years and paying them for their services.\u201d Brenda grabbed a roll and smeared some butter on it. \u201cHeck, Lake Holland sent me and Nolan to the springs. We\u2019ve been married for thirty-five years now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you think that love potion, mumbo-jumbo crap they put out there is real, Brenda.\u201d Jason shook his head.</p><p>She looked affronted. \u201cRose Holland helped my little girl catch a nice man. One that loves her and owns a business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd smells like fish,\u201d Jason sneered.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s above a decent day of work,\u201d Harrison said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Brenda said, flashing a smile at the bank president.</p><p>\u201cSo smelling bad equals decency?\u201d Jason said with a smirk. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll never be decent.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Harrison signaled the waiter for another drink.</p><p>Placing his glass down, Sasha rubbed the back of his neck. How a woman like Rose had ever become involved with a man like Jason blew his mind. The lawyer was a transparent snob and womanizer. \u201cAre you from Holland Springs, Mr. Everett?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall me Jason, and no, I\u2019m from a town fifty miles south.\u201d He wiped his mouth with his cloth napkin. \u201cI moved here about a year and a half ago.\u201d</p><p>Sasha could picture it: A new guy in town, presumably unaware of her family\u2019s history, with an easy smile and charm. Takes her out, gets to know her, seduces her, and then leaves her. But could he really hate Jason for the exact same thing he\u2019d done to Rose? Did it matter that his only redeeming quality was that he hadn\u2019t had sex with her?</p><p>The waiter placed their food in front of them, but Sasha wasn\u2019t remotely hungry.</p><p>Harrison pierced a small piece of salmon with his fork. \u201cHow did you talk Rose into letting a complete stranger stay at her home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew her from before.\u201d Sasha took a quick bite of his shrimp and grits. \u201cAnd I\u2019m renting a room, not merely staying there.\u201d</p><p>Brenda\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cBefore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time I visited your lovely town, I had the pleasure of meeting Rose at her shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The mayor\u2019s brows relaxed, but she wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cStill, Rose isn\u2019t what most would call outgoing. She keeps to herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll Rose needs is the right kind of incentive,\u201d Jason chimed in, \u201cOut of the three of them, Summer\u2019s the most...hospitable.\u201d</p><p>Sasha swallowed, imagining his fist connecting with the lawyer\u2019s nose. \u201cRose is very giving of herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d Jason tracked a woman wearing a tight red skirt as she sauntered across the room. He winked at her and she flung her hair over a shoulder, giving him a flirtatious smile.</p><p>\u201cAzalea was like that, never turned someone in need away,\u201d Harrison said.</p><p>Sasha raised his brows. \u201cI assume you\u2019re speaking of their mother.\u201d</p><p>Harrison nodded. \u201cShe took off seven years ago, right after Rose turned sixteen. Skye couldn\u2019t have been more than thirteen, and Summer eighteen, but she was playing house with Patrick Johnson.\u201d</p><p>Why would Collins bother to know the personal details of three women who were outcasts in their own town? If anyone else thought that comment to be strange, they didn\u2019t voice it.</p><p>Jason made a noise of disgust. \u201cSixty-five year old Patrick Johnson or his son, Junior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m not one to spread gossip, but she lived with both of them,\u201d Brenda said, shifting in her chair, then patted a stray hair back in place. \u201cBut who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I do know is that Summer Holland made off with five thousand dollars and Junior\u2019s Mustang when she was done with them.\u201d Disapproval was written all over Harrison\u2019s face. \u201cApple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree in that family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept Rose and Skye,\u201d Sasha pointed out.</p><p>Harrison turned steel eyes on him, but Sasha didn\u2019t waver. \u201cTime will tell.\u201d</p><p>Jason rapped his knuckles on the table, garnering everyone\u2019s attention. He leaned forward in his chair. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the issue at hand. I\u2019ve got an idea that\u2019s been running in my mind. Destroy her business\u2014make people think her stuff is no good. If she doesn\u2019t have the income to pay off her back taxes, well, she\u2019ll have no choice but to sell.\u201d</p><p>Brenda rose to her feet. \u201cEither get her to sell her home the legal and honest way, or count me out of this scheme.\u201d She left the table and headed to the front of the restaurant with her purse.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be a problem?\u201d Sasha wiped his mouth with his napkin and placed it beside his plate, unable to force down another bite.</p><p>Harrison threw back the last of his Jack and Coke. \u201cBrenda will come around.\u201d</p><p>Sasha hoped to God she wouldn\u2019t. If the deal fell through because of the mayor\u2019s guilty conscience, then the blame couldn\u2019t be placed on him and his mother was still safe. \u201cI have to go.\u201d He rose to his feet in one fluid motion. He needed a drink. Hell, he needed the whole damn bar.</p><p>Harrison and Jason looked at him in obvious surprise. \u201cI thought we were going out after dinner,\u201d the younger man said, then a gleam entered his eyes. \u201cPerks of your living arrangement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m meeting a friend,\u201d Sasha said, reaching for his wallet.</p><p>Harrison held up a hand. \u201cThis is on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thanks.\u201d Sasha grabbed his coat from the back of the chair and shoved his arms inside, thankful for once that there hadn\u2019t been a coat checker.</p><p>\u201cI can give you some pointers on how to loosen her up on the way back.\u201d Jason offered a conspiratorial smile and stood as well. He fumbled for his coat.</p><p>\u201cMuch appreciated, but not needed.\u201d For the love of God, did this asshole ever shut up about his Rose? No, not Sasha\u2019s Rose. She belonged to no one, especially not to him. \u201cGentlemen, have a fantastic evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! You can\u2019t leave me here,\u201d Jason protested as he pulled the navy material over his shoulders.</p><p>Harrison waved him away. \u201cLet him go. You can ride with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d Sasha said, then strolled through the dining room and out the entrance as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world.</p><p>Cold October air greeted him, working its way inside his bones. Finding all of his vulnerable spots. He welcomed it. A man like him didn\u2019t deserve warmth or softness.</p><p>He watched as couples holding hands waited for their cars. As they kissed and looked at each other with dreamy eyes and talked about their bloody feelings. They would be headed home. Together. Talking about their past and their futures.</p><p>He, too, would be headed home. To a woman whose future he had to take away.</p><p>It was almost three in the morning when Rose heard the back door open and close. She turned over and fluffed her pillow, watching the light of the baby monitor as it changed colors with the sounds of Sasha\u2019s loud, clumsy movements. Something crashed to the floor and he cursed.</p><p>Drawing back the covers, she rose from the bed and made her way to the door. Opening it a crack, she listened. Another series of crashes sounded and she found herself walking to his room.</p><p>Wearing nothing but a cotton nightgown with small straps, she shivered in the cold night air and wished she\u2019d had the presence of mind to put on her robe. The mass of curls covering her shoulders provided a thin barrier against the night\u2019s chill. At his door, she knocked and called out, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>She knocked again, louder this time. \u201cSasha?\u201d As she turned the knob, the door swung open so quickly that she almost stumbled inside.</p><p>Sasha loomed over her, wearing only a dark pair of jeans with the top button undone. His sculpted chest rose and fell with steady movements, nipple rings gleaming in the dim light. Washboard abs complemented lean hips as he stretched his arms above his head, grabbing the frame and leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cThere was a reason I didn\u2019t answer you, Rose,\u201d he said, blocking her from seeing the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing jeans?\u201d He didn\u2019t strike her as a jeans kind of man.</p><p>His heated gaze traveled to her face. \u201cCouldn\u2019t answer the door in the buff, could I?\u201d</p><p>He slept in the nude? Or had he brought a woman home with him? Maybe that was why he was making all that racket. He was too busy getting it on to care about not breaking her things.</p><p>He shifted to one side and she risked a peek at the bed. Nothing. Blackbeard raced past her and jumped on Sasha\u2019s mattress, circling once before lying down. \u201cWhy does your cat think my room is his?\u201d</p><p>Because it used to be hers. \u201cHow did you get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaxi driver from hell. I think he ripped me off,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou took a taxi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could hardly drive in my condition.\u201d</p><p>The smell of alcohol wafted over her face, and she wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou\u2019ve been drinking.\u201d</p><p>He pinched his thumb and forefinger together. \u201cOnly a wee bit, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you never drank.\u201d Or at least, that\u2019s what he had told her on their date. Then again, he\u2019d also told her that he wasn\u2019t coming back.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of things I thought I\u2019d never do.\u201d The perfect curve of his mouth flattened.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really none of your business,\u201d he said, throwing the familiar phrase back in her face. \u201cYou\u2019ve reached your maximum of questions to ask. Thanks for playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Exhaustion hit her hard and she rubbed her eyes. This wasn\u2019t the time for conversation. It was early morning and her toes were frozen. Like an idiot she\u2019d been concerned for him. Okay, so if she was really honest, she wanted to know how his dinner went. What Jason had said. She was more worried about his big mouth than anything Harrison Collins might have shared with Sasha.</p><p>She reached for her necklace and rubbed it, watching as he tracked her movements with his knowing eyes.</p><p>\u201cStill cross with me?\u201d He slowly reached for her, the pad of his thumb rubbing her bottom lip. His touch lulled her and made her stomach do cartwheels at the same time.</p><p>She dropped the pendant, working up the courage to ask what she\u2019d been dying to know. \u201cDid Jason say anything about me?\u201d</p><p>His thumb moved to the curve of her cheek and his eyes glittered. \u201cIs he important to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jason had humiliated her and it still hurt to think about it, much less talk about the whole sordid tale. She lowered her lashes and she stared at his feet. They were long and perfectly formed, like the rest of him.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve been on a date, sweetheart?\u201d he asked in that sexy voice of his, sliding his hand down the side of her throat and cupping the back of her neck, the pressure light. Tantalizing.</p><p>She could lie. She could say she\u2019d dated every man who\u2019d caught her eye, but it was three a.m. and she was standing in her nightgown at the doorway of the man who she wanted more than anything. \u201cNot since you and I went out. I don\u2019t really date much.\u201d Try not at all since Jason (with the exception of Sasha), and before either of them she hadn\u2019t had the time. Or rather, made the time. Most men around here wanted more than she was willing to give. But when she\u2019d met Sasha, she\u2019d taken the chance he\u2019d be different. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Like that turned out so well, a little voice inside her head reminded. But he hadn\u2019t used her for sex. She remembered his cell ringing, then he\u2019d just stopped. Kissing her. Touching her. He\u2019d become distant, his eyes fixated on the waterfall beside them. After helping her up from the ground, adjusting their clothes and walking with her back to his car, he\u2019d driven her home. Once there, he\u2019d thanked her for the date and driven off.</p><p>\u201cA babysitter is a luxury I can\u2019t afford,\u201d she added, after the silence lengthened.</p><p>He muttered a curse and she lifted her gaze higher, to the thin trail of hair that disappeared under the second button at the fly of his jeans.</p> <p>She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come to my room?\u201d he asked, his tone bordering on accusatory.</p><p>\u201cIt sounded like you were trying to destroy my home.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his fingers around her chin and lifted it. \u201cThis house isn\u2019t a person.\u201d</p><p>She bristled at his tone and thunder rumbled, shaking the house. \u201cI never said it was, Alexander. Let go of me,\u201d she ordered, jerking out of his grasp. \u201cSome of us actually have to work tomorrow\u2014today. I\u2019m leaving at five-thirty.\u201d</p> <p>His brows pushed together. \u201cBut your store is closed on weekends.\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders, determined not to be embarrassed. It was bad enough that he knew everything about her financial problems. \u201cI\u2019m cleaning vacation homes on Palm Island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the winter?\u201d he asked, his voice incredulous.</p><p>It was still autumn, she wanted to point out, but didn\u2019t. \u201cWhy do you care? You\u2019ll have the whole day to do nothing.\u201d She turned and marched down the hallway, calling over her shoulder, \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you do best?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Rose couldn\u2019t believe her weary eyes. It had to be a dream. She blinked and blinked again, her arm aching from the combined weight of Ivy and her baby carrier.</p> <p>She rubbed her eyes with the side of her fist, but the apparition didn\u2019t disappear. Waiting in her kitchen was Sasha, dressed in a hunter green sweater and distressed jeans. A black pea coat draped over one arm as he drank a steaming cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cMorning, love. Ready to go?\u201d he asked, his voice cheery. As if he\u2019d had eight hours of sleep. He passed her a mug.</p><p>She glanced down before taking a tentative sip. \u201cYou know how I take my coffee?\u201d</p><p>He tapped his head. \u201cThis brain is useful for many things. You had cream in the fridge. The tricky part was the sugar.\u201d He rinsed out his cup, then took the car seat from her. Ivy was strapped in and bundled up. \u201cShe weighs a ton. How do you carry her around?\u201d</p><p>Rose kept looking at him over the rim of her coffee cup, letting the warmth fill her. Unfortunately, it wouldn\u2019t do much to wake her up since Skye had talked her into giving up caffeine three years ago.</p><p>\u201cI started the Jeep up so it would be warm for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He gave her a crooked smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you. I packed us a lunch, too. I would offer the use of my car, but it\u2019s not scheduled to arrive here, until three this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo clean houses?\u201d She set the mug down on the counter, unable to string more than three words together. This was\u2014he was\u2014unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, still smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cWearing that?\u201d She wore baggy old sweats and even older tennis shoes. Her hair had been braided and shoved under a blue toboggan.</p><p>He frowned and looked down at his clothes. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t say \u2018I\u2019m in the mood to clean?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says \u2018I shop at Banana Republic,\u2019\u201d she said, exasperated.</p><p>He wrinkled his nose up on one side. \u201cMy sweater is from this year\u2019s Army/Navy collection and my jeans are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot from Banana Republic. I get it. You don\u2019t like chains.\u201d She threw up her hands and shook her head. \u201cBut you do see what I\u2019m wearing, right?\u201d</p><p>His face grew serious. \u201cWhen I look at you, Rosebud, you\u2019re all I see.\u201d</p><p>Heat that had nothing to do with the coffee she\u2019d just drank washed over her, making her toes curl and throwing her off balance. Bemused and unable to look away, she replied, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>A wicked grin appeared. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t care what clothes you wear, love. I\u2019d much rather have you out of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha.\u201d This Sasha she could deal with. This Sasha was the same to everyone, but the man who saw through her\u2014he was dangerous.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d gotten to the last house, Rose was dead on her feet. Her lower back ached and her fingers wouldn\u2019t function correctly. To say nothing of her mind. She\u2019d just poured half a bottle of window cleaner on a potted plant instead of water. After rinsing the plant off in the shower, she made her way to the second floor.</p><p>The sound of Sasha singing came from the kitchen. She paused in the living room, staring at him while he shook his butt and mopped the floor. His voice wasn\u2019t half bad, and for a tall man, he knew how to move his body. One that he was completely comfortable in.</p><p>And she was completely aware from past experience how his body moved. How his hands caressed and his mouth lingered. She looked away, scanning the room for Ivy and finding her safely strapped into a bouncy seat set on the middle of a large table. The baby furiously kicked her legs and made raspberries while plastic fish bobbed up and down in their mock aquarium.</p><p>\u201cAll right, love,\u201d Sasha called out, sliding over to the baby and holding an earbud up to her head. Ivy started, then gave him a toothless smile. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>Rose frowned. She really didn\u2019t know if she wanted Ivy to get attached to him. He\u2019d be gone in six months, probably sooner if he got bored. Ivy had had enough upheaval in her short life already.</p><p>Rose leaned to the side and caught his eye.</p><p>\u201cFinished?\u201d He removed the other earbud and stuffed them in his pocket.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHow much longer for you?\u201d</p><p>Opening the louvered doors, he placed the mop inside and grabbed the bucket. \u201cI already dumped this outside.\u201d He turned around, his smile sexy as hell. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go when you are.\u201d</p><p>Mesmerized, she didn\u2019t respond right away.</p><p>He waved his hand side to side. \u201cEarth to Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>Rather than admit she\u2019d been staring at him, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re really good with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, women\u2014even little girls\u2014are easy to deal with. Pay them a bit of attention, act like what they\u2019re saying is the most important thing in the world, and you\u2019ve got \u2018em.\u201d</p><p>Insulted, she put her hands on her hips. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle your feathers, love. I was only teasing.\u201d Reaching behind him, he pulled out his cell and waved it at her. \u201cDownloaded an app on how to take care of a baby.\u201d</p><p>Speechless, she tried to think of something, but settled for marching over to the breakfast nook and grabbing Ivy, bouncy seat and all.</p><p>\u201cLet me carry her,\u201d he said, keeping pace with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it. You grab my cleaning supplies and load them into the back,\u201d she said as he opened the front door for her. \u201cI\u2019ll put Ivy in the car seat and start up the Jeep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d he said, racing back into the house.</p><p>After navigating the two flights of stairs, Rose managed to open the passenger side door with one hand and place the bouncy seat inside. As she unbuckled the straps and placed her niece into the car seat, Sasha came jogging down the steps, cleaning supplies in hand.</p><p>\u201cI locked the front door,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She fastened Ivy\u2019s seatbelt and covered the baby with a warm blanket while Sasha placed the bucket of supplies in the Jeep. Shivering, she reached over the driver\u2019s seat and turned the key. On the first turn, the engine sputtered and she sighed.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d She tried again, then a third time. The engine revved to life and her breathing returned to normal.</p><p>\u201cDid that with me this morning. Have you had a mechanic look at it?\u201d He stood by the passenger side, waiting for her to get out.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep me in suspense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Although Carter Ambrose had told her that she would be lucky to get another two months out of it. But if the Jeep could hold itself together for just a little longer, then she could pay cash for another one she\u2019d seen on Craig\u2019s list. One that she\u2019d planned on Carter checking out, because he was one of the few men that she trusted to not to take advantage of her.</p><p>He placed a hand on the door. \u201cIt\u2019s fine because it\u2019s none of my concern, or it\u2019s fine because it\u2019s really fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d She brushed past him and got into the driver\u2019s side. He climbed in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d Pulling her hat out of his coat pocket, he tugged her it over her head and played with the curls sticking out from underneath. \u201c\u2014I could take a look at it.\u201d</p><p>She fought the urge to lean into his hand. To lay her head on the warm, sweater-covered chest so close. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we stop for dinner?\u201d Sasha asked as she drove along Highway 13. \u201cMy treat.\u201d</p><p>Rose was starving, but the thought of cooking and cleaning up her kitchen made her ill. All she wanted to do was put Ivy to bed, then crawl between the sheets. So his offer was a godsend. \u201cThere\u2019s a place about five minutes up the road.\u201d Honestly, it wasn\u2019t a restaurant she was interested in eating at. She\u2019d heard the food was some of the best around. Unfortunately the hostess couldn\u2019t stand her.</p><p>Not to mention Rose wasn\u2019t exactly dressed for going out. There was a new bleach stain across her chest, and the knees of her sweatpants were grimy.</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d He rubbed his hands together in obvious anticipation.</p><p>The parking lot was practically full. The only spots open near the road. Sasha grabbed Ivy\u2019s carrier while Rose reached for the diaper bag.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked before shutting the door.</p><p>Yes, she wanted to stay in her car and let him order take-out. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand on her elbow, gently guiding her to the entrance. \u201cIf you like, we can get it to go. I\u2019ll drive while you eat.\u201d</p><p>She was wary of this new Sasha. One that was trying to be considerate and attentive to her needs. \u201cIvy needs to eat, too.\u201d</p><p>Smiling a little, he lifted a shoulder. \u201cWhatever you want, Rose.\u201d</p><p>Well, the hostess certainly looked like she knew what she wanted. As they walked in, Gillian Perry\u2019s hungry gaze slid over Rose and zeroed in on Sasha. Which was entirely fine with her. She\u2019d rather not be noticed at all.</p><p>Gillian had hated her ever since Rose had told Gillian\u2019s ex-boyfriend that he shouldn\u2019t go looking for Holland Springs with her. Said boyfriend had not only broken up with Gillian and spilled his guts about the Rose\u2019s advice, but within the next month, had found the woman he was supposed to be with and they\u2019d eloped.</p><p>Ducking her head, she scooted behind Sasha. His broad shoulders obscured her view (and anyone else\u2019s of her) as they waited.</p><p>Ivy fussed and he set the carrier down on the floor so Rose could take her out. The baby went into Rose\u2019s arms eagerly, but when she wasn\u2019t given a bottle, she began to cry in earnest.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d Sasha gently rubbed Ivy\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hungry. I need some warm water for her bottle.\u201d She gently bounced the baby in her arms, trying to calm her. \u201cJust a few more minutes, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we have some warm water, please?\u201d Sasha asked Gillian.</p><p>\u201cYou can have anything you want, sugar. On the menu or off. I\u2019m done at ten,\u201d she purred.</p><p>\u201cFantastic. I\u2019ll recommend your pub to all my friends. Now about that water,\u201d Sasha merely said, shocking Rose. She thought he would\u2019ve flirted back with Gillian. He turned and faced to her, his golden head tilting down. \u201cMy girls okay?\u201d</p><p>Now that he was here, she was. Good grief. Lack of sleep was making her lose her mind, but she gave him what was probably the biggest, goofiest grin in history anyway. \u201cDoing great, honey.\u201d</p><p>One side of his sexy mouth tilted at the corner and he braced a hand against the wall beside her, the other hung loosely at his side. \u201cAre we to have pet names for one another, Rosebud?\u201d</p><p>She peered at him under her lashes, heat rising to her cheeks. Sasha called her by her full name when she least expected it. Somehow, he made it sound like an endearment. As always it threw her off balance. \u201cI was only teasing.\u201d</p><p>Ivy let out an ear-piercing shriek.</p><p>Of course, what seemed like everyone in the entire restaurant stopped talking and started staring. Rose\u2019s face began to burn and her skin felt all tingly.</p><p>\u201cHush, baby girl. It\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered, but the baby wasn\u2019t having it and cried harder, fat tears rolling down her cheeks. She glanced up at Sasha, fully expecting him to be annoyed, but sympathy gleamed in his eyes. The apology she was about to say never left her mouth.</p><p>He held out his hands. \u201cLet me take her.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she handed him Ivy, the baby settled down, her cries reduced to hiccups and sniffles. Rose was gratefully annoyed.</p><p>Sasha held Ivy securely in his strong arms, his large palm on the back of her head. \u201cSeriously, Rose, let\u2019s get something to go, and I\u2019ll drive while you eat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She placed a hand on his arm. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. We\u2019re a team.\u201d He grinned at her, his perfect lips tilting up and making her stomach drop.</p><p>\u201cWhy, look what the cat drug in,\u201d Gillian said, holding a mug in her hand. \u201cI\u2019d heard one of you had a baby.\u201d Turning to Sasha, she said, \u201cIs she trying to pass this one off as yours?\u201d</p> <p>Sasha\u2019s green eyes hardened. \u201cWho says this one\u2019s not mine?\u201d</p><p>Gillian blinked. She looked pointedly at Ivy, then back at him. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look a thing like you, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the first time Rose had been subjected to cruel remarks concerning Ivy, but usually it was more about the Holland reputation than anything else. \u201cThank you for the water, Gillian.\u201d Rose took the mug. \u201cI\u2019ll fill up Ivy\u2019s bottle and we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy takes after my mother,\u201d Sasha said and pressed a kiss on top of the baby\u2019s head before leaning back to look at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you, darling?\u201d Ivy\u2019s watery eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled at him. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>Rose sucked in air. Not since high school had anyone outside of her family defended her. Her heart did several little flips as she searched through the diaper bag one-handed. After mixing the formula, she stood and passed the empty mug back to Gillian.</p> <p>Sasha held out his hand. \u201cLet me feed her this time, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Rose passed him the bottle. Ivy latched on eagerly, sucking like crazy on the nipple.</p><p>\u201cEat your fill, darling,\u201d he said with a smile and the baby reached up with one hand to touch his jaw.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Gillian crossed her arms over her ample chest.</p><p>He looked at Rose. \u201cIs there another place you and I can eat?\u201d</p> <p>Rose glanced at the woman scowling at her. Lifting her chin, she said, \u201cI\u2019m starving and so are you. We\u2019re eating here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not have her insult you and profit from it,\u201d he murmured into Ivy\u2019s curls.</p><p>A little smile formed on her lips. \u201cThen you\u2019ll be extremely limited with where you shop and eat around Holland Springs.\u201d</p><p>Leaning down, he gave the appearance of kissing her cheek, but did no more than rub his jaw against her as he whispered in her ear. \u201cMake a list, love.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s heart sprinted, stuttered, and then passed out.</p><p>That evening, after putting Ivy to bed, Rose made her way down to the family room and found Sasha watching re-runs of Paula Dean\u2019s cooking show.</p><p>\u201cPaula, you naughty minx, there can never be too much butter.\u201d He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.</p><p>She cleared her throat and sat down beside him on the sofa, drawing her knees up and her legs over to the side. \u201cIf you see something you\u2019d like for me to fix for supper one night, let me know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHullo, sweetheart.\u201d He gave her a friendly smile. \u201cI might take you up on that very delicious offer.\u201d</p><p>A warmth that had nothing to do with desire spilled into her. It was nice to have someone to talk to besides Blackbeard, after Ivy went to bed. Heck, it was nice to talk to anyone that could talk back in complete sentences. \u201cThank you for supper and...well, everything you did today. Yesterday, too. My nap. I was really sleepy.\u201d Great. She sounded like a complete moron.</p><p>Clicking off the T.V., he turned to her and laid an arm across the back of the sofa. Although he wasn\u2019t touching her, it was as if she could feel the tips of his fingers brush against her shoulder. He tilted his head to one side, studying her.</p><p>She looked away and picked at the fuzz on the arm of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure. If you\u2019d like, I\u2019ll help you clean next Saturday, too.\u201d Just as she glanced up, a wry smile covered his face. \u201cSince I have nothing better to do.\u201d</p><p>The back of her neck heated. At the time, she had meant what she\u2019d said, but now... \u201cI\u2019m sorry for saying that. I was angry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He leaned into her. The clean, male scent of his body invaded her senses His golden hair was dark where it was still damp from his shower. She wanted to run her fingers through it and almost had to sit on her hands to stop herself.</p><p>\u201cStill, it wasn\u2019t nice,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cI\u2019m not a nice man.\u201d</p><p>Rose lifted her own brow. \u201cReally? So not-nice men get up at the crack of dawn to help clean? Not-nice men let sleep-deprived aunts get naps? Not-nice men bring cheesecake?\u201d She placed her hand on his knee. \u201cNot-nice\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shot to his feet, dislodging her hand, and she blinked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d he said, his voice gruff. \u201cMassively so.\u201d</p><p>Searching his face, she found shadows under his eyes and weariness in the lines around his mouth. Despite his meeting and late night, he had worked his tail off for her and hadn\u2019t complained once. Well, if she didn\u2019t count his constant need to point out the huge flaw in decorating a house at the beach with beachy items.</p><p>\u201cDo vacationers really need to be reminded where they are?\u201d he had said, shuddering at a living room decorated with fishermen\u2019s nets and buoys. \u201cSand in awkward places not enough?</p><p>\u201cI need to turn in for the night, too. I have lots to do around the house tomorrow,\u201d she said with a crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSome of those are things that I can\u2019t do myself.\u201d</p><p>Briefly his eyes closed. When they opened, they were completely guarded. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning. Good night.\u201d He strode from the room.</p><p>Rose sighed and stretched out on the cushions of the sofa, flexing her toes and calves. Blackbeard jumped on her stomach and meowed. She teased his whiskers. \u201cWhat do you think of him?\u201d</p><p>Blackbeard kneaded her sweater and purred, completely content.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she said, stroking his back.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cIf you clean that one more time, the finish is going to come off.\u201d</p><p>The pot fell into the sink with a loud bang.</p><p>Crap, she\u2019d been caught. For the past thirty minutes, Rose had been staring out of the window over the kitchen sink while Sasha chopped wood. Ten minutes ago, he\u2019d taken off his shirt and her mouth had dried out. Five minutes ago he\u2019d stretched and flexed his arms and her knees had gone weak.</p><p>Cheeks heating, she dried her hands on the kitchen towel and turned to face her sister. \u201cHow long have you been standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough.\u201d Skye moved to stand beside her, giving Rose a quick hug. \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you. The view is amazing.\u201d</p><p>Rose couldn\u2019t fight the giggle. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s arms and shoulders glistened in the noon sun. The ax made a perfect arc before it split another piece of wood in half.</p><p>They both sighed.</p><p>\u201cMan-candy Sunday,\u201d Skye said dreamily, \u201cWe should sell tickets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d Rose smacked her sister with the towel.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d Skye held up her hands and scooted away. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to think of ways to pay off our back taxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, don\u2019t. Concentrate on school instead.\u201d</p><p>A slight flush filled Skye\u2019s freckled face. \u201cI want to apologize for the other day. You and Summer have always taken care of me, and I sounded like an ungrateful brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already forgotten about it, but thank you. Besides, you\u2019re the baby and it\u2019s our job to take care of you.\u201d Rose tapped her sister\u2019s nose.</p><p>Skye rolled her eyes.</p><p>They both turned back to the amazing view of Sasha doing shirtless manual labor.</p><p>A little sigh left Rose\u2019s mouth before she could stop it.</p><p>\u201cGo give him this.\u201d Skye handed her a glass of iced tea, giving her a little push toward the back door. \u201cI\u2019ll listen out for Ivy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess he could use something to cool off,\u201d Rose reasoned. \u201cHe\u2019s been out there for an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s chopped enough wood for a dozen fireplaces,\u201d Skye said, a knowing look on her face. \u201cWonder what kind of frustration he\u2019s working off?\u201d</p><p>Rose wasn\u2019t about to answer that question. She started for the door, then stopped and turned to face her sister. \u201cWhat are you doing here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Skye grinned. \u201cI was visiting a friend and something told me to come by.\u201d She gave Rose another push. \u201cQuit stalling and get out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d she mumbled and opened the door. Unseasonably warm air hit her face and bare arms as she walked outside. Brown grass stabbed the soles of her feet. How could she have forgotten her shoes?</p><p>Sasha entered her line of vision. Tanned skin and pierced nipples gleaming in the sun. His jeans hung low on his hips, making her want to trace the line of hair that she knew dipped out of sight.</p><p>Oh, right\u2014he was why she\u2019d forgotten her shoes.</p><p>The wind picked up when she was only a few feet away, blowing her hair forward. Sasha paused, then embedded the ax into a piece of wood and turned. \u201cHullo, Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She thrust the tea at him, misjudged the distance and ended up colliding with his chest. Tea sloshed over the sides, down his chest and her hand.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell, that\u2019s cold!\u201d His stomach contracted.</p><p>\u201cOh God, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop staring at the liquid as it made its way down his abdomen. Slowly, she wiped her hand on her skirt.</p><p>He pulled off one of his gloves, tossing it to the side before taking the glass from her. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you brought something to get this off of me.\u201d</p><p>Rose licked her bottom lip as she thought of licking the sweet liquid from his skin with her tongue. How\u2019d it would taste sweet and...she heard a sharp intake of breath and her eyes flew up to his.</p><p>In their mossy depths glinted amusement and desire. \u201cCare to share what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cNo, I mean, I\u2019ll go get you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it, love. No worries.\u201d He drank what was left of the tea and handed her the glass. \u201cMy thanks.\u201d Gesturing to the piles of wood, he asked, \u201cThis enough for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>He drew his brows together, still not wiping the tea from his skin. Dear God, would he wipe it away? She took a step forward, grabbed his shirt from the top of a stump and toweled him off. His hand came around hers, stopping her maniacal cleaning and taking away his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Skye\u2019s the one who wants to be a midwife, because your bedside manner leaves much to be desired.\u201d He shook the material out, making a face at the spots of tea.</p><p>\u201cMy...you\u2014wait, who told you that?\u201d She tilted her head to one side and gripped the glass. Ice melting made it slightly slippery.</p><p>She must have imagined the look of panic that registered in his eyes, because in her next heartbeat he was smooth as the body butter she sold in her store. \u201cJemma Leigh, who else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She shifted from one foot then the other while he stared at her, a small smile on his lips. The sun chose that moment to shine directly on his chest, highlighting his nipple rings. Annoyed, she glanced back at the house, spying her sister in the kitchen window with her hand over her mouth. Skye was laughing at her. Laughing and enjoying Rose\u2019s discomfort.</p><p>Rose narrowed her eyes. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>The rod holding the curtain fell sideways, obscuring her sister\u2019s view. A large cloud covered the sun. Rose heard a peal of laughter from the house and frowned.</p><p>\u201cWas that Skye?\u201d Sasha asked.</p><p>She turned back to him and nodded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need to check on her? It looks like the curtain rod nearly took her head off.\u201d He stared at the window, his brow furrowed as if he were trying to solve a puzzle.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d She made her way to the forcing house (a structure that most people would call a greenhouse.), entering through the gate and plucking a sprig of lavender. Once inside, she tucked the lavender in her hair and set the glass down on one of the many wooden tables. Like every Poppy Holland before her, Rose forced fruits, vegetables, flowers and herbs to grow out of season in order to make \u2018potions\u2019 and creams.</p><p>Familiar scents of rosemary, lemon verbena, and honeysuckle inundated her, settling her nerves. She took a deep breath and began checking the pots of herbs and flowers for insects, mold and dryness. Time seemed to fall away as she got into a groove of removing dead leaves and flower heads. Mentally, she sorted through the plants she needed to make her next batch of shampoo and conditioner: chamomile, aloe, and\u2014?</p><p>She glanced around, deciding on peaches. She picked a few and carefully placed them in a nearby basket before making a snack out of one. Snapping off a couple of mint leaves, she popped them in her mouth and picked up an empty watering can. The lemon verbena felt a little dry, and two containers of sage would have to be replaced soon.</p><p>\u201cIs this your hiding place?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Rose dropped the can. It bounced on the hard-packed earthen floor, a hollow sound echoing as it came to a stop at Sasha\u2019s feet. He held Ivy in his arms. The baby looked content as she snuggled against him.</p><p>Rose swallowed and closed the distance between them to pick up the watering can. \u201cI\u2019m not hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeditation room?\u201d</p><p>She bit back a smile as she stood. \u201cDid she just wake up?\u201d After setting the can down, she clapped her hands and held them out to Ivy. The baby smiled and leaned forward, arms waving.</p><p>\u201cI fed Ivy after my shower, but Skye took care of the whole diaper-changing affair.\u201d Sasha shuddered. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough money in the world to make me touch a diaper\u2014at least not without a hazmat suit, and those aren\u2019t flattering for my physique. Or anyone\u2019s, really.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This time Rose couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head to one side and lifted a brow.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sometimes it is.\u201d She dug her toes into the dirt and kissed Ivy\u2019s sweet curls. \u201cDid Skye leave?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout fifteen minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world have you and Ivy been doing?\u201d Rose hoisted Ivy up higher on her hip.</p><p>He examined a trellis laden with honeysuckle. \u201cWe debated wearing white after Labor Day. I let her win, of course.\u201d</p><p>It was easy to be dazzled by him, to be charmed and lulled. What wasn\u2019t easy was seeing who he belonged with. She tried her best to picture the woman who would capture his heart\u2014something that should\u2019ve been as easy as growing dandelions in the front yard. Maybe it only worked on the people in town. People she knew and had grown up with. People whose needs and wants were transparent as soon as they entered her store.</p><p>But Sasha...Rose lightly swayed from side to side, gently bouncing Ivy. Sasha was as mysterious as the Pamlico Sound at twilight.</p> <p>He meandered around the glass-enclosed building, pausing every so often to read labels or sniff at a flower. When he got to the strawberry plants, he turned to her. \u201cThese the same ones you set out for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d They were also the ones used to make strawberry wine. A wine thought to be an aphrodisiac, and had been sold as a love potion during the late eighteenth century. A wine that every Poppy Holland shared with her favorite lovers. Her cheeks flushed as their eyes met.</p><p>What Sasha wouldn\u2019t give to know what made her blush. \u201cHow much time do you spend in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite flower?\u201d Sasha asked, and she took a step toward the door. Beautiful blue eyes wary as hell. \u201cDon\u2019t leave. I only want to get to know my landlady a bit better. You\u2019ve already shared your favorite dessert with me.\u201d</p><p>Wariness gave way to a tentative smile. \u201cSunflowers. They have lots of uses. You can use the oil from the seeds for cooking, or applying directly to patches of rough skin. Paper can be made from them, even rope from their fibers.\u201d She bit her lip, her gaze darting over his face. \u201cI\u2019m boring you.\u201d</p> <p>Ivy squirmed in Rose\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cActually, I find you quite riveting.\u201d He leaned against a table and a cluster of white flowers caressed his face. He brushed the flowers away, then nodded to Ivy. \u201cWould you like for me to hold her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were saying.\u201d Her brows drew together and he smiled, gesturing to the neat row of sunflowers behind her. \u201cThe Swiss Army Knife of flora and fauna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, people think sunflowers follow the sun, but they don\u2019t\u2014not after the first few days.\u201d She shifted Ivy to her other hip. \u201cThey like to face east.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUseful information if I\u2019m ever lost.\u201d He scratched his chin, then looked down. A vine with purple flowers seemed to twine around his ankle. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Rose shake her head and the vine actually moved away from him. He jerked his head up, then blinked at the innocent look in Rose\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d been chopping wood in the sun for far too long.</p><p>She studied his face for a moment. \u201cDid you know that the seeds are said to relieve Whooping Cough and get rid of fevers? My momma used to give us a tonic of sunflower oil and water whenever we got sick. But I prefer to roast the seeds and eat them. My chickens like to eat the seeds when I\u2019m done. I mean, I didn\u2019t regurgitate them. I was talking about the other ones.\u201d She glanced away.</p><p>Ivy grabbed her hair and tried to shove it into her mouth.</p> <p>Dammit. He hadn\u2019t meant to embarrass her. He\u2019d only wanted to keep her with him longer, to truly get to know her. To find out all her secrets and where that damn spring was hiding. That was top on his list, of course. \u201cBrilliant. Now tell me what flower is really your favorite\u2014purely aesthetic. No medicinal uses like curing toad warts on a man\u2019s intestines.\u201d Gently, he helped untangle Rose\u2019s hair from the baby\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cFor that you\u2019d...Oh, you were joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a little,\u201d he replied and rubbed the back of his head.</p><p>She took a step forward, then another until she stood directly in front of him. Reaching out, she brushed away the white flowers that continued to smack him in the face. He shivered.</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Leaning forward, he bent his head to hers. The heady fragrance of jasmine filled his senses. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolets are my favorite.\u201d Her words were sweet and hot against his lips. The greenhouse grew hotter, more humid, and the flowers more fragrant, but nothing as potent as her. Rose\u2019s face seemed to glow and his heart thudded loudly in his chest. \u201cFlowers have a language of their own. Sometimes, I\u2019d rather talk to them than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>A bead of sweat trickled down his back. He should concentrate on something else. Anything. He looked for Ivy, but she wasn\u2019t in Rose\u2019s arms anymore. There was a pram near the door. Rose must have laid her down. White flowers brushed his face again, directing his attention back to the lovely vision standing so close.</p><p>Swallowing, he said, \u201cAnd what do violets say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be yours.\u201d A cluster of pink flowers touched her shoulder, then grazed the top of her breasts. Her lashes lowered, hiding her beautiful eyes from him.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered and an image formed in his head. One of him gently laying her down on a thick carpet of flower petals on the floor, sinking his hands into her hair, and kissing\u2014</p><p>A cold breeze hit him and he blinked, stunned to find his arms holding air and Rose by the door with Ivy on her hip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too hot for her to stay in here long.\u201d She turned and walked through the doorway. The white gate closed behind her with a distinctive click.</p><p>\u201cAnd for me,\u201d he mumbled. He was hot as hell and painfully aroused.</p><p>He started to follow Rose and nearly tripped on the vines at his feet. Kicking them away, he moved to the door. Blackbeard met him at the gate, a reproachful look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d he told the cat as he made his way back to the house.</p><p>After jogging up the few stairs on the back porch, he strode through the kitchen and took the grand staircase two steps at a time. In record time, he\u2019d changed into his trainers and a pair of sweatpants. Rose and Ivy were nowhere to be found as he moved through the house, making his way to the front door.</p><p>\u201cTime to start doing what I came here for,\u201d he said and began to run.</p><p>And plan.</p><p>Sasha stood in his \u201cnew\u201d store, staring out of the dusty window. The faded vinyl letters of \u2018Retro Dayz\u2019 in no way obscured his view of Carolina Dreams.</p><p>Men and women went in and out of Rose\u2019s shop all day long. With his door propped open, he could hear the bells ring every time her sunny door opened.</p><p>In order to look like he was actually doing something, he\u2019d brought his laptop and sat down in a wildly leaning to one side rolling desk chair at the old counter. As he ordered new equipment and sent emails to friends asking for donations, he kept one eye on Carolina Dreams.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how she did it. It seemed as though Rose was always moving, always helping someone. Sometimes with Ivy in her arms. Not until a little after one in the afternoon did traffic to her store finally die down.</p><p>A group of four women\u2014including Jemma Leigh\u2014exited Rose\u2019s shop, their laughter carrying to him. To his amazement Rose trailed behind them, but she stopped to prop open her door with a big pot of some kind of green plants with huge red flowers.</p><p>\u201cCome to lunch with us, Rose,\u201d Jemma Leigh said with a smile.</p><p>Rose froze in place.</p><p>Sasha stood, moving to the window to get a closer look. Why did Rose look so surprised at the invitation? She had to have girlfriends\u2014all women did.</p><p>\u201cOh please come,\u201d An auburn haired woman wearing square glasses said. \u201cMaybe you could give Christina a love hint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSage Caswell!\u201d Christina said, a blush forming on her cheeks as she lightly bumped her friend with her hip. \u201cWell, my momma swears by your family. So whatever help you can give me, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>A smile began to tilt Rose\u2019s lips at the corners, but the fourth in their quartet banished it. \u201cNot with that baby,\u201d the brunette with straight brown hair snapped. \u201cThis is my one day without kids.\u201d</p><p>Sasha narrowed his eyes at the self-centered women. \u201cRose never gets a day without kids,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>Rose turned to Christiana. \u201cIt\u2019s Jacob Mansell.\u201d</p><p>Christina smiled and clapped her hands together, then reached out to hug Rose.</p><p>Quickly side-stepping the woman, Rose tucked a loose curl behind her ear and grabbed the sign by the door, repositioning it. \u201cY\u2019all have fun.\u201d She disappeared into her shop.</p><p>Sage frowned. \u201cYou really know how to make a person feel welcome.\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh punched the brunette in the shoulder. \u201cWay to go, Bernice.\u201d</p><p>Bernice rubbed her shoulder, leading the way as the group of women followed. \u201dI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so hell-bent on her coming, Sage. It\u2019s not like you and Joaquin worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to apologize to Rose before I do more than hit you on your shoulder,\u201d Sage said, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cYou tell her, Sage,\u201d Sasha said, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for\u2014Oh, my God\u2014did a bird just poop in my hair?\u201d Bernice patted her hair, coming away with some whitish-gray goop in her hand. She let out a screech.</p><p>A little blue bird swooped down, finding a spot on the awning over Carolina Dreams\u2019 door. It twittered joyfully, and Sasha\u2019s jaw dropped. He swung his gaze back to the foursome, entirely satisfied to see the other three women laughing at Bernice.</p><p>Rose peeked out of her door, her eyes widening as she clamped a hand over her mouth. He kept himself from laughing, worried that she\u2019d hear him and know he was spying on her.</p><p>However, he couldn\u2019t stop the ache that began to form in his chest when her hand fell away and the longing on her face as the women walked around the corner eclipsed the sunny afternoon.</p><p>Sasha squeezed the stuffed rabbit he bought Ivy, making it squeak, and the baby squealed with delight.</p><p>Ivy\u2019s dark brown eyes crinkled at the corners as she drooled and babbled. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll lure me in with those ridiculous lashes. I\u2019m made of sterner stuff,\u201d he said, but then the baby just had to smile at him. And his heart lurched.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too old for you, baby girl,\u201d Rose said, sitting down on the faded rug beside him and handing him a cup of green tea.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He leaned against the sofa and stretched his legs out on either side of Ivy\u2019s blanket. Rose grabbed Ivy just as she tried to eat his sock and placed her back in the middle. \u201cYou\u2019re quite good at the whole mummy thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaptism by fire,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI was scared to death, but now...\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward to set the tea on the coffee table, then settled against the couch again. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I feel guilty because I don\u2019t want Summer to come back. I want to keep Ivy forever,\u201d she said with a little hitch to her voice. Her eyes glistened with unshed tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do what\u2019s best for Ivy.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t insult her by saying everything would be okay. That she\u2019d be okay. That maybe Summer wouldn\u2019t come back after all and Rose could keep Ivy forever.</p><p>Life wasn\u2019t fair, because if it were, he\u2019d still have his dad and a mother who wasn\u2019t in a coma. He wouldn\u2019t be a pawn in his uncle\u2019s schemes. He wouldn\u2019t be a villain. One that was sitting on the floor with the woman who\u2019d saved him while he plotted against her and all that she cherished.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She swiped a finger across her lashes, then a smile curved her sweet lips. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>Blackbeard slunk into the room, his bushy tail hitting Sasha in the leg. The cat eyed a half-eaten slice of cheese cake. He jumped on top of the scratched coffee table to inspect it closer.</p><p>Sasha gave the cat a mock grimace and shook the rabbit at him. \u201cI can tell you where that damn cat\u2019s been. In my bed and under my covers, making himself at home. I\u2019ve been choking on cat hair. That beast of yours likes to sleep on my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby.\u201d Rose laughed and his heart turned over. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a little over a week.\u201d</p><p>It seemed a lot longer to him. Maybe because he spent every night listening to the sounds of her humming to Ivy. Of her asking about his day, his store, and what he wanted to eat that night. Watching as she ventured out of her shop and over to his, bringing him lunch, but never staying to eat with him. As she picked flowers and talked to Blackbeard as if he were human.</p><p>As he searched for weakness and only found his own.</p><p>Not once had she mentioned the \u201creal\u201d Holland Springs and not once had he asked her.</p><p>In the fireplace, a blazing fire crackled and snapped while the sounds of indie rockers lamenting their love lives, but not their unfortunate fashion choices (which never failed to boggle Sasha\u2019s mind) filled the silence.</p><p>\u201cLooks like she\u2019s feeling much better.\u201d This morning, when Ivy had woken up with a fever and Rose had been frantic, he\u2019d volunteered to go to Palm Island and clean so Rose would have one less thing to worry about. She\u2019d given him another one of her tight hugs in thanks, and he\u2019d driven to the ferry, happy as lunatic\u2014again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDr. Reed said kids do that. One minute they\u2019re sick, and the next they\u2019re bouncing off the walls. Or trying to eat socks.\u201d She patted Ivy\u2019s diaper-covered bottom affectionately before settling back against the sofa.</p><p>Unable to help himself, he shifted his hips so that they were fully touching hers. She didn\u2019t move away.</p><p>A log in the fireplace popped loudly, and the fire grew brighter, hotter. As did his skin. His desire for her.</p> <p>He clutched the stuffed rabbit in his hand like his life depended on it. She wasn\u2019t looking for a lover; she wanted a friend. Someone to talk to. There were many things he didn\u2019t know about Rose, but he knew for certain she was a lonely woman raising a child that wasn\u2019t hers. He also knew she was sweet, strong, and smart. And lovely. So lovely it made his gut clench every time he looked at her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been lying when he told her that she was all he could see. Half the time he wasn\u2019t aware she wore clothes. He was too busy trying not to do something spectacularly stupid like kiss her. Or pay off her back taxes and flee the country.</p><p>She leaned her head against his shoulder as if it were the most natural thing in the world. The scent of jasmine filled his senses and for a moment he belonged to her. To Ivy. To this house.</p><p>They turned toward each other at the same time, her breast brushing his arm. He became impossibly hard. Cherry lips parted and her lids half closed. The sweetest invitation to a kiss. And, God help them both, he wanted to pull her beneath him and kiss her until time ceased to exist.</p><p>\u201cSasha,\u201d she breathed and leaned forward, tilting her chin up.</p> <p>The barest touch of her lips to his froze him in place. Feathery kisses became more substantial, more urgent. Yes, his body seemed to sigh, this is the woman for you.</p><p>He murmured her name against her mouth and she took advantage, sliding her tongue inside and rubbing it against his. She tasted of tea and mint, and of all things Rose. All things good and pure. Everything he\u2019d never be, no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>Her hands slowly moved up his thighs, the pressure light and tantalizing. She slid them under his wool sweater, brushing his abdomen and making it contract. Her very clever\u2014he groaned\u2014fingers found his nipple rings and tugged. His cock surged, growing harder, thicker, and longer against the zipper of his trousers.</p><p>She kissed along the side of his jaw and down to his neck, his pulse beating rapidly as her tongue lightly flicked him there. Every muscle in his body was on high alert, ready to spring into action. Cool air hit his pecs as his sweater went over his head and was tossed on the sofa behind him. Silky curls glided over his bare skin and he moaned.</p><p>She licked his nipple, circled it with her tongue and licked him again before drawing it and his piercing into her mouth. She nibbled at him with her teeth and soothed the pleasurable pain with her tongue.</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d Her breath was a hot whisper against his wet flesh.</p> <p>This was so wrong. So incredibly, fantastically wrong. He would be the biggest bastard in the world if he took advantage of her. He scooted away before she could do more, before he could do more, still holding the bunny. He was...shaken\u2014as if that had been his first time with a woman.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he said, jumping to his feet and tossing the stuffed animal in Rose\u2019s lap. Striding over to the back door, he yanked his coat off of a hook on the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have on your sweater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>She joined him at the door. \u201cBut it\u2019s cold and nasty outside.\u201d She put her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugged it away.</p><p>Where the hell were his shoes? \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said softly, her elegant brows drawing together.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck. He owed her an explanation, but there was no way he\u2019d jeopardize his mother. He was treading a fine line as it were. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let that happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there someone else?\u201d</p><p>God, he wished that were the problem. No matter how hard he tried to talk himself into a relationship with another woman, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. Not one damn time. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I...\u201d Her eyes became shadowed.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>A decent man would have told her the truth, or at least said something along the lines of \u2018I\u2019m not taking advantage of you when you\u2019re vulnerable.\u2019 But he wasn\u2019t a decent man. \u201cYou just think you\u2019re supposed to act like this,\u201d he said in frustration, and she jerked back as if he\u2019d physically wounded her.</p><p>\u201cHe told you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d When he didn\u2019t answer she smacked her hand against her pajama bottoms. Ones that had small cats with Santa hats on them. They were too short for her, riding up at the ankles. He didn\u2019t want to know how long she\u2019d had them. He didn\u2019t want to know that she didn\u2019t have a soul in this world willing to stand up for her.</p><p>\u201cJason alluded to it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rounded and her mouth fell open. \u201cYou believed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe indicated that Summer is the, er, popular one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you defend her?\u201d</p><p>For the love of God. He waved his coat at her, then threw it on the countertop. \u201cJesus, Rose, you\u2019re taking care of her baby. One that was abandoned by your sister. According to you, she doesn\u2019t know who the bloody father is.\u201d</p><p>She fisted her hands on her sweet hips. \u201cI meant I didn\u2019t know where he was, not who he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer didn\u2019t say, and I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>As if that made it any better. As if he had any right to judge. He let his head fall back for a moment, then groaned. \u201cThis is so fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, because you got the wrong Holland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter which one of you I got,\u201d he shouted and Ivy let out a cry. Feeling like a complete ass, he practically ran to the baby, lifting her gently and holding her close. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl. It\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispered, trying to soothe her.</p><p>\u201cGive her to me.\u201d</p><p>He turned and handed her Ivy. \u201cHow about we keep our contact limited, yes? You be my landlord and I\u2019ll be your tenant. That way there\u2019s no confusion or kisses or any other misunderstandings that haven\u2019t happened yet.\u201d He snagged his sweater and jerked it over his head.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Stormy eyes pinned him with her glare. The wind kicked up, gusting hard against the house. Cold air seeped through the floorboards. \u201cAs your landlord, I\u2019m telling you to park your Mercedes on the left side of the porch. The right side is mine.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a mocking bow. \u201cConsider it done.\u201d</p><p>After she left the room, he had the absurd notion to chase her down and lie prostrate at her feet while begging for forgiveness. In under five minutes, he\u2019d managed to wipe out a budding friendship. A tentative trust. The look in her beautiful eyes would haunt him until he was old and gray.</p><p>He sat down heavily in a chair at the kitchen table and propped his head up in his hands. \u201cLess of a guilty conscience, mate,\u201d he told himself.</p><p>Too bad it didn\u2019t make him feel any better.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>For the past week, it had been raining in a freezing, steady flow from gray skies. Cars and trucks carefully inched along Broad Street, water high on each side as it splashed the sidewalks. No one ventured out much to do any shopping or eating. Carolina Dreams had had its slowest week yet which should have bothered Rose, but she was too hurt and angry to care.</p><p>The dismal weather matched her mood to a T. Looking back on that night, she knew she shouldn\u2019t have kissed him. Shouldn\u2019t have put her hands on his muscular, lean body and taken his nipple rings in her mouth.</p><p>She dropped her head into her hands, her cheeks heating. But she had ached for him. He had tasted so good. So male. So Sasha.</p><p>Only he had rejected her. Heck, he hadn\u2019t even touched her. He\u2019d sat there unmoving, unaffected. Well, not completely unaffected. Her fingers had glided past the shape of his penis. His very hard and enormous erection.</p><p>She let her head fall to her desk with a thud. What was worse, he\u2019d confirmed her biggest fear. Her biggest insecurity. He hadn\u2019t cared which Holland he\u2019d found, and a small part of her wondered if he\u2019d actually wanted Summer all along, but like Jason, had settled for Rose. The average sister. The one who didn\u2019t live up to her reputation.</p><p>Maybe that had been the real reason why she and Sasha had never finished what they started. Only he\u2019d been too polite to say it.</p><p>So far she\u2019d managed to avoid Sasha, making sure she left before he did in the morning. No small feat since they lived together and she had to pack up the entire house to travel anywhere with Ivy.</p><p>She\u2019d eaten dinner in Ivy\u2019s nursery, then headed downstairs to clean up after she\u2019d heard him turn in for the night. Only he\u2018d beaten her to it. Then he\u2019d come with her to Palm Island again, helping her clean and playing with the baby.</p><p>Despite this, their conversations were whittled down to innocuous statements like, \u201cI\u2019ll clean the kitchen while you vacuum the living room,\u201d or, \u201cPass the salt.\u201d</p><p>Of course he talked to Ivy. He made silly faces and had the most ridiculous conversations with her. And of course, Ivy babbled and kicked her feet at his attentions. He even sat in the back of the car beside her on the way there and back.</p><p>A small ding coming from her computer\u2019s speakers made her head snap up. She clicked on her inbox, read the new message, and blinked. Then she read it again and jumped up, sending her chair sliding across the room.</p><p>She danced around the office with the biggest smile on her face while Ivy watched in fascination. \u201cI can pay my back taxes,\u201d she said in a sing-song voice. \u201cWe get to keep everything!\u201d</p><p>She had to tell Skye. After two years of submitting her information and jumping through hoop after hoop, the biggest natural supplier of beauty products on the East Coast was offering her a contract. A huge one. All she had to do was meet their deadline.</p><p>The bells hanging on the front door of Carolina Dreams rang and Rose quickly stepped to the counter. She smiled at the sight of her sister and then frowned at Skye\u2019s anxious face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here,\u201d Skye said, then ducked into the office.</p><p>Tristan Reed barged in, his gray eyes glittering. \u201cSkye Holland, get your red head in here and tell me why you drove off another one of my patients.\u201d</p><p>Open-mouthed, Rose stared at him. His jet black eyebrows drew together in frustration when he found the store empty.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he growled, his usually starched shirt rumpled and his hair sticking out all over his head like little ebony spikes. \u201cI saw her run in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019m not here,\u201d Skye said in a loud stage whisper, and Rose winced.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d Rose said lamely.</p><p>Tristan\u2019s jaw worked. \u201cHas she always been like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pig-headed, stubborn-ass woman.\u201d</p><p>Skye gasped and popped out of the office. \u201cJust because you have too much water in your spirit doesn\u2019t mean you can take out your imbalance on me.\u201d</p><p>Tristan scrubbed his face. \u201cAnd just because I\u2019m half Chinese doesn\u2019t mean I believe that superstitious stuff. Or eat sushi and do karaoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you took me on a date to Mr. Lee\u2019s All You Can Eat Sushi and Karaoke Bar last week,\u201d Skye pointed out, oblivious to the visible tic forming on Tristan\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou ate salmon rolls and sang an old Backstreet Boys song.\u201d She turned to Rose and added, \u201cI think it might have been the sake.\u201d</p><p>Tristan\u2019s face grew dark and he spun on his heel, striding to the front of the store. He slammed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Rose asked. How in the world had she not known that Skye and Tristan were dating?</p><p>\u201cA little misunderstanding, that\u2019s all. He\u2019ll be over it by supper time,\u201d Skye said with a dismissive wave of her hand.</p><p>Suddenly giddy as she remembered the email, Rose motioned Skye back to the office and pointed to her computer screen. \u201cRead this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she squealed, and hugged Rose tight. \u201cThis is awesome.\u201d</p><p>They danced around the room, taking turns re-reading the email out loud, and laughing until tears were falling from their eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best day ever,\u201d Rose said, picking up Ivy and kissing her head. \u201cWell, almost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to ship out our back supplies and make some more of your cellulite cream and body butter. Shampoo. Conditioner. Bubble bath. Everything,\u201d Skye said with a laugh.</p><p>The bells rang again.</p><p>Luke Ambrose strode inside. The handsome doctor was back in town, finally finished with his reality series called \u2018Dr. LA\u2019, even though it was filmed in Miami. According to his sister, Zoe, it was a running joke in their family.</p><p>\u201cHi, Luke. How are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop making Lily\u2019s shower stuff for Carson Russell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarson Russell doesn\u2019t shop here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>Rose canted her head side to side, mentally searching her customer list. \u201cUnless she orders it online, but I don\u2019t have any local customers who do that.\u201d</p><p>Luke pulled out his wallet and placed a black American Express card on the counter. \u201cGive me whatever you have that doesn\u2019t smell good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I have what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d Rose didn\u2019t think Luke meant to be insulting, but she could never be too cautious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Skye stayed quiet as she took Ivy out of Rose\u2019s arms.</p><p>Luke mussed his hair with his free hand. \u201cAh, hell, honey. I\u2019m not trying to insult you. I just can\u2019t have her smelling like her on our dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmell like who?\u201d</p> <p>His dark eyes glittered. \u201cHer her.\u201d</p><p>Rose took a breath and tried again. \u201cCarson or Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarson. No, Lily.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want Carson to smell like Lily,\u201d he said, wandering over to the section of women\u2019s body lotions, gels, and bath salts.</p><p>She joined him, picking up a baby blue and green bottle. \u201cTry this: apple blossom with sweat pea. Lily\u2019s is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGardenia and lavender,\u201d he said, surprising her. The two hadn\u2019t been together for the past five years, yet he remembered what Lily liked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, and since she\u2019s been back in town, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke croaked.</p><p>Rose suppressed a smile. \u201cLily\u2019s back in town. She bought Dance to the Beat from Tempe Yoder last month. Didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>His mouth formed a straight line before he spoke. \u201cNo.\u201d He plucked the bottle out of her hands, dug his free hand into his pocket, and threw some cash on the counter. \u201cKeep the change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want your card?\u201d Skye called out, waving it in the air like a flag, but Luke was already in his fancy sports car and pulling out of his parking spot.</p><p>Rose turned to Skye and shook her head in disbelief. \u201cHas the full moon got their testosterone levels all testosterone-y?\u201d</p> <p>Skye snorted, then her eyes widened. \u201cDon\u2019t look now, but your favorite Englishman is headed this way and looking none too happy.\u201d</p><p>Rose leaned to the side and watched as Sasha crossed the street. He looked like the devil was on his heels and was mad as hellfire. \u201cOh, yay,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Boxes had been streaming in and out of his shop in an endless parade since last week. She had heard through the grapevine known as Jemma Leigh, Skye, and Evangeline Ambrose that Sasha was hosting a star-studded fundraiser at the Collins\u2019 home on Halloween.</p><p>Their poor door bounced against the wall and one of the bells fell to the floor with a clank as he strode inside.</p><p>Sasha stopped in front of her, so close that she could see the rough stubble on his cheeks and above his kissable top lip. Green eyes glinted like gemstones while fury rolled off of him in great waves. \u201cDid you say yes to him?\u201d</p><p>What was it with men and their random questions that they only knew who the subject was about? \u201cTo whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb with me, Rosebud.\u201d The front door slammed shut, even though no one was around to close it. The fine hairs on Sasha\u2019s arms rose under his sweater.</p><p>\u201cWant to try that again?\u201d Rose\u2019s hands fisted at her sides.</p> <p>The wind gusted and the chimes hanging from the ceiling danced. Bad insulation\u2014that was the problem. There was always an explanation when it came to the supposedly supernatural events that surrounded the Hollands.</p><p>\u201cTristan Reed,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. He had heard that the doctor was breaking years of Holland Springs\u2019 tradition by bringing one of the Holland women to Lorelei and Harrison Collins\u2019 home. No Holland had been welcome there since the Great Depression. According to Jemma Leigh, it was over Poppy Holland seducing Harrison Collins\u2019 great-grandfather on his wedding day.</p><p>\u201cAbout rescheduling Ivy\u2019s check-up?\u201d Rose stared at him like he\u2019d grown horns.</p><p>Sasha wanted to rip his hair out. \u201cNo, my fundraiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d she said with a toss of her head. Black curls tumbled around her shoulders in disarray, tempting him to run his hands through them to see if they still felt as soft as he remembered.</p><p>It had been seven days since he\u2019d last touched her or she him. Not to mention he was no closer to finding that infernal hidden spring than he\u2019d been before. But at the moment, none of that mattered. \u201cAre you going to my party as Tristan Reed\u2019s date?\u201d</p><p>Rose laughed, but there was no mirth in it. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the rumor. But just in case you haven\u2019t, my kind isn\u2019t welcomed there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich kind?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She crossed her arms. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Now he was the one confused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with Tristan,\u201d Skye said softly.</p><p>Rose grabbed her cross pendant and turned around. \u201cYou are? Oh, okay,\u201d he heard her say in that falsely bright tone he\u2019d come to recognize and hate. Hate because it meant that her feelings were hurt.</p><p>\u201cOh, Rose, I was going to tell you.\u201d Skye laid a hand on her sister\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll have the best time. Momma always said their house was really pretty,\u201d Rose added, as though she hadn\u2019t heard a word Skye said. Then she straightened her spine and walked away, disappearing into her little office.</p><p>Sasha started for her, but Skye stepped in front of him. \u201cYou need to leave her alone right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s pouting,\u201d he snapped, not really meaning it. He wanted to comfort her.</p><p>Ivy turned her head at the sound of his voice and gave him a toothless grin. \u201cAt least you\u2019re happy to see me.\u201d But he was too aggravated at her mother\u2014her aunt\u2014her whatever to hold her right now. \u201cWe\u2019ll play later. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s hazel eyes hardened. \u201cHow would you feel if everyone in town was invited to something and you weren\u2019t? Year after year after year. It\u2019s a really big deal to go there. Not that I care about those things. Every girl in Holland Springs gets to go to their annual party for their eighteenth birthday. It\u2019s like a debutante ball or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not Rose,\u201d he said, closing his eyes for a moment.</p><p>\u201cEspecially not Rose,\u201d she said, making her way behind the counter with the baby.</p><p>He drew his brows together. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Skye looked him over. \u201cIf you want to know, try talking to Rose like a normal person. Not like some caveman with his chest all puffed out because he was jealous his woman was being claimed by another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould a caveman wear Ferragamo?\u201d he asked, gesturing at his shoes.</p><p>\u201cI noticed you didn\u2019t deny being jealous or that she\u2019s your woman,\u201d Skye said with a smirk.</p><p>So had he. \u201cWhat\u2019s a bloke to do?\u201d he growled, sounding exactly like a caveman while rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>Skye groaned. \u201cAre you really going to make me spell it out for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever any good at reading between the lines, dear,\u201d he said. Actually, he was exceptionally good at it.</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d she huffed. \u201cAsk her yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite her a note. Email her. Text her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have her number,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Skye rolled her eyes, clearly exasperated by him. \u201cThen get a plane and write it in the sky. Give her gifts, and not man gifts, either. Show her you\u2019re sorry for being an ass.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow at her. \u201cHow do you know it was my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re male, aren\u2019t you?\u201d With that parting shot, Skye joined Rose in the office.</p><p>Sasha headed back to his store. The one without a name, but at the moment he didn\u2019t care. He had to make things right with Rose. He had to find that damn spring. He needed to check up on his mum.</p><p>All last week, he\u2019d searched Rose\u2019s property under the guise of working out. It wasn\u2019t too much of a deception since running was his favorite form of exercise.</p><p>Make that his second favorite. And in five more weeks he could indulge in that form of exercise until he passed out or got arrested for committing illegal carnal acts with a woman or two. Or five. He smiled grimly.</p><p>Neatly dodging the UPS guy as he brought in another box, Sasha made his way back to his office. He slumped down in his chair and drummed his fingers on his desk. What did one bring to a woman like Rose? One that when asked if he could do anything for her had requested cheesecake. Cheesecake.</p><p>A pop-up ad for a fast food chain blinked at him, its chicken mascot flapping its wings and doing the running man while wearing high-top sneakers. He leaned forward, intent on x-ing the damn thing out when he stopped short. Instead he leaned back and crossed his arms behind his head. He propped up his feet and smiled.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Sasha spit out a feather and turned right onto the gravel road leading to Strawberry Grove. Driving covered in feathers hadn\u2019t been how he envisioned showing up at Rose\u2019s front door. As he parked the Mercedes, a loose chicken half jumped and half flew over the back seat and landed in his lap. Beady black eyes looked menacingly up at him and its sharp nails dug into his wool pants.</p><p>Apparently, Farmer Johnson had taken Sasha for a fool when he\u2019d given him Rose\u2019s chickens in a large box and assured him that they would stay in it. More feathers floated around him and he sneezed. Apparently, Farmer Johnson would be correct. He was a fool, perhaps love\u2019s fool, but it didn\u2019t signify. He had to get Rose to trust him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about ruining my trousers, or you\u2019ll become tonight\u2019s dinner,\u201d he warned.</p><p>The chicken pecked his hand and stumbled to the passenger side. The rest of the fowl\u2019s brethren made congratulatory squawking sounds.</p><p>\u201cSorry little buggers,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He waved his hand in the air as he looked around. Rose\u2019s Jeep was parked in its usual spot, and he could just make out the faint glow coming from the kitchen through the formal dining room\u2019s windows. Perfect.</p><p>Cutting off the engine, he deliberated the best way to get the live cargo out of his car. Finally, he settled for quick dashes to the chicken coop until they were all safely inside. He rolled his head to one side and then the other. He was tired and sore. Chicken wrangling was not an occupation he was cut out for.</p><p>He opened the front door, sidestepping Blackbeard, and made a quick stop at the loo to wash up before heading toward the woman that made his heart beat faster in his chest. Tonight he was going to ask her to be his date to the fundraiser at the Collins\u2019 house next week. He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. No one would know it was her. Halloween themes tended to bring out masks and naughty costumes, especially in women.</p><p>\u201cHi...\u201d Rose\u2019s mouth dropped open and she stopped mid-plate placement when he ambled in. She quickly lowered her eyes, biting back an obvious smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d he asked, knowing full well he had at least a hundred feathers sticking to his hair and clothes.</p><p>Rose moved the fork and knife closer to the china and adjusted the position of the glass. It looked like a million down pillows had exploded and he\u2019d been in the blast zone.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, sneaking another glance. A tiny feather fell on his nose and his eyes crossed to look at it. She burst out laughing. Looking up at him, she placed a hand over her stomach and pointed to the mirror in the foyer. \u201cGo take a look at yourself.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his golden hair and plucked out a couple of feathers. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that feathers are all the rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople pay good money for clothes made out of feathers?\u201d she asked, laughing harder. She wasn\u2019t mad at him anymore. For the first time in months she could see the light at the end of the tunnel and her entire soul felt light. The contract from Barbara\u2019s Bugs had seen to that.</p><p>The mischievous look in his eyes made her stop laughing and her pulse triple its beat.</p><p>\u201cI think this would look better on you,\u201d he said in a rough voice. He took a step forward and then another, and before she knew it, he was chasing her around the table.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put that on me. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s been,\u201d she said, running to the little family room connected to the kitchen and skirting the baby swing that rocked a deeply sleeping Ivy.</p><p>\u201cHush, you\u2019ll wake the baby.\u201d He grinned and feinted left.</p><p>She let out a shriek and ran. Just as she rounded the sofa, he tackled her and they pitched forward onto the cushions. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d she said, trying to buck him off.</p><p>A feather tickled her nose and she giggled while he said, \u201cIf that were true, you wouldn\u2019t be laughing.\u201d</p><p>She managed to elbow him in the gut and this time he tickled her ear. \u201cStop,\u201d she said, and giggled again.</p><p>This was so silly; they were silly. And she loved it. She\u2019d never been able to be silly. To be a teenager or even a woman in her early twenties. For once she gave herself permission to laugh and tease a very attractive man who was pressing his very delicious weight against hers. She could feel every hard muscle of his chest against her back. His powerful thighs against hers. If the sofa hadn\u2019t been in the way, she would have melted into a puddle on the floor.</p><p>\u201cIf you promise to behave, I\u2019ll give you a surprise,\u201d he said, his hot breath coating the ear he\u2019d just tickled, sending little tingles down her neck.</p><p>\u201cIf you promise to behave, I won\u2019t elbow you again,\u201d she panted, wriggling again and pressing her bottom against his groin. The hard length of him made her want to moan. \u201cIs that my surprise?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe what she\u2019d just said. She never said things like that.</p><p>He scrambled off of her and stood.</p><p>She sat up, looking everywhere but him. Ivy slept on, blissfully unaware of the complete fool Rose had made out of herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the mood for omelets tonight,\u201d he said, his voice low.</p><p>He wanted to talk about food? She looked up at him in confusion. \u201cThere\u2019s some eggs in the fridge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnes from your chickens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I sold them, remember?\u201d A feather floated in front of her and landed in her lap. Was that a chicken\u2019s... She jumped to her feet. \u201cYou bought me chickens?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a genuine smile. One that threw her off balance. \u201cNot just any chickens. Your chickens.\u201d</p> <p>She ran to the back porch, not bothering to grab her coat. Throwing the door open, she ran outside and didn\u2019t stop until she got to the chicken coop. She watched in disbelief as Colonel Sanders and company strutted and pecked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he brought them back,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhile I can\u2019t believe what they did to my leather seats,\u201d Sasha said, his shoes crunching the half-frozen grass as he walked.</p><p>She whirled around and grabbed his hands, squeezing them tight. She wanted to kiss and hug him, then dance around her backyard like a deliriously happy fool. \u201cI\u2019ll clean them for you. I have a recipe for cleaning that gets just about anything out.\u201d She let go when he hissed and grimaced. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He held his hand up for her inspection and pointed to a nasty looking scratch. \u201cThe big red one got me. I can\u2019t die a horrible death from this, can I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tugged his hand down and kissed the scratch. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch, but it\u2019s getting colder.\u201d He drew her along, threading his fingers through hers as they strolled to the house.</p><p>He held the door open, letting her go first. Instead of sitting at the table, he joined her at the sink, waiting for his turn to wash his hands. While she filled up glasses with ice and tea, he began taking bowls of steaming mashed potatoes and rolls to the table. Then he grabbed the glasses, winking at her as he did.</p><p>Turning from the counter with a platter of fried chicken, she almost bumped into him. Her face heated as they did the little side to side shuffle and tried to get out of the other\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Sasha said with a grin, and let her slip past.</p><p>She set the platter in the middle of the table. He pulled out her chair, gesturing for her to sit, and when she was comfortable, he finally took his own seat.</p> <p>Suddenly shy, she focused on eating. The sound of silverware hitting the table with a thud made her jump and her eyes flew to his face.</p><p>His cheeks were flushed, highlighting the startling green color of his eyes. \u201cAre we back to this again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2014I don\u2019t what to say.\u201d She lowered her lashes and stared at the mostly empty plate in front of her.</p><p>A strong masculine hand covered hers. \u201cLook, I\u2019m doing my damnedest to apologize, sweetheart. Nothing more. And you owe me nothing.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and studied his sexy face. The slash of his high cheekbones, his sensual lips and square jaw. He was an extremely beautiful man, and he knew it. But right here, right now, he looked sincere. The little voice of warning in her head was quiet. Taking a chance, she gave him a little smile. \u201cA damned good job, I think.\u201d</p><p>Raising his brows, he gave her a cheeky smile back. \u201cGood enough to attend the fundraiser as my date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she hedged, not wanting to reveal the true reason that she wouldn\u2019t be welcome at there. However, she was always welcomed at Harrison Collins\u2019 bank. Or at least in his private office in the back. She inwardly cringed at the memory of having to beg him for a loan. He\u2019d been the one man she swore she\u2019d never go to for anything. Not even if she was on fire and he was the only person on earth with a bucket of water.</p><p>Sasha gave her hand a gentle squeeze. \u201cNo one will know it\u2019s you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMasks, love, and naughty costumes.\u201d He grinned and wiggled his eyebrows. \u201cYou would be unrecognizable.\u201d His eyes roamed her face as his hand left hers to gently tug at a wayward curl. \u201cPerhaps not. These are too distinctive.\u201d</p><p>Patting one side of her head, she tried to smooth her hair down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, your hair is lovely.\u201d He caught her hand with his free one. Holding both of her hands in his, he lifted them to his lips and gave them a tender kiss. \u201cYou work too hard, Rose. Go out with me tomorrow night. I\u2019ll pay for a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>Something broke inside of her. \u201cI\u2019ll go\u2014\u201d A look of triumph covered his face and she managed to press her hands against his mouth before he could talk. \u201c\u2014out with you,\u201d she clarified, \u201cbut not any place fancy. I don\u2019t have anything to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll dress to match,\u201d he drawled in that sexy voice of his, and she laughed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about a babysitter. I\u2019ll get Skye to do it. She doesn\u2019t have to work tomorrow night,\u201d she said, drawing her hands away. She placed them in her lap, twisting and untwisting the cloth napkin she\u2019d placed there.</p><p>He slid back his chair and began clearing the table. \u201cI\u2019ll start washing up the dishes.\u201d</p><p>It took no time at all to clean and put everything back in its place. Rose wrung out the dishcloth and straddled it along the sink, then turned to face him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Sasha shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll turn in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Rose blurted, and his brows shot to his hairline. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cWas there something you wanted?\u201d</p><p>She bit the side of her lip. \u201cCan I show you something? It\u2019s kind of a secret...well, my secret, but anyway, want to come exploring with me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes shuttered, and for a moment she was sure he was going to say no, but a smile crept back on his face. \u201cSounds fantastic.\u201d</p><p>She snagged the baby monitor off of the counter and motioned him over with a wave of her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you want to do this, Rosebud?\u201d he asked, his voice strained.</p><p>She turned and almost smacked into him. His large, lean frame overshadowed hers as his golden head bent forward. His body radiated heat and she had the urge to rub up against it. Him. But even more, she wanted to trust him. She wanted her instincts to be right when it came to Sasha. She knew he\u2019d never tell. Why would he? The hidden spring that fed the tourist spot wasn\u2019t a gold mine. All it did was make people think their dreams came true. Maybe it was time for another one of hers to do the same.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Grabbing his hand, she tugged him toward the stairs.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>Rose was going to show him the hidden springs. Later, while she was sleeping or at work, he would skulk around, and fill up several vials with water before sending them off to his uncle\u2019s lab. And as soon as they arrived, he\u2019d be gone. Instead of feeling relieved or euphoric, all Sasha felt was a heavy dose of remorse. Guilt. Every damn feeling in the world that he thought had been ruthlessly culled from his heart.</p><p>Hell, before now, his heart had only served as a highly efficient muscle.</p><p>As they grew closer, he started to dig his feet in and pull away. She turned left and there in the corner was a set of stairs. He hadn\u2019t been in this section of the house before, mostly because Rose and Ivy stayed in the kitchen and family room when they were home. Wherever they were, he found himself gravitating towards them.</p><p>She halted just before the first step and turned to face him. Her pretty eyes dark in the dimly lit hall. Her pink tongue licked at her cherry red lips and he wanted to capture it with his own. To draw her sweet little tongue inside of his mouth and mate with it. With her.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Her voice was a breathless whisper.</p><p>Jesus, was he ever ready. He grew hard, and before he rationalized his next move, he had her pinned against the wall, his mouth on hers. She gripped his shoulders. But not to push him away. Instead, she deepened the kiss and pulled him closer. Her perfect body wantonly rubbed against him while his own roared for him take her. To claim her.</p><p>He slowly slid his hands down her slender back to cup her sweet bum, the delicious weight making him thrust his pelvis against her, his cock seeking relief.</p><p>An erotic moan left her mouth and he breathed it in. He wanted everything that was Rose inside of him, humming in his veins. She nipped at his chin, her hands no longer on his shoulders, but working the buttons of his shirt and spreading it open. The touch of her fingers like before, teasing and clever.</p><p>To his relief, she had worn a skirt to work today instead of her usual jeans. He made one of his hands leave her ass to find the hem. Edging it up, his fingers brushed at her heated skin. Higher and higher he pulled it until he felt the supple skin of her thigh, then the raised edges of her birthmark. He traced the outline of it as she trembled against him. Dear God, he wanted his mouth there.</p><p>But first...First he had more important areas of her body to attend.</p><p>Delving two fingers under her panties, he found her wet, hot, and mostly bare. His knees went weak. Locking them, he pushed a soft thigh wider with one of his own and slid his fingers inside of her. Her tight inner muscles clasped him immediately and he groaned.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she moaned into the hollow of his throat.</p><p>He began a playful rhythm\u2014one that soon had them both panting. He brushed her clitoris with his thumb, and she let out a sound between a moan and a wail.</p><p>Over and over he teased, kept her on the edge until she was pounding at his chest and biting his shoulder though his shirt. \u201cDo you want to come, love?\u201d He brushed her clitoris with a whisper soft caress.</p><p>\u201cI-I want you inside me,\u201d she groaned and tilted her hips.</p><p>\u201cI am inside of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the part I want.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but he was hard pressed to do it for long. As he teased her, he was torturing himself with the waiting. The longing. She licked at his pierced nipple and bit down. He let go of her ass and cupped her head, pressing it against him. \u201cHarder,\u201d he ordered, his voice harsh.</p><p>He cursed when she obeyed him. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Now she became the tormentor: tugging, biting and teasing him until his entire body was shaking. She tore her mouth away from his chest. \u201cDo you have a condom?\u201d</p><p>Her soft request for protection was sexy as hell. \u201cUpstairs.\u201d He couldn\u2019t wait that long, but he would.</p><p>He pushed deeper inside of her and pressed down on her tender, swollen flesh. Her body went rigid and she moaned his name. He stayed with her, drawing the orgasm out as his fingers continued to thrust inside of her. Finally, he left her body and she slumped against the wall. To his utter amazement, she slid to her knees and began to unbutton his trousers.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d Please don\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to.\u201d Her warm hands slid inside and pulled his cock out. \u201cCommando?\u201d she asked, her dark brow an elegant arch.</p><p>Before he could answer, her hot mouth covered the head of his cock and he had to throw his hands against the wall to keep from grabbing her hair. After several teasing tries, she took him to the back of her throat. His forehead fell against the wall.</p><p>\u201cLike that, sweetheart. Take me just like that,\u201d he murmured, looking down and gently moving his hips. Her dark eyes seemed to glow as she pleasured him. As her tongue teased and her hands caressed the length of him. Over and over her playful mouth sucked and kissed his erection, until his chest was heaving. His balls drew up, tightened and he knew. He knew he had to push her away.</p><p>\u201cStop, I\u2019m going to...just stop,\u201d he panted, closing his eyes and pushing her shoulder away and against the wall. But she grabbed his ass and took him with her. Another swipe of her tongue and he exploded. \u201cFuck...Rose...you sweet, sweet woman,\u201d he gasped as she continued to love him with her mouth.</p><p>Falling to his knees, he joined her and gathered her close, her body soft against his as he threaded his fingers in her silky curls. He pulled away slightly, marveling at her quiet beauty. At the graceful arches and soft planes of her features. Under his intense scrutiny, her black lashes made a downward sweep and she began to turn her face away.</p><p>\u201cLet me look at you.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes hovered in the air until they lifted again, and once more he gazed into her blue eyes. Desire and an indefinable emotion filled their depths as the seconds passed. Hell, it could have been hours. He didn\u2019t know and he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful.\u201d He kissed her cheek.</p><p>She shook her head, her hair tickling his nose. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he insisted, holding her face with his fingertips as his mouth covered hers again. Her lips parted immediately. Eagerly. His tongue stroked the inside of her mouth. He\u2019d never get enough of this. Her.</p><p>Groaning low in his throat, he gently pushed her to the floor and covered her body with his, never breaking their kiss. Her legs wrapped around his waist, her soaked panties rubbing at his sensitized erection until he was hard again. Despite the mind-reeling orgasm he\u2019d just had, he wanted her again. Shoving up her thin sweater, he kissed a path down her throat to her chest. Desperate to taste her. Desperate to have her bare breasts in his hands, his mouth.</p><p>He brushed his lips over her fabric-covered breast, then took the tip into his mouth and sucked. Deep. Her nipple hardened and a muted scream left her throat.</p><p>Frantically, he searched for the clasp. \u201cDammit,\u201d he muttered against her breast. What was wrong with him? Usually, he had more finesse.</p><p>\u201cIt opens in the front.\u201d Rose massaged the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d He all but ripped it away, and was treated to the sight of her full breasts. Red nipples tightened in the cool air and he hovered over one, teasing the peak with his breath. She arched beneath him, a wordless plea escaping her lips.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of Ivy crying filled the small space.</p><p>Rose froze. \u201cI have to go to her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He helped her to her feet even as his body told him to sweep her off of them. Sasha could still taste her. He wanted to lose himself inside of Rose\u2019s sweet body. Over and over, until he found...something. Shaky hands buttoned his shirt and fastened his trousers.</p><p>A pink stain infused her cheeks as she smoothed her green sweater over the top of her hips. \u201cI\u2014um, we...\u201d She knelt down and picked up the monitor, black curls skimming the floor.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her shoulders, drew her close, and kissed her once last time. \u201cWe\u2019re not finished.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to your room later.\u201d Rose gave him a sweet smile, slipped out of his arms and walked down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>Sasha listened as she washed up at the sink, as she soothed the baby, as she walked out of the kitchen and up the steps of the grand staircase.</p><p>Blowing out the breath he\u2019d been holding, he rolled his shoulders. What had he done? All he\u2019d intended to do was take her out to some place nice. Where no one knew her name or her family\u2019s history and could make her uncomfortable. Where no one gave a damn about hidden springs.</p><p>Except he couldn't forget about it.</p> <p>Turning, he eyed the staircase, unable to do more. \"Quit being a plank and bloody move.\u201d He started toward the stairs.</p><p>Blackbeard appeared out of nowhere, purring and rubbing against his legs. His eerie blue eyes stared straight through Sasha and a shiver rippled down his spine.</p><p>\u201cFine, you win. Damn cat,\u201d he muttered, and headed in the opposite direction. He grabbed his coat and keys. \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he shouted and bolted out the front door before he could change his mind. Before he stopped this madness overtaking him. Making him want to be that man. The one who always did right. The one who was killing his mother with every minute it took him to find this damned spring. With every attempt at being a hero.</p><p>Gravel crunched under his boots as his long strides ate up the distance between the house and his Mercedes. He couldn\u2019t start his car fast enough. He couldn\u2019t pull out of the drive fast enough.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that the leather seats were ruined and the interior smelled like chicken shit. It didn\u2019t matter that David Turner would haul his ass to jail for even thinking about speeding. Glancing up at the rear view mirror, the lights of the dashboard gave him an evil glow. This was why he\u2019d never be a hero. Heroes left in defeat and smelling like chicken manure.</p><p>While villains...villains snatched victory out of the jaws of defeat. They got the job done and went off to their lair to plot their next moves while minions awaited their decisions. And villains never, ever worried about getting the girl in the end.</p> <p>Not even one who smelled of jasmine and let him chase her with chicken feathers. Not even one whose greatest desires in life were uninterrupted sleep, friends and cheesecake. One whose infrequent smiles made his gut clench and his heart beat faster.</p><p>Looming on the right was the familiar red octagon whose message he wanted to ignore, but he stopped anyway and let his head fall to the steering wheel. His cell vibrated and he picked it up, touching the screen and scanning his latest messages. The last one made his blood run cold.</p><p>Time\u2019s running out.</p><p>The picture attached was of his mother, lying unconscious and helpless in a hospital, while his Uncle Vladimir sat by her side, somehow managing to look menacing and caring all in one.</p><p>Lead coated his guts and his palms began to sweat. His vision blurred and he couldn\u2019t take in enough air, his throat closing.</p><p>Breathe, he silently ordered.</p><p>\u201cBugger it.\u201d He stomped on the accelerator.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p> <p>Unlike her baby sister, Rose had never been a morning person. She was, for all intents and purposes, a creature of the night. Long after the moon made its journey in the midnight sky, she would still be hard at work in their basement kitchen, adding and subtracting ingredients until it was perfect. Whipping up creams and lotions to keep a woman\u2019s skin glowing, smelling heavenly. All to capture the object of her desire.</p><p>As a small child she had learned that every Holland woman was practically born with the knowledge. Still Rose was completely grateful that in 1885 the fourth Poppy Holland had decided to preserve her most successful concoctions for future generations and had written down the recipes in a large, heavy tome. There were two main ingredients for every Holland product: the first, specially grown flowers and herbs from the forcing house. The second was such a well-kept secret that only Rose knew of its existence. Not even Skye and sure as hell not Summer.</p><p>Four nights before her sixteenth birthday, Rose\u2019s mother had taken her down to the basement kitchen and into the passage ways carved by former slaves and the third Poppy Holland to assist in the Underground Railroad effort. There were three different routes that shot out from the house. One led to the greenhouse, the second to a cottage and the third to a place Rose had never been.</p><p>A place she had considered sharing with Sasha before he\u2019d kissed her. Before he had touched her so intimately and with such blissful skill that she could still feel him within her. His elegant fingers sliding over her thigh, not even skipping over the birthmark on the inside. Not like...She shook her head. She wouldn\u2019t think of her former lover and his dislikes. His preferences.</p><p>Lifting her arms above her head, she stretched and sighed lustily. Morning had never been greeted so eagerly before. Sunlight poured through the French doors and long, narrow windows of her room. A room that at one time she hated. Hated what it meant. What it stood for. But now in the morning light, it looked like a woman\u2019s room. A woman who was completely and whole heartedly in\u2014</p><p>Ivy gurgled and rolled around in the middle of the large bed, distracting Rose and making her smile. \u201cOh you, sweet, sweet thing.\u201d She scooped her up. \u201cI\u2019m going on a date tonight. It\u2019s going to be an honest-to-goodness real one, with music and amazing food. Knowing his royal snobbiness, it won\u2019t be around here.\u201d</p><p>Ivy\u2019s brows raised, her little lips pursed.</p><p>Rose snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re as bad as Blackbeard over Sasha. All he has to do is walk in the room and you light up.\u201d As did she. Even if she had to hide it most of the time. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll ask him to take me dancing.\u201d The last time she\u2019d danced with the opposite sex had been in middle school when they were learning how to Square Dance during P.E.. It had been forced upon both parties by a man wearing shorts so tight and short that it should have been illegal, or students should have been allowed to wear blinders so as to not look at him directly.</p><p>She gazed dreamily out the window. Autumn leaves in every color imaginable greeted her and if she sat up straighter she could see the carefully tended garden surrounding the forcing house. Familiar sights. Ones that always welcomed her home, and now Sasha was a part of that.</p><p>Last night had been amazing. So amazing that she\u2019d fallen asleep in her bed with Ivy on her chest, she reflected ruefully. The baby had fussed the rest of the evening, so much so that Rose hadn\u2019t heard Sasha return. She\u2019d spent most of the time pacing and patting Ivy\u2019s back before finally settling down in bed with her. Only on what seemed like the hundredth rendition of \u201cMy Bonnie Lies over the Ocean\u201d, a song that Azalea had sung to her and her sisters at night, had Ivy\u2019s eyes finally drooped.</p><p>She bit her bottom lip. Sometimes she missed Azalea more than words could say. There was so much she wanted to say. To ask. What was it that had driven their mother to leave them?</p><p>There was a loud crash. One of the windows flew open. A chill permeated the air, seeping through the thin cotton of her nightgown. \u201cWhat in the world?\u201d</p><p>To Rose\u2019s horror, a crow flew inside. It landed on her vanity and cawed, sending shivers down her spine. She turned, shielding Ivy with her body. Glancing over her shoulder, beady black eyes regarded her. She grabbed her necklace with one hand, rubbing the cross as she tried to figure out the best way to get the bad omen out of her house.</p><p>Suddenly, it flapped its wings and took off. Three inky feathers floated lazily about the room before settling on the oriental rug covering the hardwoods in front of the fireplace.</p><p>Letting go of her necklace, she clutched Ivy tighter. Her heart pounded and her stomach tightened as deeply rooted superstitions threatened her modern world. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she said, knocking on the wooden headboard three times with her elbow for good luck. \u201cThere. That should fix it.\u201d</p><p>But it didn\u2019t.</p><p>Even though Sasha wasn\u2019t there to greet her with a confident grin and a cup of coffee that was more cream and sugar than anything else, she went about her daily Friday routine of cleaning and completing her own honey-do list.</p><p>All morning long, she knocked over the salt shaker, let the milk on the stove boil over; she went in one door and used a completely different one to come back inside; she found a penny and picked it tail side up without thinking about it.</p><p>But the absolute worst happened while she was gathering everything she needed to go to town. The grandfather clock that hadn\u2019t worked in the past fifty years suddenly chimed in the sitting room.</p><p>Ivy\u2019s diaper bag fell from her slack fingers.</p><p>Death was coming.</p><p>\u201cGet a hold of yourself, Rose. This is why people think the crap they do about your family,\u201d she scolded. Reputations as the town whores notwithstanding. Trembling hands grabbed the car keys, the diaper bag (again) and hefted the baby carrier into the crook of her elbow. She headed outside to her Jeep.</p><p>Skye was meeting her at Carolina Dreams and would be taking Ivy with her for the whole weekend. Not only that, Skye was cleaning for her, too. With Tristan.</p><p>It took her a good ten minutes to load everything she thought Skye would need. She gave Ivy a quick kiss on the nose and double-checked to make sure the car seat was secure, then got out of the backseat and closed the door.</p><p>Briefly, Rose wondered how in the world her sister had gotten the doctor to agree\u2014and not because he gave off the impression of being too good for it. He was a war veteran and had lived in conditions a million times worse. But Tristan hadn\u2019t been very happy with her sister yesterday.</p><p>She gave a little shrug, got in her Jeep and started it up. It would all work out in the end. And she had almost three glorious days of no responsibility. Two mornings to sleep in as late as she wanted. Two nights to stay up as late as she wanted. With a man she wanted. With Sasha.</p><p>Warmth and happiness coursed through her veins like caffeinated coffee as she turned onto highway thirteen and sped up. Desire gathered in places no longer dormant. It might be autumn, but inside of her, spring had come. Good grief. She glanced up at the rear view mirror and rolled her eyes at the silly grin she discovered on her face.</p><p>The handle of Ivy\u2019s carrier reflected in it and immediately she felt guilty. Guilty for leaving Ivy. Guilty for wanting to have fun. To be a woman and go on a date. Was this how all mothers felt?</p><p>Her eyes snapped back to the road, tears pricking at the backs. She wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s mother. She was Ivy\u2019s aunt, and until Summer came back, Ivy\u2019s caregiver.</p><p>She made a left on Ivy Lane, parking in front of her store and next to Tristan\u2019s truck. As soon as she turned off the engine, Skye and Tristan immediately began to help her transfer everything.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Skye asked after they finished packing the bed of his truck with Ivy\u2019s suitcase, swing, and every accessory known to a woman that an infant needed.</p><p>Rose inclined her head to one side, hesitating to hand over the last of the baby\u2019s things. Her sister had sounded excited when she\u2019d talked to her on the phone last night about keeping Ivy, but this was the first time anyone other than Rose had looked after the baby.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d Skye snatched the diaper bag and squeaky bunny out of Rose\u2019s hands.</p><p>Rose took a step forward, wringing her hands together. \u201cShe likes to be rocked to sleep. And don\u2019t forget to do tummy time with her. Oh, and lay her on her back to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Rose. We\u2019ve got it covered,\u201d Skye said with a smile, then turned to her companion. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer Skye elbowed him in the gut and Rose\u2019s eyes widened. Her sister was an unapologetic pacifist. Even going so far as to releasing water bugs that would sneak into the house during dry summers. Rose\u2019s preferred method was a good stomping with the nearest heavy object.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tristan grunted and crossed his muscular arms.</p><p>They made the oddest couple, Rose thought. Not necessarily in looks. Tristan was as lean and tall as Skye was curvy and short. His face severely handsome while Skye\u2019s freckled one glowed with an innate happiness.</p><p>Skye was so alive. Always in motion. She spoke with her hands, and laughed easily while Tristan\u2019s movements seemed to be guarded and efficient. Rose couldn\u2019t have asked for a better doctor\u2014not for Ivy and certainly not for herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is Alexander supposed to pick you up?\u201d Skye gently swayed back and forth with Ivy in her arms, making little popping noises with her lips.</p><p>Rose opened her mouth to answer and then quickly shut it, her brow creasing. Sasha had never given her a time. In fact he\u2019d never said where they were going. Heat crept up her neck. Good thing she\u2019d worn her favorite lavender colored turtleneck today. \u201cAfter he\u2019s done for the day,\u201d she said vaguely, then directed her attention to Tristan. \u201cHow are you going to manage your patients and help Skye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke Ambrose joined my practice,\u201d he said, his silvery eyes roamed over her sister. In fact he\u2019d barely glanced away from Skye the entire time. Rose looked away before she smiled. Unfortunately, she found Jason staring at her from across the street. What was he doing down here and why was he by Sasha\u2019s front door? It wasn\u2019t like he needed help in the job department and Jason sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to donate his money or clothes to a good cause. Actually, the only one he invested in was the get-him-to-the-top-as-fast-as-possible cause. A seriously worthy endeavor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Skye squealed and Rose started. \u201cGood grief, Skye. You scared the crud out of me!\u201d</p><p>After handing the baby to Tristan, Skye caught Rose up in a big hug. \u201cI\u2019m so excited for you,\u201d she whispered in her ear. \u201cTry to have fun.\u201d</p><p>Rose fought back the ridiculous tears caught in her throat. This was so unlike her. She never got emotional over silly little things, or big things for that matter. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p> <p>After Skye and Tristan left, Jason was nowhere to be found. Thank God. It was a short walk to the bank and she had about fifteen minutes to spare. Maybe she should pop on over to Sasha\u2019s store and see what time he wanted her ready. Being on time would be the least she could do in return.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she pressed down on the handle. Nothing happened. She frowned. Maybe she should knock. After a couple of minutes, she quit knocking and leaned to one side to take a quick peek in the window. Well, that should\u2019ve been her first clue. The place was completely dark inside.</p><p>Her insides danced, tripped and crashed against each other.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. He lived with her. She\u2019d see him tonight. Keeping her expression neutral, she walked up the street and made her way to the only bank in town. Rose couldn\u2019t help but notice that quite a few people crossed to the other side of the street to avoid walking past her. A couple of guys she knew to be friends with Jason leered at her, raking her body up and down with a smirk on their faces as they grew closer, but they let her pass between them without incident.</p><p>Unlike the greeting that every other customer got when he or she walked in, Rose was met with stony stares and judging eyes. Like usual she ignored them all, holding her head high as she passed the teller\u2019s counter and customer service desk. She didn\u2019t stop until Harrison Collins\u2019 secretary met her halfway and ushered her inside the president\u2019s office.</p> <p>Harrison, ever the southern gentleman, stood as Rose entered the room. He was all business and no smiles as he gestured to the closest chair. \u201cMs. Holland, it always behooves a person to be early. Something many of your generation have yet to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being punctual. I\u2019m ready to get this over with.\u201d She sat down.</p><p>The door click shut behind her and his expression softened. \u201cIs that any way to talk to me, sugar?\u201d He came around the desk and held open his arms.</p><p>Fighting back the nausea, Rose stood, giving him a one-sided hug. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Harrison tsked and leaned back. \u201cRose Holland, your momma raised you better than that.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cThat\u2019s right. She raised me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRose.\u201d</p><p>She knew what he wanted. What he wanted every damn time she came to his office and the door shut. The same damn thing she wasn\u2019t allowed to tell anyone. But now that she knew better, now that she wasn\u2019t so eager to please him, he held the note on her loan and owned her silence.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again, honey,\u201d he said, stepping back and holding out his arms.</p><p>She hesitated and his gray eyes turned stormy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was rude.\u201d She hugged him again and his strong arms wrapped around her. When she was younger, she would carry his hugs home with her and add them to her nightly ritual. But now she knew him, and he cared more about his standing in the community than the bastard child he\u2019d fathered with the town\u2019s most notorious resident, Azalea Poppy Holland.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>Why did the men in her life feel a need to humiliate her? She closed her eyes and breathed in the scent of his crisp aftershave. \u201cDaddy. I\u2019m sorry, daddy.\u201d</p><p>Sasha jogged through the woods, taking the path that veered off to the right. The trees grew thicker here and cast long shadows on the forest floor. The pungent smell of decaying pine needles greeted him as he dodge low hanging bushes and jumped over logs. Sweat trickled down his back, soaking the waistband of his nylon running pants.</p><p>As a young boy, he\u2019d done this with his father. Getting up at the crack of dawn to go running through the forest. Maks Romanov had been a Cross Country Olympic Silver medalist in his youth and even without that accomplishment Sasha had idolized his father. He\u2019d had drive, a purpose, and a wife that adored him. Everything that Sasha lacked.</p> <p>Now running was all that they shared in common. All that kept his father\u2019s memory fresh and close to his heart.</p><p>This afternoon he didn\u2019t run to be close; he ran to get away. Away from the disappointment he imagined in his father\u2019s voice and eyes. The small shake of his head and a frown was nearly enough to make Sasha turn around and reconsider every choice he\u2019d ever made. But it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>Keeping his mother safe was his drive, finding that damned spring was his purpose, and as for a wife or rather woman who adored him...Rose had been that woman last night. Her eyes had been luminous and when she\u2019d smiled, he\u2019d felt like he could conquer anything.</p><p>In reality he was nothing more than a pawn of his uncle. A small piece of a global chessboard that could be sacrificed\u2014no, not sacrificed, that would imply he was actually worth something. He could be discarded to win the game.</p><p>A branch smacked his bare chest, catching one of his nipple rings. \u201cShit.\u201d He stopped to see if the ring was still in place, wiggling it back and forth. No blood was a good sign.</p><p>He bent over at the waist and retied his laces. This is what he got for thinking of her. For touching her. For losing his damn mind when it came to her.</p><p>Last night, he hadn\u2019t come back. The temptation of seducing Rose in her own house had been too great of a temptation. Instead he\u2019d driven around for hours, until the pinks and golds of another sunrise had him wincing and craving shelter like a vampire. On the outskirts of Wilmington, he\u2019d found a motel advertising clean rooms and free Wi-Fi.</p><p>Sleep eluded him, guilt his constant companion as he\u2019d counted tiles in the ceiling. He supposed he could\u2019ve chalked it up to actually living with his victim. When he\u2019d begun to develop a conscience, he\u2019d quickly stunted it by reasoning that the people whose business or lives he\u2019d helped ruin had it coming. That their hands, while not as dirty as his, were not perfectly clean.</p><p>But what crime had Rose committed? She didn\u2019t smile or laugh enough? She\u2019d helped too many people without asking anything in return? She hid behind hocus-pocus and her family\u2019s reputation, keeping everyone at a distance?</p><p>Until him.</p><p>A winter goose honked in the distance.</p><p>Sasha knew what must be done. He needed to keep his hands (and every other body part) off of Rose, find the spring, visit his mother and go on a bleedin\u2019 holiday. Easier said than done since he had absolutely no self-control when it came to Rose. None.</p><p>He kicked at a rotted stump, hitting one side and it fell apart.</p><p>This ridiculous need to elicit smiles, to make her laugh and for her to know him had to be slashed and burned from his heart. Wrenched out of his soul.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t he waxing all poetic?</p><p>Leaves rustled and the scent of jasmine drifted to him, filling his senses. His mouth watered and his cock stirred. He took off. Faster and harder than before, his lungs straining and his thighs screaming. But he couldn\u2019t stop. Her scent was all around him, taunting and tempting. He needed to escape\u2014</p><p>A rock caught the toe of one of his trainers and he crashed to the ground, pine straw and dirt filling his mouth and nose. Stunned, he laid there.</p><p>Slowly, he lifted his head and spit out a wad of dirt. He scrunched his nose and blinked, clearing his vision. Rolling to a sitting position, he tentatively patted his face with the tips of his fingers, checking it for blood. A small dash of red appeared on the pad of his forefinger. Of course a spot above his eye waited until then to begin throbbing.</p><p>He reckoned it could\u2019ve been worse. There could\u2019ve been an audience with their camera phones videoing him going arse over tip. A small sound caught his attention. A blur of movement to the left and a cat meowed. He knew it well. It woke him up from the nightmares that threatened to suffocate him.</p><p>\u201cBlackbeard, you cur, come back here!\u201d Sasha jumped to his feet and pushed at a thick hanging of vines.</p><p>Vines?</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a botanist, but he for damn sure knew these weren\u2019t evergreens and that North Carolina in the fall wasn\u2019t a tropical climate. The vines parted easily and what he saw almost made him fall to his knees and kiss the ground.</p><p>Almost two stories high, a waterfall cascaded over mossy rocks to splash down into a pool roughly half the size of Trevi Fountain in Rome. Flowers of every size and color bloomed along each side, while butterflies and hummingbirds zoomed in and out of focus.</p><p>He wanted to shout out his triumph.</p><p>Then he wanted to roar in frustration, because he was unsure if this was the spring she\u2019d taken him to before, or the one he was supposed to find. His memory was suddenly fuzzy and he couldn\u2019t picture the specifics of his time spent with Rose. All he could recall was the pleasure of her kiss and his hands on her body, making him forget who he was and what he had to be.</p><p>He did neither.</p><p>Instead, he ambled over to the water and dropped to his knees at the edge. His wavy reflection greeted him, but he looked past it, down to the sandy bottom glinting with smooth pebbles. Nothing swam within its depths. What looked to be the entrance to a cave played hide and seek with the waterfall as it fell in wide sheets. That definitely called for some spelunking.</p><p>Technically, there was nothing out of the ordinary about this place. Well, if one didn\u2019t count tropical plants blooming out of season or caves in a naturally flat, almost at sea level terrain. It wasn\u2019t geographically possible. Then again, Stonehenge and Yonaguni Monument were great mysteries as well.</p><p>He thrust his hands into the water, expecting it to be cold. To his utter amazement it felt perfect against his skin. Scooping up some in his palms, he splashed his face until he washed away the dirt and grime. Almost immediately the throbbing above his eye stopped. He drank greedily, the sweet taste of the water filling his belly and cleaning his mouth. He ran his tongue along his teeth. They felt clean, as if he\u2019d just brushed them.</p><p>Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out three plastic vials\u2014which by some miracle had managed to escape destruction from his tumble. The hairs at the nape of his neck rose and he quickly glanced around. No one was there, but it felt as if he was being watched.</p><p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Blackbeard appeared at the top of the waterfall, precariously balanced on a rock. Sasha narrowed his eyes at him and dipped all three vials in the water, capping each one off with a deliberate purpose.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say to that?\u201d He stood and shoved the vials back in his pocket. The cat simply stared down at him. Sasha\u2019s face grew hot and his ears began to burn. \u201cPiss off,\u201d he shouted, waving his arms.</p><p>Blackbeard hissed and backed away.</p><p>A man\u2019s low laugh sounded to the left of him and he quickly moved behind a wide fern. Company\u2014fantastic. Peering between the fronds, he watched Jemma Leigh kiss and stroke the side of her lover\u2019s face. What was his name? Jeremy Stafford, the fisherman who no longer smelled like fish. Courtesy of Rose Holland.</p><p>Would everything in his life always come back to her?</p><p>The ring on Jemma Leigh\u2019s left hand caught the light, reflecting rainbows on their skin as they moved into a spotlight of sunshine.</p><p>Sasha\u2019s eyes widened when he realized they were completely nude. Quickly looking over at the spring, he concentrated on the pink blossoms floating all along the top of the water. What the hell? They hadn\u2019t been there five seconds ago. He must have hit his head when he\u2019d fallen. Or the water contained a hallucinogenic.</p><p>\u201cCherry blossoms,\u201d Jemma Leigh sighed as she bent down to scoop a handful up, her breasts bouncing.</p><p>Holy hell! Sasha turned away, leaning against the thick base of a palmetto.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Rose to put in special order for me?\u201d Jemma Leigh asked, her voice no longer the seemingly ditzy debutant.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, I\u2019d reel in rainbows from the sky for you,\u201d Jeremy said.</p><p>Sasha glanced heavenward. Reel in rainbows? Seriously? If he ever said something so stupid, so treacle as that, he hoped to God someone would shoot him.</p><p>Jemma Leigh giggled.</p><p>Water splashed.</p><p>Sasha sneaked another glance. The lovers were immersed in the spring and rubbing their noses together. Good God.</p><p>\u201cYou know what this means, JL?\u201d Jeremy asked, his voice husky.</p><p>\u201cPlease, for the love of God, don\u2019t start talking about your bloody feelings,\u201d Sasha muttered under breath. He\u2019d rather listen to them snog. It really was a shame he\u2019d left his iPod at home\u2014at Rose\u2019s. He glanced up at the sky in annoyance. Wherever.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear something?\u201d Jemma Leigh asked.</p><p>He flattened himself on the ground. Pine needles tickled and poked at his bare chest. Not wearing a shirt was a brilliant idea.</p><p>\u201cAll I hear is you,\u201d Jeremy said, \u201cNow, honey, tell me what finding this secret place means for us.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s stomach roiled. It couldn\u2019t be, it just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt means this is true love and we\u2019ll be together forever,\u201d Jemma Leigh sighed, sounding like the most in-love woman in existence. Well, the second most if he counted his cousin\u2019s wife. The woman actually cooed at her husband and he seemed to enjoy it. Hell, Sasha knew Christian loved it.</p><p>\u201cAnd ever,\u201d Jeremy finished.</p><p>Christ. It was the wrong spring.</p><p>Sitting up, Sasha closed his eyes and shook his head. It didn\u2019t matter, he\u2019d lie and say he found it. That should buy him some time, until he could figure out his next move. He dug in his pocket for his cell phone and texted his uncle.</p><p>His phone vibrated and there were the words he\u2019d been waiting for: </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s time to come home. You may visit Phoebe. Be at the airport in thirty minutes.</p><p>His muscles eased. Finally, he could see his mother. If he drove exceptionally fast, he could make it to the airport in twenty. He could shower and change on the plane. Everything he could possible need would be on it. But first he had to call Rose and explain.</p><p>Another vibration from his phone.</p> <p>Tell no one.</p><p>Why the hell not, he wanted to text back, but his uncle\u2019s message was clear. He expected him to go in, get the job done and walk away. Make no friends and leave no one that would care about him being gone behind.</p><p>Except Rose.</p><p>He\u2019d promised to take her out. Promised to finish what they started. He could ignore his uncle\u2019s instruction and do just that.</p><p>Sasha banged his fist in the dirt. What kind of son put his sick mother last? Grabbing the nearest rock, he clenched it so tightly in his fist that his knuckles started to ache. There were so many things he wanted to do with that rock. So many words he wanted to shout.</p> <p>But his situation, much like his life, was futile.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Rose put on her best dress\u2014one that Skye had given her last year at Christmas. Slightly funky and more her baby sister\u2019s style than hers with its bold print and little belt that had an alligator as a buckle, she felt young and pretty. It hit her at the knee, but the tall boots she borrowed from Summer\u2019s closet looked perfect with it. No one had to know she\u2019d stuffed tissue paper in the toes for them to fit.</p><p>Quickly checking the time, she gave herself a once over in the mirror. The cross necklace looked worn and old-fashioned. Maybe she should take it off? Her hands went to the back of her neck and she hesitated. There wasn\u2019t a time that she hadn\u2019t worn this necklace. This reminder of who she was and where she came from.</p><p>\u201cJust this once,\u201d she said to her reflection and smiled, taking off the necklace before she lost her nerve. After placing it in her jewelry box, she left her room.</p><p>She practically glided down the stairs and floated across the hardwoods, ultimately deciding to wait for him in the small living room. She glanced at the clock over the mantle. Twenty minutes until seven. No reason to panic or get upset.</p> <p>Seven was a lucky number and people went on dates at seven. Even Jason hadn\u2019t picked her up until after seven.</p><p>She grabbed the remote and after turning on the television, clicked through all nine channels only to find nothing on. Blackbeard wandered in and out of the room, meowing plaintively until Rose took pity on him and picked him up. \u201cI was trying to not get cat hair on me,\u201d she scolded as the cat made himself at home in her lap and purred.</p><p>Minutes turned to half hours as Rose waited. Half hours to hours. Each subsequent tick of the clock making her heart beat faster until she had to stand up and pace the room. She carried Blackbeard in her arms, lowering her head and rubbing her cheek against his soft fur every so often.</p><p>By nine o\u2019clock her stomach felt funny\u2014not exactly butterflies and not exactly cramps. Maybe he\u2019d gotten in a car accident. Maybe he\u2019d gotten abducted by aliens. Maybe the aliens ran over him with their spaceship. She sat back down and checked the stations for any breaking news of a hot British guy being kidnapped by horny women.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Again she stood, dumping Blackbeard out of her lap, and started for the phone. Pride made her stop and sit back down. She apologized to the unforgiving cat who ran out of the room with his tail standing straight up.</p><p>At ten-fifteen, she thought she heard a car pull into the driveway and ran to the front door, flinging it wide open. A sharp retort and a kiss ready for her very fashionably late date. But the driveway was empty. Slowly, she shut the heavy door and locked it, trudging up the grand staircase. Her shoulders drooped and her eyes stung, but she refused to cry.</p><p>The words I told you so ran through her mind as the ghosts of every Poppy Holland before her watched with sympathetic eyes as she entered her bedroom.</p> <p>Her earrings were the first to come off, making a little pinging noise as they hit the interior of the heart-shaped bowl. The boots were thrown into Summer\u2019s old room as she made her way to the bathroom. She scrubbed at her face, removing all traces of date night Rose. All traces of an excited woman until nothing but plain humiliation remained.</p><p>Despite wanting to rip the dress to shreds, she carefully placed it into the back of the closet, where it couldn\u2019t mock her. The never worn before turquoise satin bra and matching panties were traded for boy-cut briefs and a faded nightgown.</p><p>Saving her necklace for last, she opened her jewelry box and carefully pulled it out. It gleamed in the moonlight. As she fastened it around her neck, her throat thickened.</p><p>Walking over to the bed, she climbed on the mattress and curled into a little ball in the middle of her bed, staring at the night sky through the French doors. Her star winked as unchecked tears slid down her cheeks. She\u2019d been so stupid to wish upon it last night. So childish.</p><p>So...hopeful.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, she reached down and tugged the quilts to her chest, and closed her eyes. Sleep couldn\u2019t come fast enough.</p><p>In fact sleep didn\u2019t come at all. So, she got up, changed her clothes and headed to the basement to begin filling the order for Barbara\u2019s Bugs.</p><p>Around five in the morning, she trudged through the kitchen, flicking her sleepy eyes at the phone. He could have called while she\u2019d been gone yesterday. Maybe she should\u2019ve bought an answering machine, but for the odd telemarketer, her phone never rang. As for her cell, it was five years old with sketchy service, had no data plan and was for emergencies only. She\u2019d never seen a reason to give him her number\u2014not until now.</p><p>There was so much she still had to do. So many chores that needed to be done, but she was bone tired. Never had it taken so long to go up the stairs. Never had her house felt so empty, so quiet. She missed Ivy. She missed her sisters. She missed...Sasha.</p><p>Before she knew what she was doing, Rose found herself at his door. Pressing her hand against it, she closed her eyes and listened for the sounds of him breathing. Of him muttering in his sleep about people not listening to his fashion advice and Paula Dean\u2019s cooking. But it was all in vain. He wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>Blackbeard brushed her legs and rubbed against the door. It opened a crack and the cat slipped inside. She pushed it open further and watched the fickle creature jump on the bed, circle around twice and meow. The cat stretched, claws extended, and kneaded the bed covers before settling down in the middle. Rose wanted to crawl in there with him, breathe in the scent of Sasha\u2019s ridiculously expensive cologne.</p><p>If Sasha came home today with a really good explanation (and some cheesecake), maybe, just maybe she would forgive him. Maybe allow him to make it up to her. But after a nap and by six that afternoon, Rose knew he wasn\u2019t coming back today either.</p><p>Rather than mope around, she threw herself into her work again, only stopping to eat and catch a few hours of sleep. With each label she printed out, her heart grew lighter. This was what she\u2019d been taught to do since she was old enough to help out. This was going to let her keep her house and her business. Her life.</p><p>Twice Tempted, one read. Another, Four Ways to Keep Your Lover. Two silly little titles, but her customers loved them. Privately, she\u2019d always thought they were sweet. After all, she\u2019d been the one to make them up. Her absolute favorite was tucked away in an old spice chest, one that the first Poppy Holland had brought with her to the New World. Flowery script labeled the small crystal jar Third Time\u2019s a Charm. Out of habit she dabbed the jasmine-scented fragrance behind her ears with the delicate stopper. Just as every Poppy Holland had done before her.</p><p>And like every Poppy Holland before her, she was destined to be an outcast. To never really be a part of society, but hover on the fringes and help those who needed it. Even those who didn\u2019t deserve it. Maybe that was the real reason her mother had left. She couldn\u2019t deal with the responsibility or the shame of being a Holland. But she thought nothing of putting the burden on her oldest daughter.</p><p>The one that Rose had always thought Summer to be, but as it turned out, Summer was her first cousin, abandoned on their back porch steps by her mother, Wisteria Holland, a month after Summer was born and never heard from again. No one but their family knew and Rose intended to go to her grave keeping it that way.</p><p>The acrid smell of bleach reminded Sasha of death. He fought the urge to cover his nose and mouth with his hand. Or nick one of those masks that the nurses wore. But for Phoebe, he\u2019d brave anything.</p><p>The lonely echo of his footsteps sounded like a cell phone ringing in the middle of a darkened movie theater. Muted voices, the hum of machines and constant beep of heart monitors were the background music of his trek.</p><p>No one greeted him, and not since checking in at the front desk had he seen another living soul.</p><p>Slowing his pace as he reached his destination, he mentally prepared himself and patted the bag slung over his shoulder. A few heartbeats later he was standing in the doorway, motioning the guard to leave. It wasn\u2019t until after the burly man left, did Sasha close the door and approach the bed in the center of the room. One that was appointed with serene earth colors, thick rugs and paintings of his mother\u2019s home in Zimbabwe. He had no family to speak of living there; the entire village where his mother had been born was ravaged by cholera two years after they sent her to boarding school in London.</p><p>\u201cHullo.\u201d He tenderly smoothed the soft black and grey curls away from his mother\u2019s brow. \u201cWhat have you done with your hair?\u201d He tsked. \u201cHospital patient was so seven years ago.\u201d</p><p>Sasha hooked his foot around a nearby chair and pulled it up to the bed. He dropped the bag in the seat, unzipped it and began to lay out its contents on the bedside table. A brush, comb, hair smoother, facial cleanser, and a shampoo cap. Beside those, he placed her favorite moisturizer and his iPod.</p><p>He dialed the iPod to the playlist he\u2019d created just for his mother. One full of ridiculously sentimental songs. But that didn\u2019t stop him from humming along as the microwave heated the shampoo cap and he washed his hands.</p><p>After checking the cap to make sure it wasn\u2019t too hot, he tucked his arm under his mother\u2019s frail shoulders and gently lifted her, fitting the cap around her head. He carefully propped her against the pillows and began to lightly massage in the shampoo.</p><p>His mother had always been so proud of her appearance and her heritage, even when she\u2019d changed her name. A well-meaning agent had convinced a then fifteen year old Mudiwa that her Zimbabwean name wasn\u2019t catchy enough. So, she\u2019d changed it to Phoebe, in honor of her favorite English poet. Ten years and a successful modeling career later, she\u2019d met Maks Romanov at a Safe and Clean Water for All benefit.</p><p>\u201cI took one look into her beautiful green eyes and she couldn\u2019t stop me from asking her out,\u201d his father would always say.</p><p>\u201cAnd he couldn\u2019t stop me from saying no,\u201d she\u2019d laugh.</p><p>Then they\u2019d kiss and his father would waltz her around the room, caught up in their own love song.</p><p>He\u2019d always loved watching them, even with an adolescent\u2019s embarrassment over the affection they shared. Or rather had shared. His father was gone and, for all intents and purposes, so was his mother.</p><p>Sasha snagged a towel from by the sink, wrapping it around Phoebe\u2019s wet hair after he\u2019d removed the cap. Then he washed her face and applied the moisturizer to her mostly wrinkle-free skin.</p><p>\u201cLast month, your old arch-rival, Lina, had a face lift. Everyone knows she\u2019s at least eight years younger than you. Although she claims to be eternally thirty-five,\u201d he said as he brushed her hair. \u201cI know, I know, I shouldn\u2019t revel in others\u2019 misery.\u201d</p><p>Sasha kept the conversation flowing, however one-sided, about fashion and gossip. All the things that would make his mum smile and shake her head at him. It was from her he\u2019d inherited his love of clothes and eye for style.</p><p>Tight spirals fell in an orderly array when he was done and he chucked the brush into his bag. Finally he sat, edging the bag out of the seat with his hip and laid his head beside his mother. He took one of her hands and placed it on the back of his neck, the slight weight a comfort. It was times like these he could pretend Phoebe was stroking his hair and asking about his day, his accomplishments.</p><p>Exhaling, he closed his eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019ve met the most beautiful woman. She\u2019s kind, generous and has absolutely horrid taste in pajama bottoms. She\u2019s raising her sister\u2019s baby and running a business all by herself. I think you\u2019d get on with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d his mum laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sent to destroy her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMugare kure nemoto.\u201d</p><p>Stay away from the fire. He smiled ruefully. That had been her advice every time he\u2019d been caught being naughty.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit dramatic, even for you,\u201d Vladimir Romanov chuckled.</p><p>Sasha\u2019s eyes popped opened and he jumped to his feet, his mum\u2019s arm falling listlessly to her bed. He adjusted her hand and the covers. \u201cDon\u2019t recall your name being on my VIP list.\u201d</p><p>His uncle smiled. \u201cWe are family, Alexander, and despite what you think of me, my ultimate goal is to maintain those relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ultimate goal is world domination.\u201d</p><p>Vladimir shrugged. \u201cWith my family by my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat family?\u201d Sasha leaned against the closest wall and stroked his chin. \u201cDo you mean the son that won\u2019t have anything to do with you, or the one\u2019s that dropped off the face of the planet?\u201d Lucky bastards.</p><p>His uncle\u2019s eyes turned glacial. \u201cYour next project.\u201d</p><p>Unfazed, Sasha barked out a laugh. \u201cSebastian hates me only slightly less than you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChristian.\u201d</p><p>Sasha blinked and blinked again. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. After what I\u2019ve already done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather Machiavellian if you ask me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s bloody insane, and I refuse to do it.\u201d Sasha crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cDid you think you could fool my team of scientists with the exact same water samples?\u201d His uncle\u2019s voice was deadly calm as he strolled to Phoebe\u2019s bed, a prelude to a violent storm of consequences that Sasha would bear the brunt.</p><p>There was tenderness in Vladimir\u2019s gaze. \u201cSickness hasn\u2019t diminished this lovely face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cared for her.\u201d Claws of disgust dug deep into his soul.</p><p>Vladimir\u2019s hand hovered over Phoebe\u2019s face and Sasha watched in horror as that same hand covered her nose and mouth. He bolted for her, but two men on his uncle\u2019s security detail grabbed him. They shoved his head on the table, holding it there and twisting his arms behind his back. He moaned in pain. The corner of his iPod dug into the side of his face, but it was nothing compared to the helplessness and rage.</p> <p>\u201cLust, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Sasha relished the flash of annoyance on his Uncle\u2019s face. If he could make him mad enough, he might be able to get Vladimir away from Phoebe. \u201cShe chose my father over you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was taken in by all that sentimental drivel he spouted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike love and genuine affection? Actually putting his family first, before the company. Before you even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut him up,\u201d Vladimir commanded.</p><p>Henchman number one grabbed Sasha by the hair and banged his head on the table. Sasha saw stars, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking. It was rare day that he could actually get to the miserable S.O.B.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous of a dead man. Now that he\u2019s gone, she still wouldn\u2019t choose you, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was nothing, offered nothing,\u201d Vladimir muttered, his hand tightening over Phoebe\u2019s nose and mouth. Her body jerked pitifully.</p><p>An alarm went off on one of the machines, but Sasha couldn\u2019t see which. He grunted and rolled his shoulders, pain shooting through the joints as he struggled to get free. \u201cWhat she offered, you weren\u2019t allowed to have.\u201d</p><p>Mercifully, his uncle removed his hand. The alarm went silent. \u201cMaks walked away from his family, from me. And what did that get him? Six feet of dirt and you for a son.\u201d Vladimir skimmed the back of his knuckles across Phoebe\u2019s cheek.</p><p>The pressure on Sasha\u2019s arms and head lessened. He wrenched free, slammed his elbow into a hard body and bolted for his mother, but the sight of a Glock stopped him cold.</p><p>\u201cGod damn you to hell.\u201d Sasha fell to his knees, prepared to do anything Vladimir asked of him.</p><p>His uncle nuzzled the barrel of the gun against Phoebe\u2019s mouth and Sasha wanted to vomit. \u201cYou will return to Holland Springs. You will find the spring. You will report on Christian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, just...for the love of God, put the gun away.\u201d Sasha\u2019s gaze traveled from his mother to his uncle over and over. \u201cPlease,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>Vladimir sneered. \u201cLook at you. Sniveling and begging on the floor.\u201d He spat at Sasha, narrowly missing his face.</p><p>Sasha wanted to cry in relief when his uncle tossed the gun to one of the men behind him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember this the next time you consider lying to me.\u201d Vladimir flicked his gaze over him and nodded.</p><p>Air whooshed behind Sasha and from a distance he heard a thunk. Unable to control his body, he slid to the floor.</p><p>\u201cGet him on the plane,\u201d his uncle ordered, his voice sounding like it was underwater.</p><p>His mother\u2019s bed blurred, then multiplied as his head lulled to one side. Sasha blinked, trying to combine the images into one solid picture. Men on either side of him grabbed him by the arms, dragging him to the door.</p><p>\u201cOn your feet,\u201d one of them ordered.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t move fast enough, the other man raised his hand.</p><p>Mercifully, his world went dark before the blow.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Late Monday morning Rose opened Carolina Dreams for business, completely thankful and anxious that Skye wasn\u2019t bringing Ivy back until after lunch. The bells rang on the front door and Gabriel Edwards came strolling in.</p><p>Tall, dark, and handsome with a hint of a foreign accent when he spoke, despite being raised most of his life in Holland Springs, Gabriel was the subject of many women that shopped in her store. Now that he was single, they wanted to know if Rose knew who the right woman was for him.</p><p>Only problem was that whenever Rose did try to picture who Gabriel needed to find the spring with, the image was fuzzy. As it had always been, since the very first time she\u2019d tried to make a match for him.</p><p>Rose smiled and met him in the middle of the store. \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook her hand, his manners unfailingly polite as he asked about her, Skye, and Ivy. She thought it was odd that he didn\u2019t ask about Summer. Then again, his relationship with Summer had always been odd. \u201cSo what do you really need, Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>Finally, he rubbed the bridge of his nose and peered at her under his brows, his indigo eyes serious as ever. \u201cCould you do me a favor and take on an employee? One of the teens I\u2019ve been mentoring has finally made the decision to leave his crew, but he needs a place to live and work. Maybe you could let him live above your store and take the rent out of his paycheck?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted a troubled teen around Ivy. Or her cash register. \u201cHow old is he and has he ever been arrested?\u201d Walking to the back of the store, she tried tugging a heavy box over to the counter, but it barely moved. \u201cHow in the world did Skye lug this downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen and petty theft.\u201d</p><p>Standing, she wiped her hands on the back of her jeans. \u201cNo history of violence? Drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Where do you want this?\u201d Gabriel asked, waving her out of the way.</p><p>She pointed at the counter top. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the box filled with bottles of shampoo and conditioner with ease. \u201cPlease, Rose, he has no family to speak of. His big brother is a gang banger and his mother just got shipped back to Mexico. No one else will give him a chance, and I heard from Jemma Leigh that you got a huge contract with Ingrid\u2019s Insects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbara\u2019s Bugs,\u201d she corrected with a smile. \u201cThanks for the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He grinned back, then sobered. \u201cNo one else will hire him. You\u2019re my last hope. And it\u2019s not because I was holding out for something better. I know you have a lot on your plate right now, with taking care of Ivy and all.\u201d He blew out a breath. \u201cI\u2019ll be personally responsible. If he breaks or steals anything, I\u2019ll have David haul his butt to jail and pay you twice what it was worth.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rose, give him a chance to prove he\u2019s not what everyone thinks he is.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, tucking a stray curl behind her ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiguel Ruiz.\u201d A look of pure relief passed over his face. \u201cWhen can he start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen does he need to?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel bit the side of his bottom lip before he answered. \u201cAs soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiguel can move in Thursday afternoon. That\u2019ll give him the entire weekend to rearrange the upstairs. Tell him there\u2019ll be some casseroles in the freezer to get him started. And some basics in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grabbed her and pressed a quick kiss to her forehead. \u201cIf this town only knew what you really were like, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t believe it. Most of them will think I\u2019ve taken up with a younger man,\u201d Rose said, her face growing hot. She stepped away from him as he let go of her arms. \u201cDid you tell him about our...my reputation?\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cNothing to tell. Anyway, I need to get back to work before Noah drives Allie insane and she quits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be my date for the fundraiser at the Collins\u2019?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, well, those kind of events aren\u2019t really my thing,\u201d he said, fidgeting with his keys.</p><p>What he really meant, but was too polite to say, was that women like her weren\u2019t his thing, not anymore. Defending her and her sisters when they were kids being bullied was one thing, but now that they were all adults, it wasn\u2019t needed.</p><p>Besides his family was well-respected in the community. He was well-respected, with all the outreach programs he\u2019d started. Gabriel understood more than most that there were some people who couldn\u2019t be saved. That there were some families whose reputations would never change.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I got the invitation today. Everyone who owns a business in town did. Jemma Leigh designed the invitations and they\u2019re very pretty.\u201d She snapped her mouth shut and began sorting the remaining bottles into two piles, afraid she\u2019d blurt out that the invitation was probably a mistake, but she wasn\u2019t going to let that stop her from going. Besides, a part of her wanted to see Harrison Collins squirm in public.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you, Rose. It\u2019s just that my ex will be there, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in love with Zoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, looking her in the eye. \u201cI\u2019m happy for her. Only seeing her reminds me of what I could\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve wasted a lot of time wanting the wrong woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI completely understand.\u201d She\u2019d been wasting her time wanting the wrong man. But she really didn\u2019t want to go alone. She didn\u2019t want to have to face all those people. Or be the third wheel on Skye\u2019s date with Tristan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him, making a face. \u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited,\u201d Gabriel laughed. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not your problem; it\u2019s mine. I\u2019ll be your date. What time does it start and what should I wear?\u201d</p><p>Placing her arms along the box\u2019s edge, she tried to remember the exact wording on the invitation. \u201cEight p.m. Wear a mask with your costume.\u201d Raising her brows conspiratorially, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s on All Hallow\u2019s Eve. I\u2019ll be going as myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn angel?\u201d A slow grin slid on his handsome face and his indigo eyes glinted with amusement.</p><p>Oh Lord, was Gabriel flirting with her? \u201cPoppy Holland.\u201d</p><p>He bit at his lip again and lowered his lashes. \u201cThe Witch of Strawberry Grove. Don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d share some of your special wine with me?\u201d</p><p>He was! Everyone knew that Poppy Holland only drank strawberry wine with her lovers. \u201cI...\u201d she began, not sure how to gently turn him down. But honestly why should she tell him no? She\u2019d practically grown up with Gabriel and trusted him. And she wasn\u2019t dating Sasha. Even if she\u2019d\u2014they\u2019d...Good grief. She was hopeless.</p><p>\u201cI was only kidding, honey.\u201d Gabriel smiled, flashing a dimple in his left cheek.</p><p>Chagrined, she picked up the closest shampoo bottle and placed it with the conditioners. \u201cOf course you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I bring over dinner and a movie tonight?\u201d</p><p>Startled at his offer, Rose could only stare at him.</p><p>\u201cIf you have other plans, don\u2019t worry about,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mind Ivy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love kids.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer and her heartbeat stayed steady. This was so unfair. Gabriel was a nice guy, a good-looking guy. A stand-up kind of guy that a girl took home to meet her parents. He was a guy that took girls home to meet his. What was wrong with her? Taking a deep breath, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll cook supper and you bring the DVD. Be at my house by 6:30.\u201d</p><p>The bells on the front door jingled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so dinner and movie for tonight, be there t at 6:30. Then Friday night pick you up by seven. Got it.\u201d He stepped away from her, picked up another box and placed it on the counter. \u201cWould you like to eat first?\u201d</p><p>Skye breezed in with Ivy. She gave Rose a what-the-hell-is-going-on look, but didn\u2019t interrupt their conversation.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re serving heavy hors d\u2019oeuvres. I think we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she replied, lifting her chin. She didn\u2019t care what her sister thought.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cSee you later, then. Nice to see you, Skye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d Rose said, frowning at Skye when she remained silent.</p><p>The bells on the front door jingled as Gabriel opened and closed it behind him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was allowed to celebrate pagan holidays,\u201d Skye said as she handed over Ivy.</p><p>Starfish-shaped hands opened and closed, reaching for her and Rose held her close. She breathed in Ivy\u2019s sweet baby scent and ignored her sister\u2019s barb. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so, so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose.\u201d</p><p>Eying Skye over Ivy\u2019s curly head, she said, \u201cHow was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Skye crossed her arms, fairly dancing with energy. And curiosity. \u201cHow was your date with Alexander?\u201d</p><p>Two could play at this. \u201cFine. Thank you for keeping her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he by the way?\u201d</p><p>Rose blurted out the first thing that came to mind. \u201cFamily emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s he coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Skye raised her brows.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Skye stared at her and Rose did the same right back.</p><p>\u201cTristan\u2019s parked his truck in the back. Where are your keys?\u201d Skye finally asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bouncing the baby in her arms, Rose placed kisses along her cheeks. \u201cOn my desk.\u201d</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Skye handed Rose her keys back and kissed Ivy on the head. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Now she only had to find a last minute babysitter. Gabriel\u2019s mother had offered before, but Rose had turned her down. Maybe she should call her later and ask if the offer still stood.</p> <p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too hard to for him to dress as holier-than-thou. He\u2019s got the market cornered,\u201d Skye tossed out over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLook, he apologized about what happened between him and Summer. Stop holding a grudge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Skye muttered.</p><p>Rose snapped. \u201cGod forbid you ever have to deal with people not liking you. Or thinking the worst of you. And I believe I speak for all of us that don\u2019t have that luxury by saying: kiss my butt.\u201d</p><p>Skye stopped mid-stride and whirled around, her hazel eyes huge. \u201cHow do you know what people think of me? Or you? All you and Summer have ever done is assume the worst.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSummer and I never assumed. We were reminded day after day.\u201d Grabbing a blanket from a nearby basket, Rose spread it out on the floor and placed the baby on it.</p><p>\u201cYou never talk to anyone, not even me. You never go out. You have no friends, Rose. None.\u201d</p><p>Turning to Skye, she said, \u201cWhen am I supposed to make friends? Should I do it before or after work? Before or after taking care of Ivy? Before or after paying for you to go to school, the light bill, the food bill, or car insurance? Before or after working my ass off cleaning someone else\u2019s house? Making it look beautiful while ours rots. While I can\u2019t afford to pay someone to fix it because they want more than money. Because no decent man around here will look at me twice. All you do is smile and the town\u2019s doctor is panting after you, ready to jump as high as you tell him. He\u2019s taking you out, helping you keep someone else\u2019s kid, and most important of all, Tristan\u2019s not dating you because he made a bet with his buddies that he could make the ice princess thaw.\u201d</p><p>Rose slapped her hand over her mouth, horrified. She\u2019d never told anyone about that stupid bet Jason had made. The one she\u2019d \u201caccidentally\u201d found out about on their last date when one of his buddies stopped by the table to pay up, after Jason broken things off with her. She\u2019d been unable to say a thing, too mortified to make a scene in such a nice restaurant.</p><p>\u201cRose, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Skye ran back to her, giving her a tight hug. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Rose said softly. \u201cBesides, it was a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA year and a half isn\u2019t that long,\u201d Skye reminded her.</p><p>No, no it wasn\u2019t. \u201cWater under the bridge, honey. Now go spend time with your man.\u201d It was easy to forgive Skye or anyone else she loved. Maybe if she actually took the time to talk to her, then they would have more insight into each others\u2019 lives.</p><p>\u201cCall me,\u201d Skye said as she left.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Rose said and she meant it. She scooped up a very sleep Ivy and headed to her office.</p><p>She laid the baby down for her afternoon nap, and gently shut the door. As she started to turn, something caught her by the arm and spun her around. Her heart bungy-jumped to her toes, hitting her throat on the bounce back up.</p><p>\u201cSasha,\u201d she gasped, her heart pounding. With adrenaline or happiness, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Before she could stop him, he pulled her flush against his body. His palm slowly slid up her spine and cupped the back of her head. Mesmerized by the fierce longing in his eyes, she allowed him to rub his thumb across her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Rosebud.\u201d Sasha covered her mouth with his.</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Sasha was kissing her. Right here, right now in her store. After being gone forever and a day. After making her cry, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cKiss me back,\u201d he murmured and sealed his mouth over hers again, his tongue slipping past the defenses of her lips and seemingly daring her to bite him as it coasted over her teeth.</p><p>She gripped his arms, the lean muscles gathering and bunching under hands. For a moment she melted against him, rubbed her body along the hard planes of his and reveled in the low sounds he made in his throat. How their lips moved in perfect synchronization, like old lovers.</p><p>Digging her fingers into his arms, she tore her mouth away and shoved. Hard.</p><p>He stumbled back. \u201cRose.\u201d</p><p>She took in great gulps of air, her breasts rising and falling. And, damn him, he wasn\u2019t even following the movements. He was too busy staring at her face.</p><p>Sasha started for her again.</p><p>The bells on the door rang and he froze.</p><p>Skye walked in with Ivy\u2019s diaper bag and a huge smirk on her face. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to have interrupted your reunion, but I left this in Tristan\u2019s truck.\u201d Turning to Sasha she asked, \u201cIs everything okay with your family?\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together. \u201cMy family?\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s smile contracted. \u201cRose said you had a family emergency.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Rose and she lifted her chin, daring him to call her a liar. Finally, he settled his gaze back on Skye. \u201cSorry, still recovering from jet lag. My mother\u2019s stable. Thank you for asking.\u201d He almost looked like he was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Rose asked before she could stop herself.</p><p>He stared over her shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s been in a coma for the past seven years. And she\u2019s not getting any better. Or any worse for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d Skye asked.</p><p>Sasha glanced at Rose, found her watching him and quickly turned, but not before she\u2019d seen the emotion on his face. She wanted to comfort him, wanted to take away the pain she\u2019d witnessed in his eyes, but she couldn\u2019t. Not now. Maybe not ever.</p><p>\u201cHe was killed in a car crash when I was eighteen.\u201d</p><p>A heavy silence filled the room.</p><p>Skye\u2019s expression turned thoughtful. \u201cHave you ever considered\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh God, not this. The last thing Sasha would want to hear about is Skye\u2019s theories on holistic medicine. \u201cNot now, Skye,\u201d Rose said, holding up her hand.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Skye huffed. \u201cI need to go anyway. Class at four, then work at seven.\u201d</p><p>Rose waited until everyone had said their good-byes and Skye was halfway down the street before she turned to the man she had wanted to kick out of her store. Her house. Her life.</p><p>She reached for her necklace, but settled for the space over her heart. \u201cWhy are you here if your mother is sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs somebody else in your family taking care of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a long-term care facility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, she needs family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer needs are being met,\u201d Sasha ground out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Their eyes met, hers beautifully blue and full of questions, but he refused to elaborate. Rose would never understand. Hell, the less she understood the better off she was. \u201cI brought cheesecake,\u201d Sasha said, gesturing at the bag on the counter and smiling brilliantly. Running a hand through his hair, the small lump on his head painfully throbbed when he touched it.</p><p>Rose\u2019s dark brows raised fractionally. \u201cIs that supposed to be your apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d But he was quite sure that it would take more than dessert to make it up to her. \u201cI\u2019d like for you to be my date for the fundraiser to make up for missing our date this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Pale cheeks turned pink before his eyes. \u201cUm.\u201d She licked her lips.</p><p>This was not the reaction he\u2019d been expecting from her. He would\u2019ve thought she\u2019d yell at him or kick him out of the house by now. Jason Everett had been right about one thing: Rose was an exception to every rule.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d he said, leaning his hip against the counter. \u201cI\u2019ll kick out the first asshole that so much as looks at you wonky-eyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d she said after long moments of hesitation.</p><p>Relief filled him. For a dark moment, he thought she had a date. \u201cFantastic. I\u2019m going as a stunningly handsome\u2014and let\u2019s be perfectly honest\u2014fashionable man in black. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date.\u201d</p><p>He wobbled his head from side to side, pushing out his lips a little and scratching his chin. \u201cI reckon I can change my costume. Perhaps go as a bowl and carry you around all night, shall I?\u201d He\u2019d rather hoped she would have picked something sexier. There had to be a law somewhere that said women had to dress in the most erotic way possible on the thirty-first of October.</p><p>She shook her head, her pretty curls dancing around her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going as a date. I have a date.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped. He couldn\u2019t help it. Severe jealousy stabbed him in the heart along with the panic of losing her. No, not her, the opportunity to find the right damn spring. If she was distracted by another man, then she couldn\u2019t spend time with him and he couldn\u2019t earn back her trust. \u201cWith whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel Edwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Her stubborn chin tilted as she crossed her arms. \u201cHe\u2019s too good for someone like me?\u201d</p><p>Sasha silently counted to ten and then did it twice more before he answered. \u201cHe\u2019s nothing like what you deserve.\u201d The temperature in the store suddenly felt as if it had gotten twenty degrees cooler. He shivered, but Rose didn\u2019t appear to be affected at all. In fact, her pretty eyes fairly blazed at him.</p><p>\u201cYou mean someone like you\u2014a liar and a user? That\u2019s what you think I deserve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t twist my words.\u201d His breath came out in steady white puffs of air as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cSays the man who twists everything to his advantage.\u201d</p><p>If only she knew what a disadvantage his entire life was. If only she could see his mother, laying helpless and colorless in a hospital with a gun in her mouth. If , if, if.</p><p>Rage filled him, heating his body until the goose bumps that had begun to dot his skin disappeared and his hands clenched into fists. He jerked his gaze around the room until he found the thermostat and strode to it, nearly breaking the plastic tab as he shoved it to seventy\u2013five.</p><p>\u201cLeave my things alone,\u201d she said, ducking under his arm and wresting his hand away.</p><p>The back of her sweater collided with the front of his shirt. He cupped her shoulders to steady them both, but it only served to throw him off-balance. He had the insane notion to sweep her hair aside and drink in the jasmine perfume she wore behind her ears. To nibble on her neck until breathy moans filled the air.</p><p>Another blast of cold air hit him and he dropped his hands as if he\u2019d been scalded. \u201cWhile your Holland hocus-pocus seems to scare everyone else, might I remind you that not only am I wholly unimpressed, but you\u2019ve Ivy to consider.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened her spine. \u201cAnd let me remind you, Alexander, that who I choose to spend time with is none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>He made an inarticulate noise and turned on his heel, marching to the door he didn\u2019t remember leaving open, and out of her store.</p><p>The last person Sasha expected to see sitting on the sofa with Rose was Gabriel Edwards. Her bloody date to his party. His party. And the son of a bitch was holding Ivy.</p><p>The baby stared at the man holding her in his arms, her little mouth puckered. His clever girl was not happy.</p><p>Rose gave Gabriel one of her rare smiles and it took all of Sasha\u2019s self-control not to walk in there and bodily throw Gabriel out of the house. Breathing deeply, pressed the heel of his hand against his chest and rubbed. The last time she\u2019d smiled at him he\u2019d run like a first-rate coward out of her house.</p><p>Walking up behind them, he cleared his throat. Ivy looked up at him, her puckered lips spreading into a toothless smile while Rose and Gabriel jumped apart like teenagers caught making out by their parents.</p><p>Sasha leaned over and plucked Ivy out of Gabriel\u2019s arms before anyone could say a word. Ivy raised her brows and he kissed her on the nose. \u201cHullo, darling.\u201d</p><p>Rose looked up at him, her eyes narrowing. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>Sasha gently bounced Ivy and smiled at her, ignoring Rose\u2019s irritated expression. \u201cHas Aunt Rose fed you? I\u2019m starving.\u201d He walked to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator, looking for a bottle of formula to heat.</p><p>Rose\u2019s footsteps sounded behind him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already fed her and you can\u2019t just waltz in here like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I live here?\u201d he supplied, hitting the door with his elbow and turning around.</p><p>Briefly, Rose impersonated a fish gasping for air, then held out her arms. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t to hug him. However, she wasn\u2019t wielding a knife in order to cut out his heart and feed it to Blackbeard. Speaking of which, where was that damn cat? Usually the beast tried to trip Sasha as soon as he walked in the door.</p><p>Taking Ivy from him, she gave him the smallest smile he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI fixed a plate for you. It\u2019s on the second shelf of the fridge.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not being here when I cooked?\u201d she asked, tilting her head to the side in an attempt at guilelessness, but he wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cIt\u2019s not required in your lease.\u201d</p><p>Lowering his chin, he looked at her from under his brows and crossed his arms. \u201cThat, too. But actually, I was referring to Friday night\u2014the whole damn weekend\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRose, honey,\u201d Gabriel called out, \u201cthe previews are almost over and the movie\u2019s getting ready to start.\u201d</p><p>Sasha clenched his jaw tight to keep from telling Gabriel to shut it.</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d Rose said, her voice perfectly sweet.</p> <p>Sasha didn\u2019t think he could be more jealous, but as usual he was wrong. \u201cWhat\u2019s Edwards doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel brought over a movie for us to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does he have planned for later?\u201d</p><p>Fury flashed in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s a gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bloody boring.\u201d And everything a woman like Rose needed. Everything she deserved. Everything Sasha would never be.</p> <p>She pressed a kiss to Ivy\u2019s head before saying, \u201cGrow up, Sasha.\u201d She turned to walk away.</p><p>Catching her arm, he prevented her from leaving, but she wouldn\u2019t face him. \u201cIs this a real date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>A part of him demanded he lie, but he was done playing games. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had your chance,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>So he had. Reluctantly he let go of her, but he sure as hell wasn\u2019t leaving. He lived here.</p> <p>Rose glanced out of the corner of her eyes at Sasha and then at Gabriel. She was sandwiched between the two of them as they watched the DVD Gabriel had brought over. Their broad shoulders and muscular thighs took up most of the couch.</p><p>Wriggling didn\u2019t help. It only served to remind her of the one man who made her hot. The one who made her body tense in anticipation as his fingers brushed her arm. As he leaned over and whispered the most ridiculous rumors about the people they were watching.</p><p>\u201cHates Gummy Bears, that one. Can\u2019t abide a man who doesn\u2019t like sweets.\u201d Sasha brushed her hair away from her neck. Her skin began to tingle so sharply that it hurt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like them either,\u201d she said, turning slightly to face him. Maybe that would make him leave her alone. Maybe she should join Ivy upstairs in her crib.</p><p>A slow grin tilted his lips at the corner and she became really thankful she was sitting down, because her knees were non-existent. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re already sweet enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He leaned closer, his lips grazing her neck. \u201cMmm\u2014delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just lick me?\u201d she hissed, furtively glancing at Gabriel. He rested his chin in his hand as he leaned to one side, thoroughly engrossed in the movie.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll taste you again, shall I,\u201d Sasha said, his golden head titling to the side. \u201cJust to be sure.\u201d This time his lips didn\u2019t brush against her skin. He actually sucked on her neck and nipped at the spot with his teeth.</p><p>Oh God! She clenched her thighs together and tried focusing on the movie, but her vision was too foggy. Everything was blurred and she was having a hot flash. The fire in the fireplace leapt higher and a log snapped. \u201cBehave yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, believe me, love, I am.\u201d Sasha eased an arm behind her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Rose?\u201d Gabriel asked, thankfully paying more attention to the bowl of popcorn in his lap than anything else.</p><p>No, she was not okay. She needed to leave. She wanted to run away. Away from her traitorous body so she could focus on the pain Sasha had caused.</p><p>\u201cEr, Rose?\u201d Gabriel repeated.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer him?\u201d Sasha murmured, his sexy voice purring in her ear. He bit down gently on the lobe and she elbowed him, relishing his grunt of pain.</p><p>Why was she allowing this? This was so not her. This was something Summer would do. Suddenly, someone\u2014she really didn\u2019t want to know who\u2014grabbed her hand and she shot to her feet. \u201cI have to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel copied her, his tall and lean form blocking her view of the movie\u2019s ending. Which was fine with her because she couldn\u2019t remember the name of the darn thing\u2014much less the plot or major characters.</p><p>\u201cThanks for having me over. You\u2019re a great cook, Rose,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>Sasha rolled his eyes, not bothering to stand. He sprawled on the sofa with a lazy grace that made her want to throw a pillow at him. \u201cAss-kisser,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she mouthed.</p><p>\u201cMake me,\u201d he mouthed in answer and clasped his hands behind his head.</p><p>She shook her head at Sasha before grabbing Gabriel by the arm and dragging him out of the room. \u201cLet me walk you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too long, dear. I need you to tuck me in,\u201d Sasha called out as Rose and Gabriel entered the foyer.</p><p>She glanced up at Gabriel and fiddled with the door handle. \u201cHe\u2019s joking.\u201d</p><p>A wry smile played on his lips. \u201cIs he always like that?\u201d</p><p>On the verge of answering yes, she stopped and reconsidered. \u201cWell, no\u2014sometimes he\u2019s...him,\u201d she finished lamely. As if that could sum up a man like Sasha. A man who brought her cheesecake. A man who got up at five in the morning to help her clean and had gotten her chickens back. A man who\u2019d claimed Ivy was his and shunned any store that tried to do the same to Rose.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>She didn\u2019t trust him and the one promise he\u2019d made to her, he\u2019d broken without a second thought. Even if it was for his mother. He could\u2019ve called. She deserved a phone call at least. She would have understood, would have offered her help or something to make it easier on him.</p><p>Gabriel brushed a lock of hair over her ear. The same ear Sasha had whispered in and bitten.</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s hand fell to his side and his indigo eyes gleamed. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ve got competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...you-I,\u201d she floundered for words.</p><p>Biting the side of his lip for a moment, Gabriel leaned in and said quietly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey, I\u2019m just teasing you again. Romanov needs to see your worth. Women come too easy for a man like him.\u201d</p><p>She furrowed her brow. \u201cYou mean you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d Gabriel cheeks flushed. \u201cYou\u2019re sweet, hard-working, and one of the prettiest girls in Holland Springs, but it was over as soon as he walked in the door. You two lit up like twin Christmas Trees.\u201d</p><p>Blinking, Rose could barely get out her next words. \u201cBut he stood me up.\u201d</p><p>A dark look covered Gabriel\u2019s face. \u201cDid he apologize or give a reason?\u201d</p><p>My mother isn\u2019t getting any better, or worse for that matter.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should give him another chance. If you want to go with him Friday, I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>Another chance? She\u2019d already given him too many as it was. \u201cNo, I asked you to be my date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m your date. I\u2019m going out of town tomorrow for a meeting, so I\u2019ll see you Thursday,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>She nodded and opened the front door. \u201cBring Miguel over around four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He looked over her shoulder and his eyes gleamed again. Suddenly, he bent down and kissed her at the corner of her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he whispered before he stood. \u201c\u2019Night Romanov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSod off, Edwards,\u201d Sasha growled from behind Rose.</p><p>She closed the door and whirled to face him. \u201cCould you be more rude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me have a go at him and you can judge for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Fisting her hands on her hips, she glared at Sasha. \u201cYou- you spoiled\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sasha pounced, backing her up against the door and placing a palm along each side of her head. \u201cYes, I\u2019m spoiled. I\u2019m ruined and it\u2019s all your fault.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cMy fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yours\u2014the woman who drives me insane. The woman I dream about kissing. The woman I hunger to be inside.\u201d His head dipped down, full lips and sexy beauty mark at the corner dangerously close. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m so damn jealous that I want to...\u201d He turned away but she placed her hand on his jaw and forced his face back to hers.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>The heat in his eyes made her legs tremble. \u201cI want to lock you in my bedroom with me and not let you out until, until...\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cUntil when?\u201d she prompted. A small part of her reveled in this, his torture. She wanted him to hurt. To feel something.</p><p>He laughed, but it was mirthless. \u201cNever, I never want to let you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed between last week and tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Everything. Christ, Rose. I\u2019m so damn sorry and...and I don\u2019t know what to do or say.\u201d He looked as though he truly meant it. Regret seemed to fill his green eyes and she couldn\u2019t make herself look away. This was the real him.</p><p>\u201cYou made me cry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He rested his head against her forehead, his golden hair soft and silky. \u201cI\u2019m a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI waited up for you. I put on my prettiest dress.\u201d Tears grew thick in throat. She would not cry in front of him. She only wanted him to know how badly he hurt her. But honestly, if he\u2019d cared, he wouldn\u2019t have been so cruel in the first place. Lifting her shaking hands, she tried to push him away, but he wrapped his arms around her and held her close.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said, his breath hot in her hair. He kissed the side of her neck, her jaw and her cheek. \u201cI need your forgiveness, Rosebud.\u201d</p><p>Turning before he could find her mouth and she lost all self-control, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you another chance.\u201d</p><p>She wriggled out of his embrace, running upstairs to her room and shutting the door behind her. Pressing cold fingers to her heated cheeks, she closed her eyes and sank to the floor. What had she done?</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Sasha shot out the front door, wrenching the passenger side door open before she put the Jeep in park. \u201cYou grab the diaper bag. I\u2019ll grab Ivy, then come \u2018round to get you. It\u2019s a wee bit slippery out here.\u201d</p><p>Rose didn\u2019t wait for him to come get her. She parked the Jeep, grabbed her keys and stuffed them in the diaper bag before she got out. They met in the middle and he grabbed her hand. She ran beside him, dodging the fat rain drops that had followed her home.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we running if it\u2019s slippery outside?\u201d</p><p>Yesterday he\u2019d weeded the garden, cleaned her house and collected eggs from the chickens. All she had to do when she got home was cook supper and put Ivy (and herself) to bed after thanking a very subdued Sasha. One that kept his hands and everything else to himself.</p><p>But tonight, she\u2019d never seen him so excited.</p><p>He tightened his grip. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>As she walked in the foyer, Sasha kept glancing over his shoulder with a boyish smile on his face. After the third time, she finally asked, \u201cWhat are you so happy about?\u201d But before he could answer, the sight of her kitchen and family room made her stop in her tracks.</p><p>Ivy\u2019s diaper bag fell to the floor with a thud.</p><p>The kitchen table was covered a white tablecloth and a large vase of violets. Strawberry Grove\u2019s fanciest china held their supper. The set of dishes was one that the fourth Poppy Holland\u2019s aristocratic lover had gifted her with before sailing back home to Italy.</p><p>The small family room had been transformed with white sheets draped over the couch, new fluffy pillows in tasteful shades of green and blue.</p><p>The sound of water bubbling caught her attention and she rose up on her tiptoes, amazed to see a foot bath sitting on the floor. Like the kind that they sold at big box discount stores with settings for heat, bubbles, and massage. It was placed directly in front of a chair that normally sat to the left of the massive fireplace in the formal living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d</p><p>He gestured at the two rooms and gave a silly bow. \u201cWelcome to Strawberry Grove\u2019s day, er, night spa.\u201d He set Ivy\u2019s car seat on the floor and had her out in seconds, pressing a swift kiss to her forehead. \u201cSit and eat first.\u201d</p><p>No man had ever cooked her dinner before. She shook her head, unable to keep the smile off of her face. \u201cYou thought this would butter me up?\u201d</p><p>He flashed a heart-stopping grin her way. \u201cWorking, is it?\u201d</p><p>As they sat and ate, or rather as she ate while he fed Ivy, her eyes kept straying over to the family room. The fireplace blazed, casting cheery shadows along the walls. Blackbeard sauntered in, making his way to the sofa and jumping on one of the pillows. He circled a couple of times before laying down, purring contentedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you think to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hands and feet, or rather your nails,\u201d Sasha said as he propped Ivy against his shoulder and began to pat her back with an ease that didn\u2019t surprise her.</p><p>Hovering her hands above her lap, she examined her nails. They weren\u2019t that bad. She kicked off her flats and rubbed her feet together under the table. \u201cYou want me to paint them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He stood and walked over to Ivy\u2019s swing, strapping her in and turning on the musical mobile. Immediately the baby\u2019s eyes left Sasha and locked on the slowly turning animals. Then he grabbing a two-chambered bucket, sat down on the floor and pulled off Ivy\u2019s socks. He selected a bottle and held it up to the light.</p><p>\u201cYou want to paint Ivy\u2019s nails?\u201d</p><p>He scrunched his nose and twisted his lips. \u201cNo, you daft woman, I did it to paint yours, but honestly, why should she miss out on the fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed how she tries to put everything in her mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm, yes. Quite so. Sorry, darling.\u201d He quickly put Ivy\u2019s socks back on her feet. He set the small bottle of polish down and took off his shoes and socks. \u201cI\u2019ll do mine first. Venom looks promising.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cRight, too early 2000s.\u201d He rummaged through the bucket again and pulled out a bright red bottle. Turning it over he read, \u201cCherry Bomb Harlot. Fantastic.\u201d</p><p>While she finished eating, he painted his toe nails. \u201cDammit,\u201d he muttered, using a cotton ball to swipe at some polish. \u201cThis is harder than it looks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready for me now?\u201d she asked as he inspected his feet.</p><p>\u201cGive a bloke a minute for his polish to dry.\u201d</p><p>She stifled a laugh. \u201cIt looks great on you. All the guys will be jealous.\u201d</p><p>He waved his toes, the bright red paint glaring. \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll go Goth.\u201d He pointed to the chair. \u201cBe a good customer and sit.\u201d</p><p>She stood, then moved from the kitchen into the family room. Submerging her feet into the hot water, Rose sighed blissfully and flexed her calves. She leaned back in the chair and moaned. \u201cNothing\u2019s ever felt so good.\u201d</p> <p>Sasha snorted. \u201cI suppose I should be offended, but since I\u2019m responsible for your look of sublime pleasure, I\u2019ll let it inflate my ego.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure your ego is inflated without my approval or pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He knelt down and lifted one of her feet, drying it off before he began to rub lotion up and down her calf. \u201cMind my cheat sheet, love. I downloaded it before entering the black hole of cell phone signals otherwise known as your house.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at his phone, she could barely make out the instructions. \u201cAre those fun to play with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have more fun playing with me.\u201d His fingers drifted to the arch of her foot. She giggled and jerked, almost kicking him in the chest. \u201cGood God, woman, behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too ticklish,\u201d she gasped.</p> <p>\u201cFine, we\u2019ll go to painting straightaway then.\u201d Letting go of her foot, he rummaged through the bucket and pulled out two different polishes. One was dark blue mixed with glitter and the other a bright pink. \u201cPick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one do you think I like?\u201d she asked, feeling a little flirty.</p><p>His gaze dropped to the bottles and she watched with a sinking heart as he placed the dark blue one on the floor. That was the one she wanted. It reminded her of midnight skies with sparkling stars. \u201cGalaxy suits you,\u201d he said and gently lobbed the pink one to the side. \u201cSo does being pampered.\u201d</p><p>She peered at him through her lashes, a shy smile covering her face. \u201cI think being pampered by you suits me.\u201d</p><p>He paused and tilted his head to the side, his eyes glinting in the firelight. \u201cIt suits me to pamper you, love,\u201d he murmured and bent his golden head to see to his work.</p><p>Sublime pleasure filled Rose.</p><p>After she\u2019d been properly polished, Rose held her hands out and wiggled her fingers, grinning. \u201cThat was my very first manicure and pedicure.\u201d</p><p>He paused in the middle of cleaning off the kitchen table. \u201cHonestly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded and stuck out a foot. Silver sparkles caught the light as Blackbeard examined her pinky toe. \u201cI\u2019ll help you finish cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve been up since six. I\u2019ll take care of this,\u201d he said, dumping liquid dish soap in a sink rapidly filling with hot water. \u201cYou take Ivy and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Impulsively, Rose ran over to Sasha and gave him a brief hug. \u201cThank you.\u201d Then she turned away, not wanting to see his reaction. She unfastened Ivy, scooped her out and bolted for her bedroom.</p><p>On Thursday evening, she found him at the stove, wearing her grandmother\u2019s apron.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d He waved a spatula at the nearest chair. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on tonight\u2019s menu?\u201d The aroma made her mouth water in anticipation.</p><p>Sasha placed three bowls on the table, only two with serving spoons. \u201cA very special meal.\u201d He pointed to each dish. \u201cRoasted butternut squash, sazda with nyama, and for dessert, mapopo candy. It\u2019s made from papaya. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes it so special?\u201d she asked as he removed the apron, folding and setting it on the counter.</p><p>He moved to the table and sat down beside her. \u201cIt\u2019s a traditional dish of Masvingo. That\u2019s where my mum lived when she was little.\u201d Pinching off a bite-size portion of what looked like a thick tortilla, he rolled it in his palm and dipped the ball in the meat stew.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar away from here.\u201d He lifted it to her mouth. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to feed me?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a crooked grin. \u201cSharing food is something that family does in Masvingo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She squirmed in her chair. Somehow the act of him feeding her seemed very intimate, something lovers did for one another.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not poison, Rose.\u201d He dipped the ball of sazda, then drew air circles with it. \u201cOne bite, love.\u201d</p><p>Feeling slightly silly, she barely opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWider.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she widened it and Sasha\u2019s green eyes glinted.</p><p>\u201cNot that wide\u2014I don\u2019t want to actually watch you chew it.\u201d</p><p>Jerking back, she began to clamp her lips together, but he popped it in before they closed. Flavor exploded in her mouth and she moaned in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cWhat every man most likes to hear when a woman has her mouth full of his...cooking.\u201d Sasha waggled his eyebrows as she chewed.</p><p>She giggled. \u201cMore please.\u201d</p><p>He fed her another bite. \u201cThat particular phrase a close second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, I\u2019ll choke.\u201d Somehow she managed to swallow and he fed her yet another bite.</p><p>\u201cThird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I get to feed you,\u201d she said, pinching off a bite-sized portion of the thick tortilla, rolling it in her hand, then dipping it in the meat stew. He grinned as she held it up to his mouth. His lips parted and she pushed the sazda inside.</p><p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d he said, after chewing and swallowing it down.</p><p>They fed each other. Sasha purposefully nipping at her fingers when it was her turn. She couldn\u2019t stop giggling. \u201cQuit biting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I like the extra flavor,\u201d he said with a teasing smile. \u201cOne last bite then dessert, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She began to part her lips, but the heat of his gaze stopped her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes this time,\u201d he gently ordered, his voice husky.</p><p>Her lashes fluttered down, but she quickly opened her eyes again to find him leaning closer. So close that she could count the freckles on his nose. Forget counting them, she wanted to kiss each one. Instead she concentrated on the meal he\u2019d fixed. So simple, yet so exotic. Unexpected.</p><p>As if sensing her inner turmoil, he set the sazda in the middle of his plate and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve shared this with since both of my parents were alive.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she wiped her mouth with a cloth napkin, then set it on the table. \u201cWhy\u2019s your mom in a coma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFailing health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what made her health fail in the first place?\u201d She wanted, no she needed, him to be honest with her.</p><p>His jaw worked and his eyes got a faraway look to them. \u201cDrunk driver hit the car we were in. The shite facilities did the rest.\u201d He stood and grabbed one of the bowls, then dumped it into the sink. \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about dessert? I promise to keep my eyes closed this time,\u201d she said, trying to tease him.</p><p>\u201cThis was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>Before she knew what she was doing, she had risen from her chair and crossed the small space between them. Laying a hand on his arm, she gave a light squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, you know.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck with his hand, looking like he\u2019d rather be anywhere else than with her. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so? Were you the drunk driver?\u201d Her heart began to pound in her chest. Was that why he refrained from drinking most of the time?</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do when you found out that those facilities were bad?\u201d</p><p>His hand dropped and curled into a fist. \u201cPersuaded the powers that be to move her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d she said, giving him a gentle smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not the bad guy you pretend to be.\u201d</p><p>He briefly raised his brows and flattened his lips. \u201cAs much as I hate repetition, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>She wound her arms around his unyielding form and leaned against him. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Sure he\u2019d made really bad decisions, but the things he did to make up for them, to make it up to her were more than lip service.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2014\u201d He placed his hand under her chin, tilting it up to meet his hard gaze, \u201c\u2014because I want to do very bad things to you.\u201d</p><p>Heat flooded her body, finding the tips of her fingers and the ends of her toes. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He cupped her breast, his thumb rubbing across her nipple. \u201cTouch you here.\u201d</p><p>It tightened in response and she arched into the sheer pleasure of his touch. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you little temptress, that\u2019s not all.\u201d He sank to his knees and ran his hands under the bottom of her flowered skirt and up her legs. \u201cHold this.\u201d</p><p>She grasped the material with one hand and gripped the countertop with the other to keep from melting to the floor.</p><p>He pressed heated kisses to her leg along the way, his hot breath wafting against her skin in delicious waves. \u201cI want to tie you to my bed and have you at my mercy.\u201d His talented tongue found her birthmark and traced it, making her gasp and tremble. \u201cI want to lick cream from your nipples while you ride me. I want to put raspberries here\u2014\u201d His fingers slid under her panties and lightly stroked her, \u201c\u2014and feast.\u201d</p><p>A low moan erupted from her throat. She could barely draw in enough air as he tugged her panties down her legs. Grabbing her hips with his large hands, he turned her so that she leaned against the counter.</p><p>Eyes as dark and mysterious as the forest sought hers. \u201cLet me love you this way.\u201d</p><p>Flustered she looked around the room, belatedly remembering Ivy was snug in her crib upstairs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only you and me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, she managed a nod and hitched her skirt higher, legs trembling.</p><p>The first pass of his tongue made her knees buckle and his hands slid to her bottom, anchoring her. His tongue delved, parting the damp curls and she tensed, waiting for his tender assault. Apparently, Sasha had other ideas. Ideas that made her weak and wet.</p><p>He lightly stroked her, teased her as the tip of his tongue traced the delicate folds. Looking down, she watched him as his lips pressed against her, his head moving in gentle nods. She moaned at the carnal sight.</p><p>He clutched her bottom tighter and pressed his tongue deeper. Finally-finally- stroking her where she ached the most. Over and over, until she was shaking and biting her lip to keep from screaming.</p><p>He hummed low in his throat and looked up, his lips shiny with her. \u201cYou are delectable.\u201d He kissed her curls before asking, \u201cShall I continue?\u201d</p><p>Rose grabbed his head with her free hand, pulling him back to her. \u201cGod, yes.\u201d The next few flicks of his tongue had her moaning his name. Another slide and she shattered into fragmented pieces of herself.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she leaned heavily against the counter and felt his hands leave her. But it wasn\u2019t enough. She wanted more. She needed more. Him. Sasha.</p><p>Rising to his feet, he kissed the side of her neck, sucking at a tender spot. She could feel his erection as it rubbed the cradle of her hips through his pants.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d She was more than willing to satisfy him.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me to your bed, here...it doesn\u2019t matter where...I still want you.\u201d</p><p>He swept her up in his arms and placed her on the counter, then groaned. \u201cYou deserve a bed.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her in his arms once more, he practically ran down the hall, taking the stairs two at a time. Several heartbeats later he threw her into the middle of his bed, his body covering hers. His tongue invaded the seam of her lips, easing inside with a finesse that made her want to weep and tear his hair out.</p><p>She parted her thighs and he rocked against her. Wanting more, she struggled to wrap her legs around his hips, but her skirt was tangled around her knees.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>He pushed the elastic waistband of her skirt over her hips and down her legs. Desperate to have him, she jerked his sweater over his head and reached for his pants, but he\u2019d beaten her to it.</p><p>He stood and kicked them away. Hooking his thumbs into the waistband of his boxer briefs, he shoved them down and off. Then he gave her a pirate\u2019s smile and jumped on the bed again, enveloping her in his arms while his heavy erection pressed against her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m overdressed,\u201d she whispered against his throat.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have that.\u201d He stripped away the remainder of her clothes while she kissed and bit at his shoulders, his chin and earlobe. \u201cYou remember everything I like, don\u2019t you?\u201d he growled in her ear.</p><p>\u201cIt suits me,\u201d she said playfully.</p><p>Cool air washed over her nipples and his hot mouth covered one as it tightened. She arched off the bed when he began to suck deeply. She writhed beneath him, his hands and mouth everywhere. There wasn\u2019t a part of him that didn\u2019t cover her. No matter which way she turned, his hands were there to caress her hip, her arm or cheek. Unable, it seemed, to let any part of her go untouched. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His arm flung out, his hand opening the small drawer in the dresser beside the bed. She rose to her knees as he did the same, unwilling to lose the close contact of his body. Her curls hung down her back and cascaded over her arms as she rubbed against him. She heard the sound of foil being torn open.</p><p>\u201cRosebud, you are so damn lovely,\u201d he said and quickly sheathed his erection with a condom.</p><p>She turned away and crawled up the mattress. He covered her from behind, kissing her neck and she balanced herself on her hands and knees, ready for him.</p> <p>Instead he gently bore her back to the bed. \u201cNot this time, love. I much rather look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. The back of her head hit the mattress and his body covered hers, hot and muscular, the metal of his nipple rings making depressions in her chest. She reached between them and pinched one, eliciting a groan. She felt his erection against her and she widened her thighs, desperate to have him inside. \u201cNow, oh God...now.\u201d He thrust deeply and she jolted at his invasion, trying to accommodate his size.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he exhaled and dropped his head to the curve of her neck. Repositioning her hips with his hands, he murmured her name and thrust again, filling her completely this time.</p><p>\u201cSasha,\u201d she moaned and wrapped her legs around his lean hips.</p><p>His breath steamed against her skin, his lips and teeth working together to find every sensitive spot along the column of her throat. She dug her nails into his back, relishing the feel of his muscles as they gathered and flexed beneath her hands. His body moved with precision as he filled her.</p> <p>Letting go of her hips, he sank his hands into her hair, holding her head still as he began to ravage her mouth, the thrusts of his tongue driving her wild. She drew it deeper as she drew him deeper inside of her. Her heart pounded as moan after moan filled the room. Hers and his blending with the steady rhythm of the bed creaking as they moved together.</p><p>Straining against him, she unlocked her legs and braced her feet on the mattress. \u201cMore,\u201d she whispered in his ear and bit down on the lobe.</p><p>As if something had been keeping him in check until that very moment, his hips pistoned and Sasha\u2019s eyes roll to the back of his head with the pleasure of it. Rose felt beyond incredible. Beyond soft and sweet as her body held him so damn tightly within that he\u2019d nearly came when he\u2019d made the initial breach.</p><p>Faster and harder he rocked against her, unable to do more than grab her wrists with one hand and pin them against the bed. He loved this, being inside of her, giving her pleasure and he wanted to feel her orgasm around his cock.</p><p>Suddenly, her muscles clamped down on him and he groaned at the unspeakable pleasure. \u201cCan you come again?\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful blue eyes were glazed with passion when they opened. \u201cYes...yes.\u201d</p> <p>Angling his pelvis higher, he rolled his hips and she cried out. He smiled with pure male satisfaction and did it again. This time she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cAgain, Rosebud. Make those pretty sounds again.\u201d He undulated against her and she responded with more moans until he wasn\u2019t sure what was turning him on more\u2014the feel or sound of his Rose.</p><p>Sweat beaded his brow and his hair plastered his forehead as he continued to move. He didn\u2019t care if it took all damn night to make her come this way. His cock jumped and he fought the urge to let go. Okay, so maybe not all night.</p><p>He looked down at his lover, watching her beautiful face as she threw her head back. Her breasts were lifted perfectly for him, and he bent down, drawing a red tip into his mouth.</p><p>She cried out and her inner muscles clamped down hard on his cock. He sucked deeper and rolled his hips again as she came. As she fluttered around him. As his own orgasm made his erection surge and jump. He continued to thrust as his orgasm poured out of him, wishing that this moment was endless. Wishing that he could stay in her arms forever.</p><p>Finally, he released her nipple and it popped out of his mouth.</p><p>She giggled, then sighed.</p><p>He looked up at her, letting go of her wrists and halting the movements of his hips.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, her lashes fluttering to rest on flushed cheeks before lifting again and making his heart turn over.</p><p>\u201cHullo, love.\u201d He kissed the tip of her nose.</p><p>Supple arms came around his shoulders, drawing him down to her chest. \u201cCan I sleep with you tonight?\u201d Her voice was barely above a whisper and seemingly guarded.</p><p>It was her house. Why in the hell would she...He closed his eyes for a moment.</p><p>Mistaking his silence for a no. She began to squirm. \u201cNever mind. I don\u2019t know why I asked. I\u2019m-I\u2019ll just go back to my room now. It\u2019s probably for the best anyway. I mean, Skye used to tell me I tossed and turned all night. So I\u2019m sure I would be a bother and Blackbeard would be jealous.\u201d</p><p>Skye and Blackbeard? Rose\u2019s reference to sleeping with someone, actually going to sleep, included her sister and that damn cat? Even as he still rested inside of her, he had to know. \u201cWhat would your former lovers have to say about that?\u201d</p><p>The room was silent as he listened to the rapid beat of her heart. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPicked the quiet types, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe, they usually drove me back to my store after our...dates.\u201d</p><p>Sasha would bet his life she\u2019d meant lover in the singular sense. As in Jason Everett. He turned and placed his elbows on each side of her shoulders. \u201cAnd the other times?\u201d</p><p>Her impossibly blue eyes widened before she looked away. \u201cI walked.\u201d</p><p>That asshole had made her walk? \u201cRose, that\u2019s not...\u201d He let his head drop to her chest and he concentrated on breathing. Slowly. Picturing ways to castrate the son of a bitch helped.</p><p>\u201cIt was spring, and I like walking. The trees were really pretty, too.\u201d</p><p>Oh, good God, she was rambling. Castration was too good for his former lawyer. He would go all out and get rid of everything. \u201cJason doesn\u2019t deserve your defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t defending him.\u201d Her gaze swung back to his and her mouth formed a perfect O when she realized what she\u2019d said. \u201cOr any other of my many, many lovers.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and rolled to sit on the edge of the bed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me how many lovers you\u2019ve had\u2014one or a hundred and one. But every woman, especially you, deserves to be treated with decency. Dropping you off like the evening post or making you walk isn\u2019t it. That\u2019s what matters to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never done that?\u201d she said and he glanced over his shoulder as her chin tilted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was taught to treat a woman better than that.\u201d Really? an insidious voice whispered, Did your father teach you to seduce the woman you were ordered to destroy? He grimaced and rose from the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be back and I expect you to be waiting for me,\u201d he called out as he started for the door.</p><p>\u201cSasha?\u201d</p><p>He turned slightly and relief filled him when he saw her climbing under the covers. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Luminous eyes regarded him thoughtfully as she settled against the pillows, her curly black hair a stark contrast to the white pillowcases. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt?\u201d</p><p>Her smile filled the room and his heart. \u201cBeing a very good man.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Sasha leaned against the door frame, watching as Rose lay sleeping in his bed. The sheets rose and fell with her steady breathing. He\u2019d taken his time in the bathroom, rehearsing his lines and then striking them from his brain. She deserved better and there was no way in hell he would go another day without telling her the truth. No matter what it cost him.</p><p>Crossing the room, he gently nudged her bare shoulder and whispered, \u201cRosebud, wake up.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead wrinkled and her lips puckered, reminding him of Ivy when she was displeased. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping.\u201d</p><p>The mattress dipped under his weight as he crawled in beside her, gathering her in his arms. She was deliciously warm, her body pliant as she burrowed into him. He pressed a kiss to the top of her head. \u201cIt can\u2019t wait \u2018til morning, sweetheart,\u201d he said against her curls. \u201cOpen those beautiful eyes and look at me.\u201d</p><p>Black lashes slowly lifted, revealing slumberous blue eyes. At the center he could see his reflection and he swallowed. \u201cI haven\u2019t been entirely honest with you.\u201d</p><p>Slumberous gave way to wary as her body began to tense against his and her hands came between them. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push me away, love,\u201d he said, but she moved to a sitting position and hiked the sheets over her breasts. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known.\u201d She grabbed the cross pendant and looked away.</p><p>Sharp runners of pain unfurled in his chest, cutting into his heart. \u201cWill you give me the chance to explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not? At least I don\u2019t have an audience this time,\u201d she said, her voice flat.</p><p>He clenched his fists so tightly that his knuckles cracked. \u201cI\u2019m not breaking up with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in a relationship to begin with, so you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Closing his eyes, he counted to fifty. This was going so horribly wrong. No matter what he said, she would take it the wrong way. Not that there was a right way. He exhaled and opened his eyes. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a one-night-stand. It\u2019s...we\u2019re more than that.\u201d When she didn\u2019t respond, he leaned over the side of the bed, dug through his trouser pocket and found his cell phone. Quickly searching through his text messages, he found the one from his uncle and held out his phone. \u201cLook at this.\u201d</p><p>The slightest shake of her head had what was left of his heart in his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019m not interested in more of your lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere me out, Rosebud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that, Alexander,\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>Swallowing his pride, he tried pleading with her. \u201cPlease. One look and then I\u2019ll leave. Or stay. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Turning slowly, her black curls slid over her shoulders and swung against his chest, cool silk against his overheated skin. Lashes lowered, she took the phone from him. After a moment, the tight lines around her mouth relaxed and she met his gaze, her eyes glittering with unshed tears.</p><p>\u201cIs that your mom?\u201d</p><p>He scooted closer to her, relieved she didn\u2019t move away. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you really weren\u2019t joking when you said Ivy took after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s Russian and my mum\u2019s Zimbabwean\u2014African. That a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an odd look. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought it would be for her, but this was the South and some things weren\u2019t so easily accepted, even in the twenty-first century. \u201cMy mum\u2019s parents sent her to London for boarding school. Education was really important to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where she met your dad?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAccording to him, it was love at first sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were they together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how difficult it is to be able to be so close to her, but entirely helpless,\u201d she said, her voice soft and compassionate.</p><p>A silky thigh brushed his and he had to make himself not touch her, to not press her back against the mattress and make love to her again. \u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left the night I turned sixteen,\u201d she said, her tone so matter of fact that he wanted to take her in his arms. \u201cThe next morning, Skye and I came downstairs to an empty house. Summer wasn\u2019t around, so...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI took over everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been tough to do with school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dropped out.\u201d She exhaled, her breath shaky. \u201cIt was too exhausting trying to work and keep up with my grades. And I was afraid that if I asked for help that Skye would be taken away from me. Later, I studied my tail off and got my GED.\u201d</p><p>Breaking his own rule, he captured one of her capable hands. Despite the work she did, they were soft and supple. He admired the hell out of her. Not many sixteen year olds would have bothered to try to keep their family together. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing, Rose. What about university...sorry, college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone\u2019s meant for college,\u201d she said, her fingers curling around his. \u201cBesides, I have a business to run.\u201d</p><p>His admiration for her grew. Such an intelligent, sexy woman he had in his bed right now. \u201cDo you miss your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cMostly when I needed advice on how to take care of a baby. Contrary to popular belief, women aren\u2019t born with the knowledge.\u201d</p><p>Pressing a kiss to her knuckles, he placed her hand back in safer territory. \u201cYou\u2019re a good provider, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your dad around?\u201d He knew absolutely nothing about the man, not even a name. His uncle\u2019s lawyers had informed him that there wasn\u2019t a father listed on Rose\u2019s birth certificate.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not someone I want in my life.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to ask her more, but she looked so uncomfortable that he refrained. There was the possibility she had no idea who her father was. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in your mother raising the three of you by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the last thing I\u2019d be ashamed about.\u201d She slid away so that her thigh no longer touched his. \u201cWho\u2019s that man hovering beside your mom?\u201d</p><p>The bane of his existence. \u201cMy Uncle Vladimir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks menacing.\u201d She handed the phone back to him and brushed a strand of hair behind one ear. \u201cI\u2019d already made up my mind to believe you about your mom, even before you showed me this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I shared it. I want total honesty with you.\u201d</p><p>An elegant black brow arched. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time we met was no accident. I came to your store to talk to one of the Holland women. My uncle sent me here after reading about the legend of the spring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe tourist attraction?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a knowing look. \u201cThat spring is more than just a tourist attraction. People believe in it. It made a cut over my eye better, freshened up my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHerbs,\u201d she said, confusing the hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>A small smile flitted over her lips. \u201cLater.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, I was able to get samples of it the night you took me there, and had them sent to my uncle\u2019s Helsinki labs. He was the one who called while we were, ah, otherwise occupied at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean seducing the most gullible woman in existence and leaving when you\u2019d had enough?\u201d</p><p>Had enough? There was no such thing when it came to Rose. He\u2019d never get enough of her. \u201cNot gullible, incredibly sweet. Caring. The brief time we spent together was the absolute best I\u2019d had in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am a Holland, and we aim to please the men around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Rose, stop putting yourself down.\u201d He banged the back of his head against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cIs your uncle a scientist?\u201d</p> <p>He blinked at her change in subject or rather redirection. Women were entirely baffling and would most likely remain so until he was decrepit. \u201cDo you ever watch the telly?\u201d</p><p>She lifted a dainty shoulder. \u201cUnlike some people, I don\u2019t have time.\u201d</p><p>Meaning people like him. People who did nothing but play and use others for personal gain. \u201cHe\u2019s a very powerful businessman, a bully, actually. Long story short: the samples were no good. The people that work for him know there\u2019s another spring. One that feeds the tourist attraction.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s expression barely changed, but her fingers began to rub at her cross. \u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn international water bottling company is interested in your land. They want Holland Springs to be the location of their North American headquarters. And they want to put a plant here.\u201d Glancing at the picture of his mother and uncle, he clenched his teeth. He\u2019d been told not to play the hero. Hell, he\u2019d never wanted to be the hero. Not until a woman with infrequent smiles and beautiful eyes had entered his life. \u201cIf I don\u2019t find the source and get samples sent off in time, my uncle will move my mum to a place that\u2019s a guaranteed death sentence.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cHow can he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVladimir can do any damn thing he wants. He\u2019s the executor of my father\u2019s estate and makes all of the medical decisions for my mother until I\u2019m thirty. Less than two years away, but it seems like eternity.\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned on her face, and he wanted to kiss her. She let go of the cross pendant. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done this, is it?\u201d</p> <p>So great was his relief that he could barely get out the words, \u201cIt\u2019s been my life for the past nine years. He started using me when I was nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she gasped, \u201cThat\u2019s why you were in the Johnsons\u2019 cucumber field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason he had the living hell beat out of me is because he can\u2019t actually allow my mother to die. Who\u2019d be his minion then? But she\u2019s a little stronger now, more stable.\u201d Self-loathing shot through his veins, corroding them with its poison. As always he was trading someone else\u2019s life for his mother\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYour uncle\u2019s flat out evil,\u201d she said.</p><p>So was he, if only by association. Rose had to know the full extent of his sordid past. \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t mind doing things for my uncle,\u201d he said, not bothering to spin it and paint himself as a victim. Only women like his mother and Rose were victims of his uncle\u2019s schemes. \u201cWell, to be honest... I rather liked it. The attention I received from him. The illusion of control and power. All for starting a rumor or hacking into personal email accounts to dig up dirt. Or finding incriminating pictures\u2014you wouldn\u2019t believe what people store on their computers. It was as if I had replaced the son he didn\u2019t want with the one who\u2019d do anything for him.\u201d</p><p>Rose made a little noise. \u201cBy loving you with conditions. That\u2019s not love. It\u2019s manipulation, plain and simple.\u201d</p><p>She said it with such conviction that he wondered at it, but he had to get everything out. He couldn\u2019t stop it. He didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cEventually, I wised up and started saying no. Then Vladimir began playing Russian Roulette with my mother\u2019s health. The first time he put her at Childer\u2019s, they didn\u2019t check on her for days and she got an infection that nearly killed her. Sometimes, I think he\u2019s toying with me for his sadistic pleasure. Only when she\u2019s too weak for even the people he buys off to move does he take it out on me.\u201d He turned the phone over and over in his hand. \u201cI hate him, but I hate myself even more.\u201d Face heating and stomach roiling, he looked away. \u201cIf you only knew the things I\u2019ve done, the lives I\u2019ve ruined\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, placing her hand on his chest.</p><p>Grabbing her hand, he pressed it tightly against his skin and made himself look at her. \u201cI swear to you...I swear on my father\u2019s grave I didn\u2019t set out to seduce or use you. I tried to keep my distance, but I\u2014you\u2019ve, for lack of a better word, bewitched me, and I fell under your spell. Willingly.\u201d He gave her the barest hint of a wicked grin before he sobered. \u201cIvy as well. With the exception of my mother, the two of you are the last people on this planet I want to hurt.\u201d</p><p>When she said nothing, he let go of her hand and it fell away. Cold air rushed over his chest. He chucked his phone on the nightstand. There was no going back now. Any minute Rose would storm out of here in completely righteous indignation. Perhaps even kick him out before she got to the door. But he deserved it. He deserved every last drop of her vengeance.</p><p>Suddenly, Rose threw back the covers and got out of bed. He watched in disbelief as she grabbed a shirt from the wardrobe and hastily put it on. Not until she finished rolling up the sleeves did she look at him and say in an exasperated tone, \u201cAren\u2019t you coming with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She wasn\u2019t kicking him out?</p><p>Her spine straightened and she seemed to grow taller as she smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going to help you keep your mom safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he croaked. Jesus, he sounded like a right git.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rescue you and your mom,\u201d she said slowly, as if speaking to a small child who was refusing to listen.</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t this the part where you kick me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurse me with impotence?\u201d</p><p>One side of her perfect lips lifted at the corner, her gaze sliding over his body and arousing him to madness. Tempting him to jump out of bed, only to get right back in it with her.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I deprive myself?\u201d she asked in her soft drawl, and the fine hair on the back of his neck rose.</p><p>He gulped. \u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d</p><p>Laying one hand against her chest, her fingers began to toy with a button. \u201cBecause your momma needs it. You need it, too.\u201d Her head dipped. When she lifted it, a wealth of emotion filled her eyes. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to have the people who should be looking out for you leave you to fend for yourself. Or worse.\u201d</p><p>Her words were entirely meaningful and kind. And extremely Rose. But his humiliation couldn\u2019t have been more glaring in his mind. \u201cDon\u2019t pity me, sweetheart, I chose this life. Never forget that. Never forget that I am a very bad man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho does very nice things to try to make up for it. A very bad man wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d She let her arm fall to the side.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t afflict me with qualities I can\u2019t possibly survive.\u201d He raised his knee and rested his arm on it, looking around the room. The idea of someone helping him was foreign. It was almost too much, but like any other drowning man, he would grab on tight and never let go. \u201cWhen everything is said and done, I\u2019ll have to leave. But I\u2019ll come back to...Holland Springs if you want me to.\u201d Ask me, he silently commanded. Ask me to stay with you and we\u2019ll...He mentally shook his head. They would do nothing, because his mother would never be safe. It would be damned unfair to ask her to wait two years for him. Like a valiant soldier going off to war. As if he\u2019d ever had that noble of a purpose. Hell, his entire life was purposeless.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Rose swallowed, her body alternately flashing hot and cold. \u201cI understand, but come back here because you want to, not because you feel like you have to,\u201d she said as her heart broke into a thousand pieces and her soul screamed no. She wanted him to stay with her. Forever. However, for them and every Poppy Holland before her, the third time was not going to be the charm. It never was, according to her mother. Not since Marcus Summersby had a man stuck around for a Holland woman.</p><p>This time it wasn\u2019t because of her reputation or wanting to keep up good town appearances like her deadbeat father. It was all because a vindictive, evil man threatened Sasha\u2019s mother. And would keep threatening her until she either died or Sasha turned thirty. There was no way she could leave a helpless woman to that fate, not if it meant Phoebe remaining where she was for a few months longer.</p><p>A few months more bearable for the man Rose loved. A man that she\u2019d never tell, because she was afraid it would destroy her. As if to say those words out loud gave them power.</p><p>\u201cI do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet some clothes on and I\u2019ll grab the baby monitor.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to hear his reasons for why he couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t come back.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a confused look.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go right this instance.\u201d He rose from the bed, all graceful masculine lines as he walked across the room. In a matter of seconds, he was standing in front of her. Slowly and very deliberately, he unbuttoned her shirt as he stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHas this ever been something you\u2019ve done before?\u201d Another button slid out of its constraints and her breath hitched.</p><p>He gave her a wicked smile, his knuckles brushing her skin. Goose bumps rose and her nipples tightened. \u201cI might have undressed a woman a time or two before.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to laugh, but she just couldn\u2019t. \u201cYou know what I meant.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew serious. \u201cI make it a priority to never get intimately involved.\u201d His large hands cupped her shoulders, sliding the rich material over them. He dropped a kiss on the side of her neck, then ran his hands down the curves of her body.</p><p>A small hum of pleasure began to vibrate through her formerly sated body. Reaching out, she ran her fingers over his muscular chest, through the light sifting of hair and over his pierced nipples. Leaning forward, she licked one and smiled against his skin as his body lightly convulsed. She looked up and her heart tripled its beat.</p><p>A predator\u2019s smile covered his face. \u201cI mean to have you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spring,\u201d she said and nipped his chin.</p><p>His hand found the small of her back and pressed her closer, his hard body flush against hers. Her knees dissolved like sugar in hot tea. \u201cLater, Rosebud,\u201d he said and claimed her mouth.</p><p>Drowsy and content (and much, much later), Rose found herself tangled up with Sasha. His legs entwined with hers, his fingers in her hair as he pressed kiss after kiss to her upturned face. Silly kisses, hot open-mouthed kisses down her throat and soft, sweet kisses pressed to her lips that stole her breath away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me wet,\u201d she scolded and tucked her nose into his throat.</p><p>He laughed, a deep rumbling sound that made his chest vibrate. \u201cA permanent condition when you\u2019re around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopeless man.\u201d She closed her eyes, feeling safer and more secure than she had in years. There was something about lying in bed with him that made her feel cherished and protected. Sasha\u2019s personality was larger than life and at times, one she believed could help fight all of her battles.</p><p>Blackbeard meowed and jumped on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Sasha growled.</p><p>Rose opened her eyes in time to see her kitty knead his claws into Sasha chest.</p><p>Sasha tried to shove the cat off of him. \u201cI\u2019m not a bloody scratching post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he thinks you smell like catnip.\u201d She giggled as Blackbeard deigned to flop on his side, flicking his tail so that the tip smacked Sasha in the mouth.</p><p>\u201cBeastly little bugger.\u201d The cat purred as Sasha stroked him, a rueful smile on his face. \u201cSell any cat protection charms in your store? Hell, I\u2019d settle for a protection charm of any kind.\u201d</p><p>The cross at her throat slid to her collarbone, the metal hot against her skin. She had to get it off. She had... Quickly sitting up, she reached for the clasp on the necklace she wore.</p><p>Sasha laid a hand on her arm. \u201cI was only teasing, love. Blackbeard can scratch me up as much as he likes.\u201d</p><p>A brief moment later she held the chain in front of her, the gold cross throwing a shadow across the bed covers. She turned to him, unsure of what to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you about?\u201d He sat up, sending Blackbeard to the end of the bed.</p><p>Her neck felt strangely light without it. She began to panic, pulse racing as her palms became sweaty. The last time she\u2019d taken it off for him, he\u2019d hurt her. But that was before she knew about what drove him. About the evil that tried to posses him. \u201cHold still.\u201d Before she could change her mind, she fastened it around his neck and looked into his green eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stunned, Sasha could only stare back.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she said, giving the cross a pat and him a kiss on the jaw before she scooted down and turned on her side to face him. She propped a hand under the side of her head. \u201cThis will protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He wished like hell he could give it back; he didn\u2019t deserve something so precious to her. \u201cHow long should I wear this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours to keep.\u201d She traced the outline of the cross with the tip of her finger.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I\u2019ve never seen you without it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe first Poppy Holland gave it to her husband to keep him safe when he had to sail back to the Old World. The one time he took it off, he got sick and died.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. Perhaps that was what he should do. Take the damned thing off and wait for death. \u201cDo you have any stories about any Poppy Holland that end happily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said without a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cSurprising, that.\u201d He gazed up at the ceiling for a moment. \u201cHold on\u2014you said husband. Holland women are allowed to marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said we weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Sasha raised his brows.</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because no one\u2019s been man enough to take the Holland name as his own since Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said, even though he didn\u2019t at all. Why the hell did it matter who had what last name?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always been a Poppy Holland in Holland Springs and there always will be. No matter how much she wants things to be different,\u201d she said flatly, her body tensing.</p> <p>\u201cCome here, love,\u201d he murmured, drawing her down to him and refusing to let her shut him out. \u201cWhat\u2019s the criteria for being the newest Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe the first-born daughter.\u201d Rose snuggled against him, her bare breasts pressed against his skin.</p><p>\u201cSo Summer has to come back\u2014not just for Ivy, but because it\u2019s tradition in Holland Springs?\u201d He idly played with the curls in her hair. Curls that not so long ago had draped his thighs as her clever mouth did things that made him groan and fist the bed covers.</p><p>\u201cSummer doesn\u2019t give a damn about tradition, not that it matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that will change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d She flicked her tongue against one of his nipple rings. \u201cLet\u2019s have some wine.\u201d</p><p>It sounded like a fine idea to him, but he didn\u2019t relish the thought of leaving her very delectable body to venture downstairs. She leaned across his body, surprising the hell out him when she came back with two glasses filled with red liquid.</p><p>\u201cYou can toast.\u201d</p> <p>He twisted his head around, eyes widening when he saw the dusty bottle sitting on the bedside table. \u201cHow in the holy hell did that get into my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic,\u201d Rose said, her breath hot against his skin as she nibbled a path along his shoulder.</p><p>He jerked his head back, his body rising to her silent invitation. Jesus, his neck would be suffering from whiplash tomorrow morning. \u201cWicked woman,\u201d he said with a smile. He didn\u2019t give a damn how the bottle of wine or glasses came to be in his room. She bit his nipple and he groaned. \u201cHave mercy.\u201d Especially when she did that.</p><p>She tipped the glass to his lips and he drank deeply, then she did the same.</p><p>\u201cI need you inside of me,\u201d she said, her voice low and seductive as the wine worked its way through his body, fueling his desire for her.</p><p>Plucking the wine glasses from her hands, he set them to the side and rolled her on her back. Rose parted her legs and her hands drifted down, covering his cock with a condom.</p><p>\u201cMagic,\u201d she whispered again in answer to his obviously astonished face.</p><p>The necklace pulled tight as their mouths fused and he thrust inside of her, the snug fit nearly his undoing. \u201cSweet Jesus.\u201d He lifted her leg over his arm and thrust again, closing the eyes to the pleasure and her throaty moans.</p><p>\u201cSasha.\u201d She pulled him to her, the taste of wine on her tongue intoxicating.</p><p>Again and again he moved, deeper and deeper. Out of control as she met each thrust, her fingers digging in his back and shoulders. Acute lust and desire swept through him as her lush body welcomed his. He licked her nipples, smiling in complete male satisfaction as they hardened.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t enough. He sat back on his thighs, taking Rose with him. \u201cHold on to me.\u201d</p><p>Finding a rhythm that seemed to please her, he listened as she chanted his name. It sounded like a prayer, a plea. An incantation.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t speak, could barely think as she wrapped herself around him. Plump hips rocked upon him and his mouth watered. She was so damn soft in all the right places, so sweetly perfect for him that he wanted to devour her. To taste every inch of her creamy skin until it was firmly branded on his tongue. His soul.</p><p>Rose tightened around his cock and cried out.</p><p>He cursed, guttural and long as his own orgasm swept over him in erotic waves. Panting, he let his head fall back, reveling in the small kisses she pressed to his throat.</p><p>\u201cSo sleepy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have agreed more, but he was too damn tired to say the words. He stretched out on the bed, keeping himself inside of her and closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll clean...in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s fingertips lightly touched his mouth. \u201cHush.\u201d</p><p>Smiling against them, he exhaled and let sleep claim him.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Sasha woke to a pounding in his head. He rubbed the heel of his hand in his eye, trying to clear the fog from his brain. He\u2019d only had a mouthful of wine last night, but the pounding intensified. Apparently, homebrews were extremely powerful. Jesus. He\u2019d never touch the stuff again.</p><p>Grabbing a pillow, he pressed it over his face. \u201cMake it stop.\u201d</p><p>Rose stirred beside him. \u201cWhat in the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHangover,\u201d he said to the pillow. \u201cThe pounding won\u2019t go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I answer the door it would.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head, looking at her from beneath his pillow. \u201cThat some kind of witchy remedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s what people do when somebody knocks on it.\u201d She frowned and threw back the covers.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, his head wasn\u2019t actually pounding, his eyes didn\u2019t feel like someone was stabbing him in them, nor was his mouth all cottony. Actually he felt amazing. He tossed the pillow across the room.</p><p>Someone pounded on the door again.</p><p>He winced. \u201cThat\u2019ll wake up Ivy, inconsiderate ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. I was up with her a couple of hours ago.\u201d She waved her hand. \u201cI put the baby monitor over there. So far, so good.\u201d</p><p>Sasha tugged on her arm. \u201cGet over here and warm me, woman.\u201d The doorbell rang and he let go of her. \u201cThat had better be someone with a check for millions,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d She rose from the bed, a goddess of the morning with black curls streaming down her back and pale skin revealed with movement. Her perfect breasts bounced as she grabbed the quilt from the end of the bed and wrapped it around her.</p><p>\u201cNot in that you\u2019re not.\u201d He jumped up from the bed and scooped Rose up, quilt and all.</p><p>\u201cPut me down,\u201d she laughingly protested.</p><p>She felt so right in his arms, so good and as she gazed up at him, her blue eyes radiated happiness. \u201cNever. I quite like sweeping you off your feet,\u201d he teased.</p><p>The pounding on the door started up again and he rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a grown woman.\u201d</p><p>He gazed appreciatively at her. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of that.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and wrapped her arms around his neck. The quilt dipped lower, exposing her cherry-red nipples to the room and him. \u201cI can also open doors without help.\u201d</p><p>Lowering her to the bed, he nuzzled the valley between her breasts. \u201cLet\u2019s ignore them, shall we?\u201d He tongued the tip of one, then placed an open mouth over it and began to lightly tug.</p><p>\u201cSasha, please...\u201d She grabbed his head, but he noticed that she didn\u2019t stop him. The pounding started up again. \u201cSasha, it\u2019ll wake up the baby.\u201d</p><p>Kissing her breast one last time, he stood and strode to the window. He shoved it open and yelled, \u201cWho goes there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCircumventing leaving this room while finding out who our would be invader is.\u201d When no answer came, he smiled and gestured to the window. \u201cNow aren\u2019t you glad we didn\u2019t leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with Rose,\u201d a voice called from below. \u201cThis is Sheriff Turner.\u201d</p><p>The cross seemed to burn against his skin. Not this. Not now. They were supposed to wait until after he\u2019d sent the samples to his uncle.</p><p>Rose bolted upright in bed. \u201cOh God, something must be wrong with Skye or Summer.\u201d She shoved past him and out of the room.</p><p>\u201cFuck my life.\u201d Sasha took off after her, then had to turn back around, because he was stark naked. He quickly located a pair of pants and ran down the hall, desperate to reach Rose.</p><p>He could barely make out what the sheriff was saying as he drew closer.</p><p>\u201cGrace period\u2019s run out, Rose...\u201d</p><p>The wind picked up as Turner handed her a large manila envelope. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the weekend to vacate the property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForeclosure? B-but Lorelei agreed to an installment plan. I\u2019m supposed to sign the papers and make the first payment today. Aren\u2019t there procedures for this? I thought we\u2019d go to court or something.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch. The urge to pick up a rock and hurl it at the Sheriff\u2019s mouth to shut him up nearly overwhelmed him. Sasha jogged down the stairs, not missing the death glare from David Turner at his appearance.</p><p>\u201cSorry, honey.\u201d Turner shifted his stance. \u201cI volunteered to bring it out to you. Jason Everett tried to talk one of the new boys into letting him ride along, but I persuaded them otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my store?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff\u2019s face flushed and his eyes narrowed in on Sasha. \u201cThe Powers That Be haven\u2019t gotten around to that piece of business, yet.\u201d</p><p>Rose turned to look at Sasha, black curls whipping around her lovely face. She fisted the quilt tighter in her hand. \u201cDid you know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow about it?\u201d the sheriff said with a harsh laugh. \u201cAccording to Everett, Romanov gave Harrison and him pointers on how to get you out faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou helped them?\u201d Devastation filled her eyes, crippling him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I fell\u2014\u201d Her mouth snapped shut.</p><p>There was nothing Sasha could say to defend himself. It was better this way. Last night had been a mistake of epic proportions. And this morning had almost been a repeat. A brief journey into insanity.</p><p>She squared her shoulders and turned back to the sheriff. \u201cI\u2019m glad you were the one to give me the news, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose, if you and the little one need a place to stay, Missy and I have an extra room. No charge and no time limit,\u201d Turner said. The walkie-talkie secured at his shoulder went off. He leaned his head down and spoke to the dispatcher.</p><p>\u201cTell Missy thank you, but I\u2019ve got a place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that? I heard you\u2019ve got the apartment over your store rented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not say.\u201d Slowly, she turned and walked away from them. Her hair slid forward as she brushed past Sasha, hiding her face.</p><p>Sasha clenched his hands into fists, watching as she shuffled up the stairs.</p><p>Once Rose was out of earshot, he stepped in the doorway and scowled at the Sheriff. \u201cPrepositions not your strong point? You weren\u2019t supposed to serve Ms. Holland until after the samples were sent off. Not before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter, you cold-hearted son of a bitch.\u201d The sheriff crossed his arms and cocked his head to one side. \u201cMs. Holland, my ass. If I could arrest you for taking advantage of her, I would.\u201d</p><p>Sasha looked down his nose and a raindrop hit him on the cheek. \u201cCareful there, Sheriff. Would hate to see you out of a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day men like you will get exactly what they deserve. And I hope to God I\u2019m around to see it.\u201d The sheriff jogged down the stairs and got back in his patrol car.</p><p>One day? The man just had a front row seat.</p><p>The car disappeared in the curve. It began to rain harder, the tops of pine trees lining the road swaying from side to side.</p><p>Sasha closed the door and ran up the stairs, nearly stumbling into Blackbeard.</p><p>The beast hissed at him.</p><p>\u201cOut of my way, damn cat.\u201d</p><p>Blackbeard ignored him, taking every opportunity to try to trip him as he jogged up the grand staircase.</p><p>The cross pendant felt tight around his neck, like a noose. One he deserved.</p><p>When he got to the final landing, he slowed his pace, trying to sort through all the possible things he could say to her. But \u201cwhoops, didn\u2019t think to mention the bit about helping the town was important\u201d wasn\u2019t going to cut it.</p><p>The door to Ivy\u2019s nursery was ajar and he stepped inside. He paused in the middle of the room, listening to Rose as she sang softly to Ivy. The baby\u2019s hands reached for Rose\u2019s curls, grabbing them and cooing.</p><p>Regret hit him hard in the gut. This was what his life had come to\u2014targeting an innocent woman and baby in order to save his mother. At least Rose had a place to go. That much he could be thankful for. He would be the lowest of gutter scum if he\u2019d made her completely homeless. Not that he was far off.</p><p>\u201cDid we wake her?\u201d</p><p>The lullaby abruptly stopped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnce she goes back to sleep, I\u2019ll take you to the spring and you can get your samples,\u201d she said quietly as Ivy\u2019s lids drooped.</p><p>He blinked, unsure if he was hearing her correctly. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to help me?\u201d</p><p>She placed the baby in the crib. \u201cI said I would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRose, I...\u201d he began and tried to grab her arm as she walked by him.</p><p>She jerked back. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He let his hand fall to his side. The need to apologize was overwhelming, but he couldn\u2019t make his mouth and tongue form the words. Finally, he said, \u201cWait until tomorrow to take me to the springs. After the ball, we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll go now and then you\u2019ll get the hell out of my house.\u201d She left him standing in the middle of Ivy\u2019s room.</p><p>The door shut behind them and it took a minute for Rose\u2019s eyes to adjust to the darkness. She shivered, wishing she\u2019d put on a coat. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to watch your head.\u201d</p> <p>Automatically, she turned on the flashlight and began to walk down the corridor made of earth and oak timbers that shored up the sides and ceiling. Normally, she made this trek alone. Normally, her heart wasn\u2019t broken. Normally...Nothing was ever normal for her.</p><p>She could feel Sasha\u2019s presence behind her as they walked. The slight scuffle of his shoes echoed in turn with hers.</p><p>\u201cWho built this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed it for your official report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Rose. I\u2019m trying to make conversation so I won\u2019t go mental in here.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so sincere that she couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cAre you afraid of the dark or closed-in spaces?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Irritated, she stopped suddenly. He rammed into her and sent her to her knees, the firmly packed dirt floor unforgiving. \u201cOw!\u201d The flashlight flew out of her hand and landed on the floor with a thud, shining a long beam of light in the direction they needed to go.</p><p>Sasha swore, his hands patting her head and shoulders before he yanked her up and pressed her close.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, his voice harsh.</p><p>She closed her eyes in the near darkness and breathed in his male scent, wanting to weep at the false sense of comfort his body gave her. At the way his strong arms wrapped around her and made her think that he\u2019d cared for her. But it had all been a lie. He couldn\u2019t even tell her the truth without lying to her.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me. I bet you weren\u2019t ever going to tell me either,\u201d she said, the material of his shirt soft against her cheek.</p><p>He exhaled, his muscular chest falling. \u201cRose, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she whispered as she heard his heart begin to sprint.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her heart began beating furiously. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was trapped in mangled steel for ten hours and had to be cut out of my parents\u2019 car. Confined spaces are not\u2014\u201d his voice cracked slightly and he cleared his throat even as hers thickened in disappointment. \u201c\u2014let\u2019s start moving again before I do something quite ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>As soon as his hands fell away, she stepped back and turned around, striding to the flashlight. She wasn\u2019t falling for his routine. No matter how sincerely anxious he sounded. But she stopped and waited for him to catch up anyway.</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d she muttered. She should have left him to curl up in a ball in the middle of the tunnel. However, being cruel had never been in her nature.</p><p>\u201cI hear water,\u201d he said and her sweater grew tight against her breasts. He had to be holding on to it. \u201cDoes this mean we\u2019re close?\u201d</p><p>Unable to stop herself, she reached back and grabbed his hand, squeezing it reassuringly. \u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Ducking under a particularly low formation of rock, she entered the main room, then turned right and pressed an old-fashioned light switch. Several bulbs connected by a series of cords glowed brightly, chasing away the shadows.</p><p>Behind her, Sasha took a deep breath and let go of her sweater. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller than I expected.\u201d He brushed past her, carrying a box the size of a large cosmetics case in his left hand. He skirted the edge of the spring, then turned to her. \u201cHow deep is it?\u201d</p><p>Rose hit her collar bone with the edge of her hand. \u201cHere, but you have to be careful on the left side. There\u2019s a sudden drop-off and you can feel it sucking at your feet like a drain.\u201d She joined him and stared at the deceptively calm water. \u201cWhatever gets pulled down shows up at the legendary spring. If I know a couple will be there on a certain day and time, I send flowers to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the temperature?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, she said, \u201cNot everything can be explained away.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cThe herbs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can explain.\u201d She pointed to an over-sized chest in the corner. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixture I add three times a week. One that\u2019s been passed down from generation to generation. Hollands have been adding herbs to the springs for over two hundred and fifty years. Supposedly, the mixture can cure everything from toothaches to burns. But not broken hearts, and it can\u2019t make anyone fall in love. Or tell the truth.\u201d Clamping her mouth shut to keep from rambling even more, she turned to face him. He looked resigned. Soon he\u2019d be free. To go wherever he wanted. See whoever he wanted. A little pinch in her heart made her rub the vee-neck of her sweater.</p><p>Sasha\u2019s perfect lips parted, and the hand at his side clenched into a fist as he took a step closer to her. All that separated them was the box he held in his other hand. \u201cI never meant to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>But he had anyway. Over and over. She stepped back and ignored his quasi-apology. \u201cReady to get this over with?\u201d she managed to ask with a completely straight face.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d The smooth line of his jaw clenched and he knelt on the floor, setting the box down and opening it. He pulled out four empty vials and scooped up some water. \u201cI\u2019ll need some time to find out what I can add to this that will seem like a natural impurity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to win.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to ask who \u201chim\u201d was. Shifting her stance, she clicked the flashlight\u2019s on/off button a couple of times as he capped each one off. \u201cWas I payback? A big you-can\u2019t-tell me-what-to-do experiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate and she refused to ask him anything else. After storing the vials and closing the box, he stood and held out his hand. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Rose swallowed, remembering his hands on her body last night, this morning. His fingers teasing and making her cry out in pleasure. His palms gliding over her back and pulling her closer. Holding her, making her feel safe and wanted.</p><p>That was all it had been\u2014a feeling. Fleeting and bruising her poor heart more than she\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>Sighing, she took his hand and they began the dark trek back to the house.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Sasha stood at the front door, wishing Rose would give him a proper send off. Hell, he didn\u2019t care if it involved a knife or a rock. The need to see her alone ate at him, but Skye had shown up fifteen minutes after they\u2019d emerged from the tunnel. He knew without a doubt that he wouldn\u2019t get another chance.</p><p>And as if God was in a really good mood, or out to let the Devil torture him, Rose appeared at the top of the grand staircase and his heart turned over.</p><p>\u201cLeave your house key on the table, and I\u2019ll get the remainder of your rent back to you on Monday,\u201d she said, staring right through him it seemed.</p><p>\u201cKeep it.\u201d</p><p>An elegant brow arched. \u201cFor services rendered?\u201d</p><p>His jaw nearly dropped to the floor. \u201cQuit thinking of yourself like that. You\u2019re not Poppy Holland for Christ\u2019s sake. You have a choice and\u2014\u201d She whirled away from him and disappeared down the hall. \u201cRose, come back.\u201d He strode to the stairs and put one foot on the bottom step, poised to chase after her. But self-preservation, male ego or whatever he wanted to call it stopped him from making a complete arse of himself.</p><p>Blackbeard meowed as he crept into the foyer and threaded through Sasha\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cThis is goodbye, you mangy cur.\u201d Sasha knelt and stroked the feline\u2019s back, making the cat purr. \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve enjoyed sharing a bed with you.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, Sasha gave a last hard look up the stairs, turned on his heel and walked out of the house. He got in his car, not really paying attention to his destination. Before he knew it, he was putting the Mercedes in park at his cousin\u2019s house.</p><p>The cheery home with its white picket fence and carefully tended flowerbeds were the exact opposite of Strawberry Grove. No shutters threatened to fall on his head. The porch steps didn\u2019t creak as he jogged up them and when the door swung open, there was a person responsible for it. It was utter rubbish that he wished to be back there.</p><p>\u201cSasha,\u201d Christian said with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you never happy to see me? After all I\u2019ve done\u2014the late nights, the research, encouraging global debauchery.\u201d Sasha frowned at his cousin\u2019s choice of graphic T-shirt and dark jeans. \u201cIs she dressing you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep, and I\u2019ll thank you not to wake her.\u201d Christian crossed muscular arms over his chest and adjusted his stance to block Sasha from entering.</p><p>Sasha raised a brow and looked down his nose at him, no easy feat considering they were about the same height. \u201cI\u2019m not welcome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Inwardly Sasha cringed. He\u2019d hoped by the time Christian and his wife had returned from their honeymoon, that he\u2019d be forgiven. Apparently, he\u2019d hoped for too much. \u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Sasha rolled his eyes and fiddled with his keys. \u201cNot good with the big words, eh?\u201d</p><p>Uncrossing his arms, Christian leaned back and closed the door behind him. \u201cAs much as you\u2019re like a brother to me, I can\u2019t have you in my life anymore. You don\u2019t work for me. Hell, I don\u2019t need a personal assistant anymore because of all the things you did for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving your ass.\u201d There had been a time in Christian\u2019s life when he\u2019d not made the best of choices. Sasha had been at the right place at the right time and had gotten his cousin out of a very bad situation. But years later, thanks to the internet\u2019s love of all things viral, it had come back to bite Christian, costing him his career and nearly making him give up the one thing he loved the most.</p><p>Christian blinked and rubbed his jaw. \u201cThat you did, but I\u2019ll not have you spying for Vladimir. He can speculate on my personal life like everyone else\u2014by Googling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to spy on you.\u201d But he was and the look on Christian\u2019s face damned him for a liar.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you here for\u2014murder, mayhem or a general fuck all someone\u2019s life for the greater evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be a quiz on this later?\u201d Sasha drawled. He hadn\u2019t committed murder, but the other two he\u2019d been acquainted with for years. Though what he\u2019d done to Rose should have him sentenced to life imprisonment.</p><p>Christian raked a hand through his hair. \u201cFor once in your life, Alexander, be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I like this sorry excuse of existence I call my life? I have to be what I am. Unlike you, I have no choice. There\u2019s no telling Vladimir to shove off while I ride into the sunset with the woman I love. I\u2019m not fucking allowed. So take your serious comment and bugger it.\u201d Sasha clenched his fists, wanting to punch something or someone. Himself, mostly.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Christian asked, his light eyes probing.</p><p>A woman with beautiful blue eyes and a caring soul. A woman whose rare smiles made him feel victorious when she gifted him with one. A woman who made his heart sprint by only thinking of her. A woman he helped destroy. His shoulders threatened to sag. \u201cThere is no she.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d A slight smile played on his cousin\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cComing to my party?\u201d Sasha asked, steering the conversation back into the safe zone.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d This time Christian\u2019s lips broke out in a full smile. \u201cStill trying to figure out the angle you\u2019re working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries, mate. My angle\u2019s all worked out. The benefit is exactly what it seems to be and I\u2019ll be leaving next Wednesday.\u201d But not before he found a way to help Rose, whether she wanted it or not.</p><p>Rose unloaded the last empty box from the back of her Jeep and took it in the house. The task of sorting what was precious to her was overwhelming. How was she supposed to decide what should go and what should stay? She had three days to pack and only Skye to help.</p><p>\u201cAt least we have the apartment over the store,\u201d Skye took the box from Rose. \u201cYou can stay there until everything gets sorted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s been rented out. Can Ivy and I come stay with you? I checked on the cottage, but it\u2019s in bad shape and I won\u2019t get any money from Barbara\u2019s Bugs until they receive their first shipment. I mailed it out when I went to town to get these boxes from storage.\u201d Rose glanced at Ivy. The baby played on a large quilt in the middle of the foyer, the stuffed rabbit clutched in her hand with Blackbeard close by.</p><p>Skye\u2019s face fell. \u201cGod, I wish y\u2019all could, but I have four roommates and I can\u2019t kick them out. The lease is in Bailey\u2019s name.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFour? But it\u2019s only a two bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBailey\u2019s boyfriend and his roommate moved in two days ago.\u201d Skye scrunched her nose in displeasure. \u201cThey\u2019re such pervs. I constantly feel the need to wear at least four layers of clothes when they\u2019re around.\u201d</p><p>Well, sleeping at Skye\u2019s place was out. Maybe she would take up David and Missy\u2019s offer after all. \u201cNever mind. I can get a hotel room.\u201d</p> <p>Skye set the box down on the second step and took Rose\u2019s hand, squeezing it. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t seem like this is a good thing, but maybe it is. Out of all of us, you felt the most tied to Strawberry Grove. Maybe this is your chance to be your own person. Go do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Hope dared to spread its wings inside of her, but she caged it in. \u201cI have Ivy to think about.\u201d</p><p>Skye smiled sadly. \u201cNot forever.\u201d</p><p>Rose sucked in a breath, knowing it was true but the words hurt all the same. \u201cHow are things with you and Tristan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no me and Tristan.\u201d Skye pursed her lips. \u201cNever was. We were...friends. Since he can\u2019t go tonight, I\u2019ll babysit Ivy for you instead of Gabriel\u2019s momma.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the apartment with four roommates?\u201d Rose asked in disbelief and a hint of horror that overshadowed her concern for her sister\u2019s love life.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m staying over at Jemma Leigh\u2019s, but she won\u2019t mind. She\u2019s paying me to cleanse her aura and feng shui her house,\u201d her sister said with a rueful smile. \u201cI don\u2019t have the heart to tell her I\u2019m not that kind of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitch?\u201d Rose wiggled her brows.</p><p>Skye giggled and let go of Rose\u2019s hand. \u201cHealer.\u201d Her sister\u2019s face grew serious. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to tell you, but yesterday I got an email saying that I\u2019ve been taken off the waiting list for their midwifery program and awarded a scholarship to Colorado U.\u201d</p><p>Rose sat down on the bottom step, trying to think of something encouraging to say. \u201cBut it\u2019s so far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to do for a long time.\u201d Skye sat down beside her. \u201cI tutored some football players on the side, did some mommy\u2019s morning outs and a bunch of other odd jobs. I tucked away enough money for a one-way plane ticket with enough left over to get me started.\u201d</p> <p>Guilt sprouted inside of Rose. She\u2019d always thought Skye had it so easy living in Greenville, able to come and go as she pleased. Able to sleep in or go out with her friends. God, how wrong she\u2019d been, and now she\u2019d run out of time to change things. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday.\u201d</p><p>Rose blinked and sucked in a breath. \u201cThat soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to line up a job, find a place to live, and get my bearings.\u201d Skye linked her hands with Rose\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll visit over Skype and email you every day. I bet we\u2019ll talk as much as we do now.\u201d</p><p>Another pang of guilt hit Rose, and her heart pounded hard in her chest. \u201cHow long is the program or whatever you call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years.\u201d Skye laughed at the look on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s not forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to Blackbeard. He\u2019ll be a thousand years old by the time you come back,\u201d Rose said as the cat licked its paw.</p><p>Skye picked at the lint on her sweater, her freckled cheeks pinkening. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to come back.\u201d</p> <p>In her heart Rose had known this day would come. Skye had always wanted to travel and loved meeting new people. She loved talking to them, listening to their every ache and pain while searching her mental file cabinet for ways to help them.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you decide, I\u2019ll support you.\u201d And miss her every day, because Rose knew that after this weekend Skye wouldn\u2019t be back for a very long time, if ever.</p><p>\u201cDid you love him? Alexander, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Rose opened and closed her mouth a couple times before settling on saying, \u201cI gave him my necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Surprise showed in her sister\u2019s hazel eyes before they dropped to Rose\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what got into me. I only knew it belonged to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever feel that way with Jason?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Rose grabbed the nearest box and stood. \u201cNever.\u201d She marched up the stairs, aware of her sister watching her the entire way.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Rose had never been one to run away from what life threw at her, but tonight\u2014as soon as she walked into her father\u2019s house\u2014she\u2019d been ready to bewitch the nearest broom and fly away.</p><p>Any minute now, someone would slide right up to her with their most charming smile and ask her to leave. Any minute now, her mask would be ripped away and the entire town would laugh at her, knowing she\u2019d been played for a fool.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Oh, why hadn\u2019t she stayed at home with Ivy?</p><p>A helpless noise escaped her lips and she clutched Gabriel\u2019s arm tighter. He patted her hand reassuringly and shifted his stance so that she could lean on him for support. She almost wished that his touch did something, anything for her. A slight tingle, a rise of goose bumps...something. But of course, it didn\u2019t happen. Never had and never would. He wasn\u2019t the man for her.</p><p>The sound of music rushed over her, grabbing her attention.</p><p>She had no desire to join the crush of bodies, and Gabriel, ever the gentleman, didn\u2019t pressure her to do so. Instead she absorbed the party, her joints becoming stiffer as the fear of discovery permeated her bones. People-the famous and notorious-laughed as they mingled with locals, made jokes and toasted each other with champagne.</p><p>The entire ballroom was macabre, decorated like a Regency period horror movie set. Fabric swaths of black and silver extended from the enormous chandelier in the middle to the edges of the ballroom. Dark corners flickered with ghostly apparitions. Paintings hung around the room changed from proper lords and ladies to rotting corpses. Zombie servers wove in and out of groups, carefully balancing trays of champagne and hors d\u2019oeuvres on the tips of their sickly gray fingers.</p><p>\u201cIs that who I think it is?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s brows shot up as a notorious politician and socialite ducked behind a cluster of potted plants.</p><p>She had the absurd notion to giggle. \u201cYes and over there, standing under the portrait of a rotting lady in purple, is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy who played James Bond last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd over there...\u201d Her line of vision collided with a familiar face.</p><p>Heath Ambrose, hometown star and major league baseball player, winked at her. He stood beside his brother, Luke, at the buffet table. Or maybe it was Logan. She couldn\u2019t tell the twins apart from the back. Neither wore a costume. Instead they opted for black tuxes and half masks. Heath held his mask as he leaned back to check out a Marie Antoinette with mocha-colored skin and a flirtatious smile.</p><p>She thought she heard Gabriel growl and her eyes flew to his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded in Heath\u2019s direction. \u201cHe\u2019s been after Bella for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too good for him.\u201d His indigo eyes grew hard. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me they belong together, because it\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed,\u201d she said with a little smile.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me feel any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me to,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>Gabriel grunted, but she couldn\u2019t blame him. He didn\u2019t want his sister to get hurt or disappointed by a man not ready for a serious relationship. Too bad she didn\u2019t have a big brother looking out for her. Then maybe she\u2019d be...She\u2019d be exactly as she was\u2014alone.</p><p>\u201cHeath\u2019s actually a nice guy,\u201d she said, earning a look of disbelief from Gabriel. \u201cHe would walk me to class in school and protect me from the ones who weren\u2019t so nice.\u201d</p><p>Unconvinced, Gabriel shook his head. \u201cIf he\u2019s so great, then why didn\u2019t the two of you ever date?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWell, he did give me my first kiss, but do you really have to ask me that question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Romanov done?\u201d The question wasn\u2019t meant to be prying. In fact, she knew Gabriel was concerned about her.</p><p>\u201cWe never started.\u201d She searched the ballroom again, not wanting to be caught unaware. Sasha was here, lurking in the background. Or shadows like a very bad man.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s muscles tensed beneath her fingers as his ex and her husband appeared in the foyer. The couple didn\u2019t notice them as they waved at obviously familiar faces and melted into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we tried to be anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer told you,\u201d Rose said and then paused as a ripple of awareness shot through her. She began again, \u201cShe told you not to go looking for the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister says a lot of things. None of which are ever good ideas,\u201d Gabriel muttered.</p><p>Turning to him, Rose said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay. I can do this on my own.\u201d Hadn\u2019t she always?</p><p>Gabriel gave her a tight smile. \u201cI appreciate it, but I keep my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the expense of you being uncomfortable. Although I could tell you who you should be dancing with tonight,\u201d she teased, then the image of a woman kissing Gabriel came to mind, shocking Rose with its clarity.</p><p>Gabriel held up his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know who I\u2019m supposed to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t believe in my \u2018powers\u2019.\u201d She blinked the image away. That woman wasn\u2019t here tonight. She wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in this place.</p><p>A dimple appeared in his cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014especially on Halloween.\u201d</p><p>Rose laughed quietly as they walked further into the ballroom. Despite her mask being firmly in place and only a handful of people knowing she was here, tension crept into her spine as the party-goers flickered their eyes over her. But no one said a word or even stopped to point at her.</p><p>\u201cLooks like Romanov got a really good turnout. Wonder if he\u2019d agree to hosting one of these for the Center? We could really use the money.\u201d Gabriel stopped a waiter passing by with a tray of champagne and grabbed two glasses, handing one to her. \u201cThanks for being so understanding about Miguel.\u201d</p><p>She backed against up against the wall and Gabriel followed her, his costume making her smile. There were holes in his clothes and small bread rolls were glued to them. As soon as he explained that he was a \u201choly roller\u201d she\u2019d burst out laughing. It had helped relieve the rapidly multiplying butterflies in her stomach. Unfortunately, pop rocks had taken their place, pinging around her insides and burning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault he ran away.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s always room for my improvement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanging what people think of you is hard. Sometimes, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d She flinched as Jason Everett sauntered by with a pretty date wearing butterfly wings and purple hair.</p><p>\u201cSometimes there\u2019s nothing to change about yourself.\u201d Gabriel handed her a glass. \u201cAlthough, you could change the company you keep.\u201d</p><p>Did everyone know she\u2019d been played for a fool by Sasha? Or had Jason been running his mouth again. \u201cYou mean Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d Gabriel murmured and Rose followed his line of vision.</p><p>Sasha stood at the top of the staircase, surveying the ballroom like he owned the place. Dressed in all black, his golden hair a sharp contrast to the severity of his costume, he looked like a man bent on debauchery. The woman inside of her wanted to join him, but she quickly reminded her of exactly what type of man Sasha was. Of course that woman didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>His sexy green eyes widened and then narrowed as they raked over her, seemingly undressing her. Never had she felt more exposed while wearing so many layers of clothing. The burgundy dress had belonged to the third Poppy Holland, preserved in a trunk rarely opened, while her lingerie had been given to her in trade by a customer. A woman that designed retro corsets, garters and stockings to sell on the internet. Steampunk fashion, she had called it.</p><p>Out of habit, her hand moved to her throat.</p><p>A wicked smile covered Sasha\u2019s face as he copied her and pulled out the pendant. He held it to his lips and blood rushed to her cheeks. How dare he rub it in her face? Taking a step forward, she bumped into Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered, wishing she had the courage to run over to Sasha and rip the thing off of his neck. However, causing a scene was the worst thing she could do. It was better to remain under the radar for the next couple of hours, until she could escape this hell and go pack.</p><p>Sasha placed a black mask over the top half of his face, disappearing with her next blink. Astonishment replaced indignation as she craned her head to get another glimpse of him.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cI should eat if I\u2019m drinking.\u201d She\u2019d been too darn nervous to manage more than crackers and cheese before she\u2019d gotten dressed. Luckily, Skye had stuck around to lace her into the gown.</p><p>Rose sipped at the champagne, bubbles tickling her nose as she swayed to the song the band was playing in the background.</p><p>\u201cHullo, love,\u201d Sasha whispered in her ear.</p><p>She quickly turned, ready to demand her necklace back, but the only person she found standing beside her was a man wearing a cardboard nightstand with the number one painted on it.</p><p>He wriggled his silver eyebrows at her and blew a kiss.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Sasha appeared again, this time by the refreshment table. He struck up a conversation with a bull and a peacock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Forget about making a scene, she wanted her necklace. \u201cYou will give it back,\u201d Rose muttered and almost tripped over her dress as she started in Sasha\u2019s direction.</p><p>A hand shot out, grabbing her by the elbow. \u201cWhat\u2019s your hurry, sugar?\u201d</p><p>Harrison\u2019s gray eyes narrowed as she jerked out of his grasp. \u201cShould you be seen talking with me?\u201d She motioned to Harrison\u2019s wife.</p> <p>Lorelei Collins held court in the middle of the ballroom, dressed as Elizabeth the First. She preened as men half her age flirted with her.</p><p>\u201cThe Queen is currently occupied with her admirers. I suspect she\u2019ll be choosing one tonight.\u201d Harrison\u2019s mouth flattened. \u201cOr two.\u201d</p><p>Rose wanted to point out that he\u2019d cheated on his wife with Azalea, but knew it wouldn\u2019t do any good. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m leaving as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Harrison shook his head. \u201cSorry, sugar, change of plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a scene,\u201d she threatened, clenching her fist.</p> <p>\u201cNo you won\u2019t.\u201d Her father tapped her nose and she flinched. \u201cYou\u2019d rather cut off your hand than have everyone stare at you.\u201d</p><p>He was right and she was miserable with the knowledge. \u201cHow long do I have to stay?\u201d</p><p>Lifting his drink, he studied her over the rim. \u201cUntil the party\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour loan comes due. All of it.\u201d</p><p>There were so many words that sprang to mind, so many retorts, but Carolina Dreams was all she had left. And she was determined to keep it open and make it prosperous. The contract with Barbara\u2019s Bugs would have paid off her back taxes, but now she\u2019d be able to pay back his loan with puppet strings.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep this beautiful lady all to yourself, Harrison.\u201d Jason cast a wolfish smile as he came to stand beside them, his pack of friends flanking his shoulders.</p><p>Her insides crashed together and her knees threatened to give out, but she kept a calm fa\u00e7ade behind her mask, flickering her eyes over Jason, then away. Most of the time, she found a way to avoid him and the guys he hung out with.</p><p>\u201cMy date\u2019s waiting for me,\u201d she said, but Harrison gave a slight shake of his head. Trapped, Rose hid her clenched fists in the folds of her skirt.</p><p>Jason winked at her. \u201cThey\u2019re playing our song, Rose.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her chin, she said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two kids have fun.\u201d Harrison practically threw her at Jason.</p><p>Not in this lifetime, she wanted to shout. Reluctantly, she let Jason take her by the arm, moving her to the dance floor. Her skin crawled where he touched her. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Gabriel head in their direction, concern plainly written on his face.</p> <p>Standing on her toes, she mouthed, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel crossed his arms and waited at the edge of the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cSmile.\u201d Jason\u2019s hand moved to the curve of her hip and she wanted to vomit.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rip off your mask if you don\u2019t,\u201d he said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cAnd risk your sterling reputation? We both know that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d She focused on a point over his shoulder, staring at the image of a redheaded woman in amethyst slowly decaying until it blurred.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I like taking risks.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her gaze back to his, his sky blue eyes bright. Deceiving. Those\u2014along with his smile\u2014made people trust him, made them think he was sincere. Heck, it had made her believe Jason had been different from the rest. \u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember our last night together?\u201d</p><p>When he collected money on a bet, after breaking up with her in a crowded restaurant? She scowled at him behind her mask.</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cNot then. The night before, when I took you to The Pointe.\u201d</p><p>She remained silent. Dancing with him was one thing, but engaging in painful conversation was quite another.</p><p>He bent his dark head, his breath hot against her ear. \u201cI bent you over the hood of my car, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rose focused on the portrait again, humming in her mind to drown out his words. It was supposed to have been a romantic evening with music, dancing under the moonlight and a picnic dinner by the sound. Instead all he\u2019d brought was a box of wine, subs from one of those chain restaurants, and played a random mix of rap, metal and bluegrass.</p><p>Afterwards it had been a repeat of every date: she and Jason having sex. Not making love. Not connecting. And she\u2019d been too lonely, too inexperienced with men\u2014with any man at all\u2014to have realized it until it was too late.</p><p>\u201cRemember?\u201d he repeated, grinding his pelvis against her.</p><p>She clenched her teeth and silently thanked God for her heavy skirts. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He continued on as if he hadn\u2019t heard, which in his case was entirely possible. She\u2019d never been around a man more in love with the sound of his voice. \u201cNow you\u2019ve had the opportunity to gain some experience\u2014\u201d He nuzzled the side of her neck and she jerked her head back. \u201c\u2014give me, I mean, us another chance.\u201d</p><p>Another chance to embarrass her? Another chance to tell her that if she would just let herself go during sex it would be better for them both? Not that he hadn\u2019t made it pleasurable. He\u2019d just acted like it was her fault she didn\u2019t orgasm as soon as he wanted her to, and her amazingly na\u00efve self had tried harder to please him.</p><p>Rose hated this self-berating. The constant self-doubt and mental abuse she heaped on the woman inside of her. But she was entirely grateful that something had kept her from telling him just how inexperienced she was. Heck, he would have probably taken out a front page ad in The Gazette. However, he\u2019d barely noticed, only taking her discomfort to mean that he was extremely well-endowed. Self-centered asshole.</p><p>Her cheeks heated, and the large chandelier began to sway in the middle of the room as he turned her in time to the music.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice only a whisper.</p><p>\u201cLet me make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>Rose stared at Jason. The only way he could make it up to her would be to start practicing law in Antarctica. She cleared her throat. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes narrowed through the slits in his gray mask. He wore all shades of gray, some venturing into white, like he was the good guy. \u201cSpreading your legs for Romanov makes you too good for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No matter how much Sasha had hurt her, she wouldn\u2019t let Jason get the last word or make her feel bad.</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d He squeezed her shoulder and she winced. \u201cAre those the only two words you know?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d always hated how quiet she was. According to him, it didn\u2019t let him get to know the real her. More like it didn\u2019t help him find her weaknesses as fast. She clamped her lips together, knowing she was irritating him even more by not speaking.</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot, big words weren\u2019t a requirement to get your G.E.D.\u201d</p><p>Fury bubbled at his mocking words, and something wicked sprang to life inside of her. \u201cYou have the smallest penis I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>The words seemed to echo around the room just as the band played the last chord. A few people gasped while others laughed. She let a small smile dance on her lips, not caring if any of the locals guessed her identity.</p><p>\u201cIs that Rose Holland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if anyone should know about penis size, it\u2019s a Holland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it back,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The purple-haired butterfly tapped Jason on the shoulder. \u201cI won\u2019t be available tomorrow night. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d He stalked off, leaving Rose in the middle of the dance floor.</p><p>She wanted to give a little cheer as she carefully navigated her way through the astonished crowd, finding the nearest unoccupied corner and sinking gratefully into a convenient bench shrouded in black. She looked for Gabriel, but he was nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cDo you think if I disembowel Everett and hang him by his entrails, everyone\u2019ll think it\u2019s a part of tonight\u2019s celebration?\u201d</p><p>She turned to face the owner of the seductive voice and her heart beat in a choppy pattern. The plain black mask did little to diminish his looks; it only enhanced the way his hair glittered in the light and the mesmerizing green of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou heard?\u201d Of course he heard. The entire ballroom heard what she said.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve snatched you away, but I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene.\u201d A glimmer of humor and admiration entered his eyes. \u201cGot a bit of the devil in you tonight, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to snatch me away?\u201d she said, nervously licking her lips.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m jealous as hell.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck, the gold chain around it gleamed and for some reason she couldn\u2019t ask for it back. \u201cI\u2019m jealous of every smile, every laugh...every touch. I\u2019m jealous of every man who\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said that you didn\u2019t care if I\u2019d had a hundred lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was mistaken.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips and stood. \u201cMeaning you lied to me. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning I was trying to get a point across.\u201d He shoved his hands into his pockets. \u201cDammit, woman, you drive me insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy expecting the truth from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy expecting the best of me.\u201d Taking his hands out of his pockets, he tenderly cupped her face. \u201cI\u2019ll always fall short.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and his hands fell away. \u201cLet me be the judge of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight.\u201d</p><p>Sasha was the opposite of Jason, the perceived hero. Jason was a great lawyer, a public defender. While Sasha was a man dressed in all black, a villain trying desperately not to be the hero while doing his uncle\u2019s bidding. A villain desperate to keep his mother safe. Something she\u2019d neglected to remember when his betrayal had cut her heart into tiny pieces until nothing remained.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Sasha?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>He took one of her hands and bowed over it. \u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no...\u201d Her words died away as the band began again, playing one of those silly little love songs. Her favorite. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI texted Skye a few days ago to ask.\u201d A rueful smile tilted his lips at the corners. \u201cI wanted to make it special for you, even if you weren\u2019t my date.\u201d</p><p>The ice that had recently formed around the hollow where her heart had been began to melt as Sasha waited patiently for her to make up her mind. Unable to help herself, and because she wanted the memory of Jason\u2019s hands on her to be wiped away, she moved closer. Laying her head on his chest, she pretended that this morning never happened. That they were still a team, working together to save her land and his mother.</p><p>\u201cRosebud, please listen. You don\u2019t have to say a word\u2014mostly because I don\u2019t want you shouting out the size of my manly parts,\u201d he said, and she bit her lip to keep from laughing. From crying. \u201cBut I\u2019m sorry. I did help with the back taxes scheme. One of my uncle\u2019s attorneys looked over every piece of information about you and your family. She was the one who found the discrepancy. Honestly, I thought it wouldn\u2019t come to this. That, with my plan, Nahalah Industries would withdraw funding and everyone would leave you alone. Including me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to give me another chance, because I know I don\u2019t deserve it. But you deserve the truth. All of it,\u201d he added softly.</p><p>Another chunk of ice melted. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving next week.\u201d</p><p>She missed a step and stumbled, only his strong arms kept her from falling. \u201cBut I thought you were staying for six months and you were going to help people. Oh, more lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s everything, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Struggling for breath, she placed her palm against his chest. It shouldn\u2019t hurt so much he was leaving. She should be glad that someone so manipulative would be out of her life. But she wasn\u2019t. A fist grabbed her lungs and squeezed them tight. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out on the balcony,\u201d he murmured and escorted her outside.</p><p>Once there he let go of her and she collapsed in the nearest seat, her hands covering her mask. She wrenched it off and threw it over the railing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unmasking a tad early, but when in Rome...\u201d His mask followed hers.</p><p>\u201cStop making jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI leave my baby with you and you\u2019re out partying?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Rose stood so quickly that she stepped on Sasha\u2019s foot and he grunted. \u201cSorry.\u201d Her gaze never left her sister\u2019s face. \u201cSummer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, Rosebud,\u201d Sasha said, pressing a kiss to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d was all she was able to manage.</p><p>Her sister\u2019s brown eyes narrowed as he passed by, then she smiled. \u201cMiss me?\u201d Not waiting for an answer, Summer turned and sauntered into the ballroom.</p><p>Unable to believe her eyes or ears, Rose followed. Her sister was here. Oh God. Ivy.</p><p>Summer tossed her hair over her shoulder, casting a seductive smile at the closest male. \u201cI\u2019m back in town,\u201d she called out, \u201cHold on to your men, ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop?\u201d Rose glanced around the room. Formerly smiling faces were frowning, lips whispered and fingers pointed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop when I\u2019m good and ready. And we all know I\u2019ll never be good, but I\u2019m always ready. Ain\u2019t that right, Robert?\u201d Summer blew a kiss to the former mayor of Holland Springs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rose grabbed her sister by the arm, trying to pull her into a private corner. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing.\u201d Summer shook out of her grasp.</p><p>Rose looked over her sister\u2019s shoulder and found what looked to be an empty hallway. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always were a bossy thing.\u201d Summer snagged a glass of champagne and sashayed across the room, garnering male attention that Rose had no desire to bask in. She\u2019d already done enough tonight.</p><p>Rose ran to the first door, jiggling the knob without success. \u201cIt\u2019s locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove, little sister.\u201d Summer bumped her with her hip. She placed the glass of champagne on the floor and began to work at the lock. A few seconds and a small click later, Summer stood, turning the knob with a flourish. Picking up her glass, she entered first.</p><p>The lights fairly blazed in the room, one filled with floor to ceiling shelves of books. Closing the door behind her, Rose leaned against it and took as deep of a breath as her costume would allow.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you happy to see me?\u201d Summer drained the glass and threw it at the fireplace. Glass shattered as flames leapt into the air, dancing happily.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d Rose wrapped her arms around her sister, surprised at how frail Summer felt. \u201cYou need to take better care of yourself. A strong wind could blow you away.\u201d</p><p>Quick as lightening, Summer stepped back and crossed her arms over her mostly bare chest. The black dress she\u2019d poured herself into clung to every curve of her willowy body. \u201cI\u2019ve come to get Ivy. Where is she? No one was at Strawberry Grove but Blackbeard. And he wasn\u2019t telling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight this minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d</p><p>Because Rose loved Ivy as her own. \u201cSkye\u2019s taking care of her at Jemma Leigh\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the address and I\u2019ll go now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Summer gave her a funny look and Rose quickly added, \u201cIt\u2019s after nine and she\u2019s asleep. Better to wait until morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving tonight. I have an apartment in Wilmington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking Ivy away from here?\u201d Rose blindly reached behind her and grabbed hold of the door knob, her palms damp and her heart in her throat.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. Did you really think I\u2019d let my daughter grow up in Holland Springs?\u201d</p><p>Rose opened and shut her mouth a couple of times before speaking. \u201cI\u2019d hoped we\u2019d all be a family.\u201d First Skye, now Ivy and Summer. Sasha. Her knees almost gave out, but she firmed them. Despite this her legs began to shake.</p><p>Summer glanced around the room, seemingly taking stock of it. \u201cThis is pretty.\u201d She ran a finger over an ornate vase and pushed it over. Rose jumped as it crashed, hitting the rug and not breaking into a thousand pieces, thank God.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to get us thrown out?\u201d Rose snatched up the vase and placed it carefully back in its spot on the bookshelf.</p><p>\u201cI bet Lorelei isn\u2019t happy you\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cContrary to popular belief, I don\u2019t visit Harrison to screw him in his office.\u201d</p><p>Her sister laughed and flames shot higher in the fireplace. \u201cHarrison Collins is capable of many things, but incest isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured it out on my own.\u201d Summer sat down on the leather sofa, sifted her fingers through a tasseled throw and looked over her shoulder. \u201cWell, not entirely on my own.\u201d</p><p>She followed her sister\u2019s line of vision and she sagged against the desk. \u201cIs that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour great-great grand-something or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrashed one of their yearly balls. They put me in this room as punishment until the sheriff came,\u201d Summer said. \u201cThere\u2019s a safe in the second bookcase, third down, fifth book from the left. It\u2019s full of money and jewelry. Or was.\u201d</p><p>Rose couldn\u2019t take her eyes of the enormous portrait. The woman was dressed in pale pink, her black hair piled fashionably on top of her head. Laughing, vibrant blue eyes dominated her very pretty face as a demure smile titled her lips at the corners. At the bottom was a gold placard with the engraving Rosalyn Collins, 1822.</p><p>Was that where her mother had gotten her name? Not from her birthmark like she\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Rose, everything will work out for the best. The devil will finally get his due.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, preventing Rose from asking her sister exactly what she meant by that.</p><p>\u201cSo this is where you\u2019ve been hiding from everyone,\u201d Gabriel said, his dark eyes flashing.</p><p>\u201cOnly you, angel.\u201d Summer smirked.</p><p>\u201cCan you take Summer home for me?\u201d Rose asked him. \u201cI\u2019ll get another ride home.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s lip curled. \u201cHe\u2019s your date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than any other man in town.\u201d Except for one, her heart reminded her.</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d Summer twisted her lips and raked her eyes over him. \u201cSome would find him...lacking in certain departments.\u201d</p><p>Rose gave Gabriel an apologetic smile. \u201cSorry, she\u2019s not herself right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am completely myself.\u201d Summer stood, her hips swaying with purpose as she approached Gabriel. She ran a hand over one of his broad shoulders and his face flushed. \u201cStill wearing that chastity belt, preacher boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so concerned about my private life?\u201d The lines of his body were stiff, tense.</p><p>Rose couldn\u2019t help but feel as if this was a renewed conversation.</p><p>Blonde hair slid over Summer\u2019s slender shoulders like a waterfall over dangerous rocks and his indigo eyes tracked every movement. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean lack of one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for this, Summer,\u201d he warned, but her sister stepped closer and her smile became hypnotic.</p><p>The fire blazed higher and a bead of sweat trickled between Rose\u2019s breasts.</p><p>Summer stood on the balls of her feet, her lips almost touching Gabriel\u2019s. \u201cI can get you in the mood, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Rose cried, wanting to knock them both over the head. She grabbed Gabriel\u2019s arm and pulled him away. \u201cCan you take Summer home or not?\u201d</p><p>Harrison Collins had taken it upon himself to give Sasha the grand tour.</p><p>Curious as to the house\u2019s history, Sasha had agreed. Only he\u2019d found a painting, small and definitely not fit for public consumption, in the billiards room of the mansion. A very blond ancestor of Rose Holland reclining upon a fainting couch wearing little more than a scrap of fabric and a birthmark on her inner thigh\u2014in the familiar shape of a rose bud.</p><p>\u201cEvery Poppy Holland bears that mark,\u201d Harrison said, the end of his cigar bright red. \u201cIt\u2019s to warn the men away. Women like her aren\u2019t fit for good society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this little speech to warn me away?\u201d</p><p>Harrison clapped him on the back. \u201cWhy would I need to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll my parts are in proper working order and I\u2019m male. Two requirements for seduction of or by Poppy Holland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you liked men.\u201d Harrison clamped the cigar between his teeth.</p><p>If the banker thought to insult him, he had another thing coming. \u201cAre you flirting with me, Harrison? I\u2019m flattered, but unfortunately my affections are engaged elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Harrison\u2019s eyes grew so wide that Sasha could only see the whites. \u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>Sasha stepped forward, inches from Harrison\u2019s face. \u201cWhat a shame.\u201d He smoothed the front of Harrison\u2019s jacket. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a thing for men like you: powerful, horrid dresser...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTour\u2019s over,\u201d Harrison snapped.</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t finished.\u201d Before Sasha could spook him further, Harrison sprinted from the room, not bothering to close the door behind him. \u201cGood riddance.\u201d</p><p>Poppy Holland\u2019s seductive smile mocked him. \u201cBut you m\u2019dear...oh, what plans I have for you.\u201d He removed the painting from the wall and tucked it under his arm. He made a quick trip to his car and secured it in the back seat before heading back inside.</p><p>As he retraced Rose\u2019s steps, he heard voices and opened the door. The trio turned in perfect sync. His jaw threatened to clench, but he forced a charming smile and let his gaze rest on Rose. Or should he call her Poppy? Her hand clutched Gabriel\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cVery bad form to have a private party and not invite me.\u201d Sasha adjusted his stance as the trio stared at him. Though he leaned casually against the door frame, blood pounded furiously in his ears as he focused on the little witch in the middle.</p><p>Rose\u2019s hand fell away from Gabriel and Sasha began to breathe easier. Then he noticed the woman above the fireplace. He blinked. Was this some kind of sick joke?</p><p>Sasha strode to the painting and read the placard underneath, then stared up at the portrait. Same curly black hair, same beautiful blue eyes, and same last name as the man who owned the place. Sasha\u2019s gut clenched and a minuscule amount of fury ebbed away. That was why Harrison Collins had looked so familiar to him at Market House. What a bastard the man was to prey on his daughter\u2019s vulnerabilities.</p><p>Honestly, should he be surprised at anything anyone did?</p><p>\u201cYou never did introduce us, Rose,\u201d Summer purred and Sasha turned to regard the blonde.</p><p>He\u2019d recognized Ivy\u2019s mother as soon as she sauntered in, hell-bent on embarrassing Rose or herself, he wasn\u2019t sure. However, two things were very clear: one, Summer was extremely beautiful, a fashion designer\u2019s dream with her long legs, torso and arms. Two, he wouldn\u2019t touch her with his pinky finger\u2014not only because she was Rose\u2019s sister, but because he\u2019d seen that look before.</p><p>Every morning for the past five years it had stared back at him in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cAlexander Romanov,\u201d Rose said, gesturing toward him, then her sister. \u201cThis is my sister, Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmed, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Summer brushed past Gabriel, her hips saying \u2018come closer\u2019 while her eyes screamed \u2018run like hell in the opposite direction\u2019. Crimson nails tipped in black trailed down Sasha\u2019s coat sleeve and he repressed a shudder.</p><p>She leaned closer, whispering, \u201cPerforming curses may not be in my sister\u2019s repertoire, but it is in mine.\u201d</p><p>Halloween really did bring out the best in people. He leaned back and looked her in the eye, pulling out the cross necklace. \u201cSorry, dear, but you can\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s lips peeled back from her teeth, but before she could curse him or bite his ear off, Gabriel pulled her away.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Gabriel urged.</p><p>\u201cAsking me to spend the night, angel?\u201d Summer cooed, brown eyes wide as her lashes fluttered.</p><p>Gabriel steered her toward the door. \u201cYou think that\u2019s the first time someone\u2019s tried giving me that nickname? You\u2019re starting to slip, honey.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s smile never faltered. \u201cI\u2019m sure a man like you would catch me if I did. Show me the errors of my ways so I could get down on my knees for you and confess my sins. Maybe demonstrate the ones I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mascara\u2019s smeared.\u201d Gabriel pulled a tissue from his pocket and held it out to her.</p><p>Summer stared down at his hand for a long minute before taking it from him. Her shoulders drooped a little. \u201cDrive me home, angel.\u201d</p><p>After the door shut behind the couple, Rose said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe she let him get the last word.\u201d</p><p>What in the hell was she talking about? \u201cYour sister ordered him to take her home.\u201d Shimmering blue eyes met his, and he sucked in a breath. Jesus. Summer was here for Ivy. \u201cSweetheart, will you be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes-no...I don\u2019t know.\u201dShe dropped her head into her hands, her shoulders rigid. \u201cI need to leave, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Whatever he\u2019d been about to say slipped from his mind as her entire body began to shake. He crossed the small distance between them and guided her to the leather sofa by the fireplace, pulling her into his lap. Rubbing her back, he waited for her to cry. But the tears never came. Instead she remained rigid as ever, even as great shudders racked her delicate frame.</p><p>After many minutes had passed, she finally relaxed against him, burying her face into his neck and rubbing the chain around it with the tips of her fingers. He wrapped a cautious arm around her, welcoming the sweet warmth of her body. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the first person\u2014outside of my family\u2014that knows the truth about me. I haven\u2019t been able to trust anyone in a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted you, too.\u201d</p><p>Her words shattered him. Wounded him as they should. Thinking of the painting in his car, he said, \u201cNot entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted you with the important things: My family and my\u2014me.\u201d</p><p>He wanted her trust again. He needed it. Hell, he needed her. Playing with the tendrils of hair that had escaped its confines, he trailed his lips down the line of her stubborn jaw. \u201cI tainted the samples this afternoon\u2014with what I\u2019m not telling, but I swear to God my uncle can\u2019t hurt you now.\u201d He nibbled at her bottom lip. \u201cNo one can take away your land. The spring is worthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she exhaled on a ragged breath. \u201cI can\u2019t think straight around you.\u201d</p><p>Cursing himself for being a million times a fool, he lifted her away from him so that she reclined against the side of the sofa.</p><p>Massive mistake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ocean-blue eyes met his and as her plump lips parted, he was lost to any semblance of reasoning. He moved over her, skimming his knuckles across her cheek while her gaze never wavered from his.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t help myself around you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Her gaze fell to his lips.</p><p>Heat coiled inside of him, ready to invade every part of his body. Ready to invade hers. \u201cYour costume becomes you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Poppy Holland,\u201d she said.</p><p>At that moment he didn\u2019t care if she was the granddaughter of Anastasia or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She was entrusting him with one of her most guarded secrets, and he wasn\u2019t going to ruin it by saying something so incredibly stupid as I know.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m Poppy\u2014legendary bewitcher of men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are.\u201d He wriggled his eyebrows at her and she groaned. \u201cIt solves a problem for me, actually.\u201d</p> <p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cIt does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t decide on who I was tonight, but the answer is obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d She blinked and blinked again.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you how particularly adorable you are when you answer in two word sentences?\u201d he asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSasha.\u201d Her breasts rose above the neckline as she moved into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing underneath?\u201d He traced the curve of one soft mound and her breath hitched.</p> <p>\u201cSteampunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of that particular line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarrison Collins is my dad,\u201d she said and he looked up in time to see her lashes sweep down, hiding her eyes from him.</p><p>\u201cSkye\u2019s too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Summer?\u201d</p><p>Black lashes flickered. \u201cSummer is my cousin, not my sister. But she\u2014we\u2014let everyone think she\u2019s the oldest.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s warning rang in his ear. \u201cTo protect you.\u201d</p> <p>Rose covered her mouth with her hand and then let it fall to her throat. \u201cOh, God, Sasha\u2014I have to go. I don\u2019t care what Harrison does to me. I need to see Ivy before Summer leaves with her.\u201d</p><p>Why would her sister leave? It didn\u2019t matter. In this he could help. He pulled her to her feet. \u201cNeed my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the keys. \u201cNeed help out of that dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t drive in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have anything else to wear.\u201d She looked down at her costume and then back at him, panic filling her eyes.</p><p>He unbuttoned his jacket and slung it over the sofa. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make love right now.\u201d</p><p>He fingers hovered above the third button. \u201cLater?\u201d Danger gleamed in her eyes and he quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m giving you my shirt and jacket to wear. They should be long enough to cover your very luscious derri\u00e8re. \u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s cheeks flushed bright pink.</p><p>His cuff links were next to go. \u201cThe sight of my glorious chest shouldn\u2019t cause too many women to swoon.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cJust the women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite right\u2014the men, too.\u201d The shirt joined his jacket and he caught Rose staring at him. More specifically at his chest. After having his nipples pierced for over six years, he usually wasn\u2019t aware of them, but at this moment he was conscious of everything. The way his nipples tightened around the metal rings. His cock stirring to life as she moved closer.</p><p>\u201cWhen I first saw you tonight, all I could think about was getting my necklace back.\u201d She blinked twice and he suppressed a grin.</p><p>That was not the first thing she thought. He could feel the connection between them as soon as their eyes locked. He\u2019d been sure she felt it, too. But it wasn\u2019t enough. He\u2019d betrayed Rose by withholding information from her. And he had nothing to offer her.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he reached for the clasp at the back of his neck. Even if was the right thing to do, it was the last thing he wanted. Last night, as he counted cracks in the ceiling of the room he\u2019d rented from the local bed and breakfast, his fingers wouldn\u2019t leave the damn thing alone. It was as if she were in bed with him, comforting and making him ache for her at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t belong to me anymore.\u201d She pushed a stray curl behind her ear. \u201cI thought it did, but it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around, love,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse as he tucked the pendant under his collar. Thankfully she did as he asked and he set to work on the tiny buttons running down the back. The dress slid off of her shoulders and fell to the floor. After catching sight of what it had revealed, he nearly did the same. She was wearing a corset\u2014laced up the sides\u2014that constricted her waist into waspish proportions and a garter belt.</p><p>He flexed his fingers and stepped back. Shapely legs encased in nude stockings with silver threads weaving up the sides caught the firelight. His mouth went dry and a cross between a moan and a groan left his throat.</p><p>\u201cConsequences,\u201d Rose said as she bent over to grab his shirt.</p><p>To hell with consequences. He cupped her elbow, turning her face him and tilted her chin up. He bent his head, already tasting her kiss.</p><p>The door burst open and they jumped apart.</p><p>David Turner poked his head in, disgust filling his face. But Sasha knew it wasn\u2019t directed at Rose. Only him. Always him. Not that he could blame the bloke.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d Rose jerked his shirt around her, a guilty flush creeping up her neck.</p><p>It was exactly what it looked like, Sasha wanted to say. Or it would\u2019ve been. He cast a critical eye on the Sheriff\u2019s costume. Of course the man was in uniform. \u201cOriginality not your strong point either?\u201d Sasha asked, silently daring the man to say something.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with Rose. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d Turning Rose to face him, Sasha helped her with the buttons, then draped his jacket around her slender shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll go wait in the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, David.\u201d She gave Sasha a tremulous smile. \u201cSasha can stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time did you get here?\u201d David asked, ruining Sasha\u2019s moment of sweet victory.</p><p>\u201cEight. My date was very punctual,\u201d she said with a raise of her brows.</p><p>Sasha rolled his eyes and mumbled, \u201cOf course he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomanov come with you?\u201d The sheriff gave him a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with this line of questioning?\u201d Sasha asked, annoyed and mildly panicked.</p><p>\u201cI really need to go to Jemma Leigh\u2019s and get Ivy. Summer\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>David cursed. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know about the explosion, do you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened until the blue was a thin line around the black. \u201cWhat explosion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kinda hoped you\u2019d been the one to do it,\u201d the sheriff muttered.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Rose asked, her voice rising as she turned around to face the sheriff. She grabbed Sasha\u2019s hand and squeezed.</p><p>David shifted his stance and took off his hat. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God man, spit it out,\u201d Sasha growled.</p><p>\u201cAn explosion from your greenhouse made Strawberry Grove catch on fire. Hayden Laws said he\u2019d never seen a house go up that fast\u2014not without help.\u201d</p><p>The room went silent, not even the clock on the mantle dared tick.</p><p>Hysterical laughter came from Rose\u2019s mouth and Sasha tried to soothe her, but she pushed him away. \u201cI don\u2019t need your comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire department\u2019s doing the best that they can, but it\u2019s out of control.\u201d</p><p>A gust of wind blew the windows open, lifting the drapes as lightning split the sky. Thunder boomed, shaking the entire house. The party-goers let out shouts of laughter, thinking this was part of their entertainment.</p><p>Thunder boomed again, books and expensive vases falling to the floor.</p><p>Rose turned, shoes silent on the hardwoods as she stalked to the closest window. Her hands were fisted at her side.</p><p>Sasha stared at her back, the fine hair on his neck rising as his jacket seemed to float off of her and land on the sofa. But it was only the gust of wind. It lifted his hair at the roots. \u201cYou need to come away from the window, Rosebud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m done.\u201d Her voice was strangely calm.</p><p>Suddenly, the heavens opened and rain poured from the sky.</p><p>\u201cThat should help,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWho set your house on fire?\u201d David shouted over the next boom of thunder. \u201cNobody would blame you if you were the one that did it. But if someone else were to blame, I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Sasha blurted, the need to convince her that he had absolutely nothing to do with destroying her home imperative. \u201cI swear on my mother\u2019s life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t, Sasha.\u201d</p><p>He nearly dropped to his knees at her easy acceptance. Just like before, when he told her about his uncle\u2019s schemes. Whatever it took, he\u2019d make it up to her.</p><p>She cast a glance over her shoulder, her blue eyes glowing eerily as lightening flashed. \u201cGo home to Missy, David. She\u2019s about to go in labor.\u201d</p><p>David smacked his hat against his thigh. \u201cDon\u2019t you start that crap with me. Tell me who set your damn house on fire so I can arrest his ass.\u201d</p><p>The lights went out and lightening flashed again, gifting Sasha with her silhouette.</p><p>\u201cSasha?\u201d Her voice was reedy thin.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d As if in slow motion her knees gave away and her body began to crumple to the floor. He managed to catch her before she hit the hardwood floor, her sweet frame soaked by the rain and ice cold where their skin touched.</p><p>\u201cDoes that answer your question, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>Turner worked his mouth for a moment and swiped his hand over his face. \u201cNot by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody right,\u201d Sasha agreed.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me what happened back there?\u201d Sasha turned the heat up in the car, giving her a sidelong glance. He fiddled with the controls, turning the radio up. The volume was low enough for conversation, but loud enough to hear the local DJ share what costume was the most popular this year.</p><p>Rose cast her gaze at the patrol car in front them, trying to convince herself that maybe the explosion had only set a part of her house on fire. That maybe the firemen had caught it in time. \u201cI passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose, you made a storm appear out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople can\u2019t control the weather.\u201d If she could, Holland Springs would be in The Guinness Book of World Records for the most assholes struck by lightning in one town. She laced her hands together in her lap. \u201cThey were calling for storms tonight.\u201d</p><p>The DJ reminded everyone to watch out for isolated evening thunderstorms.</p><p>\u201cConvenient.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. Nothing was. If things had been left up to her, she\u2019d be saying good-bye to Ivy. Telling Summer all the little things she needed to know about her. Giving her sister the baby book she\u2019d made. All the pictures she\u2019d taken. Well, not all of them. A few she\u2019d keep for herself. \u201cSummer won\u2019t wait until tomorrow to leave.\u201d A lump formed in her throat, almost as large as the boulder sitting in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll only stay as long as they need you, then I\u2019ll drive you to Jemma Leigh\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to say good-bye to Ivy, too.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him, the glow from the dashboard highlighting the stark lines of his face. Her heart pinched. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to miss her?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once and applied the brake as the patrol car slowed and made a left at the intertwined dogwoods that stood behind the Strawberry Grove street sign.</p><p>Sasha did the same, the bump as the tires hit the gravel making Rose sway slightly. She breathed deeply, clutching her hands tightly and wishing for her cross necklace. There was no way she could look. None at all. She closed her eyes like a coward.</p><p>The car quit moving.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open. She tried to speak but only air rushed out and a strange sort of croaking in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, love.\u201d He grabbed her hands, squeezing them.</p><p>Nothing in her life had prepared Rose for the sight that greeted her. Her own American horror story come to life.</p><p>Flames licked at Strawberry Grove, ravenous as it ate the almost three hundred year old structure. Fiery fingers reached for the sky, engulfing the roof and two chimneys. Paint peeled like skin from a rotted corpse. Blown out windows like empty eye sockets. Missing doors like mouths opened in a forever silent scream. Great billows of smoke so black that it blocked the moon\u2019s feeble attempt to shine. Ashes floated through the air, blanketing the firemen, their trucks and anything else nearby like dirty snow.</p><p>Obviously, the rain from the storm hadn\u2019t helped, but maybe that\u2019s what started it in the first place\u2014the lightning from the storm and not a person. It happened all the time, so why should her house be spared?</p><p>No, not her house. Her home, her safe haven where no one judged her. Where her family had lived for generations. Where Ivy had rolled over the first time, where she changed Ivy\u2019s first diaper, given Ivy her first bath and listened to her coo at Blackbeard.</p><p>It was where Rose had taken her first steps and said her first words. She and her sisters\u2019 height, yearly measured and marked on a wall by the back stairs. Giggles and secrets shared under the cover of darkness. Chasing butterflies and Blackbeard in the front yard. Helping her mother pick flowers as she and her sisters learned each one\u2019s proper name and uses. Things she\u2019d never do for Ivy, not at this home. And now that Summer had her back, not at any other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taking a deep breath, she risked a look at her forcing house. Only one corner remained. Gone were plants hundreds of years old. Gone were seeds kept in large glass jars, ones that you couldn\u2019t find on eBay or at Littman\u2019s Nursery five miles up the road.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just seeds or flowers; it was her legacy. Her means of support so she didn\u2019t have to end up like her mother. Like Summer.</p><p>How in God\u2019s name would she finish fulfilling the order for Barbara\u2019s Bugs? If she didn\u2019t uphold her end, then she wouldn\u2019t get paid. If she didn\u2019t get paid, she couldn\u2019t pay off her loan to Harrison. Thoughts of everything she was responsible for fell like dominoes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d David coughed. He waved over one of the volunteer firemen, and started questioning him. The terse shake of the fireman\u2019s helmet indicating that things were worse than what she thought.</p><p>\u201cArson.\u201d</p><p>The word pierced her heart. There was no way she could blame lightning now. There would be reports to fill out and reporters to avoid once they arrive. At least she didn\u2019t have an insurance policy on the house, because then she would have the added burden of convincing one of their agents she hadn\u2019t started the fire.</p><p>Despite the organized chaos of men and women running around lifting hoses, adjusting nozzles and giving orders, she\u2019d never felt more alone. Defeated.</p><p>Rose lifted her chin, determined not to show how hollow she felt inside. Determined not to lean on anyone for anything. Ever. She wouldn\u2019t acknowledge that it was Sasha holding her up, that his arms were anchoring her to this world.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re shivering, love.\u201d Sasha added another blanket\u2014his own\u2014to the one wrapped around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d She was shaking with rage. Fury and pain threatened to consume every good and decent part of her soul. Who would do something like this? She sliced her gaze to Sasha for a moment, then watched the sheriff head back their way.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer\u2014the fire\u2019s too hot.\u201d David ambled over, headlights illuminating the grim slash of his mouth. \u201cThe chicken coop out back\u2019s empty and someone saw your cat run off to the east.\u201d</p><p>The tiniest prick of joy made her want to smile. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Ominous creaking gave way to a sharp crack. The emergency crews began to shout and back away.</p><p>Sasha jerked her against him as the roof collapsed. \u201cWe have to leave, Rose. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRomanov\u2019s right, honey.\u201d David took off his hat and wiped his arm across his face, smearing ashes on his nose and cheeks. \u201cThere might be another explosion. Whoever did this wanted to make sure that nothing would be salvageable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>David held up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not accusing you, Rose. Everyone knows how important this house was to you. It\u2019s been in your family so long, it\u2019s like an honorary member. There\u2019s nothing you can do no how. I\u2019m not sure why I was told you needed to come out here.\u201d</p><p>Because it was a message. The Hollands had finally been purged from Holland Springs. At least her sisters and Ivy hadn\u2019t been home. Fury gave way to panic.</p><p>Rose grabbed Sasha\u2019s arm. \u201cI need to go to Jemma Leigh\u2019s. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer\u2019s gone.\u201d Gabriel stopped a few feet in front of her, his face highlighted by the fire behind her.</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Rose whispered.</p><p>Sasha muttered something under his breath.</p> <p>\u201cShe took off about fifteen minutes ago.\u201d Gabriel held out a piece of torn notebook paper. \u201cShe left this for you.\u201d</p><p>Rose took the paper. \u201cI need more light.\u201d</p><p>David shined his flashlight on it.</p><p>She read the note, then looked up at Gabriel. \u201cAn address\u2014that\u2019s it? I didn\u2019t even get to say good-bye.\u201d Covering her mouth with her hand, she tried not to cry. Tried to remain furious, but a piece of her was gone. Her baby girl was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop her?\u201d Sasha stepped in front of her. The pain in his voice undeniable. \u201cYou know how much Ivy means to Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I know is that Summer\u2019s her mother and it\u2019s not up to me,\u201d Gabriel countered. He sighed. \u201cShe loves her daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I love Ivy, too,\u201d Rose whispered brokenly.</p><p>Sasha turned around, grasping her upper arms. \u201cWe\u2019ll get her back. My uncle has a massive legal team at his disposal.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at the night sky, stars playing hide and seek with smoky clouds. Out of habit she searched for her star, resigned when she didn\u2019t find it. Apparently everything that mattered to her was gone. When she came back to earth, Sasha was frowning.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d He gave her a little shake, then let go.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s as it should be.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t. She shuffled to Sasha\u2019s car, climbing into the passenger side and staring at the windshield, staring at nothing.</p><p>Sasha joined her, a few minutes or hours later, she wasn\u2019t sure. He started up the car and covered her hand with his. \u201cI texted Skye and assured her that you were okay. She said she\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me to my store. I can sleep there.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m taking you home with me.\u201d</p><p>She was too drained to argue. \u201cFine.\u201d Taking one last lingering look at her home, Rose placed her palm on the window. Condensation gathered around the outline, blurring the colors.</p><p>Mercifully, the image faded as they drove away.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help getting your corset off?\u201d Sasha asked as he slid past her, turning on lights and opening doors.</p><p>Rose blinked, realizing they were in his room at the B&amp;B. She couldn\u2019t remember how she got there. Letting the blankets fall to the floor, she set to work on the buttons of Sasha\u2019s shirt. Somehow it\u2019d gotten wet, and the blankets had done very little to soak up the moisture.</p><p>She heard rain falling and turned to the window, but the part in the lace curtains showed a perfectly lovely night.</p><p>\u201cShower\u2019s going. Let\u2019s get this off of you, yes?\u201d Waiting for her consent, he smiled gently.</p><p>She nodded and he turned her, each tug sending a bigger rush of air into her lungs. The pretty lingerie fell to the floor in a small heap. Her panties and stockings were next to go. Sasha had been quick, efficient. Touching her only when necessary. There hadn\u2019t been any lingering, or hot kisses, not like the night he\u2019d fed her dinner.</p><p>Had that only been last night?</p><p>Sasha led her to the bathroom, joining Rose in the shower and pulling her close. \u201cWe smell like eau de smoke, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be worse.\u201d</p><p>Haunted blue eyes met his and Sasha wanted to howl at the unfairness of her situation, because in his mind it couldn\u2019t get any worse. Rose had lost her house, the supply to her business and most importantly, Ivy. All in one night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of you this time. Wash you up and tuck you in bed.\u201d He kissed her eyes closed and let hot water soak her hair before massaging in shampoo. Curls slipped through his fingers as he rinsed her hair, a sweet flowery scent replacing the smell of smoke and despair.</p><p>He soaped up a washcloth, tenderly running the material over the smooth skin of her face, her neck and shoulders. He followed the graceful lines of her back, the generous swell of her hips and the perfect breasts that tempted him to kiss the nipples.</p><p>Shaking his head, he mentally scolded himself for being the worst sort of cad.</p><p>He let his hand drift lower, closing his eyes as his fingers brushed her stomach and lower, then lower still as the cloth dropped to the floor. Damp hair slid on his knuckles and he jerked his hand away.</p><p>There had to be a safe place on her body that he could wash. Feet. And legs\u2014or at least the calves. Although her calves were shapely\u2014like her thighs\u2014and the curve of her birthmark on her inner thigh drove him crazy.</p><p>This was his penance, he thought. For every bad deed, thought or look. Hell wasn\u2019t fires burning bright, melting your flesh while you lived through the torment. No, hell was two consenting adults, bare skin, soapy palms and hot water while being forbidden to touch the woman of your dreams in the way you wanted.</p><p>Or perhaps this would be the closest he\u2019d ever get to heaven.</p><p>Bracing her against him, he bent down on one knee and lifted her foot to rest on it. Every delicate fold of her intimate flesh was bared to him. He swallowed a groan.</p><p>\u201cThe polish job doesn\u2019t look half bad,\u201d he said, trying to distract himself. Concentrating on her needs, he kept the cloth between them, a shield from his entirely inappropriate and unruly body. Each pass humbling him, unable to fathom why she would allow him of all people to care for her. To touch her when she was the most vulnerable.</p><p>He wanted to fall to his knees and thank her. Worship her.</p><p>Managing to angle the shower head so that water would hit them both, he washed his hair and body, then turned off the water.</p><p>Fluffy towels hanging from warm hangers waited for them as he stepped out of the shower. Grabbing two, he wrapped one around her sweet body and the second around her hair.</p><p>\u201cFeeling more yourself?\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly she nodded and handed him a towel.</p><p>He wrapped it around his hips and helped her out of the tub. She toweled herself off and grabbed the comb by the sink to run it through her hair.</p><p>When she was done, he gathered the wet mass and braided it for her, wringing the end out with a towel. \u201cDo you know how long I\u2019ve been waiting to wash your back?\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a smile flickered in her reflection.</p><p>Scooping her up in his arms, he carried her to bedroom. \u201cShould\u2019ve brought my cell phone into the shower and videoed it for prosperity.\u201d</p><p>Another small smile buoyed his heart.</p><p>Tucking her between the sheets wasn\u2019t hard, but dragging himself away was. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to set your house on fire in order to get me to sleep with you.\u201d He grabbed a pair of boxer briefs and pulled them on. \u201cI\u2019m not that complex of a man.\u201d</p><p>Black lashes lifted, revealing blue eyes full of anxiety and a deep pain. \u201cI don\u2019t have any clothes.\u201d</p><p>That was the last thing he expected her to worry about, and sorry bastard that he was, it was the last thing on his mind. \u201cI\u2019ll leave straightaway. Think the mall\u2019s open?\u201d He glanced at his phone, checking the time. It was nearly midnight. Nothing was open, not even the local Wal-Mart since it wasn\u2019t \u2018super-sized\u2019.</p><p>Her hand caught his arm and he froze. \u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>Whether she meant the bed, the room, or her life, he didn\u2019t care. He would stay in whatever capacity she\u2019d let him. Nodding, he gently grabbed her hand and kissed the knuckles.</p><p>Sliding over, she lifted the covers and met his eyes.</p><p>The selfish need to hold her overruled his sensibilities. He joined her and she went willingly into his arms, her body soft and warm. Feminine and sweet.</p><p>\u201cStrawberry Grove can be rebuilt, you know.\u201d He brushed his lips against her temple.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t have insurance.\u201d</p><p>Well, that certainly made things more difficult, but maybe he could find a way to help her. He was definitely sure she wouldn\u2019t take his money, so he\u2019d have to go another route. \u201cYou can stay here with me. I\u2019ll put off leaving for a couple of weeks.\u201d His mother was safe for the time being and Vladimir had always allowed him to take a holiday after his work was finished. For once he\u2019d actually like to think or say the word holiday without feeling like a fraud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Her voice was soft and serious. She sounded exhausted and felt like a dream. She shifted closer to him, the parts of her body that he was trying hard to ignore getting his attention. \u201cEveryone I love is leaving me.\u201d</p><p>Did that include him? He brushed the thought away. \u201cSkye\u2019s close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s leaving for Colorado on Monday.\u201d Rose let out a shaky breath. \u201cShe finally got off the waiting list for their midwifery program. It\u2019s for two years.\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell. He wanted to fix it for her, make things the way they used to be. Before he\u2019d shown up and ruined her life. Wasn\u2019t that what a man was programmed to do\u2014fix things for his woman? No, he reminded himself, Rose was not his woman.</p><p>\u201cThank you for taking care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to thank me. This is what...\u201d He paused, wondering with what word exactly he should use to fill in the blank. Friend or lover? While desirable, neither seemed appropriate at this point. \u201c...people who care about other people do for each other.\u201d He winced. That sounded lame to his ears.</p><p>Rose remained silent.</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, he risked a peek of her face and exhaled the pent up breath he hadn\u2019t been aware he\u2019d been holding. She was asleep, her chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm. One that indicated she\u2019d been that way for a while. There was a great chance (and his great hope) she\u2019d fallen asleep during his \u2018people caring about people\u2019 fail.</p><p>Rolling to one side, he turned off the lights.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Sasha had hardly slept last night. The woman laying so trustingly in his arms had seen to that. Every time she\u2019d moved or made the smallest of noises, he\u2019d tried soothing her. And every time her bare breasts or sweet ass had pressed against him, he\u2019d tried not to notice.</p><p>He\u2019d failed miserably. However, he\u2019d kept his own promise of thinking of her needs and ignored his body\u2019s insistence to make love to her.</p><p>Rose slid a silky soft leg over his thigh, her intimate curls brushing his skin and he hardened. Of its own volition, his hand drifted lower and cupped her. She was wet and warm. Damn, she felt so good. Her hips undulated against him and one of his fingers nearly slipped inside of her. She moaned and he glanced up at her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes blinked open, sleepy and heavy lidded. \u201cSasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant you.\u201d She grabbed his wrist and pulled up, his fingers slid inside of her. \u201cNeed you so bad.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you, sweetheart.\u201d He would take care of her forever. For as long she allowed. \u201cRelax.\u201d</p><p>Letting go of his wrist, she pushed the covers away. Her legs fell open and for the longest time he watched himself touch her there. As he made her body shake and tremble. As her moans filled the room.</p><p>Dipping his head, he tugged a cherry red nipple into his mouth and sucked hard. She cried out his name, arms rising to find her pillow. She fisted it between her hands.</p><p>His cock was so fucking hard right now, but he wanted to remain selfless. He closed his eyes and circled her nipple with his tongue. He wanted\u2014</p><p>Her hands grasped his cock, stroking him. Rolling to the side, he kissed her deeply, his tongue mimicking his fingers.</p> <p>She gasped his name into his mouth as she came. As he moaned hers, his own orgasm shaking him to his very core. Jesus Christ. He couldn\u2019t leave her. Not now. Not ever. There had to be a way for them to be together.</p><p>She smiled at him, tears in her eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me.\u201d He smoothed a stray curl from her face. \u201cGo back to sleep, love.\u201d She nodded and closed her eyes.</p><p>After cleaning himself off, he shot from the bed and headed to the bathroom. He made use of the facilities and dressed in record time.</p><p>Pressing a soft kiss to Rose\u2019s cheek, he left the room and jogged down the stairs, surprised to see the owner, Haven Crawford, lugging in a large box through the front entrance.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p> <p>Haven shot him a grateful smile and handed it over. \u201cDidn\u2019t take you for an early riser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose\u2019s still sleeping, and I couldn\u2019t.\u201d Sasha followed her to the back and set the box down on the floor in Haven\u2019s private quarters. \u201cAll of Rose\u2019s clothes were burned in the fire, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Haven gestured to the box. \u201cAlready taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Rose?\u201d He knelt in the floor, prying the flaps apart. He pulled out jeans and sweaters. Skirts and shoes. Everything from the mentionable to unmentionables filled the box. All were clean, most still had tags, but it didn\u2019t matter because someone or someones cared enough about Rose to help her out. Before she had to ask.</p><p>Hell, knowing Rose, she wouldn\u2019t have asked for help.</p><p>\u201cGabriel Edwards dropped it off,\u201d Haven said.</p><p>Sasha dropped a rather nice-looking pair of pumps. \u201cWho is he\u2014Superman?\u201d</p><p>Haven lifted her brows. \u201cIt came from the clothes closet at Grace Church. Most likely, his momma and sister picked them out before sending it over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take all this up to her.\u201d He started to heft the box in his arms, but a quick shake of Haven\u2019s head made him stop.</p><p>\u201cI want to hang it all up, iron anything that needs it and generally make everything look nice for Rose. I have some luggage she can borrow, too.\u201d Haven began taking out the clothes, laying them across the sofa and lining up shoes along the bottom. \u201cThere\u2019s more coming, Gabriel said, and Jemma Leigh\u2019s organizing a drive for Rose or something like that.\u201d</p><p>He could only imagine the \u2018something like that\u2019 Jemma Leigh would have in mind, but it would be from the heart. It seemed like there was nothing for him to do now.</p><p>Standing, he dusted off his trousers. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose sends her couples to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer couples?\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck.</p><p>Haven glanced up at him \u201cThe ones that take her advice to look for the spring. Almost always, there\u2019s an engagement. And almost always, they have their wedding here. Or a reception if they want to do the church thing.\u201d Haven bent back over the box, pink hair with purple tips sliding to the side. \u201cShe sent me my first customer two years ago, when I first opened for business. This is the least I can do for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe in the legend of the spring?\u201d</p><p>Haven snorted. \u201c\u2019Course not. But I believe in Rose and so do a lot of other people.\u201d Haven gathered some clothes and handed them to Sasha. She selected a pair of flats and the heavy winter coat from the bottom of the box, adding them to his pile. \u201cTake these to her.\u201d</p><p>Sasha dashed off to his room, throwing open the door. \u201cWake up, sleepyhead.\u201d</p><p>Rose sat up. \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the clothes on the bed. \u201cGuess what I\u2019ve got for you. Well, not me exactly. There\u2019s loads more...Rose?\u201d</p><p>Rose didn\u2019t answer him. She sat with the covers pulled to her chest and her gaze on the comforter.</p><p>\u201cHaven sent these to you. They\u2019re from Edwards\u2019 church.\u201d He hated even mentioning the man\u2019s name, but credit had to be given where it was due. \u201cApparently, that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg. If you\u2019d like some help putting outfits together, I\u2019ll volunteer\u2014as long as you promise to model the lingerie for me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the flats and turned them over, then dropped them on the floor. \u201cAre those supposed to make up for my house burning down?\u201d</p><p>This was so not his Rose, but allowances had to be made. She\u2019d just lost everything. Running a palm over his jaw, he took a shaky breath. \u201cI know it\u2019s not cheesecake, but new clothes always worked for me. Sex, too. I am a man, after all.\u201d When she didn\u2019t look up from the bed, he sat down beside her. \u201cHelp me out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll thank Haven and Gabriel when I see them.\u201d She pulled her knees to her chest and rested her head on them.</p><p>He stroked her hair, watching as the curls came loose from her braid. \u201cCome away with me. We\u2019ll go any place you want\u2014although I do have some recommendations. There\u2019s this little island off of Spain you\u2019d like.\u201d This he could do for her. He could make her forget for a while. Hell, if he could convince her, he would keep her with him. Until he was free and then they\u2019d really be free\u2014together. Go anywhere, do anything without anyone giving a damn.</p><p>\u201cAnd do what?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>Sasha lifted a curl from her shoulder and rubbed it between his fingers. \u201cSleep, eat, shop...make love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to leave, to run away from my problems and responsibilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve more than this kind of life.\u201d He dropped the curl between his fingers and grabbed the cross at his neck.</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d she asked, her voice monotone. Emotionless.</p><p>Was that all? He looked around the room, struggling to keep his temper in check. \u201cI want to spend every day...every minute with you, Rosebud.\u201d</p><p>Pretty blue eyes met his. In their depths was so much pain that it made him want to reach for her. To kiss and hold her until the world fell away and no one could hurt her again. \u201cUntil your uncle has other plans for you.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath, \u201cI\u2019ve no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d Her gaze was unwavering.</p><p>Blood rushed to his head. \u201cWhat kind of sick fuck makes something like that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind that preys on an innocent woman and her family. The kind that makes her think that she matters, that makes her think you care about her when all you really wanted to do was have a little fun while you bided your time,\u201d Rose said, shoving away the covers and reaching for the clothes he\u2019d brought to her. \u201cThe kind who suggests a vacation after her home is destroyed, after her family leaves her all alone. After her baby is taken away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy went home with her mother,\u201d he pointed out and she flinched.</p><p>Rose tugged a pale orange sweater over her head. \u201cAm I supposed to wait around while you screw up someone else\u2019s life?\u201d She yanked on a pair of panties, then jeans. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re done, I should welcome you back into my bed, never knowing if you\u2019ve been with someone else.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, then began pacing the room. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even to save your mother?\u201d</p><p>Her parting shot almost made him march out of the room right then and there. But she\u2019d been through so much in the past twenty-four hours that he couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave her. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Rose?\u201d he asked as their eyes met. \u201cI want you with me. I\u2019m begging you to go. Please, you have to go.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s heart pounded in her chest. There were lots of things she wanted to from him, but he couldn\u2019t give her any of it. She was tempted to take him up on his offer. How easy it would be to leave this place. To start over like her sisters had chosen to do, but she couldn\u2019t. She belonged here.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bloody fucking owe you, that\u2019s why,\u201d he shouted and her heart quit pounding. It sank in her chest, heavy with despair. He thought he owed her. It was his only reason for even suggesting she leave Holland Springs.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go with you,\u201d she whispered and grabbed the coat from the bed.</p><p>His jaw worked. \u201cCan\u2019t or won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t easy for her. Who would choose to live a life like this, confined to a role she had no desire to play. \u201cI\u2019m Poppy, my mother was Poppy, her mother before her. It\u2019s just the way things are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one gives a damn about Poppy Holland.\u201d He shook his head and rapped his knuckles on the mantle above the fireplace. \u201cNo one knows who that is anymore. Your family\u2019s the ones clinging to the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I have left.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an incredulous look. One that was underlined with vulnerability, but she refused to let it sway her. \u201cYou have me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBecause you owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No...fuck it all.\u201d He strode to her, gripping her shoulders. His heated gaze pierced her heart. \u201cDon\u2019t you want something different?\u201d</p><p>Yes, she wanted something different, but she did not want to be with a man who thought he owed her. Who\u2019d mentioned nothing of love. She loved Sasha\u2014God, she loved him. But she refused to stand by him why he worked for his uncle. It wasn\u2019t about him choosing his mother over her. She\u2019d never ask him to. And the thing she knew Sasha wanted the most was the thing that being with her would never give him\u2014his freedom. \u201cI want you to leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s green eyes shuttered and his hands fell to his sides. His face was devoid of emotion, of warmth. \u201cFine. Stay here and rot for all I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Sasha.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her feet into the flats and moved to the door, closing it softly behind her. Forcing the tears back, she closed her eyes to pain, not wanting to think of how tenderly he\u2019d taken care of her last night. How he\u2019d touched her so reverently and like she was made of glass. As if he knew that all the cracks in her soul were threatening to break her body into pieces. Then this morning, the most intimate time of her life.</p><p>She told herself that she didn\u2019t need Sasha in her life. That she\u2019d made the right decision. That sometimes a person had to set free the person they loved the most.</p><p>She\u2019d always hated old sayings like that, because it was obvious that whoever thought it up had never gone through it themselves.</p><p>Lifting her chin, she descended the stairs and went to find Haven.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Sasha boarded the jet, flinging the painting of Poppy Holland in the nearest chair and hoping like hell he\u2019d damaged the thing.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t waiting until next week to leave. Today would suit him just fine.</p><p>Except he wasn\u2019t fine. He was the exact opposite of it. He was the most miserable sod on the face of the planet and couldn\u2019t do a damn thing about it.</p><p>For some reason known only to God and Rose, she was convinced that she belonged in that ass-backwards town. That she had to be Poppy Holland to a generation that cared little and knew nothing of what it meant to her. Jason Everett hadn\u2019t preyed on Rose solely because of her last name. Jason had done it because he was an unfeeling asshole. Unfortunately and most likely, Rose wasn\u2019t the first or the last woman he would hurt.</p><p>Perhaps Vladimir had been right all along. Sasha should have never tried playing the hero. Look what it had gotten him. Absolutely nothing. His uncle still plotted, his cousins were either not speaking to him or still missing. Phoebe hung on by a thread, wasting away while the woman he loved...Jesus.</p><p>He stared at back of a seat. \u201cI love her. I love Rose.\u201d Fate couldn\u2019t be this cruel to make him love a woman whose life he ended up helping to destroy after all.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been cleared for take-off, Mr. Romanov.\u201d The pilot\u2019s voice came through the intercom.</p><p>Sasha glanced out of one of the windows, hoping for some kind of unnatural weather pattern, but all it did was continue to rain.</p><p>He sat heavily in one of the numerous seats and fastened his seatbelt, ignoring the football match on the flat screen.</p><p>Once they were airborne, a flight attendant strolled through the cabin, the expression on her face inviting and hopeful as she bent over, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnything you need?\u201d That same hand slid lower, nearing his groin, but he caught it and gently moved it into away.</p><p>\u201cNot this time, Taylor.\u201d Not ever. She wasn\u2019t Rose. No woman ever would be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back with a soda water.\u201d Taylor said, then walked away.</p><p>He let his eyes close and put his heartache firmly from his mind.</p><p>Three days later, Sasha met his uncle at Romanov Industries London offices. He\u2019d always admired this particular building, mostly for its view of the hands-on museum across the street. He\u2019d loved going there as a child with his parents. They would spend the whole day exploring and touching everything in sight. Every child\u2019s dream come true. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, Vladimir wanted to tear the thing down because it blocked his view of the Thames.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019ve dared show your face.\u201d His uncle strode into the office, security on his heels but always ten paces behind. \u201cI had to pay someone to do your job.\u201d</p><p>Bored at the always threatening tone of Vladimir, Sasha snagged an Asian pear from a fruit basket and rubbed it on his shirt. \u201cExplosion expert is not on my list of talents.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPity, it would actually make the other one less lonely if it were.\u201d</p><p>There were times, Sasha darkly acknowledged, that his uncle\u2019s sarcastic nature was unnervingly identical to his. He took a savage bite of the pear.</p><p>\u201cMake it quick. I\u2019ve more important things to do than listen to you blather on about your inheritance, your mother or what you don\u2019t feel like doing.\u201d</p><p>The speech he\u2019d been prepared to make went into his mental wastebasket and what was left of his pear in the trash bin. \u201cI quit.\u201d</p><p>Glacial eyes bore into his. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeed a hearing-aid in your advanced years, do you?\u201d</p><p>Vladimir cursed in Russian and advanced on Sasha. \u201cYou can\u2019t quit.\u201d</p><p>They stood toe to toe, but for the first time, Sasha was without fear. There was nothing his uncle could do to his mother. Phoebe\u2019s health had deteriorated to the point that even the doctors refused Vladimir\u2019s intimidation. A new administrator with family connections to MI6 and an amazing dedication to her patients hadn\u2019t hurt either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done. It\u2019s over. Finito. Sore de kimatta. Shall I say it in your native tongue, or my mother\u2019s?\u201d Sasha didn\u2019t bother to hide his smirk.</p><p>A vein pulsed in Vladimir\u2019s forehead. His face turned red, then purple as his eyes bulged. He clutched his left arm, dropping to the floor.</p><p>Sasha rushed to his side, knocking two security guards out of his way. He loosened the tie and unfastened the collar around his uncle\u2019s throat. \u201cCall the medics, he\u2019s having some kind of attack.\u201d</p> <p>Cell phones were whipped out, voices giving descriptions of what had just happened.</p><p>His uncle wheezed and gasped for breath.</p><p>\u201cKeep breathing, because I\u2019ll be damned if I give you mouth-to-mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-ss,\u201d his uncle began, his eyes rolling and spittle accumulating in the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDeathbed apology\u2014not quite what I wanted, but who am I to argue with the Grim Reaper.\u201d</p><p>A crew of in-house medics entered the room, brushing Sasha out of the way. They worked over the twitching body.</p><p>Sasha strolled over to the window, gazing down at the always busy sight of London\u2019s streets. He supposed he should feel sorry or pity...something, but he couldn\u2019t. He just didn\u2019t have it in him. Tucking his hands into his trouser pockets, he started whistling and slipped out of the room.</p><p>A medic stopped him in the hallway. \u201cSir?\u201d</p> <p>Sasha grunted.</p><p>\u201cThe receptionist said you were next-of-kin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only one who\u2019ll claim him, you mean,\u201d Sasha grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Traffic was forgiving and they made it in record time. After waiting for an hour in a pleasant room with beige walls while reading fashion magazines two months out of date, a doctor entered the room.</p><p>\u201cYour uncle\u2019s stable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the good news?\u201d Sasha asked, not really caring that the man looked aghast.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me, I\u2019ll take you to him.\u201d</p><p>Sasha passed a few nurses who winked at him and waved. Beds with only curtains for privacy lined the walls as he got closer to the private rooms.</p><p>His uncle lay prone in bed, his eyes active and alert as Sasha and the doctor drew closer. \u201cYour uncle had a stroke, Mr. Romanov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he able to speak?\u201d</p><p>The doctor grabbed the chart from the shelf in the wall and scanned over it. \u201cNot at this time. The injury done to his body will require intense physical therapy. The kind that we, unfortunately, don\u2019t offer.\u201d</p><p>Glacial eyes hardened, one narrowing while the other\u2019s eyelid drooped.</p><p>\u201cWho does?\u201d Sasha asked, his gaze unwavering on his uncle\u2019s face.</p><p>He looked up from his chart. \u201cSt. Mary\u2019s and, well, between the two of us, the other place isn\u2019t worth mentioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChilder\u2019s?\u201d It would be divine justice to send the evil son of a bitch there. For Vladimir to be at the mercy of inattentive workers and dodgy facilities with shite conditions. He could send him there and his uncle\u2019s days would be numbered, a revenge so tantalizing that it shimmered and tempted him to grab it. To make his uncle pay.</p><p>Vladimir let out a snort. Sasha didn\u2019t know if the man was daring him to do it, or mentally calling him weak. But only a true villain took revenge on a weak man. And he was done being the villain.</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Mary\u2019s.\u201d Sasha nodded his head. There were just some things a man didn\u2019t do. Turn into his uncle was one of them.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but it\u2019s not up to you.\u201d</p><p>Both Sasha and the doctor turned.</p><p>\u201cSebastian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always did have a talent for telling us apart.\u201d Arrogant and cold, with his pale eyes and slicked back hair, his formerly missing cousin strode into the room wearing a three-piece suit.</p><p>\u201cEasy enough\u2014you\u2019re the one with the stick up your arse.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian handed a stack of papers to the obviously confused doctor. \u201cHe\u2019s being transferred to Childer\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Sasha gaped at him. \u201cThat place will most likely kill him.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian leaned over his father, placing a kiss on his forehead. \u201cOne can only hope.\u201d</p><p>What sounded like a laugh burst from Vladimir\u2019s mouth. Over and over the horrible sound like a gun being fired, until the three of them were forced to leave the room while a nurse rushed past them, hypodermic needle in hand.</p><p>Sebastian paused in the middle of the hallway. \u201cI\u2019ll be taking over as head of Romanov Industries.\u201d</p><p>Astounded, Sasha stared at him. His cousin was going to waltz in and take over like he hadn\u2019t been missing for the past six months? \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere and there.\u201d Sebastian sliced his hand in the air. \u201cI have massive plans for R.I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave Rose Holland alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Sasha smiled, slowly and with confidence. \u201cI\u2019ll email pictures of you and Kate in a rather intimate moment to The Daily Mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Sebastian pulled on leather gloves. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in partnering with Nahalah Industries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll leave my mum at St. Mary\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guilty of many things, but using a dying woman as leverage isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>Sasha hadn\u2019t thought his cousin was that much of a bastard, but he couldn\u2019t be sure. For years Sebastian had followed in his father\u2019s footsteps. Trying, it seemed to Sasha, to snatch every crumb of attention and praise from Vladimir when it was tossed his way.</p><p>\u201cLastly, I want my inheritance and for everyone to leave me alone. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s brows lifted, an amused smile on his lips. The first Sasha had seen since they were boys. \u201cDidn\u2019t he ever tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this time I thought you were an utter bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut with it,\u201d Sasha demanded, clenching his hands into fists.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had control of everything for the past three years. If you\u2019d taken the time to actually go over the documents with your father\u2019s lawyer, you\u2019d have known.\u201d Sebastian turned on his heel, leaving Sasha to do what he hadn\u2019t done since Holland Springs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting pissed,\u201d he said to no one in particular.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Despite Rose\u2019s prayers and bargaining with God, Tuesday came as it always had. To add insult to injury, the sun shone brightly while fluffy clouds lazily drifted in the sky. An absolutely perfect day to auction off her home, her life and her dreams.</p><p>The clock on the microwave changed from 1:59 to 2:00 and her heart dropped to her stomach, acid eating it away. The land that Strawberry Grove had been built on was gone, sold to an international corporation for a fire-sale of a price.</p><p>She half-laughed and half-sobbed, wrapping her arms around her knees as she sat on the small sofa.</p><p>Most people in Holland Springs had probably lined up hours ahead of time to watch. Heck, they were probably bidding on it, just to make things interesting, because they sure weren\u2019t coming to her store.</p><p>She had even heard rumblings of a party to celebrate the whole occasion. No one had done a thing to help her, not that she wanted their help anyway.</p><p>The box of clothes Gabriel\u2019s church had sent her didn\u2019t really count. And neither did Haven\u2019s offer of a place to stay or the luggage she packed with all those clothes. Well, maybe that wasn\u2019t completely fair.</p><p>She frowned and placed her chin on one of her knees. Gabriel\u2019s church did that for anyone in need, regardless of reputation or economic status. Haven probably wanted to keep their business relationship on good terms.</p><p>Then again, maybe no one knew where she was. Her store was on a side-street that only those with a purpose to shop at Carolina Dreams came down. But Haven knew, she\u2019d taken her to the fire station near her house to get her Jeep. According to the owner of the B&amp;B, a good Samaritan had towed it there right after emergency crews had arrived on scene.</p><p>For almost the entire weekend, she had hidden in her little apartment, only venturing out to have dinner with Skye before she left for Colorado. Skye had driven them to an out of the way caf\u00e9 near Wilmington. They\u2019d spent hours reminiscing and Rose had made a promise to include her in more than just the mundane things of her life.</p><p>Then she had waited until her baby sister had said good bye and driven out of sight before she let herself cry. And that wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d been safely locked in the bathroom, hot water falling on her head and mingling with her tears.</p><p>Rose glanced around the room. Empty shelves lined the wall where all of her extra products had once been. Her apartment felt like a place, not a home.</p><p>The fridge\u2019s fan kicked on, humming. Other than that it was quiet. Stifling. Suffocating.</p><p>Leaning over the back of the sofa, she opened a window and peered out. Sheriff Turner walked right under her window, carrying a box. He knocked on her front door, but she\u2018d be damned if she answer it. Every time David showed up, he brought nothing but bad news and that box looked like it could hold more than she could handle.</p><p>Who was she kidding? The head of a pin could hold more bad news than she could handle right now.</p><p>At least she couldn\u2019t see the courthouse from here, but she\u2019d find cold comfort where she could. For a long time, Rose had thought she\u2019d always done fine on her own, but a man with moss colored eyes and a sexy smile had shown her just how wrong she was. She had been completely unprepared to be alone, not fully comprehending how big of a void Ivy and Sasha had filled in her life. But now...</p><p>Now they were gone and while she might see Ivy again, she had no doubt Sasha would never come back here. No he\u2019d soon be off (if he wasn\u2019t already), charming his next victim out of whatever his uncle wanted. And if his next victim were a woman, he\u2019d be charming his way into her bed.</p><p>She gave a little snort, then a soft cry. As if he needed to do that. All it had taken for her was a nap, cheesecake, helping her clean vacation homes, bringing back her chickens, cooking her dinner, painting her toes...She drew her brows together.</p><p>Sasha had done a lot for a man intent on seduction. He\u2019d done things that most men wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of doing. Although she could chalk it up to his training, his life for the past several years. A life that, according to him, he wasn\u2019t allowed to live like he wanted.</p><p>Unwrapping her arms, she stood up and moved to the top of the stairs. There had to be something she could do to keep her mind off of the auction. Off of Ivy. Off of Sasha.</p><p>She jogged down the stairs and slipped into her office, powering on her desktop.</p><p>The clock on the right hand side of the screen read 2:15.</p><p>Taking a steadying breath, she began to surf the internet. With only a couple of clicks she tortured herself with pictures of Sasha. She made a face at the screen and moved to x it out, only to stop when she felt someone looking over her shoulder.</p><p>She tentatively glanced back and her mouth dropped open. Her heart resurfaced from her stomach and began pounding furiously in her chest.</p><p>\u201cMomma?\u201d Rose jumped up from her chair, her fingers automatically searching for the cross that Sasha still had.</p><p>Azalea Holland smiled, hair the color of honey framing an ethereally beautiful face dominated by bright lavender eyes. Impeccably dressed in a suit and skirt that matched her eyes, she looked nothing like the woman Rose remembered. A woman who\u2019d favored lived-in jeans and form-fitting t-shirts from her favorite concerts.</p><p>Rose wanted nothing more than to curse the woman, yell at her, or even tell Azalea to get the hell out of her store, but tears clogged her throat and blurred her vision. All she could do was stand there and stare.</p><p>\u201cOh, sugar, it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Azalea didn\u2019t move any closer.</p><p>Waves of embarrassment washed over Rose, leaving her cold. She wanted her mother to hug her. She pressed her fingers to her eyes, trying to get her emotions under control. \u201cWhere have you been? Where were you when I needed your help?\u201d</p><p>Azalea dug into her wide purse, pulling out a handkerchief and a manila folder. She handed Rose the handkerchief and set the folder on the shelf beside her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t anywhere good. And I sure as hell wasn\u2019t fit to help you then, but now...\u201d She tapped on the folder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drying her eyes, Rose pressed her mother for more answers. \u201cBut now you are? Does your suit have superpowers or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to make my assistant, Barney, cry in less than five seconds when I fuss at him for not recycling.\u201d Azalea brushed a curl behind Rose\u2019s ear. \u201cSo pretty. I always knew you\u2019d be a stunner.\u201d Her eyes dropped to Rose\u2019s neck. \u201cWhy\u2019d you run him off, sugar?\u201d</p><p>Rose stepped back, bumping into her desk. \u201cStop it. I want you to answer my questions, not ask ones of your own.\u201d</p> <p>Azalea moved the desk chair from behind Rose, sat down and crossed her legs. \u201cFire away.\u201d</p><p>For the life of her, Rose couldn\u2019t come up with a single one.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I help you out?\u201d Azalea leaned forward in her chair. \u201cI\u2019m not proud I did what I did. I chose to run off with one of my gentlemen friends, leaving you girls behind. Those were some dark years for me. I got caught up with the wrong people, filled my body with the wrong things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need that much information,\u201d Rose muttered.</p><p>Azalea continued, \u201cAbout four years ago, I met the nicest man...a rich one to boot. I tried every trick I knew to get him into bed, to get him really into me and wanting to spend some cash. But nothing worked. He wanted to get to know me.\u201d</p> <p>Rose crossed her arms. \u201cGet to the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped he would have made you smile more.\u201d Azalea frowned, her perfect skin actually creasing. \u201cThen again, I\u2019m not sure how much a young man like him would have to smile about. Always having to follow the bidding of another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read Alexander\u2019s horoscope this morning in The Gazette while having coffee with Jemma Leigh.\u201d</p><p>Of course Jemma Leigh would tell Azalea everything she knew. No Holland hocus-pocus needed.</p><p>A little smile formed on her mother\u2019s lips. \u201cIs he as snazzy of a dresser as it said? Those things can be so moody. I really should have brought my charts with me, but I packed up in such a hurry to avoid rush hour. Traffic in Charlotte can be a real pain.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte? \u201cYou\u2019ve been there all this time,\u201d Rose whispered. She sat down in a metal folding chair in the corner. Her mother had been only five hours away.</p><p>\u201cOnly for the past three years. I started Barbara\u2019s Bugs in Concord, in Devlin\u2019s basement.\u201d Azalea picked up the manila folder and handed it to Rose. \u201cThis is my apology to you girls. I can\u2019t go back and be your momma again. I\u2019ve got two little ones to try to get it right with this time, and I\u2019m a married woman now.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, Rose took the folder, but didn\u2019t open it. Her mother was someone else\u2019s mother. Someone\u2019s wife. Obviously Azalea didn\u2019t want Rose or her sisters to be a part of her new life, because she hadn\u2019t mentioned anything of coming to see her or meeting any new siblings. She hadn\u2019t asked about Ivy either.</p><p>Azalea stood, smoothing the material of her skirt and hiking the straps of her purse higher on her shoulder. Diamond rings on her hands flashed at her. But on her right pointer finger, Azalea still wore the mood ring Rose, Summer and Skye had bought her for Mother\u2019s Day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen great things for you. We\u2019re going to be business partners. Barbara\u2019s Bugs has decided to invest in Carolina Dreams by providing you with capital to get Strawberry Grove\u2019s forcing house rebuilt and the plants growing again. Check the cottage west of the house. All the backup jars, as my grandmother Poppy liked to call them, are in hidden under a trap door in the kitchen. You\u2019ll know where, when you step on just the right place.\u201d</p><p>Rose glanced down at the folder, then back up at her mother. \u201cBut it was auctioned off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you know it, but the owner of Strawberry Grove finally got word what was going on, and paid off the back taxes early this morning.\u201d Azalea winked at her, then leaned down to press a cool kiss to Rose\u2019s forehead. \u201cAnd no more going down to Harrison\u2019s office either, unless you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have a loan with him,\u201d Rose protested.</p> <p>Azalea straightened. \u201cYou\u2019re also owed eighteen years of back child support. Rather than go to court and drag this out, exposing his secrets; he agreed to my terms.\u201d</p><p>Rose bit her bottom lip. \u201cWhat about Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey.\u201d Her mother shook her head, closing her eyes. When they opened, they were shiny with tears. \u201cI filled you and your sisters\u2019 heads up with so much nonsense. There stopped being a Poppy Holland when my grandmother named my mother Lake and made sure everyone called her that. Sure we kept the name going by passing it down, but Poppy\u2019s gone. People don\u2019t believe in that stuff no how. It\u2019s the reputation that gets remembered and kicked down the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut people need Poppy Holland. It\u2019s our...my duty to give love advice.\u201d</p><p>Azalea sighed and played with one of her many rings. \u201cYou\u2019re giving a name too much power over you. There\u2019s a time and place for tradition, but one that keeps a woman down ain\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say; you left.\u201d Rose stood, lifting her chin. \u201cI stayed.\u201d</p><p>Azalea made a noise of disapproval. \u201cLook where it\u2019s gotten you. You had the chance to leave with Alexander. To see the world and be a young woman for once.\u201d</p><p>Growing up, she\u2019d always believed in the magic of her mother, but after Azalea left, Rose had put away childish things. Or so she thought. There was no way her mother could know about Sasha\u2019s offer. No one did.</p><p>Azalea nodded at the computer screen. \u201cHe\u2019s the man in the picture?\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s eyes widened as she turned around. She\u2019d forgotten about her ridiculous web-surfing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for him. He kinda popped up on the screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I made sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stubborn child. That man loves you.\u201d Her mother sounded so certain that Rose almost believed her. Almost.</p><p>Rose shook her head, then turned back to her mother. \u201cNo, he owes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the harm in letting him pay you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not you. I don\u2019t use people.\u201d</p><p>Azalea lifted a brow. \u201cNot all of us are as strong as you, Rose. And some of us actually like men and having one around.\u201d</p><p>The not-so-thinly veiled insult hit its mark. \u201cI like men.\u201d In fact she loved one and she wanted him around indefinitely, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be. \u201cAnd I respect them enough to treat them decently.\u201d Like she had with Sasha? No, she\u2019d let her pride get in the way. She\u2019d let her fear color her words.</p><p>\u201cDid you take Alexander to the spring?\u201d A knowing look entered her mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cShare some strawberry wine with him...take him to your bed?\u201d</p><p>Rose couldn\u2019t have stopped the blush that flooded her face if she had tried. \u201cThat\u2019s really none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Azalea gave her a self-satisfied smile and reached for her hand, squeezing it gently. \u201cLet\u2019s not fight, honey. One day you can introduce me to your man and I can give you some pointers.\u201d</p><p>It was then Rose realized what a blessing in disguise it had been for her mother to leave. For all the good that her mother had done today, she was still selfish and self-centered. Women around here might have had a good reason not to like her family after all.</p><p>Still, this wasn\u2019t the reunion she\u2019d dreamed of. Her mother wouldn\u2019t be in her life, not in the way she\u2019d always hoped.</p><p>\u201cI look forward to doing business with you, Barbara.\u201d Rose managed to shake her mother\u2019s hand and slip it out of her gasp.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s face transformed into a cool business woman. \u201cAs do I, Ms. Holland.\u201d Walking out the door, Azalea tossed over her shoulder, \u201cThere\u2019s someone waiting out here for you.\u201d</p><p>A familiar black streak of fur raced inside and jumped up into Rose\u2019s arms. \u201cBlackbeard, you bad kitty, where have you been?\u201d</p><p>The cat meowed, then began purring.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d She buried her face in the cat\u2019s fur.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>After consulting world-renowned experts and all of them coming to the same consensus that no brain activity had been present for the past three weeks, Sasha had made the gut-wrenching decision to take his mother off of life-support.</p><p>Each one had assured him that he was doing the right thing. However, the right thing never turned out to be the easiest thing.</p><p>She\u2019d taken her last breath in his arms, a shuddering sigh that racked her frail body. He remembered telling his mum that he loved her. Then silence; not even the machines dared to make a noise. Sasha had held her until the doctor on call had come to the room and given the time of death for the nurse to record.</p><p>He\u2019d buried Phoebe beside his dad, as they had wanted. Christian and Sebastian had attended, the strain between them obvious but not overwhelming. Sasha had felt a sort of melancholy mood invade his body during the ceremony, but he\u2019d had three weeks with his mum.</p><p>Every day he\u2019d visited her. Some days he\u2019d talk for hours, reading from their favorite fashion magazines on his tablet. Other days, he was content to sit in silence or listen to her playlist on his iPod, relieved to be able to simply be with her. Free from worry. From responsibility.</p><p>Sublimely free.</p><p>It was everything he\u2019d wanted. Everything he\u2019d thought he needed. The freedom to come and go as he pleased. No more looking over his shoulder. No more getting the living hell beat out of him. No more waiting for the other shoe to drop and watch his uncle play God with Phoebe\u2019s life.</p><p>His mother was at peace, and he could imagine that his father was at peace as well. That they were waltzing around Heaven, fantastically happy to be together again. A part of him was happy for them as well.</p><p>But as he sat in his favorite pub and drank his favorite ale, all he could think of was Rose. What she was doing. Thinking. Who she might be seeing.</p><p>A couple of men booed as their rugby team took another hit. In the corner a couple held hands and snogged.</p><p>Sasha took another pull of his beer and grimaced. He knew without a doubt who\u2019d want to be snogging Rose: Gabriel Edwards. The bloody sod. Though to be fair, Edwards was a decent fellow. He was someone that would be good for Rose\u2014boring, but good\u2014and he\u2019d keep her safe from men like Jason. Men like Sasha.</p><p>He scratched his jaw. He had no idea what the two of them would talk about. Edwards was as quiet as Rose. She needed someone a bit more social, a bit more charming. A bit more of himself.</p><p>\u201cDelusions of grandeur, mate,\u201d he mumbled. Rose had made it perfectly clear that she didn\u2019t need him. No, her traditions, her small town and her store were what she needed. What she preferred over him.</p><p>\u201cGod Almighty, Sasha, couldn\u2019t you\u2019ve picked a better place to get up to?\u201d Sebastian sneered in the mirror behind the bar.</p><p>Sasha rolled his eyes as his cousin took out a pristine handkerchief and attempted to clean off the sticky counter. \u201cI\u2019d reckoned there\u2019s no better place than the one you wouldn\u2019t be seen in.\u201d He turned toward Sebastian and saluted him with his bottle.</p><p>\u201cWhile I had assumed you\u2019d be off to places more exotic for Fashion Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Fashion Week, and I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Sebastian raised his brows. \u201cThere can be only one thing to keep you away from clothes or get you out of them\u2014a woman. Or more precisely Rose Holland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a fucking clue what you\u2019re about.\u201d Sasha struggled to remain impassive. \u201cBut you do know where you can precisely shove it.\u201d Slamming his bottle down on the bar counter, he motioned the bartender over and settled up his tab.</p><p>\u201cGood to know some things never change,\u201d Sebastian said.</p><p>\u201cSod off,\u201d Sasha muttered and stumbled out into the freezing November night, leaving his arrogant ass of a cousin behind. He hailed a cab, muttered his address and leaned his head against the back of the seat. When they arrived, he slipped in the deserted townhouse and told himself that it was better this way.</p><p>No beast wrapping around his ankles and doing its level best to trip him as he trudged up the stairs and to his bedroom. No baby toys to dodge, or soft lullabies being sung in the middle of the night. No starfish-shaped hands reaching for him. No drooling mouth messing up another shirt, or breaking into a grin.</p><p>He certainly didn\u2019t miss the smell of night blooming jasmine. Or the way rare smiles would make him feel victorious. Luminous blue eyes that could see to his soul were blocked from every thought. And he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t think of how it felt to be inside of her, of how she moaned his name or clutched him to her. Of how much he loved being with Rose.</p><p>He loved Rose...Ivy, too.</p><p>Looking in the mirror, he shook his head, then shucked off his clothes. A cold bed greeted him. He paused, one knee on the mattress and took a deep breath. This was his life and he\u2019d better get used to it.</p><p>Mercifully, sleep claimed him seconds after his head hit the pillow.</p><p>The worst thing about coming to terms with all the lies Rose had been told was confronting her worst fears.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the afternoon digging through the charred remains of Strawberry Grove, hoping to find something worth salvaging. The only thing she found was a half-burnt chest of jewels and pictures in her room. No, not her room\u2014Poppy\u2019s room. A room so sacred that as a child she\u2019d hovered in the doorway, watching her mother as she dressed for her dates. Every Poppy had inherited this room. Or so she\u2019d been led to believe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had searched and searched for her beloved book. The one that had passed down from one Poppy to the next. The one truth in her life, the abundance of handwritten notes in the margins couldn\u2019t have been forged. But she hadn\u2019t been able to find it. Good thing she had the majority of it memorized.</p><p>Her shoulders drooped a little.</p><p>Only she didn\u2019t want the memory, she wanted the real thing.</p><p>The sun dipped behind the horizon and she pulled her cardigan tighter around her middle.</p> <p>In her purse she carried an envelope with a check, one that would ease her conscience and free her from Harrison\u2019s hold. No matter what kind of deal Azalea had worked out with him, Rose wanted the loan to be paid in full. The legal way, the right way. Every way that neither of her parents had chosen to use.</p><p>She pushed the first door opened and entered the bank. This time she let a small smile push at the corners of her lips. More than a few patrons and employees actually smiled back. Her hands shook and her stomach cramped. Maybe Sasha and Skye had been right.</p><p>Her father\u2019s secretary looked her over and rolled her eyes. \u201cYou have an appointment?\u201d</p><p>Rose lifted her chin. \u201cDon\u2019t need one.\u201d She went inside Harrison\u2019s office, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>Harrison glanced up from his work. \u201cI\u2019d figured you\u2019d come by sooner or later, sugar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is for you.\u201d She dug in her purse, pulled out the envelope and set it on his desk. \u201cIt\u2019s the balance of the loan.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t pick it up, merely looked at her with his cold gray eyes. \u201cYour momma\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what kind of deal the two of you cooked up. I\u2019m paying back the loan. It\u2019s done,\u201d she said with a firm nod, then turned to walk out the door.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t marry me. Though I asked her at least a dozen times through the years.\u201d</p><p>Her hand froze on the doorknob. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>He placed a hand on her shoulder and she fought the urge to shrug it away. \u201cI loved your mother, but she wasn\u2019t content with just me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou expect me to feel sorry for you?\u201d His hand fell away and she turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cI was there when you were born,\u201d he said. \u201cShe ever tell you that?\u201d</p><p>No, her mother had never cast Harrison Collins in any kind of positive light, which had made Rose wonder why Azalea had insisted on Rose seeing him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She reached for her throat. She couldn\u2019t handle any more confessions.</p><p>He took off his glasses and tucked them into the front pocket of his shirt. \u201cI\u2019d like to start over with you, Rose. I\u2019m man enough to admit I was wrong.\u201d He sat down on the edge of his desk and looked up at her, his eyes filled with pain and regret. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be right away. You let me know when. This is on your terms.\u201d</p><p>Rose grabbed the chair in front of her, her knees shaking. \u201cOnly in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell the entire world, Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. All these years you\u2019ve insisted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d Harrison\u2019s jaw worked. \u201cThat was Azalea\u2019s and it was the only way I could see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy me and you?\u201d She took a deep breath, then another. \u201cWhy not Skye and her dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get back at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Rose clutched the top of the chair harder.</p><p>\u201cMarrying Lorelei.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said she wouldn\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean she wanted me to be with someone else.\u201d He smiled sadly. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to get back at each other for years now and I\u2019m done. I\u2019m too old, too tired, and too damn sick of these games, because the only ones getting hurt are my girls.\u201d</p><p>His girls? Rose wasn\u2019t going to touch that last statement. No telling what she\u2019d find out if she did. \u201cIs that why you loaned me the money instead of giving it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have taken it?\u201d A knowing look entered his eyes. \u201cOne thing you got from me and your momma is pride, honey. There\u2019s not a damn thing wrong with wanting to do it your own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m paying it off.\u201d She glanced around the room, noticing for the first time pictures of her and her sisters tucked into the shelves. \u201cThose new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of y\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>That part of her that wanted to stay forever angry at her dad twisted tight, like a wet cloth being wrung out. She didn\u2019t know what to think. The mother who raised her, didn\u2019t want her while the father who supposedly shunned her, wanted a relationship in public. But she didn\u2019t quite trust him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you pushing Jason Everett on me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsulting him in front of hundreds of people made your point.\u201d Harrison frowned. \u201cDid he do something to you?\u201d</p><p>She had the absurd notion to tell him exactly what the asshole had done, so that he could wreak some kind of fatherly vengeance on Jason. \u201cHe\u2019s not someone I would choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Romanov is?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and moved to the door again.</p><p>\u201cTo think I believed Jason when he said the man was gay,\u201d Harrison muttered.</p><p>\u201cJason says lots of things.\u201d Rose turned the knob. \u201cI\u2019ll need a receipt to show that I\u2019ve paid off my loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you come by tomorrow? I\u2019ll take you to lunch, and give it to you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pulled open the door, then looked over her shoulder. Her father\u2019s face had fallen, but her next words transformed it. \u201cYou can drop it off at Carolina Dreams later this afternoon. I\u2019m trusting you to keep your word.\u201d Then she walked slowly out of the bank, her head held high.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Sleep hadn\u2019t come easy to Rose for the past week. Her dreams had been filled with images of the crow that had invaded her room... and Sasha, with him needing her and she couldn\u2019t shake them. For one horrible moment last night, she\u2019d reached for her cell, then stopped in the nick of time. No good would come of it anyway.</p><p>She rolled over in bed and sighed, refusing to acknowledge that a new day had dawned. Yet another one without Sasha and without Ivy.</p><p>Heavy breathing and slobbery kisses made Rose\u2019s eyes pop open. Warm brown eyes crinkled and a toothless mouth covered her nose.</p><p>\u201cIvy?\u201d</p><p>Ivy babbled and grabbed Rose\u2019s braid, jerking it around.</p><p>She caught the baby up in a hug. \u201cHow in the world did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe flew in on a magical carpet.\u201d</p><p>Rose jumped. \u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d She untangled her hair from Ivy\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere else would you be?\u201d Summer sat on the corner of the bed, eyes bloodshot while her make-up was flawless. She swung her tall black boots as she continued, ignoring Rose\u2019s question. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t quit crying. She wouldn\u2019t let me hold her, console her. I tried feeding her, but she refused to take the bottle until she was beyond hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy likes it a little hotter than lukewarm, but make sure you test it first,\u201d Rose said, then looked down at the baby in her arms, feeling guilty and happy when Ivy\u2019s eyes crinkled at her like they always did when she was happy.</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s something a mother should know, and I\u2019m not cut out to be one\u2014just like mine.\u201d</p><p>Rose leaned forward, wanting to take Summer\u2019s hand, but something in her sister\u2019s face stopped her. \u201cYes, you are. It takes time to learn what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Summer stood and moved to the fireplace. \u201cGabriel told me that if I really wanted what was best for Ivy that I should let you adopt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that?\u201d Stunned, Rose stared at her sister. Summer was going to let her adopt Ivy? She forced down the hope that dared to take flight in her body. This had to be a dream.</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d Summer crossed her arms, a frown marring her face. \u201cI think he\u2019s half in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Rose shook her head. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all the way then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer, he\u2019s not the one for me and you know it,\u201d Rose reminded her.</p><p>Her sister lifted her nose a little. \u201cZoe Ambrose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, you know they weren\u2019t meant to be. It\u2019s not your fault he didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she said it was right. She was the one who claimed they belonged together and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma got most things right,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThere are plenty of people in this town who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop defending her.\u201d Summer banged her fist on the mantle and the fire roared to life. \u201cShe left you Rose. She left you, me and Skye to fend for ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but she paid off the back taxes, and gave us Strawberry Grove.\u201d The look on Summer\u2019s face kept her from sharing the conversation Rose had had with Azalea.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her fool you. She\u2019s still the same woman.\u201d</p><p>Rose couldn\u2019t agree more. Azalea was the woman who\u2019d raised her, Summer and Skye, but in the end, Azalea had chosen a new life. One that didn\u2019t include any of them, no matter what kind of business deals they did in the future.</p><p>Ivy toppled over to one side and Rose grabbed a pillow, placing it beside the baby. Summer placed another one on the opposite side.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s her rabbit?\u201d Rose asked, trying to dispel the tension.</p><p>\u201cDiaper bag.\u201d Summer moved to the dresser, rummaged through the bag and threw the stuffed animal into her lap.</p><p>Ivy began babbling and Rose handed it to her. The stuffed animal went straight into the baby\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cGabriel said he knows a lawyer in Wilmington that can help us get through the adoption paperwork. He said the guy\u2019s decent and to leave him alone.\u201d The mattress dipped slightly under her sister\u2019s weight.</p><p>\u201cGabriel or the lawyer?\u201d</p><p>Chipped black and red fingernails drew a pattern on the pillow beside Ivy. \u201cI think it\u2019s all-encompassing. Don\u2019t get too close to the decent ones, they might dump Mary Sue Perfect and where would she be?\u201d</p><p>Sympathy for her sister flooded her body. Summer had never had it easy. She had taken on the role of the most popular Holland. Until this moment, Rose thought her sister had enjoyed it. But the bitterness infusing her tone was telling. \u201cWho wants Ms. Perfect?\u201d</p><p>Summer flashed her a little smile. \u201cYeah. I need to get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to stay here with me and Ivy.\u201d Rose meant it. There wasn\u2019t anything she wouldn\u2019t do for her sisters.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for me in Holland Springs.\u201d</p><p>Rose thought of the woman she\u2019d seen in her mind\u2019s eye while talking with Gabriel. \u201cDon\u2019t be too sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my lawyer contact you.\u201d</p><p>Enormous relief filled her, hope tangling with it and making her insides dance joyously. Ivy was going to be hers. Forever. Tears spilled over and she didn\u2019t bother to hide them. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll take such good care of her,\u201d she managed to choke out. Then a smidgen of guilt pricked her heart. \u201cYou sure about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I would\u2019ve driven Gabriel\u2019s truck back to Holland Springs if I wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stole his truck!\u201d Rose\u2019s mouth fell open, then she shut it and wiped the wetness off her cheeks.</p><p>Summer gave her a look. \u201cThe keys were in the ignition and the tank was full. He went inside to pay for the gas and took too long. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll give it back. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>There was really nothing she could do to change her sister\u2019s ways and there were many ways about Summer that she had no desire to change. Shaking her head, Rose scooped up Ivy. \u201cWant to kiss her good-bye? Not that you\u2019re not welcome to visit.\u201d</p><p>Summer leaned forward and ruffled the curls on the baby\u2019s head. \u201cSend me pictures, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ivy latched onto Rose\u2019s thumb. \u201cLove you, Summer Rain.\u201d</p><p>Her sister stood and blew her a kiss. \u201cYou, too, Rosebud.\u201d She started for the door, then paused. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Alexander\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Summer turned to face her. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have anything to do with the fire\u2014that was his uncle. Someone working for him approached me and I needed the money. I made sure everyone was safe before I did it.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s hands began to shake. Relief and hope giving way to rage and fury. The wind began to blow, shaking the walls. Thunder boomed. \u201cYou purposefully ruined my life?\u201d</p><p>Defiant to the end, Summer tipped her nose in the air. \u201cI set you free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be free,\u201d Rose shot back, then shook her head. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not a prisoner. I can leave at whenever I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t. If I couldn\u2019t dynamite your ass away from here, what chance does anyone else have?\u201d Summer gave her a side-eyed glance and frowned. \u201cHe asked you to go away with him and you said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he owed me,\u201d Rose pointed out as the wind settled down. \u201cIt was his only reason for asking me to go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOwed, loved...same thing in my book.\u201d Summer strode from the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Much to Rose\u2019s shock (and chagrin at lumping everyone together), over the coming weeks people were still stopping by Carolina Dreams, but not to buy her products (which most did anyway). Couples she helped \u201cpush\u201d together brought her homemade casseroles, baby furniture and clothes for Ivy; they brought her thank you cards and cheesecake (once word got around from Daisy). </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rose had ended up donating the Jeep to an organization that took old cars that no longer worked, after Carter Ambrose had pronounced it not fit to drive. That same day a delivery van, with the words \u2018Carolina Dreams\u2019 painted on one side had shown up in front of her store. Not even an hour later, a minivan was delivered.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure who\u2019d given her the vehicles, but she was beyond thankful and extremely pleased to be wrong about the people of Holland Springs. Although most of the time she wanted to hide in the office in the back of the store when it got really crowded and everyone started sharing stories of Rose\u2019s match-making advice.</p><p>Slowly, but surely things were changing for her. For whatever reason, Jason Everett avoided her at all costs (most likely he was afraid she\u2019d comment on his sex skills.). She found herself actually smiling at people when she walked down the street, or did a little shopping in their stores. Many acted like they were genuinely happy to see her and Ivy.</p> <p>Whether it was her attitude or a realization that not everyone in Holland Springs hated her family, she wasn\u2019t quite sure. Maybe a combination of the two.</p><p>\u201cOh no, Ms. Holland, you let these people help you out,\u201d Jemma Leigh teased when she walked in and caught her gathering items to donate to Goodwill.</p><p>Sage Caswell walked in behind her, soft gray eyes shining. \u201cWe brought lunch.\u201d She held up a large bag and shook it. \u201cAnd no Bernice.\u201d</p><p>The three of them sat on a blanket behind the counter, eating sandwiches and watching Ivy trying to crawl.</p><p>Jemma Leigh grinned at her, then tucked a chunk of blonde hair behind her ear. \u201cHow does it feel to have Ivy back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike my family\u2019s complete.\u201d Well, almost. She wished both of her sisters were with her...and sometimes, late at night, she wished Sasha was with her, too. Yesterday she had received a package in the mail. When she had opened it, she had been shocked to find a half-nude painting of Poppy Holland. The note accompanying it, however, had erased her shock and pinched her heart.</p><p>For your eyes only, it had read. She had known exactly who it was from. Although how he\u2019d found it was a mystery she wasn\u2019t quite sure she wanted to solve.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feel bad about people helping you,\u201d Sage said, thankfully misinterpreting her melancholy mood. \u201cEveryone wanted to do something.\u201d</p><p>Rose tilted her head to the side. \u201cEveryone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone who counts.\u201d Jemma Leigh clarified with a smile and Sage nodded. \u201cPeople you\u2019ve helped and then some.\u201d She finished the last of her sandwich and washed it down with a bottle of water.</p><p>\u201cNot Nahalah Industries,\u201d Jemma Leigh added, when she noticed Rose eying the bottle.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Jemma Leigh laughed and began to clean up. \u201cMomma said to tell you that anytime you need a babysitter to call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr me,\u201d Sage volunteered. She leaned over and gave Ivy her stuffed rabbit. \u201cI love babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her thank you.\u201d Rose smiled, then turned to Sage. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>Sage made a little noise. \u201cBut you won\u2019t take the offers, will you?\u201d</p><p>Rose bit her lip and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll have to for my bachelorette party,\u201d Jemma Leigh declared. \u201cBernice\u2019s not invited, because it\u2019s my only day without bitchy women.\u201d</p><p>Rose laughed and Sage cheered.</p> <p>Soon, too soon really, their lunch was over and Ivy\u2019s eyes had drifted shut. The baby\u2019s tummy was full and her shirt sleeve had the dried remnants of pureed peas on it. Cheerios from a game called \u2018watch Ivy try to fit as many as possible in her mouth at one time\u2019 littered the outer edges of her blanket. But Rose didn\u2019t mind. A mess made by Ivy meant Ivy was still here, still hers and with the way things were going, forever hers.</p><p>Her life was complete. It was exactly as it should be\u2014except for the ache in her heart.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>November faded into December. The autumn leaves fell to the ground, leaving bare limbs in their place.</p><p>Most days Rose\u2019s life was so filled with piecing everything back together and tending to Ivy that she barely had time to herself. But when she did, Sasha filled every nook and cranny of her mind. He was a constant dream, one that hadn\u2019t faded with time. Her traitorous heart still yearned for him.</p><p>She missed his energy, his humor...his kisses. The way he dressed and how he talked to Ivy like an adult.</p><p>The way he had gazed at her the first time they made love.</p><p>\u201cWant a slice to go?\u201d Daisy asked, jolting Rose out of her daydreaming.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m closing in about ten minutes but you two feel free to stay in here as long as you like,\u201d the baker offered, a friendly smile on her face. \u201cI need to finish making a menu for a wedding reception I\u2019m catering.\u201d</p><p>Rose smiled back. She had always liked Daisy and had admired her for keeping her business open through a struggling economy. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be even more wonderful when I hire someone to be my assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for you,\u201d Rose said as Daisy moved behind the counter and called out her thanks.</p><p>Rose looked at Ivy. The baby sat in a highchair, gnawing on a bagel and drooling like crazy. Just last week her first tooth had popped through, but she still hadn\u2019t said her first word. Mainly Ivy liked to coo and babble at the rabbit Sasha had bought her.</p><p>A hunk of bagel fell to the floor and Ivy leaned over to look at the mess. Grinning, she threw the rest after it and gurgled with glee.</p><p>Rose smiled. \u201cGuess you\u2019re done with that.\u201d She used a paper napkin to clean up the baby\u2019s mess.</p><p>After wishing Daisy a Merry Christmas, Rose bundled Ivy up and headed outside. She walked along Broad Street, stopping every so often to point out holiday displays to Ivy.</p><p>Turning onto Ivy Lane, she squared her shoulders and adjusted the baby on her hip, trying not to notice Sasha\u2019s fake store. It was an empty space except a \u2018for sale\u2019 sign had been in the window since the end of November. The clothes and money he raised had been split between Gabriel\u2019s organization and the women\u2019s shelter.</p><p>According to Jemma Leigh, that had been Sasha\u2019s doing and he wanted to keep things quiet. So, of course, the realtor told everyone. Jemma Leigh Jackson had never kept a secret in her life.</p><p>Rose\u2019s heart pinched as she thought of Sasha. What he was doing for Christmas? Who would he spend it with? The woman inside of her shouted that it should be Rose. That Rose should woman up, find out where Sasha was and go to him. Obviously, the woman inside of her had lost her mind.</p><p>Or had she?</p><p>She froze in her tracks. Maybe that\u2019s exactly what she should do. She could call Sasha\u2019s cousin, Christian, and ask him. Then go online, get some tickets and find a hotel. Her body trembled with excitement and she started for her store.</p><p>\u201cRose Holland?\u201d</p><p>She turned, unease racing down her spine as she found Christian Romanov standing in front of her, his famous smile nowhere to be found and his pale eyes serious.</p><p>Gasping, she clutched his hand. \u201cHas something happened to Sasha? To his momma?\u201d</p><p>Christian nodded. \u201cWe buried Phoebe a month ago.\u201d</p><p>She stood on the balls of her feet, looking over Christian\u2019s shoulder for some sign of Sasha. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander\u2019s not...himself.\u201d Christian rocked back on his heels.</p><p>\u201cTake me to him,\u201d she said without hesitation. Fate was smiling down on her today. Excitement zipped through her, making her knees wobbly. She steadied them and smiled.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d Christian clapped his hands and rubbed them together, a gesture so familiar that it made her body ache. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>A black Mercedes with sleek lines idled by the curb, its driver waiting by the back passenger side door. Rose let Christian guide her by the elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d She didn\u2019t know why she bothered to ask. Nothing matter but getting to Sasha.</p><p>Ivy waved her arms at Christian, making happy noises.</p><p>\u201cTo merry old England.\u201d He grinned and tweaked Ivy\u2019s nose.</p><p>Reality crashed over her, making her shoulders droop. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have a passport and neither does Ivy.\u201d</p><p>Christian ushered her into a waiting car, the warmth of the heater a welcome changed from the frigid winter air. \u201cIt\u2019s all been taken care of.\u201d He sat down on the seat across from her and handed her two thin, blue booklets.</p><p>\u201cBut what about tickets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaken care of.\u201d</p><p>The limo driver turned the Mercedes onto a private airfield, a white jet with the words Romanov Industries painted on the tail waiting at the edge of the runway.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d she mumbled and pressed a kiss to Ivy\u2019s head.</p><p>Not until they were halfway across the Atlantic did she start to panic. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any clothes, or a car seat...or extra bottles. I only have the stuff in my diaper bag. And who will feed Blackbeard?\u201d</p><p>Christian played on his phone, not bothering to look up. \u201cIt\u2019s been taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course it has.\u201d Dazed, she settled back in the leather seat. \u201cHow did you know I\u2019d say yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it a man\u2019s intuition,\u201d Christian said and she rolled her eyes.</p><p>With only three hours until Heathrow, Rose made herself take a nap with Ivy in one of the bedrooms on the plane. A circle of pillows corralled the baby on all sides.</p><p>The next thing she knew, the sun was shining through her window and a flight attendant was knocking on her door while saying, \u201cWe\u2019re about to land, Ms. Holland.\u201d</p><p>Ivy stirred. Rose quickly changed the baby\u2019s diaper before finding her seat. Christian still sat in his, his head lolling to one side. He mumbled something about angry birds and thieving pigs in his sleep.</p><p>The first bounce woke Christian.</p><p>The second had her clutching Ivy to her chest, until they disembarked the plane.</p><p>\u201cHappy Christmas Eve.\u201d Christian guided her to yet another waiting Mercedes. There was a car seat for Ivy. Hot chocolate steamed in the cup holder by the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is going on with Sasha?\u201d She buckled Ivy in and adjusted the straps, then passed the baby her stuffed rabbit.</p><p>Christian gave her an enigmatic look. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you taking me to him, or are we meeting him somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certainly not taking you home with me.\u201d He pulled out his cell, ran his forefinger over the keypad and put it back in his coat pocket. \u201cWon\u2019t be long now.\u201d Then he promptly fell back asleep.</p><p>Rose hid a smile behind the mug of hot chocolate.</p><p>The car wove in and out of traffic, sights flying by faster than she could catch a decent glimpse. She wanted to wake Christian up to ask him what part of London were they in, but he obviously needed his beauty sleep.</p><p>She sipped at the warm drink, the rich chocolate warming her insides, but it did nothing to bolster her nerves. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t be happy to see her, or even want her help. Her love. Maybe he\u2019d settled into his new life and didn\u2019t need anyone, least of all the woman who\u2019d rejected him. The cup trembled in her hands and she had to set it down before it slipped out of her damp palms.</p><p>Glancing at Ivy, she found the rabbit in the baby\u2019s mouth, her eyes slowly opening and closing. \u201cSleepy girl,\u201d Rose whispered.</p><p>Another left turn and the limo stopped in front of a light-colored wall made from ancient-looking stones. The gates opened and the limo drove down a pebbly path, halting beside an elaborately carved water fountain. The driver opened the door, a gust of icy air gnawing at the warmth and waking Christian.</p><p>Before she knew it, he\u2019d helped her out of the car, handed off Ivy and deposited four suitcases and a trunk with the initials LV at the bottom of a huge set of doors. Her head swam at the sight of luggage that cost more than what she made in a month.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d He rapped on the door.</p><p>Her eyes rounded. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntelligent women\u2014how would we get on without them?\u201d He winked and slid back inside the car.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d The driver tipped his hat to her and shut the door.</p><p>All she could do was stare as he drove away.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>Rose jumped and whirled around, finding a man in a starched gray suit who looked to be at least a hundred years old\u2014if that young. \u201cUh, I...I\u2019m Rose Holland and this is Ivy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPemberly, ma\u2019am. Right this way.\u201d He motioned for her to follow him inside.</p><p>Two men rushed outside to grab her suitcases, trunk and Ivy\u2019s car seat.</p><p>\u201cTake those to the Yellow Room,\u201d Pemberly ordered as they walked inside with her things.</p><p>The doors closed behind her, sealing her fate.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Sasha, I mean, Mr. Romanov?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be along shortly.\u201d</p><p>The doors banged open and Rose backed up, hiding in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cBalmy weather, my arse,\u201d Sasha grumbled as he unbuttoned his jacket.</p><p>Her heart jumped so high into her throat that she almost choked on it. If he were in such a bad way, then why did he look so good? Had Christian lied to her?</p><p>\u201cYou have visitors,\u201d Pemberly intoned.</p><p>Sasha glanced around the impressive foyer. \u201cAttention to detail is why I keep you around, Pemberly.\u201d He hadn\u2019t seen her.</p><p>But she saw him. His golden hair and bronze skin. Sexy eyes and broad shoulders. The way he wore a button-down shirt and slacks. The way he grinned when the butler managed to look even haughtier than she thought possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Switching the baby to her other hip, Rose wished for a hole to open up in the floor and swallow her. Of course he wasn\u2019t in a bad way. Not that she expected him to be walking around, wringing his hands and looking like hell. But she wasn\u2019t prepared for the bone-deep pain it caused her to view him like this. And she couldn\u2019t hide out in the corner until he left. Heck, she was surprised Ivy hadn\u2019t given them away by now.</p><p>Before Rose\u2019s courage could fail, she took a deep breath and stepped into the light. \u201cHe means us.\u201d</p><p>Ivy babbled and extended her arms, reaching for the man Rose knew without a doubt the baby loved.</p> <p>The coat fell from Sasha\u2019s hand, missing Pemberly\u2019s outstretched fingers and hit the floor. Along with his heart, his stomach and every other internal organ as pure astonishment replaced them.</p><p>He turned to face her and swallowed. \u201cRosebud...and Ivy? But I thought Summer had her.\u201d She had to be a mirage. There was no way in hell Rose would be standing in the middle of his foyer, looking achingly beautiful and holding his sweet Ivy.</p><p>He\u2019d honestly thought the baby had been lost to Rose. There had been a time, after his mother died, that he considered going to Summer and persuading her to give Ivy back. But Rose wouldn\u2019t have appreciated his interference.</p><p>\u201cSummer signed adoption papers.\u201d Blue eyes regarded him warily. \u201cIvy\u2019s my daughter now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you,\u201d he said simply. However, the aching spot she occupied in his heart reminded him of just how unhappy he\u2019d been. Until now. Joy threatened to consume him, but the woman he loved didn\u2019t look quite so smitten with him. \u201cWhen...how...why are you here?\u201d</p> <p>She glanced away. \u201cChristian flew us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian\u2019s in Fiji. Apparently they haven\u2019t outgrown the whole twin switcheroo bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was his brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, Scrooge, er, Sebastian, got a bit of the Christmas spirit in him.\u201d He narrowed his eyes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t flirt with you, did he?\u201d</p><p>Rose shook her head. \u201cNo, he slept most of the time and played a game on his phone. The plane ride was a little bouncy but nice. Ivy and I had a little nap. There was a big bed. It was soft and I drank hot chocolate in the limo.\u201d</p><p>Sasha bit back a smile at her nervous ramblings. \u201cDid you come to spend Christmas with me?\u201d</p> <p>Pemberly sailed away, Sasha\u2019s coat in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI came to help you.\u201d She still wouldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cYour cousin said you weren\u2019t doing too good since your momma died.\u201d</p><p>His heart sank a little. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason?\u201d</p><p>Ivy wiggled and squirmed until Rose knelt down and placed her on the floor. \u201cShould there be another?\u201d</p><p>Well, he had hoped for more. As soon as he\u2019d seen her, he\u2019d thought she\u2019d come to tell him she wanted to be with him. He didn\u2019t need anything else but that.</p><p>Rose kissed Ivy\u2019s head. The baby got on all fours, rocking back and forth.</p><p>Who was he kidding? He wanted everything from Rose, especially her love and trust. But those things took time. Lucky for them both, he had plenty of time. Of freedom to do whatever he wanted. Be with whomever he wanted.</p><p>The baby did some sort of army crawl, inching Sasha\u2019s way. He couldn\u2019t keep the smile off of his face. \u201cIvy\u2019s crawling!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKinda.\u201d</p><p>He knelt on the floor, torn between the fascination of watching her show off her new skills and wanting to hold her in his arms. Her mother, too. \u201cShe\u2019s gotten so big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you call a cab for me, please?\u201d Rose asked and he jerked his head up.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a ride to Heathrow. I think your cousin pulled a fast one on me.\u201d</p><p>Panicking, he mentally raced through a plethora of ideas and blurted out the first one that sounded sane. \u201cAt least stay until lunch. Let Ivy get her morning nap, and you get one too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired.\u201d</p><p>Sasha searched her face. No, she didn\u2019t look tired. She looked exhausted and slightly scared. Not that he could blame her. He was terrified that she\u2019d leave. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve, love. You\u2019ll be lucky to find a place to sit for the next twenty-four hours, much less a plane ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a hotel room.\u201d</p><p>Undeterred he said, \u201cYou can stay in one of the fifteen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-two.\u201d Pemberly brought in a tray of snacks, set it between Sasha and Rose and disappeared to only he knew where, acting like two adults kneeling in the middle of the foyer with a baby crawling around was a regular occurrence. Bless him.</p><p>\u201cWhat he said.\u201d He scooped up Ivy and kissed her forehead. She tried to bite his nose with her one tooth. \u201cIt\u2019s been awhile, but does the tooth fairy leave money for when a tooth comes in?\u201d He\u2019d missed so much, but for damn sure he wouldn\u2019t miss anything else.</p><p>Rose bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can look it up online and check,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cI meant about staying here.\u201d Rose closed her eyes and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cTea?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPemberly can charge you twice what\u2019d you pay at Claridge\u2019s, if it\u2019d make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>One of her rare smiles pushed at the corners of her lips, then to his eternal gratitude she sat down on the floor, crisscrossing her legs in front of her. \u201cHow are things?\u201d</p><p>The breath he\u2019d been holding in rushed out. \u201cI\u2019m not working for my uncle anymore. I quit, before my mum died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...good. And sad about your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt surprised Vladimir so much that he had a stroke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>An image of Childers\u2019 stark hospital rooms sprang to mind. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead.\u201d Yet.</p><p>\u201cYour house is pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at the ceiling, then the walls and back at him. \u201cEvery building on Broad Street could fit in here with room to spare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was rather Wayne Manor-like.\u201d At her questioning look, \u201cYou know, from the movie Batman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw that one.\u201d</p><p>This was not how he envisioned a reunion with Rose. Stilted questions and abbreviated answers. Sighing, he placed Ivy back on the floor, sitting up. She grabbed his thumbs and bit down on one, her sharp tooth pinching. \u201cHoly\u2014\u201d He clamped his mouth shut and gently pried his thumb out.</p><p>\u201cGive Ivy her bunny to gnaw on.\u201d Rose threw the stuffed animal at him.</p><p>He caught it easily, then gestured to the snacks and tea. \u201cHelp yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d But she didn\u2019t move from her spot on the floor.</p><p>The silence grew, heavy and awkward.</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay with your mom passing?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been preparing for it for a really long time, or I thought I had,\u201d he confessed and sat down, stretching his legs out on either side of Ivy. \u201cBut every day it gets easier. And I did have three weeks with her. No one lording anything over my head.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sympathetic smile as Ivy crawled over his leg. He grabbed the baby and set her back between them.</p><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019re partnering with Barbara\u2019s Bugs,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rose nodded and traced a pattern on the marble floor. \u201cBarbara is Azalea, my mother. She has a whole new life with kids and a husband. My sisters and I...and Ivy aren\u2019t going to be a part of it.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cDid you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The temptation to take her in his arms nearly overwhelmed him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out the way you wanted.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged lightly. \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he said softly and her eyes flew to his.</p><p>A heartbeat later she replied, \u201cI missed you, too.\u201d Her black lashes lowered, hiding her thoughts from him.</p><p>His heart pounded so loudly in his chest that Rose had to be able to hear it. He would tell her now. Confess his soul. It was what he should have done months ago. \u201cRosebud, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ivy began to fuss, throwing her rabbit on the floor.</p><p>Bloody perfect timing, he thought wryly.</p><p>Rose jumped to feet. \u201cShe needs a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d Pemberly said, moving to the stairs. \u201cWe\u2019ve set up a nursery of sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to charge Ms. Holland extra for that,\u201d Sasha said and Rose rolled her eyes.</p><p>Pemberly continued his trek.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks you\u2019re funny.\u201d Rose grabbed her bag.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s laughing on the inside, love. Where it counts.\u201d Sasha picked up Ivy. She snuggled against him, her familiar baby scent making his heart turn over. He followed the butler, Rose close behind him.</p><p>After they\u2019d gotten Ivy tucked in and Pemberly went on his way, Rose softly closed the door and stood in front of it. Not moving. Not saying anything, actually. He couldn\u2019t stop staring at her. At her lovely face, her beautiful eyes and the rise and fall of her breasts beneath her sweater.</p><p>He stepped closer. Lights flickered in the hallway and he gave her a slow smile. \u201cI had this house inspected from top to bottom before I bought it, and there\u2019s no faulty wiring.\u201d He braced his hands against the door on either side of her head.</p><p>She licked her perfect lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d Lowering his head, their mouths became dangerously close. \u201cBut I believe otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I thought you didn\u2019t believe in my hocus-pocus.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cEverything you to do me is magic.\u201d He pulled one of his hands away and traced her jaw. \u201cSpend Christmas night...with me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Rose breathed him in, luxuriating in his nearness. She knew exactly where Sasha wanted her to spend the night\u2014in his bed. \u201cJust one night\u2014that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d His hand drifted lower, dipping beneath the collar of her sweater and turning her flesh hot.</p><p>What she wanted was more. She wanted forever, but maybe he didn\u2019t. Maybe she was a fool for even coming here. \u201cBecause you still owe me?\u201d</p><p>His heated gaze followed the path of her tongue as she licked her lips again. \u201cPoor choice of words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing anyone else?\u201d</p><p>Giving her an annoyed look, he stepped away. \u201cDo you actually think I\u2019d invite you to spend the night with me if I were?\u201d</p><p>Hope blossomed in her heart. \u201cI think...I...\u201d She tried to get out the words, but they wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck and she saw a glimmer of a gold chain as it rose with his movements. He still wore the cross. She smiled and tears flooded her eyes, but he\u2019d turned and walked away.</p><p>\u201cStay as long as you like, love,\u201d he called out. \u201cI\u2019m going...somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Rose cried out and he froze. \u201cI love you, Sasha. And I want to be with you. Every minute of every day. \u201d</p><p>He turned around, his eyes narrowed and his stride purposeful. His long legs ate up the distance between them. \u201cYou can\u2019t take it back. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take it back.\u201d She grabbed his shirt and pulled him closer. \u201cI love you. Come home with me and Ivy. Be with me. Marry me.\u201d Rose didn\u2019t care if she sounded ridiculous. She had to get the words out, even if it meant she scared the crap out of him while doing it. Forget scaring him; she\u2019d never been so petrified in her life.</p><p>But Sasha didn\u2019t run away. He stayed firmly planted in front of her, his sexy green eyes full of emotions that she hoped to God were ones that mirrored hers.</p><p>He lifted a golden brow. \u201cMarry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take my last name,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>\u201cAm I to be Ivy\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like for you to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to warn you that I\u2019m the jealous sort,\u201d he said, his voice gruff. \u201cAnd I insist on staying home with the baby while you work.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help the giggle that slipped out. \u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Rosebud.\u201d</p><p>A thrill of joy ran through her entire body. \u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a million times, yes.\u201d He kissed her long and hard, until she was breathless. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need to quit asking each other so many questions.\u201d She rose on her toes and kissed him again, trailing her lips along his jaw and chin. His arms came around her, pulling her flush against him. \u201cWhere\u2019s your room?\u201d</p><p>Sasha half-drug, half-carried her to a room three doors down from Ivy\u2019s, the baby monitor clipped to her back pocket bumping against her.</p><p>He set her down on her feet and just looked at her, as if trying to memorize her face, then he claimed her mouth in a kiss so searing that her clothes should have been on fire. Her lashes fluttered and his hands were on her, pulling and tugging. Turning her one way, then another. When she finally opened her eyes, she looked down to find that neither of them had on any clothing.</p><p>He held out his hand. It visibly shook. \u201cDo you see what you do to me?\u201d He produced a condom, flashing her a grin and wiggling his brows. \u201cSleight of hand.\u201d</p><p>Her own body trembled in response as he rolled it over his erection, then his mouth was on hers. She touched him everywhere, caressing and smoothing her palms over his chest, his back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tugged on his nipple rings with her teeth, licking at them and making him groan. She stroked the hard length of him, running her nails over the heavy sacs beneath it.</p><p>He spun her around, kissing and licking his way up her back as he told her how much he\u2019d missed her and all the ways he would make it up to her.</p><p>\u201cEvery night, Rose...hell, several times a day if that\u2019s what it takes,\u201d he said between heated kisses on her neck. Then he whirled her around, his golden head bent over hers as he traced the curves of her body. \u201cPerfection, utter perfection in every way.\u201d</p> <p>She could only smile, unable to speak. Words had never come easy for her, not like Sasha. That had never been her gift. But she knew in her soul that he meant them. Every. Last. Word.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you several times a day.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a heart-stopping smile. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d Then his hands were in her hair, behind her head and gently tilting her face to his. He sealed his lips to hers, drinking her in and feeding her desire.</p><p>She dug her nails into his muscular shoulders. The cool, smooth texture of a wall behind her back startled her and she gasped. He used that moment to slide his talented tongue inside of her mouth while his hands drifted from her neck to her breasts, teasing her nipples and rolling them between his fingers.</p><p>Letting go of her breasts, he leaned forward and she heard something crash to the floor. He lifted her, placing her on the top of the low dresser, the wood cold on her thighs and butt.</p> <p>Pulling away she glanced at the floor, eyes widening at the mess he\u2019d made. Then she looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cBeen meaning to redecorate this room,\u201d he said with a grin. A dangerous hand drifted lower, skimming her stomach and cupping her where she ached. Where she throbbed. Where she grew so wet for him.</p><p>She no longer cared what he did to the floor, only to her.</p><p>He lifted her thighs, wrapping them around his lean hips. \u201cLook at me, Rosebud.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes felt so heavy, so drug-induced with love-sex-magic that she could barely open them. He penetrated her in a glide so slow and smooth that it made her want to scream and sigh at the same time. He was hot and thick where they were joined.</p><p>And he was hers. Completely. Forever.</p> <p>He thrust inside of her, over and over. His rhythm steady, unlike the frantic beating of her heart. She gripped his shoulders tighter and buried her face in his neck, licking and scraping at his throat.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said and angled his body in such a way that every roll of his hips made his groin touch her in just the right spot.</p><p>Her toes curled\u2014Oh, God, was it ever the right spot\u2014and her thighs gripped him tighter. She was so close, so...her head fell back as her body soared. She might have called out his name or God\u2019s. Probably both. His hands cupped her butt, his breath harsh in her ear and he moved faster, harder.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI love you, love you, Sasha.\u201d</p><p>He thrust a final time, deeper than ever before and held himself still as she pulsated around him. His forehead dropped to hers, his chest heaving while he breathed in great gulps of air.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t make it to the bed,\u201d he panted.</p><p>A trickle of sweat zigzagged down the valley between her breasts. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>Still joined, he walked to his bed and let her tumble away from him. A minute later, he joined her, enfolding her in his arms as they sank into a mattress that felt more like a cloud. Something cool and hard slipped over her fourth finger and she furrowed her brows. Holding her hand up in the light, a yellow diamond shone brilliantly in the light streaming from the windows.</p> <p>Now it was her turn to sound like a newspaper reporter. \u201cHow...what...when?\u201d</p><p>Giving her a wicked smile, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked, love. When one wants to marry a Holland, one must learn a few tricks to keep her on her toes. I had planned on returning to Holland Springs and wooing you properly, but my plans were thwarted.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her breath hitching in her throat. \u201cI love you, Sasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Mr. Holland,\u201d he said and she couldn\u2019t keep the tears from falling. He kissed them away. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild Strawberry Grove\u2014so long as you let me do all the decorating.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be serious. This was almost too much happiness for one day. \u201cYou\u2019ll live in Holland Springs with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live anywhere with you and Ivy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled through the last of her tears as they drifted off to sleep with one another.</p><p>They woke up to Ivy babbling over the baby monitor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her.\u201d Sasha leapt out of bed, grabbed some pajama bottoms and hopped out of the room as he put them on. He came back with Ivy a few minutes later and joined Rose in bed, placing the baby between them.</p><p>Rose sighed contentedly. \u201cMy family\u2019s complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur family\u2019s complete,\u201d he said, then he kissed her.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>The town square of Holland Springs was awash in pinks, reds, and greens. All in honor of Mother\u2019s Day and ripe strawberries. There was a Strawberry Queen, a pie-eating contest, and a strawberry-picking contest. Not wanting to ruin his vintage McQueen shirt, Sasha had opted out of the last two, and had been unable to cajole Rose into running for the first event.</p><p>He watched as his daughter toddled around Daisy\u2019s display of cheesecake slices.</p><p>\u201cGet what you like, darling,\u201d he called out.</p><p>A feminine hand clasped his and he turned his head. Rose stood by his side, beautiful blue eyes shining as she smiled. Her booth\u2019s merchandise had sold out within an hour of opening. Carolina Dreams was more popular than ever and so were Rose\u2019s famed match-making skills. She\u2019d sent seven couples in the last three months to the spring and all seven had come back engaged.</p><p>\u201cIvy, come away from there before you knock something over.\u201d</p><p>Ivy\u2019s bright yellow bow quivered in her hair as she ran to them, chubby little legs fast and sure. \u201cMummy!\u201d</p><p>Rose caught Ivy up with in hug, then set her down and smoothed out her skirt.</p><p>\u201cA one year old doesn\u2019t need cheesecake,\u201d Rose pointed out, a slight smile on her red lips</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nearly two.\u201d At Rose\u2019s frown, he quickly said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t actually going to let her have any.\u201d</p><p>Ivy\u2019s little brow furrowed as she tugged at Rose\u2019s Dior skirt, then pointed at the booth. \u201cEat cake, daddy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Rose crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>He gave Rose his most innocent look. \u201cI wanted it to be a surprise for you.\u201d He walked over to Daisy and threw out his arms, waving his hands at the display. \u201cSurprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Prise,\u201d Ivy shouted, mimicking him.</p><p>Daisy shook her head, bright orange strands slid to one side and she tucked them behind an ear. \u201cYou\u2019ve already eaten two slices. Pay up.\u201d</p><p>Rose snorted and took Ivy\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go before daddy thinks of any more surprises that get him in trouble.\u201d</p><p>It warmed his heart to see the two of them together. So close, so loving...and stylishly dressed. There was something to be said about a man who was content. Who was in love and completely infatuated with his wife. With his daughter. With his entire life.</p><p>He loved taking care of Ivy and staying abreast of the progress of the hospital being built in his mother\u2019s old village. Bringing Rose lunch was one of the highlights of his day. Having her in his bed every night was beyond compare.</p><p>Rose glanced at him over her shoulder, curly black hair tumbling down her back and her yellow diamond ring catching the sun. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Mr. Holland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right there, love.\u201d Tonight he would really surprise Rose by taking her away on a belated honeymoon. And Ivy, of course. He glanced down at his own wedding band, then grinned and strolled after them. </p> </body></html>"]
