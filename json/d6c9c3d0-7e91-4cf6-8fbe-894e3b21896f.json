Everything happened in slow motion, yet lightning fast. She twisted her body, colliding with the ground in a bone-jarring thump. Her left shin smacked into the cement step. Heat bloomed as that section of her skin ruptured. Her right leg collapsed; her knee went one direction, her ankle the other. Burning pain shot through her as the cartilage in her right shoulder popped. Screaming in agony wasn\u2019t an option\u2014the impact had knocked every bit of air from her lungs.</p><p>Can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t breathe, oh God, I\u2019m dying.</p> <p>Dots swam in front of her eyes. First black, then white, then gray, then nothing.</p><p>No sight. No sound. No feeling.</p><p>Was she dead?</p><p>Immediately her pain receptors came back online, kicked into overdrive and she gasped in lungfuls of air.</p><p>Oh shit. Oh holy mother of God every inch of her body hurt.</p> <p>Time blurred as Ginger lay at the bottom of the stairs in pain, stunned. She needed help.</p><p>Yeah, good luck with that one. You never ask for help.</p><p>This time, she had no choice.</p><p>As Ginger tried to roll to her right side, using her left hand to push herself upright, she lost her balance. The heel of her left palm skidded across the coarse pavement, grinding off her skin, clear down to the bone\u2014or so it felt as a new stinging sensation assaulted her.</p><p>Goddammit. Her vision blurred, her ears rang, her body throbbed. She wanted to curl into a ball and weep.</p><p>Think. Crying won\u2019t solve the problem. Call for help.</p> <p>Call. Right. If she could just reach her cell phone... Not an easy task, considering her right arm was useless. Despite the bloodied skin on her left palm and the pain pounding from every molecule of her body, she managed to snag the cell phone from her right jacket pocket.</p><p>Breathing hard, hurting, mortified and feeling a little loopy, Ginger used her thumb to dial 911.</p><p>\u201cNine-one-one. What\u2019s your emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me. I\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up.\u201d</p><p>Ginger managed to relay the basic information of her whereabouts without cackling hysterically about the \u201cI\u2019ve fallen\u201d line until after she\u2019d hung up. She laughed and laughed until her stomach muscles hurt.</p><p>Huh. Maybe she had hit her head harder than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>Sundance, Wyoming wasn\u2019t exactly a metropolis. The wait for the ambulance wouldn\u2019t be long. The bitterly cold wind whipped snow crystals around her. Since she couldn\u2019t move, she laid flat on her back on the icy pavement, staring at the bleak winter sky.</p><p>The tears she\u2019d been holding in finally poured out and froze to her cheeks.</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Kane \u201cBuck\u201d McKay had just pulled the plastic sheeting from his Hungry-Man Salisbury steak dinner when his cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cSonuvabitch.\u201d Fingers smarting from the steam burn, he flipped his phone open with a curt</p><p>\u201cMcKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck?\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s flash of temper mellowed and his lips formed a genuine grin. \u201cHayden. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re callin\u2019 me on a school night. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>The little boy babbled a mile a minute and Kane\u2019s smile dried.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa there. I can\u2019t understand a word you\u2019re sayin\u2019, buddy. Come on. Take a deep breath and start over.\u201d</p><p>Hayden spoke a little slower, but not much.</p><p>By the time Hayden finished, Kane had his coat and his boots on. \u201cOkay, Hayden, calm down. You\u2019re gonna get your breathing outta whack if you don\u2019t take it easy. Slow and steady. That\u2019s good.\u201d He waited, listening to the wheezing silence on the line as he shoved his wallet in his back pocket, grabbed his keys and plunked his hat on his head. \u201cYou\u2019re at home with your grandpa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Urgently whispered words sounded in the background and then, \u201cThis is Dash Paulson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDash? Kane McKay. Hayden called and said Ginger had some kind of accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why in the devil the boy called you.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s gratitude for ya.</p><p>Pause. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad he did. Evidently Ginger fell down the stairs at the office and that\u2019s all I know.</p><p>She called about an hour ago from the hospital, told us not to worry and she\u2019d keep us updated. We\u2019ve heard nothing since. It\u2019s frustrating not able to go to her and see for myself what\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>Dash Paulson was wheelchair-bound, which put him in a shitty situation because he was also housebound. \u201cHow about if I head to the hospital and see what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it,\u201d Dash said.</p><p>\u201cSit tight. Lemme talk to Hayden again.\u201d Before Hayden could ask a million questions, Kane cut him off. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to check on your mama. It might be a bit before I know anything, so in the meantime I want Raising Kane</p><p>you take your grandpa\u2019s mind off his worryin\u2019. Play chess or work on that five-thousand-piece puzzle. Stay off the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise, sport.\u201d</p><p>Kane jammed his hands in his gloves and patted his dog\u2019s head before he climbed in his truck. He tried to focus on something\u2014anything\u2014besides his mounting worry on the drive to Sundance. Not only was Ginger Paulson a single mother, she was also her father\u2019s caretaker, and she maintained a law practice.</p><p>Ginger. Just the mention of her name stirred something inside him. She\u2019d captured his interest like no other woman he\u2019d ever met. She redefined the term stacked\u2014six feet of curves, curves and more curves. A red-haired, hazel-eyed beauty whose Amazonian size was only topped by her Amazonian intellect.</p><p>Too bad Ginger was way out of his league. And since she\u2019d enrolled her son in the Little Buddies program, she was strictly off limits, which was a damn crying shame.</p><p>Out of loneliness and boredom, Kane had signed up as a volunteer for the Big Buddies/Little Buddies program, a program that paired young boys without a male influence with local male mentors. Once Kane had completed the training, he\u2019d received his first Little Buddy. Problem was, the boy\u2019s mother was looking for a husband for herself, not a mentor for her son. When Kane rebuffed her advances and requested the boy be removed from his mentoring, she\u2019d claimed to the program director that Kane had hit on her, resulting in Kane almost getting kicked out of the program in his very first month. That\u2019d chapped his ass. Big time.</p><p>No one had expected him to stick with the program. So he\u2019d worked damn hard to prove he had what it takes to be a good example to young boys. He\u2019d had hits and misses.</p><p>Then he was paired with Hayden Paulson.</p><p>It\u2019d been a rocky start. The boy was painfully shy, small for his age and freakishly smart\u2014none of those descriptions had ever been applied to Kane McKay. After the first month, Kane wondered if he and Hayden would ever find common ground. But Kane saw something special in Hayden and forged a mentorship based on friendship.</p><p>Over the course of the last two years, he\u2019d managed to coax Hayden out of his shell. Hayden was more outgoing, more confident in his own interests, plus he was eager to try new experiences. One of Kane\u2019s proudest moments came when the kid out-fished him on a camping trip. Spending time with the little boy with the big brain was the highlight of Kane\u2019s week.</p><p>The bonus? Mama hung around whenever Kane showed up on their doorstep. And sometimes he lingered, chatting her up, trying like hell to charm her, while Hayden impatiently tugged at him to get a move on.</p><p>But damn. Ginger Paulson was something else. That amazingly hot body, that amazingly expressive face, those amazingly tasty lips. The woman had turned him inside out and upside down since he\u2019d given into temptation and taken the kiss she\u2019d offered.</p><p>How much farther would it\u2019ve gone if he hadn\u2019t done the right thing for once and backed off?</p><p>All the way.</p><p>Keep thinking about the hot mama and prove your indecent thoughts by showing up at the hospital with a hard-on.</p><p>Still...Ginger intrigued Kane on several levels. After she\u2019d relocated from southern California to take over her dad\u2019s law practice, she\u2019d involved herself in the community, but she didn\u2019t date. Ever. A fact he\u2019d learned directly from her son. On occasion she whooped it up with Libby McKay and Dr. Monroe, but mostly she handled her family responsibilities and kept a low profile.</p><p>That\u2019s where he and Ginger had boatloads in common. Wild Kane McKay, part of the infamous bad boy McKays, once the terror of four Wyoming counties with his boozing, brawling and babes, was no more. He\u2019d foresworn the love \u2019em and leave \u2019em lifestyle after his cousin Colt had entered rehab. Since his twin brother Kade\u2019s marriage, a matrimony epidemic had consumed most of his hell-raisin\u2019 McKay cousins. Kane really had no one to party with anyway and surprisingly, he hadn\u2019t missed it at all.</p><p>His late nights were few and far between unless he counted the poker games he hosted for his remaining single McKay cousins. Kane didn\u2019t spend much time with Kade in their off-the-ranch hours.</p><p>Same went for his cousin Colt. Both men were married, with families. Sometimes Kane longed for the life they\u2019d led at the Boars Nest. Not the nonstop partying, or the orgies, but the camaraderie they\u2019d shared.</p><p>Everyone had grown up and moved on, it seemed.</p><p>Everyone but him.</p><p>Or so people thought.</p><p>Because he wasn\u2019t married with two-point-five kids, the consensus, even among his own family members, was he didn\u2019t want to grow up. But admitting his loneliness seemed fucking pathetic, so he hadn\u2019t done a damn thing to change those misperceptions.</p><p>The truck had warmed up by the time he\u2019d reached Sundance. January was always miserable in the cattle business and in Wyoming in general. They\u2019d positioned their calving season for early spring. Spring snowstorms were always a threat to the health of the cows and the calves, but he\u2019d take wet and muddy over bone-chilling cold any day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kane parked in the nearly empty hospital parking lot. He entered through the front doors. After shaking the snow off his hat, he stood there like a dumbass, wondering what the hell to do next.</p><p>The blowsy blonde manning the information desk looked all of seventeen. But that didn\u2019t stop her from offering him a lewd once-over and licking her shellacked lips. \u201cWell, hello, cowboy. You lost? Or is something broken and needin\u2019 some fixin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. A...friend of mine was brought in a little while ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMale or female friend?\u201d the receptionist cooed.</p><p>\u201cFemale. Her family can\u2019t get here so they sent me to get some information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t give it out, no matter how cute you are. It was a wasted trip for you Mr....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKay. Kane McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKay?\u201d Her raccoon eyes lit up. \u201cAny relation to that hot, awesome bull rider Chase McKay? Is he your son?\u201d</p> <p>Son? Jesus. Chase was only ten years younger than him. Even on his worst day Kane knew he didn\u2019t look that damn old. \u201cNo, he\u2019s my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod I love to watch him ride. He\u2019s like...so incredible. Sheer poetry on the back of a bull.\u201d The girl actually stood and craned her neck, trying to look behind him. \u201cIs Chase with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Wasn\u2019t the first time his cousin\u2019s groupies grilled him for the elusive Chase McKay\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cIs there any way you can just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>He whirled around to see Libby, his cousin Quinn\u2019s wife, hustling toward him. Unease punched him in the gut. His gaze dropped to Adam, perched on Libby\u2019s hip. The kid didn\u2019t appear sick\u2014he was his same stout-bodied, chubby-cheeked, blowing-spit-bubbles, happy-baby self. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoely\u2014Doc Monroe\u2014called me about Ginger.\u201d Adam squealed and Libby shushed him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGinger called Dash and Hayden and only gave them enough information to freak them out, so I showed up to figure out what\u2019s really goin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical Ginger behavior,\u201d Libby sniffed. \u201cShe\u2019s been moved from emergency into a private room.</p><p>Come on.\u201d</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t bother to check with the chickie behind the desk to see if he was breaking any rules by following Libby.</p><p>Halfway down the hall, Libby stopped in front of a closed door. \u201cShe\u2019s already had her shoulder reset and they\u2019re putting a walking cast on her calf to immobilize the sprain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc Monroe can explain better than I can.\u201d Libby brushed her lips across Adam\u2019s dark head when he fussed again. \u201cGinger is lucky she didn\u2019t break her damn fool neck.\u201d She pushed open the door.</p><p>Kane followed her inside. And froze.</p> <p>Ginger was sprawled on the hospital bed, damn near naked. The hospital gown left little to the imagination, exposing the deep \u201cV\u201d of her cleavage and stopping mid-thigh. Her right arm was tucked in a sling. Her left hand was heavily bandaged. He dragged his gaze up to Ginger\u2019s face. Her hair was an untamed cloud of red, spread across the white pillow behind her head. Her face was perfectly beautiful, nary a scratch, but it held the too-white shade of shock and pain.</p><p>Her eyes opened, narrowed. \u201cWhat are you doing here, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, to you too, Red,\u201d he drawled. \u201cI\u2019m here because a very scared little boy called me and asked me to check on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I talked to your dad too.\u201d He jammed his hands in his pockets and ambled across the room. \u201cThey\u2019re worried, since you didn\u2019t let them know what\u2019d happened, beyond that you fell down the stairs and ended up in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Any semblance of Ginger\u2019s bravado fled.</p><p>\u201cI can call Dash and let him know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Dr. Monroe said. \u201cIncluding the bit where I\u2019m keeping you overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t stay in the hospital. I can\u2019t leave my son and my father alone. Not even for a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccidents happen, Ginger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t happen to me. I\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>He exchanged a look with Libby. They both knew Ginger was far from fine.</p><p>Dr. Monroe got right in Ginger\u2019s face. \u201cHow much pain are you in?\u201d</p><p>Ginger swallowed and looked away.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me. Scale of one to ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d Ginger admitted softly.</p><p>Kane sucked in a breath. Knowing how hardheaded Ginger was meant her pain was a least a seven, if not an eight.</p><p>The doc piggybacked a small, clear pack of solution onto the IV and popped the needle into the tubing. \u201cNow listen up. You dislocated your shoulder. You have a severe sprain that I\u2019m still not sure isn\u2019t a ligament tear. Knowing you, I was forced to put a cast on it to keep you from injuring it further until I can ascertain just how bad it is. You have a deep laceration on your shin, which was filled with metal flakes and salt, requiring an antibiotic to stave off an infection. You sustained multiple bruises from your fall. You claimed you didn\u2019t hit your head, but I can\u2019t take a chance you did and just don\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cSo given those injuries...you have to stay in the hospital, Ginger. Just one night. If you\u2019re improved tomorrow, I\u2019ll let you go home. But tonight, I\u2019m not giving you a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoely, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019m your doctor, not your friend. I\u2019m doing what\u2019s best for my patient.\u201d Doc Monroe squeezed Ginger\u2019s left shoulder. \u201cYou need to heal and it\u2019s my job to ensure that happens. The best way to do that is to drug you up and let you sleep uninterrupted.\u201d</p><p>Kane knew Ginger and the doc were good friends, and it had to be hard as hell for the doc to do what was right, not what was easiest, not what Ginger wanted.</p><p>Ginger\u2019s teary eyes searched the doctor\u2019s face. \u201cWho will take care of Hayden and my dad while I\u2019m in here? You know I don\u2019t have anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Libby said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me bringing Adam, I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Kane interjected.</p><p>All three women looked at him as if he\u2019d caught fire.</p><p>He bristled. \u201cWhat? Hayden\u2019s camped out with me plenty of times. Takin\u2019 care of him will be a breeze. And Dash just needs me there in case Hayden needs something, right? I don\u2019t gotta bathe him or nothin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have to help him get into bed. If he rolls out of it for some reason during the night, you have to get him back in. Sometimes in the morning he needs assistance getting out of bed and into the chair...\u201d</p><p>Kane stared at Ginger. \u201cYou do all that for your dad every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sometimes twice a day. So I just don\u2019t think this is your thing, Kane. No offense.\u201d</p><p>No offense? Bullshit. Before he could snap at her, Dr. Monroe jumped in.</p><p>\u201cThis would have to be for more than one night. If I release her tomorrow she\u2019ll need someone to help her out for at least five days. Would that be a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>Five days, hanging with Hayden? Five days of playing fetch and carry for a scantily clad Ginger?</p><p>Sign. Him. Up.</p><p>\u201cNah. I can get Kade or my cousins to fill in for me for a few days. We\u2019re pretty slow right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Quinn and Ben too,\u201d Libby said.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then it\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I have a say in this?\u201d Ginger demanded.</p><p>Doc Monroe said, \u201cNope. Besides, I\u2019ll be more inclined to release you if I know you\u2019ve lined up aftercare. You do want to go home tomorrow, right?\u201d</p><p>Ginger huffed out an impatient \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The doc pointed at Kane. \u201cThen there\u2019s your answer.\u201d</p><p>Kane focused on a wide-eyed, surly-mouthed Ginger and grinned. \u201cWell, roomie, probably we should iron out the details before I head on back to your place and start fluffing your pillows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you if anything happens tonight that you can\u2019t handle with either Hayden or Dash, call 911,\u201d Dr. Monroe said to him.</p><p>\u201cNo. I know my medical limitations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll be back later to check on you, Ginger.\u201d As Dr. Monroe walked past Kane, she muttered,</p><p>\u201cThe drugs will start to take effect in a few minutes. She\u2019ll be loopy, so say what you need to while she\u2019s still coherent.\u201d</p><p>Libby leaned over and rubbed Ginger\u2019s upper arm. \u201cTake care. I\u2019ll swing by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Ginger reached for Adam\u2019s chubby leg, realizing at the last second she couldn\u2019t touch him due to her injuries. Frustration darkened her eyes as she watched Libby and Adam leave.</p><p>Finding themselves alone, they stared at each other in the sudden silence.</p><p>\u201cYou want to call your dad and Hayden and fill them in? Or do you want me to do it?\u201d</p><p>Ginger bowed her head. \u201cI can\u2019t even hold a phone, Kane. Just tell them I love them and I\u2019m...sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this.\u201d</p><p>She intended to apologize for an accident? Again, Kane forced himself not to chew her out for something that wasn\u2019t her fault. He turned his back on her and dialed. Dash answered and Kane explained the situation, sensing the older man\u2019s relief. Then Hayden came on the line. \u201cHey, buddy. Your mama is a little banged up but she\u2019s gonna be fine. Yes, I promise. I know you miss her, but she has to stay here overnight.\u201d</p><p>Ginger made a pitiful-sounding gasp and Kane spun to face her.</p><p>\u201cShe misses you too. Uh-huh. Tell you what, I\u2019ll be stayin\u2019 with you for a few days to help out. That sound all right?\u201d Kane smiled. \u201cSure we can do that. I\u2019m callin\u2019 the bottom bunk in your room, so get all them robot parts put away before I get there.\u201d He locked his gaze to Ginger\u2019s. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure your mama don\u2019t want me sleepin\u2019 in her bed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blushed and looked away.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cook something when I get there. No pizza. \u2019Cause I know you\u2019ve got a milk allergy, that\u2019s why.</p> <p>See you soon.\u201d Kane snapped the phone shut and wandered to Ginger\u2019s bedside.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m sorry if I seemed ungrateful, I\u2019m very grateful, it\u2019s just...I\u2019m not used to needing help, let alone asking anyone for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re being so sweet and thoughtful, volunteering to take care of my son, my dad and me.\u201d</p><p>Really interesting that she put herself last.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but worry that you\u2019re getting roped into something you didn\u2019t want and you\u2019re too much of a gentleman to say no.\u201d Tears seeped from the corners of her eyes.</p><p>Dammit. What was he supposed to do when she cried? Kane had little experience with women\u2019s tears, except the manipulative variety. And these were borne of pain and frustration.</p><p>He grabbed a Kleenex. \u201cCome on, sugar, you\u2019re breakin\u2019 my heart here.\u201d He gently blotted her tear-dampened face. \u201cYou in a lot of pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s like my whole body is throbbing. Not a good kind of throbbing.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cI do believe the drugs are finally kickin\u2019 in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Ginger blinked at him. It didn\u2019t help; her eyes had taken on a dreamy, unfocused look. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suspect you will ask me regardless if I say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kiss me that night?\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s heart skipped a beat. His gaze dropped to her lips. God, he still fantasized about that lush mouth. How aggressive he\u2019d been with the kiss, how eagerly she\u2019d welcomed it. How his wanting of her overrode his common sense, but he had zero regrets. Even now. Months later.</p><p>\u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes again. \u201cWhy you askin\u2019 me this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019ve never talked about it. We both pretended it never happened. Or was that kiss so easy for you to forget, McKay?\u201d</p><p>He angled close enough that her breath teased his lips. \u201cNot. Even. Fucking. Close. You have no idea how much I still...\u201d Crave you. Fantasize about you. Wish I would\u2019ve taken what we both wanted.</p><p>However, Kane said none of that. He backed off just like he had that night. \u201cNever mind. This definitely ain\u2019t the time or the place to talk about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Tell me. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kissed you because you needed to be kissed.\u201d</p><p>Her lips formed a half pout. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>Goddammit she was beautiful, even in pain, and Kane couldn\u2019t resist touching her. \u201cNo, that ain\u2019t all.</p><p>But that\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna admit to when you\u2019re drugged up and hurtin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes fluttered coquettishly. \u201cSee? Just like I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d Did you imagine I came this close to fucking you up against that wall until you screamed loud enough to wake your kid and your dad?</p><p>Unlikely.</p><p>Ginger gifted him with a dreamy smile. \u201cI think that you are a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how badly I want to challenge that statement,\u201d he murmured, moving his thumb up to caress the arch of her cheekbone and the dark circle beneath her closed eye.</p><p>\u201cBring it, cowboy. Maybe I\u2019m not as much the prim and proper mother that you see me as.\u201d</p><p>Right. Kane doubted she\u2019d be on board with some of the kinkier things that did it for him. \u201cSugar, you\u2019re babbling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll remember every word of this conversation. I have perfect recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that a bit, counselor.\u201d</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>He grabbed a spare blanket from the dresser and covered her completely. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Get some rest. I\u2019ll be back to get you tomorrow.\u201d Kane made it to the door when her raspy voice stopped him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the sleeping arrangements.\u201d</p><p>Had to be the drugs talking.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even turn around. He just kept walking.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>Ginger smiled at Hayden when he skidded to a stop in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can hug me. Just don\u2019t squeeze too hard.\u201d</p><p>He buried his face in her neck and heaved a deep sigh.</p><p>She placed her forehead on the top of his damp head, breathing him in. The scent of her little boy, baby shampoo beneath the hint of sweat and the cold tang of the outdoors. \u201cI missed you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistake.\u201d She smooched his crown before he squirmed back. He never used to try and escape her hugs, but from the day he\u2019d turned eight, he\u2019d gotten stingy with maternal affection. She looked over at Kane, lounging in the doorway.</p><p>Good thing she wasn\u2019t hooked up to a heart rate monitor.</p><p>Holy buckets the man looked commanding, even leaning nonchalantly against the doorjamb.</p><p>Commanding and an utterly striking example of masculine perfection. Scuffed black boots crossed at the ankle anchored the long line of his denim-clad legs. He wore a shaggy sheepskin coat and folded his arms over his broad chest. His ever-present black cowboy hat shadowed his face\u2014a shame really, because Kane McKay had a beautiful face. Sharp angles defined his strong jawline. The neatly trimmed dark mustache and goatee framed those perfectly kissable lips. And his eyes. Lord have mercy on her soul. She could lose her train of thought in a heartbeat, gazing into those dark blue depths.</p><p>Don\u2019t you mean you could lose your panties in a heartbeat?</p><p>The man epitomized rugged cowboy, down to the inscrutable way he looked at her, so she wasn\u2019t quite sure what he was thinking.</p><p>Which was probably why she\u2019d never made a move on him.</p><p>Well, that and it was against the rules of the Big Buddies/Little Buddies program for them to fraternize.</p><p>And man, she\u2019d thought about fraternizing with him naked a whole lot. Ever since the night last year that she\u2019d gone out and found trouble with his assorted McKay cousins\u2019 wives at the Twin Pines. Not only had she ended up drinking too much, she\u2019d found herself in the middle of a bar fight, and coming home in the backseat of a cop car, courtesy of Deputy Cam McKay. She\u2019d panicked to see Kane\u2019s truck parked in Lorelei James</p><p>her driveway, fearing something had happened to Hayden, but Kane had calmed her down immediately...</p><p>And then he revved her back up, with his sexy whispered, \u201cHow about if you let me take you to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Feeling guilty about her impure thoughts, she said, \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in school?\u201d to Hayden and then shot a questioning glance at Kane.</p><p>Kane shrugged. \u201cI wanted to swing by and tell Libby you were goin\u2019 home, so I just picked him up early.\u201d His gaze moved over her at a snail\u2019s pace and she shivered. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI signed myself out. Got my cache of drugs. Just waiting on the wheelchair.\u201d She scowled. Seemed an unnecessary rule in her opinion.</p><p>Hayden\u2019s eyes grew big. \u201cYou have to be in a wheelchair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetie. They\u2019ll wheel me out in one, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I thought maybe you and Gramps could have wheelchair races.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d beat me for sure. He\u2019s pretty speedy.\u201d</p><p>Hayden crouched over the pink plaster. \u201cBuck said you had a cast. Can I sign it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing when we get home.\u201d</p><p>The nurse wheeled in the chair and Kane left to pull his pickup around. Hayden didn\u2019t say a word as the nurse helped Ginger into the chair. At least they\u2019d removed the full bandage on her left hand so she wasn\u2019t a total invalid.</p><p>Face it. You are completely helpless for the next few days.</p><p>Once they reached the patient pickup area, Ginger debated on how she\u2019d climb into Kane\u2019s monster truck. Hayden had no such qualms; he clambered into the back seat like a monkey. Good idea. Maybe she should just go for it. She attempted to stand and Kane was right there, gently shouldering aside the nurse.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He smiled at the nurse. \u201cI got it from here.\u201d He put his mouth on Ginger\u2019s ear. Tingles ran from neck to her midsection, tightening everything in its wake. \u201cTrust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn three I\u2019m gonna lift you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p><p>His arm slipped behind the bend of her knee. He gently cradled the right side of her body to the hard strength of his. \u201cOne. Two. Three.\u201d</p><p>Then she was airborne, efficiently being stuffed in the front seat of Kane\u2019s truck. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t wind up in the hospital yourself, McKay, with my weight straining your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m used to movin\u2019 around heifers.\u201d</p><p>She would\u2019ve snapped at him if not for the twinkle in his eye and the smirk curling his lips. \u201cYou are a regular riot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can take a joke,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019d wondered. Besides, you smell way better than heifers and you didn\u2019t try to knock me on my ass. That\u2019s always a plus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always next time,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 forward to it.\u201d He fiddled with the seatbelt. \u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 we\u2019d better put this strap behind your head so it don\u2019t strain your shoulder and only use the lap belt.\u201d The intimate way Kane\u2019s fingers straightened the belt across her abdomen sent her heart galloping and a small gasp escaped.</p><p>Mr. Twinkling Blue Eyes was right in her face. \u201cShit, sorry, I thought I was bein\u2019 careful. Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. No.\u201d</p><p>He squinted at her. \u201cThen what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I just discovered my whole body goes haywire from your slightest touch. \u201cAh. Nothing. I\u2019m just anxious to get home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled. His damn smile was as sexy as his teasing eyes. \u201cOnce we get there, don\u2019t bail outta the truck on your own. I\u2019m here to help you, and that includes carryin\u2019 you into the house if I have to, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed, you might learn firsthand exactly how good I am with ropes.\u201d</p> <p>Gulp.</p><p>Kane grinned and spoke to Hayden. \u201cAll buckled in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s get your mama on home, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Hayden filled the air with chatter, which Ginger mostly tuned out due to the reappearance of a vicious headache.</p> <p>Once they\u2019d reached her house, she couldn\u2019t wait to crash in her own bed and sleep. She depressed the seatbelt locking mechanism and turned toward the door.</p><p>\u201cAh ah ah. My threats ain\u2019t idle, sugar, so stay put.\u201d</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>The man lifted her out and wrapped his arm around her waist, holding her tightly to his side.</p><p>\u201cI can manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d he argued with entirely too much cheer.</p> <p>Glaring at him didn\u2019t cause his sexy smile to slip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to learn to lean on me.\u201d They took three steps. \u201cThere you go. See? That ain\u2019t so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d But Ginger wouldn\u2019t admit the hardest part was being pressed against Kane\u2019s muscular body and feeling the need to surrender to his raw magnetism.</p><p>Definitely loopy from the drugs.</p><p>Kane stopped on the top step. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleepy. Sore. Starving. And crabby about being all three to be real honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s totally understandable. Let\u2019s get you inside.\u201d</p><p>In the kitchen, she sagged into a kitchen chair. \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo rush.\u201d</p><p>Ginger heard the soft squeak of her dad\u2019s wheels on the wood floor and looked up.</p><p>This aged version of her father caught her by surprise. During her childhood, this soft-spoken man had loomed larger than life. Tall, slender, with a shock of red hair. Now that red hair had turned white. His frame had shrunk, leaving his shoulders hunched, his arms and legs slightly shriveled. The arthritis confined him to a wheelchair, destroyed his body, but not his will, and his mind was as sharp as ever.</p><p>Ginger had always adored him. Even when her mother used lies and manipulation to keep them apart.</p><p>He\u2019d given up his position as a federal prosecutor in California and retreated to Wyoming after the demise of his marriage to Ginger\u2019s mother. Although they both regretted the years they\u2019d lost, she was grateful they\u2019d worked to build a new relationship.</p><p>She attempted a smile. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDearest daughter.\u201d His shrewd eyes took in every injury and assessed it before moving on to the next. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about what happened after you\u2019ve rested.\u201d He tapped his fingers on the arms of his chair.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s none of my business, but who\u2019s going to help you get undressed?\u201d</p><p>Ginger hadn\u2019t thought about that. She\u2019d left the hospital wearing the camisole top she\u2019d worn under her suit jacket and a borrowed pair of baggy scrubs-type pants. She\u2019d only needed one shoe, so the nurse outfitted her with a pair of shower shoes, covering both her feet with socks and surgical booties to protect her from the cold.</p><p>\u201cThat young McKay has been quite a help, but I\u2019m not comfortable with him...helping you get your clothes off, even though rumor around town is he\u2019s helped plenty of women out of their clothes. Plenty of women,\u201d he reiterated.</p><p>\u201cDad. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. But I\u2019d feel better if you had a female around to help you do those types of things.\u201d He pinned her with a paternal look. \u201cIt\u2019s what you insisted on for me, remember? The male nurse who comes every other day to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll call Libby. Or maybe Joely can swing by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He rolled toward the living room.</p><p>\u201cYour dad have that opinion of all McKays? Or just me?\u201d Kane asked tersely from the hallway.</p><p>Ginger glanced up and saw a hard glint in Kane\u2019s eyes. \u201cSince your family has been my dad\u2019s clients for thirty years, I\u2019m betting it\u2019s just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t sugarcoat it,\u201d he drawled. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, a man could take that the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>She stood too quickly and swayed, but Kane was right there to catch her. He snarled and practically carried her to her bedroom, leaving her no time to protest.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to protest. You like his take-charge nature and all that big, strong, blustering manly goodness.</p><p>Ginger didn\u2019t dissect her reaction. She sighed when her back hit the mattress. How sweet was it that Kane set an extra folded fleece blanket next to her? Knowing she was always cold?</p><p>Hayden ducked around Kane and curled up beside her. \u201cI could stay and keep you company.\u201d</p><p>Her heart swelled with love at her son\u2019s sweetness and concern.</p><p>But Kane shook his head. \u201cSorry. Maybe later. Your mama needs to rest.\u201d When Hayden\u2019s face fell, Kane amended, \u201cTell you what. I am gonna force her to eat so she can take her pain pills. You wanna make her a couple of slices of toast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He raced off.</p><p>She sank into her pillows, too tired to argue with Kane about his use of the word force, too tired to keep her eyes open. \u201cI don\u2019t need the pain meds right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will in about an hour. I\u2019d hate for the pain to wake you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d The bed shifted as Kane sat next to her. Ginger didn\u2019t open her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook, I understand your dad\u2019s concerns about me, but if you need help changin\u2019 outta these clothes, I could probably keep it...umm, clinical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably?\u201d she asked lightly.</p><p>Pause. Then soft laughter. \u201cAh, hell, who am I kiddin\u2019? If I get even the barest glimpse of your nekkidness, my thoughts would be impure enough to warrant your daddy getting out the shotgun. So scratch that goddamn temptation.\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s eyes flew open.</p><p>Kane stroked his closely trimmed mustache and stared at her breasts, spilling out the sides of the lace camisole. His avid gaze didn\u2019t return to her face for several long moments.</p><p>When Kane did look at her, the lust raging in his blue eyes caught her completely off guard. She blurted, \u201cYou\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActed as if I\u2019ve thought about takin\u2019 you to my bed and keepin\u2019 you there for a solid month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Umm. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, sugar. Have I ever. It\u2019s an impulse I\u2019ve ignored because I\u2019m supposed to provide \u2018moral character\u2019 for your son. So I feel guilty as hell when I see you and imagine all the immoral things I\u2019d like to do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat types of things?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Kane traced the length of her bare arm with the tip of his index finger. \u201cThings that\u2019ll make you stammer and blush.\u201d He smiled when goose flesh broke out across her skin from his touch. \u201cAnd shiver like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019ll be in close quarters the next few days.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cSo if you catch me starin\u2019 at you, understand you can trust me. I\u2019d never act without an invitation from you.\u201d</p><p>Ginger stayed mum for a moment. \u201cIs that why you kissed me and ran last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you. I kissed you because you needed to be kissed. Besides, you were babbling and I wanted to shut you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have to babble more often,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Hayden burst into the room and passed her a plate with two slices of peanut butter toast. \u201cHere\u2019s your favorite,\u201d he said proudly.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Wow. Look at me, a lady of leisure, with two handsome men waiting on me.\u201d</p><p>A frown creased Hayden\u2019s brow behind the bridge of his glasses.</p><p>She chewed the toast, although it was hard to swallow. She choked out, \u201cCould I get a glass of water, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Ginger jammed another chunk of toast in her mouth to prevent asking Kane what was going on between them.</p><p>Kane leaned closer. \u201cUsing food to sidestep talkin\u2019 about the issue? Really, Red? Is that a legal tactic?\u201d</p><p>She kept chewing, feigning total cluelessness.</p><p>\u201cWe will finish this discussion when you ain\u2019t stuffing your face. I\u2019m damn tired of livin\u2019 in avoidance.\u201d</p><p>Hayden skipped back in, but he was strangely subdued as he doodled on her cast.</p><p>She rooted in the plastic hospital bag for the pain meds. Kane handed her the glass of water and kept staring at her mouth after she popped the pills. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got toast in your teeth.\u201d</p><p>Great. She swished water in her mouth and curled on her side before shooing them out of her room.</p><p>The drugs didn\u2019t immediately kick in, which allowed her thoughts to spin back to the night Kane had kissed her a few short months ago.</p><p>Ginger rarely went out, so it was ironic that the two times she\u2019d let loose in the last year, Mr.</p><p>Responsible, aka Kane McKay, had been a witness to it. She\u2019d been at the Rusty Spur with Joely Monroe, celebrating their single sisterhood by knocking back a round or five of a delicious little drink called a screaming orgasm. Ginger wasn\u2019t much of a drinker, but the running joke about them having to buy their orgasms made them order a whole bunch. Usually at top volume and then they dissolved into hysterical laughter. Her pleasant buzz dimmed after their designated drivers, brothers Chet and Remy West, drove her home first and she saw Kane\u2019s pickup parked in her driveway. Again. Which just served as a reminder that she couldn\u2019t forget her responsibilities, even for one night. She always had to be available. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She raced inside, fearing the worst, since Hayden and Kane were supposed to be on an overnight camping trip\u2014the only reason she\u2019d agreed to a girls\u2019 night out in the first place. Fortunately, Hayden had only forgotten his inhaler. Once he\u2019d gotten home and used it, he hadn\u2019t wanted to leave again so Kane had waited around to talk to her. Which was sweet and thoughtful and made her feel like complete shit.</p><p>She\u2019d double-checked on her son amidst Kane\u2019s reassurances the boy was fine. In that moment Ginger was grateful that Kane was attuned to Hayden\u2019s unpredictable physical ailments and she appreciated Kane didn\u2019t think less of Hayden for them.</p><p>Ginger had slumped against the wall across from Hayden\u2019s room, feeling guilty. Feeling relieved.</p> <p>Feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>Kane moved close enough to her she felt the heat radiating from his body. \u201cGinger? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I feel like a horrible mother. Not being here when Hayden needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to worry you because he really was fine. If I thought it\u2019d been something serious, I would\u2019ve called you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re worried I\u2019ll think you\u2019re a horrible mother? Think again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cSugar, I ain\u2019t one to cast stones. There\u2019s nothin\u2019 wrong with goin\u2019 out and havin\u2019</p><p>a good time once in a while. Especially since I know you\u2019re rarely whoopin\u2019 it up at the Golden Boot.</p><p>Which is a damn cryin\u2019 shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a smart, pretty woman who I suspect is a lot of fun once you let your hair down.\u201d</p><p>In such close proximity and in dim light, Kane\u2019s eyes glowed dark indigo. Such compelling eyes fringed by ridiculously long black eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lookin\u2019 at me like you\u2019re considering cuttin\u2019 loose.\u201d</p><p>Can I cut loose with you?</p><p>Bracing his hands on either side of her head, Kane studied her curiously. \u201cDid you mean to say that out loud?\u201d</p><p>Oh crap. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so.\u201d Kane\u2019s moist lips teased her ear and followed her jawline. A delicious slow, warm shudder worked through her entire body. He brushed his mouth across hers. Once. Then he eased back slightly to gauge her reaction.</p><p>Unconsciously, Ginger licked her lips.</p> <p>A half growl rumbled from his chest and Kane captured her mouth and he kissed her.</p><p>Man, had he ever kissed her. A tongue-plundering, lip-gliding, hot, wet and conquering kiss. She figured she\u2019d have a real screaming orgasm if she kept kissing Kane McKay, so she kept her lips locked on his. Lord, his kisses alone made her dizzy with desire. Drunk on his wicked sensuality.</p><p>The kiss ebbed and flowed, relaxed and intensified, and seemed to go on forever, but not nearly long enough.</p><p>Who knows how much farther it would\u2019ve gone if Hayden hadn\u2019t called out for her.</p><p>Kane retreated immediately. Ginger began to apologize, but Kane very gently put his finger over her kiss-swollen lips. \u201cNo need. I\u2019ll let myself out.\u201d</p><p>After she\u2019d soothed her son, she half hoped Kane had changed his mind. But he\u2019d been gone and they\u2019d never spoken of the kiss again.</p><p>Kane glanced out the window at the setting sun. As much as he didn\u2019t want to leave, he had a couple of things to tend before dark. He grabbed his coat and stopped in front of Dash. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Dash waved him off. \u201cNo rush. I imagine she\u2019ll sleep for a while yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Hayden asked, looking up from the chess game.</p><p>\u201cHome to do some chores. Got to make sure Shep has food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you could bring Shep here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. But I\u2019ve stashed him in the barn where it\u2019s warm and dry.\u201d Kane missed his dog, but he knew he couldn\u2019t keep Shep in Ginger\u2019s house, despite Hayden\u2019s continuous claims he wasn\u2019t allergic to dogs, just cats.</p><p>\u201cCan I come along?\u201d</p><p>Kane looked at Dash, then back at Hayden. \u201cTell you what, if you stay here and keep an eye on your mama, I\u2019ll take you tomorrow and you can help me check cattle, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Hayden returned his focus to the chessboard.</p><p>The cold air bit into him and he wasn\u2019t surprised to see the temperature had dropped to a single digit.</p><p>He huddled in his coat and cranked the heat in his truck. Icy fingers of snow slithered across the road.</p><p>Somehow he managed to block out the conversation with Ginger because chances we\u2019re high she either wouldn\u2019t remember it, or she\u2019d ignore it.</p><p>At his place he parked under the carport. He checked the house first, finding it eerily quiet inside. He didn\u2019t bother to take off his boots as he wandered to his bedroom. He\u2019d purchased the trailer after his cousin Cam bought the Boars Nest from him and Colt. By that time Colt had already built his new house, Kade was married to Skylar and Kane was used to living alone.</p><p>As a bachelor, Kane had no desire to design room layouts or choose kitchen cabinetry and countertops or pick plumbing fixtures. He\u2019d wanted a ready-made house and this mobile home bought at an oil company auction fit him perfectly. Not too big, not too small and easily moved onto McKay land.</p><p>Kane poked his head into the extra bedroom and debated on grabbing his laptop, but knowing Hayden\u2019s tendency to monopolize his time, he doubted he\u2019d have a chance to work on updating cattle records.</p><p>He\u2019d taken a six-pack of Bud Light from the fridge when he saw his brother Kade\u2019s rig park out front.</p><p>It was about the time Kade headed home to his wife and kids in Moorcroft.</p><p>The instant he stepped outside, a purple fur-lined hood bobbed as the pink streak raced toward him.</p><p>\u201cUncle Buck!\u201d</p><p>Kane grinned at his oldest niece. The girl was a spitfire, all sweet girlie goodness one second, wild and ornery as a mustang the next.</p><p>She threw herself at him.</p><p>\u201cEliza, did you sweet-talk your daddy into lettin\u2019 you help him today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet-talk.\u201d Kade snorted. \u201cShe browbeat me. Up at the crack of nothin\u2019 waitin\u2019 by the damn door for me this mornin\u2019 and she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stubborn McKay child. Imagine that.\u201d Kane whispered, \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe\u2019n Grammy baked cookies today! With rainbow sprinkles and we bringed you some, \u2019cause Grammy said it\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t got a woman to bake sweets for you.\u201d</p><p>Kane exchanged a look with his brother. Then he smooched Eliza\u2019s forehead. \u201cI don\u2019t need a woman when I have you. Come on. You can help me feed Shep. He\u2019s probably mighty lonesome out in the barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s he in the barn? Was he bad?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m helpin\u2019 out Hayden\u2019s mama for a few days and Shep can\u2019t come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he can\u2019t sleep in Ginger\u2019s house and they don\u2019t have a barn. He\u2019ll be better off here.\u201d</p><p>Her enormous blue eyes pooled with tears. \u201cOh no. Poor Shep\u2019s all alone?\u201d</p><p>Ah hell, he\u2019d done it now. His softhearted, hardheaded niece constantly dragged home injured critters\u2014birds, frogs, turtles, feral cats. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, Eliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna see for myself,\u201d she harrumphed, exactly like her mother, and marched to the barn.</p><p>Kade sighed. \u201cThanks a lot. She ain\u2019t gonna leave here without Shep. That girl, I swear I\u2019m gonna have a zoo instead of a ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA llama, a goat, two sheep, chickens, cats, dogs and horses... Yep, as soon as Eliza Belle convinces you to buy an ostrich you can rename the place McKay\u2019s Menagerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>Kane laughed. \u201cYou love it. Although the inside of your house is as much of a zoo as the outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I swear all three girls talk at the same time, from the moment I pick them up until we tuck them in bed.\u201d</p><p>Between Eliza and fraternal twins Peyton and Shannie, Kade and Sky definitely had their hands full.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t really complainin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s also true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Eliza wants to babysit Shep for a couple of days, I\u2019d appreciate it. That way I won\u2019t worry about him.\u201d</p><p>Eliza and Shep loped out of the barn. Kane bent down and ruffled the dog\u2019s ears. \u201cWhat do you say, Shep? Wanna stay with Miz Eliza for a couple days?\u201d</p><p>Shep wagged his tail.</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><p>Kane looked at Kade. \u201cGot time for a beer before you head back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one.\u201d</p><p>Once they were inside, Eliza made herself at home. She shed her coat, the Hello Kitty snow boots Kane had bought her for Christmas, and opened the kitchen cupboard where Kane kept the dog food. She chattered away while Shep chowed down.</p><p>Kane handed his brother a beer.</p><p>Kade twisted the cap off the beer, took a long pull and looked at Kane suspiciously. \u201cSo, what\u2019s really goin\u2019 on with you and Ginger Paulson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d Kane flicked the metal beer cap into the garbage can. \u201cShe fell down her office stairs.</p><p>Ended up with her arm in a sling, her lower leg in a cast and she\u2019s got no one else to help her out, so I volunteered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because I am crazy about her. \u201cJust bein\u2019 a good neighbor.\u201d</p><p>Kade waggled the beer bottle at him. \u201cBullshit. I know you, bro. Need I remind you what happened with Brandi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. No. It ain\u2019t the same. Not at all.\u201d Brandi, the mother who\u2019d been so desperate to hook him, had shown up at his trailer late one night. She\u2019d removed her trench coat to reveal her naked body beneath it. Things had gone downhill when he\u2019d learned she\u2019d left her six-year-old son home alone so she could strip for him. He hadn\u2019t exactly been nice to her, requesting reassignment, and she\u2019d caused problems for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no interest in Ginger at all?\u201d</p><p>Lie. Lie through your damn teeth, fool.</p><p>But Kane couldn\u2019t snow his brother. \u201cThere\u2019s interest. And sparks. But I don\u2019t wanna do anything to jeopardize my relationship with Hayden.\u201d He swigged his beer. \u201cGinger is a temptation that I\u2019ve resisted.\u201d</p> <p>So far.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, you willingly put yourself in close quarters with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I ain\u2019t exactly the brightest crayon in the box, am I?\u201d</p><p>Mouth tight, jaw set, Kade stared at him.</p><p>\u201cJesus. What?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that part of it? You think she\u2019s smarter than you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink?\u201d Kane repeated. \u201cI know it. I barely graduated from high school, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I don\u2019t think she gives a shit what grade you got in world history.\u201d</p><p>Kane raised his beer bottle. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been a D-plus.\u201d</p><p>Kade laughed.</p><p>\u201cHey, I was extremely proud of the plus. Anyway, in addition to her kid, her daddy lives with her, so ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 happening. Like I said. I\u2019m just helpin\u2019 out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is Dash? You don\u2019t have to like...help him to the bathroom and stuff?\u201d</p><p>Kane shrugged, not entirely comfortable discussing the man\u2019s private issues. He\u2019d helped Dash last night, but the ornery coot hadn\u2019t been any happier for Kane\u2019s help than Ginger had been. Like father like daughter. \u201cNot so far. Do you know why Dash moved to Sundance from sunny California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid to ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir. And I know Ginger did some legal work for Sky, which means Sky told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to tell you?\u201d Kade asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. If you can\u2019t trust me, who can you trust, bro?\u201d</p><p>Kade snorted. \u201cFine. Ginger and Sky got to swappin\u2019 stories, bein\u2019s they\u2019re both from California.</p><p>Evidently Dash\u2019s divorce from Ginger\u2019s mother was nasty. The mother hired some high-falutin\u2019 divorce attorney and she demanded all their physical property as well as excessive alimony. So Dash handed over all the real estate and gave up half of his future earnings to her for a period of fourteen years, until Ginger turned eighteen.\u201d Kade swallowed a drink of beer. \u201cThen he turned around and quit his judgeship, and signed on as Dirk Whitmore\u2019s partner in Wyoming. The ex-wife was beyond pissed about the loss of income and refused to share custody of Ginger. So Dash was allowed to see Ginger for two weeks in the summertime\u2014in California. That was it.\u201d</p> <p>Kane whistled. \u201cHarsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Makes me grateful we never had to go through any of that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy. You\u2019re not s\u2019posed to swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, if you don\u2019t tell your mama you caught me swearin\u2019, I won\u2019t tell her I caught you with her lipstick.\u201d</p><p>Eliza immediately said, \u201cDeal.\u201d She yawned and crawled on her daddy\u2019s lap. \u201cI wanna go home. I miss Mama and my sissies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019. Get your winter stuff back on and me\u2019n Uncle Buck will load Shep and his food.\u201d</p><p>Seemed strange that the only ones who called him Buck were his nieces, his cousins\u2019 boys, who he considered his nephews, and the kids in the Little Buddies program. The great experiment with changing his name to something completely different from his twin brother\u2019s had lasted until the night he\u2019d picked up a brunette in a bar outside of Gillette. Her continual cries of \u201cFuck me, Buck\u201d and \u201cBuck me, Buck\u201d and</p><p>\u201cSuck me, Buck\u201d were enough to make him ditch the name altogether\u2014not that it\u2019d really caught on.</p><p>While they were outside, Kane said, \u201cCan you handle everything Monday and Tuesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Gonna be a long weekend for you, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I forget, Colt said something about you pickin\u2019 up the generators and takin\u2019 \u2019em in to Brown\u2019s Repair before we hit calving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Colt do it? It ain\u2019t like I don\u2019t have plenty of my own shit to take care of around here and I\u2019m helpin\u2019 out Brandt and the boys.\u201d</p><p>Kade frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He just told me to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Kane sneered. \u201cMore like command me. Asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. I\u2019m just the messenger.\u201d Kade\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell has been goin\u2019</p><p>on between you and Colt the last month, but I\u2019m pretty sick of bein\u2019 the go between\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sick and tired of his\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Look.\u201d Eliza stood on the seat and passed him a Ziploc bag of cookies through the sliding beer window\u2014after she\u2019d given one to Shep. \u201cYou can share with Hayden if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh, short stuff. I don\u2019t share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama says it ain\u2019t nice not to share. Isn\u2019t nice,\u201d she corrected herself.</p><p>\u201cHow many bags of cookies you got stashed in your jacket so you don\u2019t have to share them with your sisters?\u201d</p><p>She smiled coyly and blew him a kiss. \u201cBye, Uncle Buck.\u201d</p><p>Kane shook his head, charmed by his niece\u2019s sweet slyness.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Ginger woke to a spike of pain in her shoulder. Both her legs ached. Her hand smarted. Her mouth was dry.</p><p>Last night she\u2019d only stayed conscious long enough to use the bathroom, eat more toast and swallow more painkillers.</p><p>And dream. Good Lord had the dreams been spectacular. All starring one hunky, built cowboy, who\u2019d shed his gentlemanly persona right along with every stitch of his western clothes. He\u2019d bound her. Gagged her. Tied her up. Tied her down. Spread her out. Bent her over. Displayed her body solely for his pleasure.</p><p>He\u2019d demanded sexual obedience. He showed his bedroom prowess, demonstrating kinky things she\u2019d only read about. So it was disorienting to wake up alone and realize she\u2019d been hallucinating about the sexy gentleman rancher.</p><p>No wonder she started out the day cranky.</p><p>Since personal grooming had fallen by the wayside for the last two days, cleaning herself up was her first priority. She desperately needed a change of clothes. A change of scenery. Ginger felt like a prisoner in her own body, in her own room, in her own home.</p><p>Enough feeling sorry for yourself. Your father deals with this every damn day.</p><p>After three false starts, Ginger draped fresh clothes around her neck and hobbled to her master bathroom before Kane bulled his way in and took over. Much as his take-charge nature appealed to her, the last thing she needed was her good-smelling sexy helper to get a whiff of her very rank self.</p><p>Carefully unhooking the sling, she kept her right arm immobile as she slowly removed her clothes. It was mortifying to be coated in sweat by the time she\u2019d stripped to just her skin. When she got a glimpse in the mirror of the injuries to her body, she literally gasped.</p><p>She looked hideous. Bruises dotted her ribcage. A few were scattered across her upper thigh. An ugly welt protruded on her left shin below the deep gash. Luckily, her coat had protected her arms from cement burns, although her left palm had borne the brunt of her graceless skid across the frozen pavement.</p><p>The snappish voice\u2014 stop sniveling, it could\u2019ve been worse\u2014 dried the moisture forming in her eyes.</p><p>A shower wasn\u2019t a possibility due to her cast, but she had to wash her hair. Had to. Thankfully she\u2019d invested in a removable handheld showerhead and she wouldn\u2019t have to wedge her aching body between the toilet and the tub to reach the main spigot.</p><p>She filled the sink with hot water and loaded her washcloth with suds from her favorite Sky Blue soap\u2014a creamy mix of sweet lavender and mint. It was harder than she\u2019d anticipated, scrubbing herself with her left hand. By the time she finished, she felt a million times better, but she was exhausted from the effort. And she still had to wash her hair.</p><p>Ask for help.</p><p>No. She\u2019d done fine on her own, maybe slower than she preferred, but she could do this.</p><p>Ginger set extra towels on the floor to cushion the cast and her shin. She cranked on the water, placing the shampoo bottle within reach before bending over the edge of the tub. Her fingers circled the hose for the sprayer and she jerked it close.</p><p>Ready. Set. Clean.</p><p>Getting her head wet? Easy. Washing her scalp and her long hair one-handed? That sucked. Bad.</p><p>Trying to rinse out the shampoo, when she couldn\u2019t feel with her other hand if suds still matted her hair?</p><p>Beyond frustrating.</p><p>In attempting to rinse her nape, water poured into her ears. She hated that echoey, squishing sound in her head. As she adjusted the angle of the spray nozzle, soapy water trickled down her spine, following the crack of her ass to flow between her thighs. When she repositioned the rotating showerhead again, this time to rinse the front of her hairline, she nailed herself right square in the face with the water. For some reason, she screamed, flinging the sprayer aside like it\u2019d been shooting acid rain at her.</p><p>Stupid, stupid, Ginger. What is wrong with you? It\u2019s just water.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she opened her eyes to see where she\u2019d tossed the sprayer. Thick rivulets of soap slithered down her forehead and puddled in the corners of her eyes.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see, she couldn\u2019t hear, she couldn\u2019t move. The soap started to burn. \u201cShit! Shit! Shit!\u201d</p><p>The door banged open. \u201cGinger? Jesus, what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Was that Kane? She shrieked, \u201cGet out! Get out of here right now!\u201d Her eyeballs stung. Her naked body burned with utter humiliation. God. Of all the positions to be stuck in, on her knees, her fat white ass flapping in the wind.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out? Good plan.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed shut.</p><p>She blindly reached for the hose for the hand sprayer. Unable to see a damn thing, she leaned over too far, smacking her shoulder into the bottom of the tub. \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, goddammit, hold still.\u201d Kane moved in behind her, straddling her upper torso, squeezing his knees on either side of her ribcage. He reached for the hose and placed the nozzle on the back of her head. \u201cClose your eyes and tilt your head down,\u201d he said tersely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Ginger was surprised by how quickly she acquiesced, she was even more surprised by Kane\u2019s thoroughness.

I\u2019m gonna help you to your feet whether you like it or not.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her midsection.</p><p>She sucked in a breath when the muscular backs of his forearms brushed the underswell of her breasts. Her nipples constricted. Her whole body quivered.</p><p>\u201cSteady. I know you\u2019re cold. Let\u2019s get you upright first. Then we\u2019ll see about getting you dried off and warmed up.\u201d He lifted her with almost no effort. Instead of letting her go, he held her tightly against his body.</p><p>She whimpered.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurtin\u2019 you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just...mortally embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me.

Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cTough shit.\u201d</p><p>She nearly smiled through her chattering teeth.</p><p>\u201cNo more of this \u2018you don\u2019t need my help\u2019 attitude. From now on, I\u2019m gonna stick to your goddamn side like glue, understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He released her. \u201cNow brace your hand on the sink and I\u2019ll dry you off.\u201d</p><p>With brisk, but calm efficiency, Kane toweled off every section of her wet body. She had to admit that he didn\u2019t let his gaze linger on her naked body parts. Until he had to help her get dressed. He muttered something about going straight to hell.</p><p>Kane slipped the straps of her favorite lime green bra up her arms and pulled the cups to cover her breasts. After he snapped the front clasp of the separate sections together, his fingertips swept the deep \u201cV\u201d</p><p>of her cleavage, lingering on the upper curves.</p><p>Her nipples hardened at his touch, despite the echo of her father\u2019s warning about Kane\u2019s deftness with female undergarments. He\u2019s helped plenty of women out of their clothes.</p><p>He lifted a brow at her shirt choice. \u201cA button-up, long-sleeved western shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it\u2019d be easier to put on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot easier to snap with one hand. Let\u2019s start with your bum arm.\u201d Once he had the shirt snapped, he slipped the sling over her head. \u201cCareful.\u201d</p><p>Ginger fought the urge to tell him to hurry, because hello? She was naked from the waist down. The glint in Kane\u2019s eye warned that if she complained, he\u2019d take even longer dressing her.</p><p>When he dropped to his knees, she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away from his dark head so close to her pussy. If he moved his face, just a couple of inches, he could put his mouth right where she most wanted it.</p><p>Would he comment about her being a natural redhead?</p><p>But Kane didn\u2019t say a word. He didn\u2019t slowly, sensuously ease the soft cotton yoga pants up her legs.</p><p>One fast tug and the waistband hugged her hips.</p><p>Not only did Ginger feel ashamed of her less-than-perfect body, she was embarrassed by her conflicting emotions\u2014on one hand wanting Kane to notice her, on the other hand wanting to cringe away from his scrutiny.</p><p>Kane stood and hung up the towels.</p><p>How much of a freak did it make her that she felt more vulnerable dressed than she had stark naked?</p><p>Keeping her head bowed, she whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Then Kane was right there, tipping her face up to meet his gaze. \u201cHey now, what\u2019s with the waterworks? I just got you dried off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m such a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>He studied her. \u201cWhy do you have such a hard time askin\u2019 for help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never needed it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you need it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for pointing that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be pointing it out over and over until it\u2019s through that thick skull of yours, so suck it up.</p><p>Get used to takin\u2019 my help, Ginger, because I\u2019m just as goddamn stubborn as you are. And I ain\u2019t gonna wait for you to ask me for it.\u201d</p><p>Hayden knocked and rushed in without waiting for the obligatory \u201ccome in\u201d, oblivious to the fact she and Kane had been within kissing distance.</p><p>\u201cMom? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Hayden squinted at her hair. \u201cExcept you look like a mad porcupine.\u201d</p><p>Her hair snarled like a Brillo pad if she forgot to put conditioner in, which she had. Combing it without the benefit of conditioner? Near impossible, especially since she\u2019d be forced to use her left hand.</p><p>The thought of hobbling around her house with her hair looking like an electrocuted porcupine made her want to cry.</p><p>\u201cHayden, buddy, why don\u2019t you give your mama a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows. Go on.\u201d</p><p>If Ginger couldn\u2019t even look at herself in the mirror she couldn\u2019t imagine what Kane saw when he looked at her.</p><p>Silence, thick as steam, floated around them.</p><p>Kane curled his hands around her face. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a mad porcupine. Maybe just a rabid squirrel.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and sobbed simultaneously.</p><p>His too-kind eyes searched hers. \u201cFind me a brush and I\u2019ll comb out your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>His hands fell to his sides. \u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d he said with an edge to his voice.</p><p>Way to insult the man when he\u2019s gone above and beyond. Ginger backtracked. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what? Because it doesn\u2019t take a damn doctorate to untangle hair, Ginger.\u201d</p><p>What did that have to do with anything? Kane wasn\u2019t feeling intimidated by her...was he?</p><p>That was beyond ridiculous. The man was...a super hero\u2014according to her son. And from what she\u2019d seen so far? She\u2019d have to agree.</p><p>\u201cRed?\u201d he prompted brusquely.</p><p>Keep it light. \u201cI was just wondering if it\u2019d be presumptuous to ask you for a pedicure too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d He flashed her that knee-weakening grin.</p><p>In her bedroom, she perched on the edge of her bed. Kane followed a beat later, wielding a brush and a comb. He closed the door behind him and propped a knee on the mattress. \u201cIf I pull too hard, let me know.\u201d</p><p>Ginger let her eyes drift shut, allowing herself to enjoy the feel of Kane\u2019s hands on her head, straightening and smoothing the coarse strands, one section at a time.</p><p>\u201cI see them wheels turnin\u2019, counselor. You\u2019re wondering how many heads of women\u2019s hair I\u2019ve combed before yours, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Was she that transparent? \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo women, but I have untangled wild child Eliza\u2019s hair a time or two.\u201d</p><p>Grateful for the subject change, she asked, \u201cDo you spend much time with Kade and Skylar\u2019s girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I can. Eliza more than the twins, since she\u2019s older.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cLast year? She was complaining to her parents about them goin\u2019 away for \u2018alone\u2019 time and demanded alone time too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSent her to my house for the weekend. We ate junk food and watched girlie movies and played High Ho! Cherry-O and Go Fish. However, I drew the line at playin\u2019 Barbies or painting her nails,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cSo your pedicure chances are slim to none.\u201d</p><p>Ginger laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnd while I was workin\u2019 on the tractor? Little sneak ran off to play with Shep in the shelterbelt. She came back an hour later with her hair in knots. I figured Kade and Sky would throw a fit if I chopped off Little Miss\u2019s long locks, which woulda been a damn sight easier than combin\u2019 through it. Took me two solid hours to untangle that rat\u2019s nest.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fool her. Warm amusement for his niece\u2019s antics lurked beneath the words. It appeared the man was great with all kids, not just hers.</p><p>\u201cSo yesterday when I went to check on Shep, Kade and Miz Eliza showed up. She got teary eyed that my dog was \u2018all alone\u2019 and convinced her daddy to take him home for the weekend.\u201d He sighed. \u201cPoor Shep will probably have pink ribbons attached to his collar when I pick him up.\u201d</p><p>Ginger had forgotten Kane had a dog. And he hadn\u2019t asked to bring him along, knowing Hayden\u2019s allergies. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to make other arrangements for Shep, Kane.\u201d</p><p>The brush stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like hearin\u2019 the sexy way you say my name.\u201d</p><p>A blush spread across her cheeks. Her heart pounded. \u201cOh. Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize since I volunteered to be here and Shep would\u2019ve been fine sleepin\u2019 in the barn.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched. Not uncomfortable. The gentle, yet thorough way his hands stroked her hair was as relaxing as it was arousing. Unconsciously, Ginger rubbed her thighs together. How amazing would those stroking motions feel all over? Her breasts? Her belly? Her pussy? A sound of pure pleasure escaped before she could stop it.</p><p>\u201cYou like this,\u201d he murmured in her ear.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Then he didn\u2019t say another word, but he seemed to take even more care, even more time.</p><p>The soft sound of the bristles gliding through her hair slowed.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I like seein\u2019 this red mass down around your pretty face, I\u2019m gonna pull it into a ponytail.\u201d Once her hair was slicked back, he said, \u201cYou wanna check my handiwork to see if it\u2019s up to your standards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t trust me. \u2019Cause I\u2019ve been havin\u2019 all sorts of naughty thoughts about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthfully? Since always.\u201d His silky voice drifted across her ear. \u201cBut it\u2019s gotten much more intense in the last hour since I busted in on you in the bathroom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A dizzy, disconnected feeling buzzed through her system and she found it difficult to breathe. \u201cAnd yet you were a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p><p>His deep-throated laugh vibrated through her body.</p><p>\u201cOh, maybe I looked like that on the outside. But on the inside? I would\u2019ve liked nothin\u2019 better than to lock that damn bathroom door behind me and put my hands and my mouth all over your perfectly lush curves. All over. Every inch. Over and over. Until I knew that body as well as my own.\u201d</p> <p>Ginger looked sideways at the bulge in the crotch of his jeans and then met his dark gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re attracted to me after the very unsexy way I mooned you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? Lord woman. With you bent over like that?\u201d He rubbed his fingers across his goatee, staring at her hungrily from beneath lowered lashes. \u201c\u2019Bout the sexiest damn thing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>Took every ounce of restraint for me not to drop my jeans and just drive into you. No sweet-talkin\u2019, no foreplay. Just down-and-dirty, hard-and-fast sex.\u201d</p><p>A wave of lust swamped her.</p><p>\u201cBut I ain\u2019t the type to take advantage.\u201d</p> <p>Talk about a cold dash of reality. \u201cMeaning what? Since I\u2019m a captive audience, my attractiveness has markedly increased for you solely because we\u2019re in such close proximity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna explain that in English, counselor?\u201d</p><p>She huffed out a breath. \u201cFine. You find me appealing because I\u2019m the only woman who\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Kane bent down so they were nose to nose. \u201cNot. Even. Fucking. Close.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Hayden raced in.</p><p>She and Kane broke apart, but not as fast as she imagined they would.</p> <p>Without preamble Hayden blurted, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Look.\u201d She flattened her palm over her scalp. \u201cNo more porcupine.\u201d She brought him down beside her on the bed and brushed the hair from his brow. \u201cNow I\u2019m ready to get out of this bedroom for a while. I\u2019m starved. What did you guys eat last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpaghetti. And we had chicken noodle soup today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds yummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you up,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He moved in front of her and growled, \u201cThat was not a request, Red. Give me your damn hand.\u201d</p><p>Using Kane for support instead of the wall did have advantages. Muscles, muscles and more muscles.</p> <p>Plus, he smelled good. She let him maneuver her to the kitchen.</p><p>Her dad watched their progress, silently, but his shrewd gaze flicked back and forth between her and Kane.</p><p>No reason to feel guilty. She was an adult woman. It was her house. And besides, nothing had happened between them except hot looks and teasing banter.</p><p>\u201cGlad to see you up and about, daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to be up and about.\u201d She glanced at the kitchen, expecting a disaster area, but it was clean except for the pot on the stove.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some soup?\u201d Kane asked her.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She\u2019d never seen the domestic side of the rancher, and she watched him shamelessly as he ladled soup into the bowl. He set it in front of her and she looked up at him with astonishment. \u201cHomemade chicken noodle soup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. My mama\u2019s recipe. She made sure both Kade and I knew our way around the kitchen before she kicked us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too good to be true,\u201d Ginger muttered. She dipped the spoon into the broth and slurped.</p><p>Delicious. She ate like she\u2019d never seen food. Kane refilled her bowl without asking or without commenting on her ravenous appetite.</p><p>\u201cSo can I watch Transformers tonight?\u201d Hayden asked.</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d probably watched it last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Last night we played games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all played chess?\u201d</p><p>Hayden sighed. \u201cMom. Three people can\u2019t play chess. Besides Buck doesn\u2019t like chess.\u201d</p><p>Ginger sent Kane an inquiring look.</p><p>Kane shrugged. \u201cIntellectual games ain\u2019t really my thing. I\u2019d rather play cards. Plus, chess is something you play with your gramps. When I was your age, I played checkers with my grandpa. It was our thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your brother? Didn\u2019t he feel left out?\u201d Hayden asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. Gramps played cribbage with him. And trust me, we were awful protective of \u2018our\u2019 game with grandpa. I\u2019d never horn in where I didn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>Again, Ginger was bowled over by Kane\u2019s sweet side.</p><p>Are you? Are you really? Haven\u2019t you watched him with your son and marveled at his patience and thoughtfulness? Haven\u2019t you seen him treat you the same way?</p><p>\u201cGinger?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at Kane. \u201cSorry. Were you speaking to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wonderin\u2019 if you want more soup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta head to my place and check a couple things. I told Hayden he could come along...if that\u2019s all right with you?\u201d</p><p>Ginger appreciated Kane didn\u2019t presume anything with her son. \u201cFine with me. I\u2019ll hang out and keep Dad company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter, Ginger,\u201d her father said crossly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t, Dash, but she does,\u201d Kane answered. \u201cI don\u2019t trust Red not to get into trouble while we\u2019re gone, so keep an eye on her to see if she needs any help, \u2019cause God knows the stubborn woman won\u2019t ask for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Her father sent her a sly look. \u201cRedheads are always trouble.\u201d</p><p>After Hayden and Kane left, Ginger nestled into the couch and snagged the remote. \u201cAnything good on TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a documentary on Catherine the Great on The History Channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, Dad, but that\u2019d put me to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He shook his finger at her. \u201cNo offense, but you are supposed to be resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of resting. I\u2019m restless. It\u2019s driving me nuts.\u201d</p><p>He pulled himself out of his wheelchair to sit on the opposite end of the couch. \u201cDr. Monroe called me and gave me the official medical breakdown of your injuries, but that doesn\u2019t tell me how it happened.\u201d</p><p>Ginger explained and wasn\u2019t surprised by her father\u2019s drawn-out sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only do I love and adore you, Gigi, I count on you. So does Hayden. I couldn\u2019t handle it if something happened to you.\u201d</p><p>Gigi. He only used his pet name when he was really upset. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll call West Construction and have them check the downspouts to see why we have an icy spot on the steps. Be just our luck if someone sued us.\u201d</p><p>He harrumphed. \u201cDid you make any progress on the Jensen case?\u201d</p><p>Now they were back to the status quo. \u201cNot really. I can\u2019t find a precedent. I know I\u2019m overlooking something simple.\u201d</p><p>He offered a few suggestions she hadn\u2019t considered. And for the millionth time, she was grateful there wasn\u2019t a blessed thing wrong with his mind.</p><p>Shoptalk faded. Ginger stretched out on the couch, allowing her dad to settle her foot and cast on his lap. He confiscated the remote and picked the most boring TV show ever. She dozed off.</p><p>Insistent taps on her shoulder awakened her. She blinked sleepily at her impatient son as she swung her feet to the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re back. Did you have fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Buck let me bring some of his cookies. Want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Kane sauntered closer. With his feline grace and King of the Jungle swagger, when he walked into a room he owned it. Why did Ginger have the urge to offer him her neck in submission? Or show him her tail?</p><p>Kane smiled, as if he could read her thoughts, and flashed his teeth before he sat next to her on the couch.</p><p>\u201cNormally I don\u2019t share my sweets, especially when they\u2019re from my niece.\u201d</p><p>Ginger bit into the cookie and the rich, buttery taste burst into her mouth. \u201cEliza made these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a little help from Grandma.\u201d</p><p>Hayden inserted himself between them and looked at Kane. \u201cDid you have grandmas to bake cookies with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. So I guess you and I are in the same boat, sport. Havin\u2019 to beg cookies from whoever we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to rain on your cookie parade, but how many have you had? I don\u2019t want Kane to have to deal with you getting sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had four...maybe five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more today, okay?\u201d</p><p>Hayden sighed. But he didn\u2019t complain. The poor kid had been dealing with food allergy issues his whole life.</p><p>\u201cYour mama\u2019s right. I don\u2019t need to eat any more cookies either. I\u2019ll just put them away for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s comment mollified her son. \u201cSo guess what else? Buck\u2019s going to teach me how to play poker and Texas Hold \u2019Em. Cool, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. I assume there won\u2019t be betting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Hayden said with exasperation.</p><p>\u201cNo ma\u2019am. No betting,\u201d Kane said. \u201cThis is strictly for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen count me out,\u201d Dash said.</p><p>Three sets of eyes zoomed to the family patriarch.</p><p>\u201cAfter I teach Hayden, I\u2019d be up for a game or two with real stakes,\u201d Kane offered.</p><p>\u201cPoker or blackjack?\u201d Dash asked.</p><p>\u201cHow about a little of both? With a side of Texas Hold \u2019Em just to make it interesting?\u201d</p><p>Dash smirked. \u201cI\u2019ll get my wallet.\u201d</p><p>After Dash disappeared into his bedroom, Kane lowered his voice. \u201cLevel with me. Is your grandpa any good at cards?\u201d</p><p>Hayden shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s always talking about playing cribbage for a quarter a point at the senior center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time. You should see the jars of quarters in his room.\u201d</p><p>Kane groaned. \u201cI do believe I\u2019ve been had.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ginger grinned.</p><p>For the next hour, they convened around the kitchen table. Kane was extremely patient in teaching Hayden the basics. He didn\u2019t criticize his choices nor did he offer him false praise. He explained.</p><p>The most entertaining aspect was watching her father and Kane measuring each other, gauging their opponent\u2019s skill level, trying to figure out each other\u2019s tells.</p> <p>Ginger called a halt to the card competition so they could eat supper.</p><p>Again Kane wouldn\u2019t let her do anything. He made her sit as he heated up the soup. Between the four of them they finished the pot. Hayden flopped on the living room rug with his Lego set. He could amuse himself for hours. Ginger counted herself lucky her son was such an easygoing kid.</p><p>They\u2019d conned Ginger into playing banker for the McKay versus Paulson card tournament. Both Kane and her father bought in with twenty-five bucks worth of poker chips.</p><p>Despite the throbbing in her shoulder, Ginger gritted her teeth, determined not to take a pain pill. She propped her cast on an extra chair and sipped a glass of water.</p><p>Watching Kane deal kept her focus on his hands. Long fingers, thick in width, but surprisingly nimble with big, rough-skinned knuckles. Little spots of black hair dotted the backs, above his wrists. She imagined those masculine hands caressing her body. The deftness of his fingers moving inside her. The coarseness of his calluses dancing across her skin. The sheer size of his palms on her breasts or spanning her hips.</p> <p>\u201cGinger?\u201d</p><p>Startled out of her mental skin flick starring one high-handed cowboy, Ginger looked over at her father. \u201cSorry. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a beer?\u201d</p><p>Her dad was drinking beer? Didn\u2019t he prefer wine? \u201cProbably better not mix alcohol with my medication.\u201d</p><p>Kane passed Dash the deck of cards. \u201cYour deal. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackjack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFigures.\u201d</p><p>The rheumatoid arthritis had done a serious number on her father\u2019s body; the most obvious place was his hands. Some days he had difficulty eating, or holding a pen, or poking buttons on the remote. She didn\u2019t baby him and offer to help him\u2014unless he specifically asked. Respecting his privacy meant she had to watch him wrestle with simple tasks such as brushing his teeth and cleaning the lenses on his glasses.</p><p>Seeing his gnarled fingers struggling to shuffle the deck of cards caused an ache inside her. But he hid his frustration well.</p><p>Her father\u2019s slowness didn\u2019t bother Kane in the slightest. He sipped his beer, toyed with his chips. Not once did he offer to shuffle and deal for Dash. Not once did he urge the man to hurry up. Not once did he sigh or stare.</p><p>Kane\u2019s consideration brought a lump to Ginger\u2019s throat. This man was so much...more than she\u2019d ever imagined. Sexy. Thoughtful. Sweet.</p><p>\u201cRead \u2019em and weep, boy,\u201d her father taunted.</p><p>\u201cYee-haw, here\u2019s a chance to win some money back from the card sharp. I\u2019ll double down and split,\u201d</p><p>Kane said.</p> <p>Dash had an ace showing. He flipped over a Queen of Hearts on one of Kane\u2019s cards.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s good. Hit this one.\u201d</p><p>He turned over a nine of clubs on the other.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Her father turned over his hidden card. A Six of Spades. \u201cSeventeen. Dealer stays on seventeen. Let\u2019s see them.\u201d</p><p>Kane had split a pair of tens, winding up winning with both twenty and nineteen. He grinned and scooped the chips to his side of the table.</p><p>The give and take of the game went on for another hour. Ginger almost felt invisible, listening to her dad and Kane talk about their gambling experiences. The highs and lows. The Vegas trips. The rhythm of the male voices soothed her and she drifted off.</p><p>She jerked awake with a gasp and found herself the center of three different scowls. \u201cWhat? I was just resting my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019ve been out for a good ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom. You were snoring.\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>Kane stood. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to call it a night, Red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be restin\u2019, remember? And somehow I don\u2019t think fallin\u2019 asleep at the table is what Doc Monroe had in mind.\u201d</p><p>Hayden hopped off his grandpa\u2019s lap, slipped his arms around her neck. \u201cNight, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d She whispered, \u201cNo goodnight kiss?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stay up too late and no drinking beer.\u201d</p><p>His nose wrinkled. \u201cI don\u2019t like beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo whiskey either.\u201d</p><p>He smiled that sweet little boy grin that turned her insides as gooey as a marshmallow. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She swung her cast around and stood.</p><p>Kane lifted a challenging brow. \u201cI\u2019ll help you and make sure you don\u2019t fall on your face before you get to bed.\u201d</p><p>The automatic response to deny his help was strong, but she let it go. \u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay a couple of practice hands for me and keep an eye on your grandpa so he ain\u2019t stackin\u2019 the deck against me.\u201d</p><p>Dash rolled his eyes.</p><p>Ginger kissed his cheek. \u201cNight, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s body heat nearly scorched her back as he escorted Ginger to her room. The bed she\u2019d cursed hours earlier looked like an oasis. \u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are. C\u2019mere.\u201d Kane gently wrapped her in his arms. \u201cIt ain\u2019t so bad, havin\u2019 my help, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He whispered, \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s not all bad.\u201d She sighed and relaxed into him.</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t seem to mind holding her. \u201cSince I\u2019m the only one who didn\u2019t get a goodnight kiss, I\u2019ll take a rain check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could come and get it later.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lifted. \u201cYou invitin\u2019 me into your room, counselor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so surprising?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve ever heard or the worst.\u201d</p><p>Ooh. Rejection. \u201cForget it. Kissing me goodnight is not part of your caretaking duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t go and get all pissy on me. We both know there\u2019d be more between us than just one kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t fuckin\u2019 believe.\u201d He sighed. \u201cLook. I\u2019ve kept my hands off you because of Hayden. That\u2019s it. You and me bein\u2019 together, especially now, would confuse him. He\u2019s a great kid. I won\u2019t hurt him, Ginger. Not for anything in the world.\u201d</p><p>Right then, her heart stumbled. She knew she should\u2019ve probably left it at that.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Ginger wanted to explore this sexual sizzle, a one-two punch of lust she\u2019d never experienced with any other man. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt him either, but I\u2019m more than just a mother. Didn\u2019t you tell me you required an invitation? Well, here it is. And...\u201d Dammit. She sounded needy. Horny. Stupid. She turned her head away.</p><p>Kane placed a finger under her chin, forcing her to look at him. \u201cAnd...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you like crazy, Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthfully? Since always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find me appealin\u2019 because I\u2019m the only man around here that you ain\u2019t related to?\u201d</p><p>Smartass man, tossing her words back at her. She drilled him in the chest with her index finger. \u201cNot.</p><p>Even. Fucking. Close.\u201d</p><p>Kane blinked at her, slowly, sexily, gifting her with the captivating grin that transformed his face from merely handsome to devastatingly gorgeous. \u201cI\u2019m likin\u2019 this sneaky, wild streak, Red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying it out; it\u2019s brand new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll accept your invite. But you oughta know I have a condition if you wanna fuck around with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>Kane loomed over her. His eyes darkened. His entire posture changed. \u201cI\u2019m in charge of what goes on between us behind closed bedroom doors. Period. Leave the lawyer out of it because there ain\u2019t gonna be any negotiating for a more even split of who\u2019s in control. You need to be fully aware of what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>The bad-boy smile he gave her rivaled the devil\u2019s. \u201cIn bed? About as far from gentlemanly as you can imagine. Think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>Hell yes, she was on board with handing over all sexual responsibility to him. But the lawyer in her had to poke him. \u201cNo humiliation and pain games. Because if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to decline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood pain is subjective as well as erotic. But when I\u2019ve got you nekkid and at my mercy, the last thing I\u2019m gonna be thinkin\u2019 about is humiliation. I\u2019ll be too focused on seein\u2019 how many times I can make you come.\u201d</p><p>A man with his purported sexual experience could afford to brag about his inventiveness. She swayed a little.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fallin\u2019 asleep on your feet. Let\u2019s get you in bed.\u201d</p><p>Once she was settled, Kane brushed his warm lips from her temple to her ear. \u201cKeep your door unlocked tonight. Try to get some rest.\u201d He shut off the lamp and left her in the darkness.</p><p>How was she supposed to sleep now?</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Kane felt like a horny teen as he snuck down the hallway toward Ginger\u2019s room. He almost turned around and climbed back into the bottom bunk.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>He slipped inside her bedroom, pressing his back against the door as he shut and locked it behind him.</p><p>Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Would you look at that?</p><p>Ginger had fallen asleep on her back with her left arm gracefully curved above her head. The arc of her hip mimicked the angle of her arm, creating the impression of a 1940s pinup queen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jesus. He wanted her. Yet, he knew having her just once would be like a fucking gateway drug. He\u2019d become addicted. He\u2019d want more from her than sex. He\u2019d want everything.</p><p>As he debated on the best way to wake her, her eyelids lifted and she peered at him drowsily. Her shy smile proved to be his undoing. He took the kiss he craved, bringing his mouth down on hers hard.</p><p>Right away her lips parted, her tongue eagerly sought his and the kiss caught fire.</p> <p>Kane groaned, lost in the rush, lost in the give and take of the kiss. Pulse-pounding passion tinged with sweetness. No roving hands. No body parts grinding together. Only their mouths touched. Wet lips.</p><p>Swirling tongues. Nips of teeth. Gliding, sliding, falling headfirst into the kiss, well past the point of no return, he never wanted to stop kissing her. Somehow, Kane eased back from the pleasure of her mouth.</p><p>Ginger stared at him, wide-eyed, tracing her kiss-swollen lips with the tips of her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wondered if I\u2019d embellished that kiss from a few months back, but I hadn\u2019t. You sure know how to make my head spin, Kane McKay.\u201d She reached up, letting her fingertips trail over the lower half of his face. \u201cI love the way your mustache and goatee feel when you\u2019re kissing me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cImagine how it\u2019ll feel other places.\u201d He threw back the covers. \u201cIf I unhook your sling are you gonna be able to keep your bum arm still?\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head. \u201cDepends. What do you plan on doing to me?\u201d</p><p>Kane grinned. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got a couple of real good ideas, Red, but sharin\u2019 them at this point would spoil the surprise. I\u2019d rather demonstrate than explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no guarantees I can hold still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the sling stays on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Ginger gave him a head-to-toe perusal. \u201cYou wear flannel pants and a wife beater as pajamas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNormally I don\u2019t wear pajamas at all.\u201d</p><p>Her hazel eyes enlarged when he climbed onto the bed, straddling her pelvis, with a knee on either side of her hips. He whipped off his tank top.</p><p>She sighed gustily. \u201cYou should never ever wear a shirt. In fact, it should be illegal for you to cover that magnificent chest.\u201d</p><p>Kane reveled in the way her hungry gaze roamed over every ounce of his exposed flesh. \u201cThat so, counselor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir. Do you work out to maintain this fantastic physique?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf feedin\u2019 cattle and doin\u2019 stuff around the ranch is considered workin\u2019 out, then yes. Sometimes I meet up with Colt at the community center and we lift weights.\u201d Not recently, since his cousin had been a serious dick lately.</p><p>You really wanna think about Colt when you\u2019re finally in Ginger\u2019s bed?</p><p>No.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot wait to put my hands all over you, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes. My turn first.\u201d Kane rested on his haunches and reached for the snaps on her shirt. \u201cKeep your eyes on mine as I undress you.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to argue, then thought better of it.</p><p>Tempting, to yank the sides of her shirt apart and be done with it. Especially since he\u2019d forced himself not to gawk at her beautifully tempting body parts earlier. Now faced with the luxury of memorizing every abundant inch, he wasn\u2019t about to rush.</p><p>He popped the first pearl-snap button. Then the next. Then the next until a long strip of her luminescent skin, from her neck to her belly, peeked out from beneath the lapels. Carefully, Kane peeled back the left half of her shirt, tucking the right side beneath her sling. He traced the delicate line of her clavicle to the hollow of her throat. With every teasing stroke, the pulse along the side of her neck jumped.</p><p>Not as calm and cool as she appeared.</p><p>Kane let the backs of his fingers drift, paying particular attention to the patterns of freckles. He murmured, \u201cI love the way these spread across your skin. Looks like mud spatters on alabaster.\u201d</p><p>Her body went rigid.</p><p>Kane met her gaze, surprised to see a hint of anger. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spout poetry about my stupid freckles. They don\u2019t resemble \u2018cinnamon sprinkled on cream\u2019 or</p><p>\u2018nature\u2019s polka dots on a flesh canvas\u2019. They\u2019re ugly. They\u2019re weird. They\u2019re blotchy. There\u2019s too damn many of them. They\u2019ve been the bane of my existence since the day I realized the more time I spend in the sun, the more freckles show up. And that really sucks when you live in sunny California.\u201d</p><p>He closed the distance until they were nose to nose. \u201cIf I wanna spout poetry about your beauty marks, then I\u2019ll damn well do it. So suck it up.\u201d He bent his head and his tongue zigzagged random patterns across the brown dots, switching it up to nuzzle her neck, nibble her earlobes, nip the strong line of her jaw.</p><p>He teased, tormenting until she moaned his name.</p><p>\u201cSomething you need?\u201d he asked, trilling his lips down the pointed tip of her chin.</p><p>\u201cYou. More of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could get used to hearin\u2019 that sexy squeak when I taste you right here.\u201d He opened his mouth along the side of her neck and sucked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I have other noises, you know, when you lavish attention with that talented mouth...elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch impatience. You hintin\u2019 about some place in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do a freckle check by my nipples,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Kane chuckled against her skin, then sucked another spot in the middle of her breastbone.</p><p>\u201cHey, no hickeys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. I wanna leave my mark on you. So when you\u2019re alone in your bed? And you look down?</p><p>You\u2019ll see it and remember me puttin\u2019 my mouth all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m ever going to forget this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d He kissed a path down the center of her body, right through her deep cleavage. When he reached the front clasp on her bra, he took it between his teeth and bit down, expecting it to snap open.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Damn. It\u2019d been a few years since he\u2019d tried this trick of removing a woman\u2019s bra with just his mouth.</p><p>He tried it again.</p><p>The plastic didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d lost his touch.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s a good thing.</p><p>Kane glanced at Ginger to see that luscious mouth forming a smirk.</p><p>\u201cProblems, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems I\u2019m a bit rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, I\u2019m not exactly sorry to hear that,\u201d she demurred.</p><p>\u201cTime to get serious about this clothes removal business.\u201d</p><p>He rose on his knees and cracked his knuckles.</p><p>Ginger laughed.</p><p>The husky sound of her amusement zinged straight to his crotch.</p><p>One deft twist of his fingers and the bra cups separated, revealing the pearly flesh, but the green lace edge kept her nipples hidden. He curled his right hand over her rib cage and traced the heavy underswell of her breast, leisurely sliding the fabric aside with his thumb.</p><p>Her chest rose and fell with anticipation. Her teeth dug into her lower lip.</p><p>The second that pale peach tip became visible, Kane\u2019s mouth was on it.</p><p>Ginger arched up hard and moaned.</p><p>He suckled and teased. Using his mouth, his lips, dragging his goatee across the taut peak.</p><p>\u201cI...oh. I like that.\u201d</p><p>He could spend a solid day learning how she liked to be touched on her tits. What made her squirm.</p><p>What made her come.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus, I feel like I\u2019m going to...\u201d</p><p>He kept sucking until the restless rubbing of her thighs beneath him increased. He switched sides, devoting the same ruthless attention to this nipple, while his fingers manipulated the one still warm and wet from his mouth.</p><p>Breathy moans built, urging him on. Her pelvis shot up and she gasped, \u201cOh. My. God.\u201d</p><p>Kane swore he felt the pulse of her orgasm in his mouth as he vigorously sucked her to the peak of her climax.</p><p>At some point Ginger had latched onto his head, digging her fingernails into his scalp. That bite of pain was a serious fucking turn on.</p><p>Her body quivered beneath him and she sighed the contentment of a satisfied woman.</p><p>He intended to hear that sound many more times; he was nowhere near done with her. Not tonight.</p><p>Not ever. If he had to use sex to win her over, then he\u2019d goddamn well do it.</p><p>Kane released her nipple. His mouth wandered down her body. Kissing her sternum. The defined line of her upper belly, pausing at the indent of her navel. Upon reaching the waistband of her yoga pants, he gazed at her across the length of her torso. \u201cLift up.\u201d</p><p>Ginger canted her hips.</p><p>He tugged her pants off. Before he focused his attention on that sweet slice of heaven between her thighs, he repositioned her cast. \u201cLie back.\u201d</p><p>Beautiful. Bright red curls covered her mound. Kane was just so damn eager he skipped the buildup.</p><p>No teasing touches. No teasing remarks on the sexy freckles scattered across her curvy, muscular thighs.</p><p>Keeping his grip on the inside of her legs, Kane pressed a kiss to the top of her pubic bone. Then he dragged his tongue through the cleft to the source of that deliciously spicy scent.</p><p>Warm. Sticky. Sweet.</p><p>Kane closed his eyes and devoured her pussy. He lapped at the cream gathered at the opening to her body, alternating long sensual strokes with short jabs. Wiggling his tongue deep, retreating to wrap his lips around her clit. But Kane only sucked that nub one time and returned his oral worship to the mouth of her sex. Licking her. Exploring every hidden fold of her soft, wet cunt. Swallowing her honey like ambrosia.</p><p>Her whimpers increased. Her legs shook.</p><p>And still he didn\u2019t relent or change his pace.</p><p>\u201cKane. Please. I\u2019m about to crawl out of my skin. My shoulder is throbbing and I didn\u2019t take pain meds because I wanted to be fully conscious for when you came to me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a convincin\u2019 argument, counselor. I\u2019ll let you play the injury card this time.\u201d He blew across her engorged pussy and she whimpered. \u201cBut next time? Fair warning. I ain\u2019t gonna stop kissin\u2019 my fill of your sweet spot until I\u2019ve had enough. Not even if you beg.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lifted up, so their eyes met over the plane of her body. \u201cWatch me.\u201d He lowered his head, rubbing his cheeks, his jawline and his lips into those tight red curls, coating his facial hair with her juices. \u201cI love the way you smell almost as much as I love the way you taste.\u201d He slid his thumbs up through the wetness and pulled back the supple skin hiding that pleasure pearl.</p><p>Her belly rippled with anticipation.</p><p>Kane nimbly flicked his tongue across the nub, not too hard, or too fast, just a consistent pressure.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>When her pelvis arched, his lips enclosed her clit and he sucked, matching the rhythm of her pounding pulse.</p><p>Sexy whimpers surrounded him as she came, hard, fast, wet, and then she was done.</p><p>After gifting her pussy with one last soft-lipped kiss, Kane pushed up, placing his hands by her head.</p><p>Ginger\u2019s generous mouth curved into a lopsided smile. She reached her arm above her head, stretching like a contented feline. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the throbbing shoulder?\u201d</p><p>Another satisfied sigh escaped. \u201cCompletely forgot all about it.\u201d</p><p>Kane pressed his mouth to hers, sharing her taste. He wanted to kick off his pants. Feel the tight clasp of her cunt around his cock as he sank into her over and over. But Ginger wasn\u2019t up for sex, especially not the raw, urgent fucking he had in mind. After several easy, lingering smooches, he forced himself to retreat.</p><p>\u201cYou need a more comfortable shirt to sleep in.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him with complete confusion. \u201cBut. You haven\u2019t... We could... I want to, I mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I love hearin\u2019 how flustered my kisses make you, Red, the truth is, you\u2019re injured. I probably already took advantage of you.\u201d He grabbed her pants and motioned for her to raise her hips.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, but she let him shimmy the yoga pants up her legs. \u201cYour mouth sucking on my tits until I came and then that same hot mouth sucking on my pussy until I came? I fail to see how that\u2019s you taking advantage of me, when you didn\u2019t come at all.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Kane hadn\u2019t expected such coarse, common words from the woman with the gigantic vocabulary.</p><p>\u201cShocking, isn\u2019t it? How I prefer dirty-talking to sweet-talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see how hard you are. I could give you a hand job? Shoot. I\u2019m probably not very good with my left hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cHow about if I whisper dirty nothings in your ear while you jack off?\u201d</p><p>His dick actually jumped at that sexy visual. \u201cAnother time. What shirt you wanna wear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a black tank top on the hamper.\u201d</p><p>He snagged it and sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cUp you go.\u201d He unhooked the sling. The shirt came off first, then the bra. Before he covered her with the tank top, he drew a circle around each of her nipples, watching as they puckered into stiff points. He couldn\u2019t resist granting each one an openmouthed kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou are a tit guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never gotten off just from a man sucking on my tits. I\u2019ve been close a couple of times, but they\u2019ve always stopped too soon. Too eager to get to the good stuff, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese babies are the good stuff.\u201d Kane cupped the globes in his hands and rubbed his goatee across the tips. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for these beauties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d Ginger prompted.</p><p>Kane locked his gaze go hers. \u201cLike watchin\u2019 them bounce as you\u2019re ridin\u2019 me. Holdin\u2019 onto them as you fuck me reverse cowgirl. Slidin\u2019 my dick in here until I\u2019m ready to explode\u2014\u201d he dragged his index finger through the center of her cleavage, \u201c\u2014and then comin\u2019 all over your chest, seein\u2019 how those freckles look covered in my seed.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cShockin\u2019, ain\u2019t it?\u201d he teased. \u201cHow I prefer down and dirty sex to sweet, sweet love making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot shocking at all, Kane. Just hot as hell. I can\u2019t wait to prove to you that I like it as down and dirty as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways full of surprises, counselor. But tonight, you\u2019re done in.\u201d</p><p>Ginger ran her fingers up the length of his fully erect cock and circled her hand around it. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>Kane placed his hand over hers, squeezed once and removed her hand from his dick. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSneak into the bathroom and whack off. Probably twice.\u201d</p><p>She smiled cheekily.</p><p>And Kane did just that. Thinking of Ginger the entire time.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Ginger managed to brush her teeth, wash her face and change into a fresh pair of yoga pants all by herself. It took forever, but she had to do it. If for no other reason than to prove to Kane that she was on the mend and she was up for anything tonight.</p><p>She\u2019d shuffled to the kitchen to start a pot of coffee when she heard Kane come up behind her.</p><p>\u201cJust what do you think you\u2019re doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>His raspy morning voice sent tingles zipping across her nerve receptors. She turned her head and his mouth was right there. Sweet, minty breath drifted from between his parted lips.</p><p>\u201cAh hell, Red, how am I supposed to resist kissin\u2019 you when you look as fresh and pretty as a damn daisy?\u201d He pressed his lips to hers, bestowing the type of gentle, warm kiss lovers shared after a passion-filled night.</p><p>She\u2019d barely caught her balance from his sweetness when he scrambled her brain cells with a no-hold-barred-I-want-you-now zealous kiss of intent.</p><p>\u201cWhy you tremblin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about last night.\u201d</p><p>Kane pushed a piece of her hair behind her ear. \u201cNo regrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that I didn\u2019t get a chance to touch you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always tonight, if you\u2019re feelin\u2019 up to it.\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s eyes searched his. \u201cYou aren\u2019t bothered by the fact that all I did was lay there and wasn\u2019t an active participant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d He nipped her mouth with firm-lipped sugar bites. \u201cAlthough, I am hard as a fuckin\u2019 brick thinkin\u2019 about your mouth on my cock. That\u2019s the image I jacked off to last night. You, on your knees, lookin\u2019 up at me, your soft hair teasin\u2019 my thighs as my dick is buried in your hot mouth.\u201d</p><p>Heat moistened her pussy. \u201cWhat are you doing right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot draggin\u2019 you to your bedroom, as much as I\u2019d like to.\u201d He backed off to mutter, \u201cMaybe we better talk about something else. Park that sexy ass on the chair and I\u2019ll make us some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy much?\u201d Ginger shuffled to the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re dying to show me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>This man could get her all kinds of fired up just with molten looks and sexy words.</p><p>Kane rested his backside against the counter as the coffee brewed. \u201cSo what do you guys do on Sundays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends. Sometimes Hayden has a friend over. Sometimes you two do Little Buddies stuff.</p><p>Sometimes we spend a couple of hours playing Xbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true you only let Hayden play the Xbox once a week?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cProbably sounds crazy. But it\u2019d be easy as a single parent to let him fill up the hours with TV or video games while I\u2019m working. I don\u2019t want to socially stunt him by keeping him away from video games entirely, but there are better things he can do with his time. So far he hasn\u2019t fought me on the one day a week rule.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cDo you follow that same rule, counselor? Or are you addicted to the Internet and your cell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spend plenty of time on the phone and the computer during working hours. It\u2019s a respite when I\u2019m done for the day. I have a BlackBerry, but I don\u2019t know how to do half the shit on it. Sometimes I take pictures. What about you? You texting like crazy and always checking your email?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly. I have a BlackBerry, but we don\u2019t get cell reception everywhere on the ranch, so it\u2019s dead more\u2019n half the time. I do text. I\u2019m online once a day, usually to check stock prices, do a little research. I use my laptop for updating the databases about our herd. The dams and sires, calf live birth weights, milk weight gain ratios, that sort of stuff.\u201d</p><p>Living in an ag community, she was aware that ranchers, especially the younger generation, used computer technology for everything. \u201cDo Kade and your father do that much computer work too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade could do it if he wants to. I always send him backup files of my work in case something happens to me or to the computer, but Kade has way more on his plate after workin\u2019 hours than I do. It makes sense the responsibility falls to me.\u201d</p><p>Ginger didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Kane brought her a cup of coffee and sat across from her. \u201cI see the wheels a\u2019turnin\u2019, counselor.\u201d He blew across his cup. \u201cYou shocked I\u2019m mildly technologically savvy?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze hooked his. \u201cNot at all. It just makes me wonder how many more responsibilities fall to you because you don\u2019t have a wife and three kids waiting on you after you drop off the last bale of hay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worried I\u2019m doin\u2019 more than my fair share?\u201d he asked, his tone slightly amused.</p><p>\u201cI guess I am. I\u2019m not sure how the McKay Ranches Inc. or McKay Cattle Company works. Your family ranching businesses are the only clients Dad has kept on since his retirement and he\u2019s slowly easing me into it. But it does seem unfair if you\u2019re bearing a bigger workload.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I forget you\u2019re a lawyer, and you look at things differently than normal folks.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him coolly. \u201cSo I\u2019m abnormal? Was that an insult, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. You iced over my coffee with that cold glare, sugar.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. The division of duties ain\u2019t the same on the ranch as it is in a traditional nine-to-five workplace. We do what needs done. Sometimes there\u2019s a helluva lot that needs done. During calving season. During haying and branding. Like when Skylar was pregnant with the twins? I sure as hell wasn\u2019t gonna make Kade stick around and check the herd in the middle of the night. Especially when he lives a lot farther away than Dad or me. Besides, he wouldn\u2019t have been worth a shit anyway, worryin\u2019 about his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalving is a busy time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExhausting. I don\u2019t get more\u2019n a couple hours sleep for at least three weeks. In the last few years, Kade handled the daytime chores. Dad switches back and forth between helpin\u2019 both of us. If Dad gets too tired, then Ma pitches in. I\u2019m usually out at the bunkhouse with my cousins during that time, since we\u2019ve staggered the calving season. So, see? It all works out.\u201d He got up and grabbed the coffee pot, refilled both their cups. \u201cFor instance, Kade is takin\u2019 care of things while I\u2019m here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember to thank him,\u201d Ginger murmured. \u201cAnd you. Thank you, Kane. I know you probably had more important things to do than babysit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because I want to be. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little more convinced now than I was when you first showed up at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>At his smoky gaze, and his gravelly \u201cIs that so?\u201d heat curled in her belly.</p> <p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re restin\u2019 today, do you mind if I take Hayden into town for the high school basketball game? We don\u2019t have to stay for all four quarters, but he\u2019s been lookin\u2019 forward to it. Thought we could pick up something for supper and bring it home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. It\u2019ll be good for him to get out.\u201d</p><p>Kane was quiet as he fiddled with his coffee mug.</p><p>\u201cI see the wheels a\u2019turnin\u2019, cowboy. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis might sound weird, but would Dash want to come to the game? There\u2019s this scrimmage thing at halftime, and Hayden\u2019s been practicing his sprint drills. We\u2019d intended to ask you as a surprise, but bein\u2019s you\u2019re laid up... I think it\u2019s important that Hayden has family there.\u201d</p><p>Kane continually shocked her with his attention to detail and the genuine affection he held for her son.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs perfectly capable of making up his own mind,\u201d Dash supplied as he rolled up to the table.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGinger. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Admitting she felt fantastic might encourage him to ask why she felt so fantastic. She couldn\u2019t admit two orgasms courtesy of Kane McKay were just what she needed. She shrugged. \u201cOkay. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little stir crazy, if you want to know the truth. Since tomorrow is a holiday, the bus won\u2019t be picking me up to take me to the senior\u2019s center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot there was no school tomorrow,\u201d Ginger said.</p><p>Dash addressed Kane. \u201cWere you serious about letting me tag along today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it. I wouldn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to cheer on my grandson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Is the mechanical handicapped platform in the van easy to run?\u201d Kane brought Dash a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cFar as I know. Ginger doesn\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d</p><p>Interesting that Kane hadn\u2019t asked her if the equipment was hard to handle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to get an earlier start. But don\u2019t let on you know about Hayden\u2019s surprise,\u201d Kane warned.</p><p>\u201cI was an attorney for fifty years, boy. I know how to keep a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a damn fine poker face too,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Dash gave him a sly grin. \u201cA necessity, being a judge and living in a small community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I want a chance to earn back my twenty-five bucks.\u201d</p><p>Ginger looked at Kane. \u201cYou lost to my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. That\u2019ll teach me to go all in.\u201d Kane drained his coffee. \u201cWhat do you guys want for breakfast?</p><p>Eggs? Toast? Cereal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCereal is fine with me,\u201d Dash said.</p><p>Ginger rolled her eyes. Another thing her father and her son had in common: love of sugar-laden cereals. \u201cI\u2019ll have eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. I\u2019ve gotta wake up my egg cracker.\u201d Kane strode off.</p><p>She felt her father staring at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t place it. You seem different today. More relaxed or something.\u201d</p><p>Ginger slipped on her poker face. \u201cI must be on the mend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept all right?\u201d</p><p>Why was he pushing her on this? Normally he couldn\u2019t give a rip about her sleep patterns.</p><p>Shit. He knew. Her dad knew that Kane had snuck into her room last night.</p><p>Stay calm.</p><p>For fuck\u2019s sake. She was a thirty-seven-year-old woman. This was her house. If she wanted to invite a man into her bed, it was none of her dad\u2019s business. She\u2019d buck up, and just...</p><p>Lie her ass off.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That pain pill really knocked me out.\u201d</p><p>Her dad harrumphed.</p><p>Hayden trudged into the kitchen. His sleep-tousled blond hair stuck up every direction and his glasses were on crooked. He snuggled into her, wrapping his arms around her neck. Wouldn\u2019t be too much longer before he wouldn\u2019t want morning snuggles and hugs. She kissed the top of his head. \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden, it might be better if you didn\u2019t squish your mama, and sat next to her instead of on her.\u201d</p><p>Hayden shook his head and burrowed deeper into her neck.</p><p>Kane frowned but didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Her son used to be clingy, but not so much in the past two years, so she was perplexed by his suddenly shy behavior.</p><p>Kane set out two bowls, spoons, a carton of soymilk and a box of Frosted Cheerios.</p><p>Her father helped himself to breakfast. The only sounds were the hum of the heater and the crunching cereal.</p><p>\u201cI hear there\u2019s a basketball game today. Grandpa is going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to come to the basketball game, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. And I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ll be stuck here while you\u2019re having a good time with Grandpa and Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Buck,\u201d Hayden said snottily.</p><p>\u201cActually, my name is Kane. Buck was a nickname I tried out for a while, hopin\u2019 it\u2019d distinguish me from my twin brother and my McKay cousins, whose names, for some reason, all seem to start with the letter C or K.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you,\u201d Hayden retorted.</p><p>Shocked, Ginger leaned back and looked at her son sternly. \u201cHayden Michael Paulson. What is wrong with you? That was just plain rude. Apologize to Kane right now.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Surly, stubborn silence.</p><p>Ginger waited about another fifteen seconds. Then she instructed, \u201cBack to your room. You can come out only when you\u2019re ready to be civilized and apologize to Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. Go on.\u201d</p><p>He climbed off her lap and ran to his room, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>She closed her eyes. Kids and drama went hand in hand. Chances were high Hayden\u2019s snit would only last a few minutes. But she\u2019d learned early on if she let him exhibit bratty behavior, he\u2019d use it whenever possible to get his way.</p><p>\u201cGinger?\u201d Kane said.</p><p>Please. Don\u2019t offer me parenting advice right now. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like a reheat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d filled her cup and cleared her father\u2019s bowl.</p><p>Sure enough, less than five minutes later, the bedroom door opened and Hayden appeared. He started to climb onto her lap, but she shook her head and pointed to Kane.</p><p>Hayden stood behind his grandfather\u2019s wheelchair, his fingers curled around the handgrips. \u201cUmm.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry for being rude to you, Buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the apology, sport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Takes courage to admit you were wrong.\u201d</p><p>Hayden slid into the chair next to her. \u201cWhat am I supposed to call you? I\u2019ve always called you Buck, but everyone else calls you Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy nieces Eliza, Peyton, Shannie and Liesl call me Buck. So do Kyler, Gib, Thane, Anton, Parker, Braxton, Spencer, Westin... Shoot, I know I\u2019m forgetting a couple that can talk now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou consider all your McKay cousins\u2019 offspring your nieces and nephews?\u201d Ginger asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty much. Me\u2019n Kade were with them all the time growin\u2019 up. And we\u2019re ranching together, so the kids think of me the same as their other McKay uncles.\u201d He winked. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta admit to havin\u2019 a real soft spot for Kade\u2019s girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton and Ky are cool,\u201d Hayden offered. \u201cThey\u2019re always talking about all their cousins.\u201d He dumped cereal in his bowl and poured soymilk over it.</p><p>\u201cSeems my cousins\u2019 wives are in a race to see who can have the most kids in the shortest amount of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s winning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby and Channing were, but with Cam and Domini adopting Liesl and the twins a few months back...they\u2019re tied. Four and four.\u201d</p><p>Ginger looked at Kane. \u201cLots of twins in the McKay family tree.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMostly fraternal. Kade and I are the only identical twins in our McKay generation, but it seems genetics\u2014and adoption\u2014is makin\u2019 up for it in this next generation.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s phone buzzed and he plucked it out of his front shirt pocket. \u201cMornin\u2019 Ma.\u201d Pause. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Another pause. \u201cBecause it ain\u2019t a story Ginger wants spread all over town.\u201d He held the phone away from his ear as his mother railed on him.</p><p>Ginger detected humor in his tone, not anger as he said, \u201cSorry. No, I am sincerely sorry, Ma. Yes ma\u2019am.\u201d Then he hung up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave Hayden a conspiratorial wink. \u201cSee? My mama still makes me apologize too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgot to tell her I\u2019m helpin\u2019 out over here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hayden tucked into his cereal, hiding behind the box.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do we have to leave for the basketball game?\u201d Dash asked Kane.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready. I have a few things to finish up in my room.\u201d Dash left the table and his door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re done with breakfast, you need to hop in the shower, Hayden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, Mom. I\u2019m probably just gonna get sweaty at the game. I\u2019ll shower when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you make me shower every day? It\u2019s a waste of water,\u201d Hayden grumbled. He shoved the cereal box aside and challenged Kane. \u201cDo you shower once a day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>A triumphant expression crossed Hayden\u2019s face. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>Kane mock-whispered, \u201cSometimes I shower twice a day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo fair.\u201d Hayden picked up his bowl and drank the last of the soymilk as he walked to the sink.</p><p>Before he made it to his room, Ginger yelled, \u201cA shower means getting your hair wet and scrubbing it with shampoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw man\u201d echoed back to her and she and Kane smiled at each other.</p><p>\u201cYou busted him on a technicality, Mom, nice goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you determined to do your part to save the environment when you were a boy by not showering? Because this is a foreign concept to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce Kade and I had a contest to see who could go the longest.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWe tied at three weeks until Ma couldn\u2019t stand the smell of us and hosed us both down in the front yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew an iron-fisted disciplinarian lurked beneath Kimi\u2019s sweeter-than-honey demeanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe puts the \u2018mean\u2019 in demeanor. She\u2019s small, but she\u2019s mighty.\u201d</p> <p>Then playful Kane vanished and he stared at her with the inscrutable gaze that caused her nerve endings to twitch.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>He practically growled, \u201cHow badly I want to throw you over my shoulder and drag you to bed.\u201d</p><p>The rush of lust unfurled her flirty side. \u201cWhat would you do with me, once you had me where you wanted me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you. After I fucked you on the bed, I\u2019d fuck you against the wall. Then I\u2019d bend you over the chair and fuck you from behind as we\u2019re watching ourselves in your mirror. Then I\u2019d fuck you in the shower.\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s heart galloped. For a man of few words, he used them well. She could almost feel the soft mattress against her spine and his muscular body covering hers from chest to feet. She could almost feel the hot, hard thickness of his cock filling her as he braced his hands by her head. He\u2019d look into her eyes, alternating his sexy penetrating stare with bone-melting kisses. Wordlessly urging her to new sexual heights as he rammed his flesh into hers, until they both exploded with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cAh sugar, you\u2019re playin\u2019 with fire, eyeballin\u2019 me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a long goddamn day,\u201d he muttered and exited the kitchen.</p><p>Kane\u2019s mother, being the snoopy sort, showed up just as they were getting ready to leave. \u201cMa.</p><p>What\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>Kimi McKay had to stand on tiptoe to kiss her son\u2019s cheek. \u201cJust being neighborly. I brought over a casserole and a few of the cookies Eliza and I made.\u201d</p><p>Hayden peeked in the bag. \u201cCool. Sprinkles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like sprinkles?\u201d Kimi asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cMaybe sometime your mama will let you come over and bake cookies with me. Been years since I had a little boy in my kitchen helpin\u2019 me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be fun. Me\u2019n Buck had a cooking class with Domini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard. What did you learn?\u201d</p><p>Hayden scowled. \u201cThat I can still taste broccoli even if it\u2019s hidden in food.\u201d</p><p>Kimi laughed. \u201cNo broccoli in the casserole, I promise. Now you guys better get goin\u2019. I\u2019ll stick around. Keep Ginger company. You know, in case she needs something.\u201d</p><p>Kane froze. Dammit. How could he force his mother to leave without it seeming like he was trying to get rid of her?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. Kimi West McKay knew that. She\u2019d counted on Kane being polite in mixed company because that\u2019s how she\u2019d raised him.</p><p>A well-played move by the blonde tornado.</p><p>His mother lovingly patted his arm\u2014and then heaved him out the door. \u201cHave fun, boys!\u201d</p><p>Dash wore a funny smirk as he rolled down the wheelchair ramp. \u201cI see Kimi still rules the roost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Always has. I suspect she always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><p>He bristled. \u201cWhat makes sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you aren\u2019t put off by strong women.\u201d</p><p>That comment came completely out of left field. And it made him bristle even more. Like Dash thought that he didn\u2019t have the smarts to know when to stand up for himself?</p><p>Hayden said, \u201cI know what we need to do first.\u201d</p><p>Kane was grateful for a chance to focus on something besides what Ginger\u2019s dad thought of him\u2014which apparently wasn\u2019t much.</p><p>After the van door opened and the mechanical platform was on the ground, Dash could roll himself onto it. Then Kane just hit a switch to load man and chair inside the van. Impressive, how slick the whole set up worked. Must\u2019ve cost a pretty penny, but it was worth it since it kept Dash from being totally housebound.</p><p>At the community center, they unloaded in the handicapped zone. Kane hadn\u2019t realized how tight the fit was between parking places for a mechanized wheelchair platform. Despite Dash\u2019s insistence he could maneuver himself into the gymnasium, Kane wheeled Dash inside, Hayden loping alongside them. When people called out to Dash, Kane wondered if Dash\u2019s insistence about handling himself was a smokescreen: maybe Dash was embarrassed to be seen with him.</p><p>\u201cHey, look! There\u2019s the signup sheet for the halftime race,\u201d Hayden said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you on the list.\u201d Kane spoke to Dash. \u201cYou wanna wait here until we\u2019re done so we can find seats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to stay in the handicapped section on the main floor. You two go on, I\u2019ll be fine on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Grandpa, I wanna sit with you.\u201d</p><p>Dash looked at Kane briefly, then back at his grandson. \u201cWe can sit in the same vicinity, but the handicapped section is small. If you sit by me, that means someone in a wheelchair won\u2019t have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Dash set his twisted hand on Hayden\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGo sign up. Hayden raced to the table. Dash glanced at someone behind Kane and muttered, \u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Dash Paulson. Long time no see.\u201d</p><p>Kane recognized his cousin Keely\u2019s voice and turned around.</p><p>She squealed, \u201cKane! I hoped you\u2019d be here.\u201d She hugged him effusively and punched him in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cHey, what was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not inviting me to the last McKay poker game. You macho guys were just pissed because I handed you your collective asses last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall you bein\u2019 out of town.\u201d His eyes narrowed on his only female McKay cousin. Circles darkened the pale skin beneath her tired eyes. Her sunny smile seemed a tad forced. \u201cWhatcha been doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorkin\u2019, workin\u2019, and more workin\u2019.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI was coming to this basketball game to support my lamebrain brother Colt, but he backed out at the last minute.\u201d</p><p>Kane said, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d without any disappointment.</p><p>Keely ignored his sarcastic reply and invaded Dash\u2019s personal space. \u201cSo Mr. Paulson...happy as I am to see you out and about, you wanna tell me why you\u2019ve been ditching our physical therapy sessions?\u201d</p><p>Dash scowled at Keely. \u201cThey\u2019re pointless. I\u2019m never getting out of this chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. But you don\u2019t want to lose what strength and agility you have now, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Ginger know you\u2019re skipping class?\u201d</p><p>Another grimace. \u201cNo. I also know you can\u2019t tell her because of patient confidentiality, so you\u2019d best be keeping this to yourself, missy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Paulson, we both know there are ways around those pesky rules. So if you don\u2019t show...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Keely rubbed her hands together with utter glee. \u201cFair warning. Wednesday is gonna suck. I\u2019m putting you through the wringer. See you then.\u201d She gave him a finger wave and a haughty grin before she whirled on her boot heel and vanished into the crowd.</p><p>Dash pointed at Kane. \u201cNot a word to my daughter about this business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word. But I agree with Keely. And I\u2019ve seen firsthand how much her therapy has benefited my cousin Cam. Think about that.\u201d</p><p>Kane wandered off in search of Hayden. They found two seats in the lower bleacher section. Kane kept Hayden\u2019s junk food intake to a grape snow cone and a box of red licorice. With the kid\u2019s food allergies, he was careful to stick to the tried and true. The guilt would eat him alive if Hayden got sick on his watch.</p><p>At halftime, Kane headed down to the main floor and crouched beside Dash as Hayden participated in the footrace.</p><p>Hayden finished third. Kane snapped a couple of pictures of the ceremony and the green ribbon with his cell phone and sent it to Ginger.</p><p>Near the end of the third quarter, he saw the back of Dash\u2019s wheelchair as he exited the gym. He and Hayden followed.</p><p>Dash was parked outside the restroom, wearing a scowl.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Two spots of color dotted the man\u2019s sallow cheeks. \u201cI need to use the facilities but this handicapped bathroom isn\u2019t conducive to my needs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kane scratched his head. \u201cHow about if you repeat that in plain English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis particular bathroom is impossible for me to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d</p> <p>The muscle in Dash\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cNo. That\u2019s not the issue.\u201d</p><p>Like hell that wasn\u2019t the issue. Like father like daughter. Neither one wanted to accept his help.</p><p>Rather than snap, or embarrass the man, or point out the obvious, Kane said, \u201cFine. Let\u2019s get you back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d prefer to stay until the end of the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the future, maybe it\u2019d be better if you asked my plans instead of assuming they\u2019ll conflict with yours.\u201d</p> <p>Dash had no response.</p><p>Kane buttoned his sheepskin coat and slipped on his gloves. \u201cEveryone ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a sec. I gotta say goodbye to someone.\u201d Hayden raced off and ducked beneath the bleachers.</p><p>The silence between him and Dash was decidedly chilly and didn\u2019t owe a damn thing to the frigid temperatures outside.</p><p>\u201cMcKay, I apologize. I can be a bit of a curmudgeon sometimes.\u201d</p><p>At least the members of the Paulson family didn\u2019t have a problem admitting when they were wrong.</p> <p>\u201cI understand. We\u2019re cool. Know what\u2019s funny? My mama used that same word to describe my grandpa. Course, me\u2019n Kade thought it meant mean.\u201d</p><p>Dash smiled. \u201cThanks for bringing me here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Hayden bounded back, grinning from ear to ear. \u201cThis is so great. I wish we could do guy stuff like this with all of us every weekend.\u201d</p><p>Kane looked at Dash, who rather pointedly focused his gaze on his hands in his lap and didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cMe too, sport,\u201d Kane said. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cKimi, don\u2019t feel obligated to stay if you have other things to do,\u201d Ginger said, after twenty minutes of general small talk.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to stick around. And to be honest? You\u2019d be doin\u2019 me a favor by lettin\u2019 me stay.\u201d</p><p>Ginger eyed the petite blonde. How this small woman birthed twins boggled her mind. \u201cHow would you getting stuck with me be a favor?\u201d</p><p>Kimi cracked open a can of diet soda and poured the fizzy liquid over a glass of ice. \u201cFirst off, it\u2019s Sunday. Which means football, which I don\u2019t care a lick about. But my husband and his brother Carson are huge fans. They turn the TV so damn loud I can\u2019t stand to be in the same room with them.\u201d She winked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what they\u2019re countin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re left to your own devices every Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t so bad. About half the time I head over to my sister Caro\u2019s place, since Carson is parked in my den. But today, Caro has all her grandkids over. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I adore my grandnephews and grandnieces. There are just so darn many of them. Cryin\u2019, fightin\u2019, screamin\u2019, kids and dogs runnin\u2019 in and out of the house. Plus diapers, and at least one of them always vomits. Caro\u2019s in her element, but she\u2019s used to bein\u2019 surrounded by kids, as she had half a dozen.\u201d</p><p>Kimi set the soda on a coaster next to Ginger, and then poured herself a soda on ice too.</p><p>\u201cOf course, my granddaughters are perfect angels. Here. See for yourself.\u201d From a saddle-shaped purse, Kimi whipped out a four-by-six photo album and handed it over. \u201cSince Sky works so much during the week, her and Kade\u2019s weekends are devoted to their girls, and I can\u2019t fault them for that. Even when I don\u2019t get to see my girlies as much as I\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever hang out with Kane on Sundays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRarely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Kimi shrugged. \u201cUsed to be he\u2019d still be enjoying female companionship from his Saturday night adventures in whatever bar he\u2019d been trolling in the night before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for lack of women vying for his attention. My boys are good lookin\u2019 men. Lord, they\u2019ve been rating a second and third glance from women of all ages since they turned fourteen. Kane took advantage of Raising Kane</p><p>that female attention, way more than Kade ever did. But in the last few years, it\u2019s like Kane had a complete personality makeover.\u201d</p><p>Getting the goods on Kane McKay straight from his mother\u2019s mouth? Too good an opportunity to pass up. \u201cHow\u2019s he changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis cousin Dag died. Colt went into rehab. Cord got married. Kade got married. Then they sold the Boars Nest to Cam. It was like everybody grew up and moved on. Everyone but him. And don\u2019t get me started on that ridiculous name change.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought a lot about it and the bottom line is this\u2014I don\u2019t think Kane wanted to give up his party-boy ways. It\u2019s made him a little bitter, so he keeps to himself. It bugs the crap out of me that he\u2019s alone so much.\u201d Kimi sighed. \u201cThen again, near as I can figure, he\u2019s not bouncing on every woman with a pulse in the tri-county area. Good Lord. That man had lousy taste in women.\u201d</p><p>Cheeks burning, Ginger sipped her soda, keeping her mouth shut.</p><p>But Kimi was perceptive and recognized Ginger\u2019s intentional silence. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got something to say about Kane, by all means, spit it out.\u201d</p><p>Her internal debate lasted all of fifteen seconds. \u201cNo offense, Kimi. I hate to say you\u2019re wrong about your son...but you\u2019re wrong. Kane keeps to himself because he\u2019s just plain tired. Sounds to me like he\u2019s picked up a considerable amount of slack since Kade became a family man.\u201d Ginger lifted a finger when Kimi started to argue. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t whining or complaining when we talked about it, just explaining.</p><p>\u201cKane spends time with Hayden at least once a week. Maybe he isn\u2019t hanging out with his married McKay cousins, but he plays poker with his single McKay cousins every other week. Maybe the difference is Kane doesn\u2019t feel compelled to live up to his former wild reputation. And near as I can tell? He isn\u2019t bitter. But I suspect he is lonely.\u201d</p><p>Kimi flat-out gaped at her. Then she got up and walked into the kitchen. She stared out the window, keeping her back to Ginger.</p><p>Way to insult Kane\u2019s mother first thing. Sometimes you have the tact of your mother.</p><p>Ginger waited for Kimi to either leave in a huff or lash out at her, figured she deserved either or both reactions.</p><p>Finally she came back and sat next to Ginger on the couch. Ginger\u2019s stomach churned seeing tear tracks on Kimi\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I stepped over the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d Kimi laughed. \u201cOkay, you did. It\u2019s just...you think you know your child. Straight down to the bone. Then someone shows you how arrogant that is. I should never assume anything. It makes me mad when other people do it, and I\u2019ve done the same damn thing with my own child. So I don\u2019t know which is worse, how impressed I am by your insight into my son, or how embarrassed I am because of my lack of it.\u201d</p><p>Somewhat relieved, Ginger sagged into the couch. \u201cI entrust Kane with the most important thing in my life\u2014my son\u2014so I probably see him in another light than you do.\u201d</p><p>A shrewd look entered Kimi\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow do you see my son?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d like to see the gorgeous, thoughtful, kind, sweet, funny man naked a whole lot more, especially with his innate ability to make my earlobes sweat when he puts those calloused hands on me.</p><p>\u201cNot only is Kane multi-faceted, Kimi, he\u2019s great at multi-tasking. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if he hadn\u2019t volunteered to stay here and take care of us after my accident.\u201d Ginger tilted her head back and stared at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of caretakers, are you Dash\u2019s primary caretaker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And no. We built this one-level house to accommodate his wheelchair. Everything is handicapped-accessible. I hired a male nurse to deal with Dad\u2019s personal hygiene stuff because the stubborn man refuses to let me help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen need their pride,\u201d Kimi said softly. \u201cMy father hated being seen as weak. But Cal\u2019s dad, God rest his soul, accepted he\u2019d never be the man he was and kept a great sense of humor about his \u2018failings\u2019</p><p>until the day he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point...my Dad is between those two mindsets. Luckily he\u2019s still a social guy, so he\u2019s off to the senior center or community center three times a week. Although he\u2019s retired, he comes into the office and helps me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCal said Dash intends to pass all the McKay legal work on to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to it than I imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig ranch. Big secrets. I hope you\u2019re up for it.\u201d</p><p>That was a strange thing for Kimi to say.</p><p>The silence didn\u2019t last long and Ginger appreciated Kimi kept the conversation rolling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised Dash kept his health issues a secret while he was dealing with Linda\u2019s illness.\u201d</p><p>Kimi clucked her tongue. \u201cLinda was such a sweet woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I hear. I didn\u2019t know her at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that because you were close with your mother? I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever heard her mentioned.\u201d</p><p>Ginger tensed up at the mere mention of her mother. \u201cAs you probably know from local gossip, my parents\u2019 divorce was less than amicable. My relationship with my mother wasn\u2019t that great growing up, but it worsened after I left for college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019d think she\u2019d be proud to have such a successful, smart, driven woman for a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. She hated I\u2019d followed in my dad\u2019s footsteps. Then Hayden\u2019s birth knocked her for a loop, because frankly, she wasn\u2019t ready to be a grandma. Plus, it embarrassed her I\u2019d become an unmarried single mother and refused to disclose the name of Hayden\u2019s sperm donor. She cut all ties with me when we moved to Wyoming.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere does she live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue.

It\u2019s a pretty screwed up situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it. But then I\u2019ve learned that there\u2019s no such thing as the perfect family.\u201d</p><p>Her cell phone buzzed. She opened the picture message from Kane, showing Hayden receiving his third place ribbon. How much did it suck she couldn\u2019t be there?</p><p>\u201cHoney? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She passed the phone to Kimi. \u201cMother\u2019s guilt. Kane sent me a picture of Hayden and his award.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He\u2019s always doing stuff like that. But it makes me feel so guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of bein\u2019 a mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever still feel guilty?\u201d</p><p>Kimi pinned her with an arch look. \u201cYes. Especially when it\u2019s pointed out to me that I don\u2019t know my own son as well as I thought I did.\u201d</p><p>Ginger blushed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m glad you talked to me. I really liked seein\u2019 Kane through your eyes, Ginger.</p><p>And I hope...\u201d She waved dismissively. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Kimi, tell me. You hope what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope Kane knows how proud I am of him, not only for helpin\u2019 you out, but for the time he spends with Hayden. I\u2019ve never thought of him as overly responsible besides when it comes to his duties at the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should tell him. It\u2019d be good for him to hear it from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s head pounded, a byproduct of thinking about her mother.</p><p>Kimi stood. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get you a pain pill and tuck you in. I fear my son\u2019d have my hide for talkin\u2019 your ear off when you\u2019re supposed to be restin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how tired I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is a sign you need to get some shut-eye.\u201d</p><p>Kimi stayed by Ginger\u2019s side until she drifted off, offering comfort and silent support. Her last coherent thought was Like mother, like son.</p><p>\u201cHey, Red.\u201d A soft kiss teased her forehead.</p><p>\u201cAm I still dreaming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we nekkid in this dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Completely. Rolling around on satin sheets and you\u2019re kissing me in that panty-drenching way of yours.\u201d</p><p>Kane chuckled. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have to act out the good parts of the dream later. But it\u2019s time for you to get up.\u201d</p><p>Ginger opened her eyes, sighing dreamily that Kane\u2019s handsome face was so close to hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that sigh for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re just so damn pretty, Kane McKay.\u201d</p><p>His neck flushed. \u201cHow many of them damn drugs did you take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d She ran the tips of her fingers down the section of skin where the blush met his goatee.</p><p>\u201cYou could have any woman in town. You have had most of them, to hear your mother talk. So what are you doing with me?\u201d</p><p>Hurt flashed in his eyes. She could\u2019ve bitten her tongue for her careless comment.</p><p>\u201cMy ma was here tellin\u2019 stories about me, was she? Fillin\u2019 you in on all the women I bedded and discarded? Did she tell you that the reason Kade and Sky ended up together was because he pretended to be me after I was an asshole to her on our first and only date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She didn\u2019t mention that one.\u201d</p><p>Kane stood abruptly. Angrily. \u201cDon\u2019t matter. We\u2019ve been back awhile. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Ginger reached for his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t run off in a fit of pique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave because you\u2019re mad. Kimi didn\u2019t name off your conquests, Kane. She just said you used to be quite the wild one and you\u2019ve mellowed. Now instead of worrying about you being too rowdy, she worries about you being alone too much.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cMa said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alone by choice.\u201d</p><p>There was more to his statement, but she didn\u2019t push. Instead, she brought his hand to her mouth and placed a soft kiss in the palm. \u201cSo does that \u2018alone by choice\u2019 comment include tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an invite, counselor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I feel the need to point out it is an open-ended invitation.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s eyes turned dark with liquid heat. He cupped her chin in his hand, sweeping his thumb across the inside of her lower lip. \u201cKnow one thing about me that ain\u2019t mellowed? That I\u2019m in charge even when you\u2019re touchin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>His bold statement caused her belly to jump. She stared at him, wondering how far he\u2019d take things.</p><p>\u201cYou look nervous, Red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met a man like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple? Or highly experienced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d</p><p>He huffed, \u201cThen what?\u201d a little impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYou distract me to the point that\u2019s all I can think about...being with you.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s lethally sexy grin appeared. \u201cI can live with being a distraction, sugar. In fact, I intend to bump up my attentions and see if I can\u2019t become your obsession.\u201d</p><p>Hours later, Ginger reflected on Kane\u2019s words when he waltzed into her bedroom and she realized he could become an obsession.</p><p>Hayden had hit the sack earlier than usual. Her father had retreated to his room directly after Hayden.</p><p>And now Kane had come to her.</p><p>A thrill of anticipation electrified her, starting at her toes, ending at her scalp.</p><p>She\u2019d purposely dimmed the lights to enhance the mood. Hoping the ambient glow would mask her physical flaws and her nervousness.</p><p>Instantly he flipped on all the switches, growling a warning, \u201cNo hidin\u2019 from me. Ever. I like to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Kane gestured to the edge of the bed. \u201cSit there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to get undressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you to get undressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your answer. This time you\u2019re undressing me.\u201d Kane stood in front of her, legs braced apart, arms crossed. A master directing his slave. \u201cPants first.\u201d</p><p>His high-handed behavior wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected. No kissing, no seduction. Using her good hand, she tugged one side of the elastic band, then the other, until the flannel pooled at his bare feet. He kicked his pajama pants aside.</p><p>Ginger\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t waver from her first up-close look at his cock. Oh wow. Circumcised? Check.</p><p>Long? Check. Thick? Check. She wanted to rub the smooth and shiny purple head across her lips.</p><p>He grabbed the edges of his tank top and yanked it off.</p><p>Confused, Ginger met his eyes. \u201cI thought I was supposed to undress you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were. Until I saw the way you were lickin\u2019 your lips. I\u2019m dyin\u2019 to feel your mouth on my cock.\u201d</p><p>Kane wrapped one hand around her jaw. The other hand circled his dick and he brought it in line with her lips. \u201cUse your mouth only, and only on the tip.\u201d</p><p>He painted her lips with the polished skin of the head. Once the slit was close enough to taste, her tongue darted out to catch the drop of fluid beading in the center. She moaned at her first taste of him.</p><p>\u201cYou keep makin\u2019 sounds like that and this\u2019ll be over too damn quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to make those sounds when this bad boy is completely buried my mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually. For now, focus on the head.\u201d</p><p>She circled her lips around the crown and sucked, alternating with flicks of her tongue. Working the sweet spot beneath the thick rim brought forth Kane\u2019s masculine groans of approval, but it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>She wanted to feel the rigid length gliding over her tongue. She wanted to feel his girth stretching her mouth wide. She wanted to feel his pubic hair ticking her nose as she took him deep. She wanted total submersion in this intimacy.</p><p>So yeah, maybe she resented his dictate of control.</p><p>Without warning, Kane tilted her head and pushed past her lips, over her teeth, across her tongue, bumping her soft palate, until his cock was fully seated in her mouth and halfway down her throat.</p><p>Ginger fought the gag reflex, focusing on her breathing. Trying not to feel smug she\u2019d gotten exactly what she\u2019d wanted.</p><p>Brusquely, Kane said, \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>The only things she could move were her eyes. She gazed up at him. God. He was something. So overpoweringly male.</p><p>\u201cYou were testy about me parceling out a taste of my cock an inch at a time, weren\u2019t you, sugar?\u201d</p><p>Her affirmative growl traveled up his shaft.</p><p>He trembled.</p><p>Ginger smiled, hard as it was with her lips stretched around the base of his cock.</p><p>\u201cYou are stubborn about getting your way,\u201d he murmured. His thumb traced the hollowed section of her cheek. \u201cTruth is, that makes me fuckin\u2019 hot.\u201d He let his fingers drift up her face to circle the shell of her ear before coming back to rest on her jaw. \u201cBut I\u2019m gonna enjoy teachin\u2019 you obedience.\u201d</p><p>His big, rough-skinned hands landed on her head. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>Her left hand gripped his muscular quad.</p><p>Kane pulled his cock out, letting the rim of the cockhead rest on her lower lip. Then he thrust back in fully. He did that three more times a slow withdrawal, a fast plunge to the root.</p><p>Saliva built in her mouth, coating his shaft, making the glide easier. Ginger kept her eyes closed, reveling in the silken push and pull of his hard flesh across her soft tissues.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he rasped. \u201cGet me wet.\u201d</p><p>She let her teeth graze the underside of his cock as he eased out. Then she playfully flicked her tongue into the slit.</p><p>\u201cNo teasing.\u201d He shoved deep. \u201cNow suck harder. That\u2019s it. Lemme feel those throat muscles workin\u2019.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kane picked up the pace.</p><p>Ginger loosened her jaw, loving his loss of control with every grunting thrust into the wet recess of her mouth. Her panties were soaked. Her sex throbbed with want, jealous her mouth was being so thoroughly filled.</p><p>The strokes increased. Kane\u2019s breathing turned even more ragged. \u201cI\u2019m close. Jesus. Fuck.\u201d Two more deep thrusts and he stilled. His cock twitched on the back of her tongue and he groaned, \u201cSwallow.</p> <p>Now. All of it. Christ.\u201d His hips continued to bump against her face.</p><p>Her cheeks were compressed tightly to the rigid shaft. Her throat muscles contracted around the head as his seed flowed down the back of her throat. A pleasant buzz reverberated in her head.</p><p>First time she\u2019d experienced that euphoric feeling from giving a blowjob. Usually her orgasms gave her that floating, melting sensation.</p><p>Seriously fucking hot, seriously fucking heady, this obedience stuff.</p><p>\u201cHey. Red. Look at me.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked at him.</p><p>Satisfaction and pure possession were etched on his face. And his mouth. That sinful, talented, knowing mouth, curled into a naughty smile. \u201cYou liked that.\u201d</p><p>Ginger couldn\u2019t even nod with the fierce grip he had on her head.</p><p>Kane\u2019s cock remained in her throat. \u201cBeautiful, sexy Ginger. Prim and proper mama no more. Christ, woman, you blew my fuckin\u2019 mind.\u201d</p><p>She kept her eyes riveted to the fire blazing in the blue depths. She finally understood his need for control\u2014because his sexual hunger could be overpowering. All encompassing. Addictive.</p><p>\u201cBut you can let go of my dick now. In fact, sugar, you\u2019re teeth are startin\u2019 to hurt a little.\u201d</p> <p>What? She was keeping his cock in place? Not him? That was new. She relaxed her jaw.</p><p>Kane\u2019s greedy gaze was locked on his semi-hard cock slipping from between her lips. \u201cSoon as you catch your breath, we\u2019re goin\u2019 again.\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled his hip, breathing his musky scent deep into her lungs. Her fingernails were still embedded in his thigh with enough force she\u2019d marked him.</p><p>He seemed content to stroke her hair, brushing back the tendrils sticking to her sweat dampened face.</p><p>Several insistent knocks on the door brought them both out their sexual trance.</p><p>\u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s head snapped up.</p><p>Kane said, \u201cShit,\u201d and quickly\u2014and rather comically\u2014dragged on his pajama bottoms and pulled on his tank top, inside out.</p> <p>Good thing she had her clothes on and she looked sleep tousled, not sex-ravaged. Kane unlocked the door, ending up behind it as it opened.</p><p>Hayden rushed in and started to fling himself at her, but Kane deftly stopped him mid-leap.</p><p>\u201cGently, sport. Your mama still ain\u2019t up to tackle hugs.\u201d</p><p>If it surprised Hayden that Kane was in her room, he didn\u2019t show it. He burrowed into her.</p><p>\u201cSweetie? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a bad dream. And you died and Grandpa changed into a tornado, with robot arms and he chased me in his wheelchair. He was gonna cut off my head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds scary. But I\u2019m thinking no more Transformers before bed,\u201d she murmured, looking up at Kane.</p><p>Kane mouthed, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I sleep with you?\u201d</p><p>Hayden rarely asked to crawl in bed with her so she knew he was shaken up. She kissed the top of his head. \u201cOf course. Do you need a drink or anything first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just need you, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Her heart tumbled. \u201cI\u2019m here. Not going anywhere, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He released a heavy sigh. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Kane can tuck us both in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Ginger rolled back onto the mattress. Hayden snuggled beside her, heeding Kane\u2019s warning not to jiggle her sling. They wiggled until comfortable positions were attained.</p><p>Kane tugged the blankets over them. \u201cDo you want pillows to prop up your cast?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He clicked off the lights. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the door open in case you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Usually Hayden was a restless sleeper but it didn\u2019t take long before his breathing leveled. He mumbled, \u201cLove you, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, baby.\u201d</p><p>She thought she\u2019d be too keyed up from the sexual shenanigans with Kane to fall asleep right away.</p><p>But right after closing her eyes, she drifted off.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>By the time Ginger hobbled into the kitchen the next morning, Kane had already showered, shoveled the steps and the wheelchair ramp and brewed a pot of coffee.</p><p>Yeah, he was a little anxious.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to bring her a cup; she walked right past him poured her own. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a busy bee this morning,\u201d she said, gazing out the window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to getting up early. Did Hayden settle down all right last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly, yes. He\u2019s still completely sacked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked on you guys about three and you were both sound asleep.\u201d</p><p>Ginger turned around. \u201cWhy\u2019d you check on us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHabit. I\u2019ve been checkin\u2019 in on you at some point every night since I got here.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Hard. \u201cSo? Do I drool? Snore? Babble in my sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not usually this cranky before you\u2019ve had your first shot of caffeine. Something botherin\u2019</p><p>you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...never mind. Drop it, okay?\u201d</p><p>Kane stopped in front of her. \u201cNo. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing everything. I\u2019m doing nothing. I\u2019m tired of being helpless. I need a real shower so badly I can smell myself. I look horrible. I hate the way the pain pills knock me out. I hate that if I don\u2019t take them I hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Ginger lifted her head. \u201cLike my total helplessness, my total dependence on you isn\u2019t enough reason for me to be cranky?\u201d She scowled at him. \u201cWhy in the hell are you so damn chipper this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a blow by blow account of what\u2019s put a big ol\u2019 grin on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d She hid her smile behind her coffee cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you\u2019d be happy. I thought you\u2019d be upset we were interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything less than you givin\u2019 Hayden your full attention when he needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I thought maybe you were peckish because I hadn\u2019t kissed you good mornin\u2019 yet. Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t kiss you goodnight, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlacking on your caretaking duties, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to Dash\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cI checked on him too. He\u2019s still snoring away.\u201d Kane set her coffee cup on the counter and held her face in his hands. \u201cGood mornin\u2019, beautiful.\u201d He kissed her with as much tenderness he could muster, needing her acceptance. Her surrender.</p><p>Ginger tried to crank the heat up, but he wouldn\u2019t allow it. He gently bit down on her lower lip and briefly held it hostage between his teeth. \u201cAh. Ah. Ah. My pace. And I\u2019m wantin\u2019 slow, wet and sweet kisses from you right now, counselor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane. I want more than kisses.\u201d</p><p>His cock, already stirring with interest, went fully erect. \u201cSame goes, but I ain\u2019t gonna start something we can\u2019t finish. Neither your daddy nor your son needs to see me bending you facedown across the counter as I fuck you like a madman.\u201d</p><p>The pulse in her throat jumped.</p><p>With deliberate slowness, Kane bent down, breathing on the spot before he placed his lips on it. \u201cI love the way you taste right here.\u201d</p><p>Ginger shivered, releasing a husky moan.</p><p>\u201cI want you under me, on top of me, in front of me, every which way I\u2019ve ever thought about takin\u2019</p><p>you and then some. But let\u2019s be realistic, Red. It\u2019s probably not gonna happen tonight.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cHaving second thoughts about getting mixed up with a single mother who\u2019s rarely alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 we\u2019re gonna hafta get creative to carve out our own alone time.\u201d He kissed a path to her ear. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s a school day, and the bus picks Hayden up out front, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. Umm. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, I don\u2019t know. Yes, tomorrow is a school day. And God, I cannot think straight when you whisper in my ear, Kane McKay. You could recite the constitutional amendments and I\u2019d get turned on.\u201d</p><p>Kane smiled against her temple. \u201cAnd the senior bus picks your dad up...early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s plan on spending tomorrow\u2014the whole day\u2014alone together, in bed.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back to look at him. \u201cThat\u2019d be perfect. But I have to work. I\u2019ve already missed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. Doc Monroe said you needed a minimum of five days recovery time. Tomorrow is the fifth day. Doctor\u2019s orders are doctor\u2019s orders, sugar. And it\u2019s my job to make sure they\u2019re followed to the letter.\u201d</p><p>After a brief pause, Ginger giggled.</p><p>Giggled.</p><p>The brilliant, sexy, headstrong bombshell with too many responsibilities and too little personal time...actually giggled like a girl.</p><p>That\u2019s when Kane knew he was done for.</p><p>He smashed his mouth to hers, kissing her with the passion that he could finally unleash tomorrow.</p><p>She matched his every tongue tangling, lip gliding, teeth nipping move, adding a few of her own, until he was dizzy with lust. Why did he have the strangest urge to break out into song like some cheesy romantic comedy hero?</p><p>Hero. Right. He was far from being a hero, but it looked as if he was about to get the girl of his dreams\u2014for one day, anyway.</p><p>Kane eased back from the reckless kiss, pressing his forehead to hers.</p><p>\u201cIs it tomorrow yet?\u201d she murmured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled, pleased as punch that she was just as anxious. \u201cNo. But as soon as everybody\u2019s up, I\u2019m gonna need to go outside and work off this extra energy.

Not since the night you goaded me into kissin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p> <p>\u201cSurprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d</p><p>Kane whispered, \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had any wood in my shed since I moved here.\u201d</p><p>Simultaneously, they tilted their heads back and stared at one another.

Again.</p><p>At 6 a.m. Kane showered. Shaved. Trimmed his mustache and goatee. Did a little manscaping.</p><p>At 6:30 a.m. the coffee finished brewing.</p><p>At 6:35 a.m. he heard Ginger\u2019s door open. She woke Hayden. Then her father. Then she entered the kitchen.</p><p>Okay. He\u2019d half hoped she\u2019d slink in wearing the silky green robe he\u2019d seen hanging on the back of her bedroom door. But no. She wore black yoga pants that hugged her every mouth-watering curve and an old T-shirt that barely skimmed her navel.</p><p>Hello gorgeous.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t look at him. She poured herself a cup of coffee. Knocked it back and poured another.</p> <p>\u201cGinger? You okay?\u201d</p><p>She whirled on him and growled, \u201cNo. Don\u2019t touch me. Don\u2019t talk to me. Don\u2019t even look at me.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Had she changed her mind? \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you do, I will jump you and ride you like a pony, right fucking here, right fucking now, on my dirty kitchen linoleum.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Guess she hadn\u2019t changed her mind.</p><p>Heh heh.</p><p>Grinning, Kane held up his hands in mock surrender. \u201cI\u2019ll just umm...watch The Weather Channel or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d</p><p>If Hayden or Dash noticed her edginess, they didn\u2019t mention it. She packed Hayden\u2019s lunch. He bundled the boy up and sent him out to wait for the school bus.</p><p>One down; one to go.</p><p>Dash seemed to be dragging his wheels. Even after the senior bus pulled into the driveway and honked. He slowly put on his coat. Buttoned it. Double-checking each button.</p><p>At one point Kane swore he caught a knowing, ornery smirk on the man\u2019s face.</p><p>Dash wrapped his scarf around his neck, then rewrapped it. He settled his Elmer Fudd hat with the earflaps on his head. Tugged on his gloves with his teeth. Took them off and tried it again.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>But the man bundled up and ready for a trip to Siberia, simply waited at the door.</p><p>\u201cDo they usually come in and get you?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Pause.</p><p>\u201cNeed me to help you out to the van, Dash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little eager to get rid of me this morning, McKay?\u201d</p><p>Dammit. \u201cNope. I thought you might be worried the ramp is icy. I shoveled it, so you don\u2019t have to worry about careening out of control.\u201d</p><p>The horn honked again.</p><p>Dash stayed put.</p><p>Now Kane was really starting to sweat. What if the bus left? He could drive Dash into town in the van, although that\u2019d eat up some time, but that\u2019d still leave him and Ginger...</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Dash said and Kane scrambled to hold the door open while Dash rolled out.</p><p>8:37 a.m. Dash was on the bus\u2019s loading platform and the driver opened the door to load Dash\u2019s wheelchair into the bus.</p><p>8:40 a.m. the bus started backing down the driveway.</p><p>8:41 a.m. the senior bus disappeared down the highway.</p><p>8:42 a.m. Kane locked the front door.</p><p>At 8:42 and sixteen seconds Kane stood at the foot of Ginger\u2019s bed.</p><p>The sexy vixen had draped the green robe across her body. \u201cThey\u2019re gone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen strip.\u201d</p><p>Kane raised an eyebrow. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo control games. I want you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl ain\u2019t a game for me, Red. No master-slave scenarios. No collars. No fake punishments for disobedience. No crops or whips or spankins...unless you ask. Or maybe, even if you don\u2019t.\u201d Kane yanked his T-shirt off. Unbuckled his belt and unzipped. And stopped.</p><p>If the glazed look in her eyes was an indication, she\u2019d quit listening to him when he\u2019d started shedding clothes.</p><p>He whistled to get her attention.</p><p>Ginger\u2019s gaze zoomed back to him. \u201cUmm. What were you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. I\u2019m in control when that bedroom door shuts. You cede all power to me. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one\u2014because I like it and bein\u2019 in control is my true nature. And two\u2014because I know you\u2019re the take-charge type. You\u2019re always worryin\u2019 about everyone else in your family, makin\u2019 sure your career and every aspect of your life are kept under control. Which is fine. Perfect actually. Because it\u2019ll be so much more freeing when you hand that tightly held control over to me when we\u2019re in the bedroom.\u201d Kane shucked his Wranglers and his socks, keeping her focus trained on him. \u201cNo one has to know but us. I\u2019m willin\u2019 to compromise on a lot of things, but this ain\u2019t one of them. So tell me now if you\u2019re on board with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put my clothes back on and we\u2019ll chalk it up to differing philosophies.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. He recognized the wheels in her head were spinning frantically, trying to justify this action with all that lawyer speak that made her so damn appealing.</p><p>\u201cSay yes. Let me take care of you, Ginger. I\u2019ll give you everything that you never knew you needed in bed.\u201d And out, but she wasn\u2019t ready to hear that part yet.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Kane wrapped his fist in the silken material of the green robe and yanked, revealing her...fully clothed body.</p><p>Her porcelain-colored skin flushed a deep crimson. \u201cI wanted to be a temptress, to wear my skimpiest lace panties and matching bra, but I couldn\u2019t get undressed by myself. So, sorry I\u2019m in the same old crappy stuff I\u2019ve worn for the last\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d He crawled across the bed, his painfully hard dick bounced against his belly. \u201cLose the pants.\u201d Off they went. \u201cSit up.\u201d</p><p>She pushed upright with her good arm and studied him from beneath lowered lashes. \u201cTake the sling off too. I\u2019ll be careful. I just need to touch you with both hands, Kane.\u201d</p><p>He unhooked the sling and maneuvered her shirt off. She wore the lime-green bra. He twisted the front clasp, slid it free from her arms and it met the rest of her clothes on the floor.</p><p>Once he tore his greedy gaze away from her drool-worthy tits, he sealed his lips to hers. As Kane kissed her, he slowly rolled her onto her back.</p><p>By the time they came up for air, Kane teetered on the edge of just plowing into her and getting this first time out of the way so he could take it slower the second go round.</p><p>Fuck that. Ginger deserved better. Hell, he deserved better.</p><p>He pushed onto his haunches; his gaze started at the sassy dent in her chin and winged to the pale peach tips of her hardened nipples and ended at the triangle of red curls. Kane bent his head and lapped her slit from the mouth of her sex to her clit.</p><p>Damn. She was already wet. Really wet. Completely ready.</p><p>\u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d With now, now, now pounding in his head, he slid her left foot up until it was flat on the mattress. Then he did the same with the cast. He braced his left hand above her shoulder and directed his cock to the warm, wet place between her thighs.</p><p>Then Kane snapped his hips. With one fast stroke he was fully seated inside her. He levered his body over hers, so they were belly to belly, chest to chest, eye to eye. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s left hand touched his face. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, don\u2019t think, just fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Growling, Kane pulled out and slammed back in. \u201cGood thing you said that, because I couldn\u2019t hold back right now if I tried.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew. Shoved in to the root again. Each stroke gained momentum. Faster and faster until he was fucking her without pause.</p><p>She squirmed, delicately arching her neck, canting her hips, urging him to go deeper. Her free hand gripped his ass and her breath whooshed out with his every forceful thrust.</p><p>\u201cGod, that feels so good,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cToo goddamn good.\u201d Yeah, it\u2019d been a long time since he\u2019d had sex, but he never remembered it being this good. Maybe the buildup of sexual tension heightened his senses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already close. Shift your hips a little to the... Oh yes, right there.\u201d</p><p>On every upstroke he pressed into her pubic bone, grinding against her clit. Shortening each thrust so he kept nearly constant pressure where she needed it most.</p><p>Her cunt muscles clamped down on his cock, keeping it in place and she came with a husky, drawn-out wail.</p><p>Steady. Steady. Steady.</p><p>Kane clenched his jaw and rode out her orgasm, memorizing the play of emotions crossing her exquisite face. The look of pain morphed into an expression of bliss and she released a wholly feminine, wholly satisfied sigh.</p><p>The sigh set him off. He jackhammered his cock into her without restraint, watching her tits shake, watching her smile grow as his control unraveled.</p><p>His balls constricted. He shouted as pulses of hot seed shot out of his dick into the slippery, wet heat of her pussy. At each ripple of pleasure zipping down his spine, he couldn\u2019t stop his pelvis from thrusting, trying to prolong the almost violent electric bursts as long as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as he stopped moving, Ginger\u2019s mouth was on his. Unrelenting and hungry. Kane remained in the pushup position as long as he dared, letting her control the kiss, but his arms needed a break. The last thing he wanted was to crush her dislocated shoulder.</p><p>Ginger made a soft protest when he broke the kiss.</p><p>\u201cI know, darlin\u2019, but give me a second, okay?\u201d He shifted back, dislodging his cock. Wetness trickled down her leg and it occurred to him why it\u2019d felt so goddamn good: they\u2019d forgotten a condom.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She realized the oversight the same time he did.</p><p>\u201cShit, Ginger, I\u2019m so sorry. I was just so damn crazed to be with you that I forgot.\u201d He rested on his haunches, dropping his palms to his thighs. \u201cI\u2019ve always used a condom. Always. And it\u2019s been a while for me, so I\u2019m clean. I know that doesn\u2019t probably ease your mind as far as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane.\u201d She sat up and placed her hand in the center of his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We should\u2019ve thought of birth control\u2014both of us\u2014but I was just as eager as you were. Besides, I\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are? But...why?\u201d The spike of jealousy surprised him. \u201cIf you\u2019re not seein\u2019 anyone regular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had one unintended pregnancy. I\u2019ve been on the pill since Hayden was a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, that\u2019s good, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the few times I\u2019ve let myself act like a woman, and not a mother, I\u2019ve insisted on condoms.\u201d</p><p>Her hand inched down and she swept her thumb across his nipple. \u201cI loved the feel of you in me, no barriers. Just you bare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Goose bumps prickled his skin from her lazy stroking motion on his chest.</p><p>\u201cSo we can skip the condoms entirely, if you want.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s hand slid into her hair. He tilted her head back while bringing her closer. \u201cOh, I want, all right.\u201d</p><p>Silence passed between them as they looked at each other. Lust built quickly, reflected in equal measure.</p><p>He softly brushed his lips across hers. \u201cAgain. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s gaze dropped to his cock. \u201cHere I thought I\u2019d get to use my hand to help you rise to the occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t stoppin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>She reached between them and fondled his balls. Then she wrapped her fingers around his girth and stroked, keeping her eyes glued to his. \u201cSee? I\u2019m not very good with my left hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, darlin\u2019, you don\u2019t have to be good. Just puttin\u2019 your hand on me does all sorts of good.\u201d He loosened his hold on her hair. \u201cNeed help climbin\u2019 up on my lap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>Kane adjusted his legs beneath hers. \u201cHold onto my shoulder.\u201d As soon as Ginger had some semblance of balance, he lifted her so her legs were half-wrapped around his waist as they faced each other.</p><p>\u201cOh. I like this,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He aligned his cock and slid into her in a single slow glide.</p><p>\u201cI really like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way I can have my hands free to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention I can kiss all those spots that\u2019ve been tempting me.\u201d Ginger used her teeth to follow the muscles corded in his neck. She methodically tasted the section of skin under his strong jaw. She slid her lips to his ear. \u201cWhile this control thing is a turn on? I want equal time to explore your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Okay, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove in me, Kane. Put your hands on me. God, I love the way your rough hands feel on me.\u201d</p><p>Kane grabbed her ass cheeks and rocked into her. In this position he couldn\u2019t pull his cock out, but there was something very intimate about staying connected while hands and mouths explored. While pulses raced and sweat beaded on skin.</p><p>And Ginger took her own sweet time in her exploration. She kissed, nibbled and licked the slope of his shoulder, his jaw, all the while making very satisfied, very approving noises. He loved the way her tits pressed into his chest. The stiff nipples rubbing the hair on his sweat-slickened skin when she shifted to touch him at another angle. He loved the feel of her quickened breath puffing out every time he lifted his hips and drove into her a little deeper.</p><p>He loved everything about this. About her.</p><p>Part of him wanted to stay locked with this highly sensual woman for the next hour, just existing in the physical reaction. Another part wanted that drive to orgasm.</p><p>When Ginger reconnected their mouths the urgency re-ignited.</p><p>His hands cupped her buttocks, lifting her completely off his cock so he could plunge in fully.</p><p>She ripped her mouth free, arching her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear down on me, oh fuck yeah, just like that.\u201d Kane buried his lips in her throat and sucked hard.</p><p>\u201cOmigod. Yes. Yes!\u201d Ginger\u2019s body tightened, inside, outside.</p><p>Kane came with a roar as her climax milked his with every rhythmic pulse. He was pretty sure he stopped breathing for a second or so. He was pretty sure the damn world stopped spinning. He was also pretty sure one day in bed with her wouldn\u2019t nearly be enough.</p><p>Soft kisses tracked his hairline.</p><p>His eyes fluttered open.</p><p>Ginger smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cJesus. That was fucking amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr amazing fucking,\u201d she teased, kissing his nose.</p><p>\u201cThat too,\u201d he murmured. He sensed her restlessness and need to move. \u201cHang on. Lemme help you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her, turning so she balanced on her good arm before lowering her to the mattress.</p><p>She immediately closed her eyes and rested her bum arm on her bare belly.</p><p>Kane crawled beside her and swept the damp hair from her rosy cheek. \u201cYou okay? Need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome recovery time before round three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, Red, that\u2019s supposed to be my line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use a drink of water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d Kane slipped on his boxer shorts and wandered to the kitchen. He checked the time, checked his phone and washed his hands and face in the sink. He half expected to find her asleep when returned to her bedroom.</p><p>But Ginger was wide-awake. Looking sexy as hell propped up on the pile of pillows on her bed.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He handed her the glass of water and she drained it. \u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But we worked up a powerful thirst, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like a powerful hunger for me.\u201d</p><p>Both her auburn eyebrows lifted. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a third round, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Kane kissed the top of her foot. \u201cAnd a fourth.\u201d He kissed above and below the bandage covering the gash on her shin. And the cute dimple above her knee. Then the bruises on her upper thigh.</p><p>\u201cAnd possibly a fifth.\u201d Finally he kissed the sexy curve of her hip. \u201cJust not right now.\u201d</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>\u201cYou cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can warm you up.\u201d He carefully pulled her into his arms.</p><p>She wiggled until she could press her cheek into his chest. Her cast clunked into his shin as she attempted to twine their legs together. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d His fingers trailed lazily up and down her spine.</p><p>After a bit, Ginger sighed. \u201cWant to know something that\u2019s embarrassing to admit? It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been with a man, I was worried I wouldn\u2019t remember how.\u201d</p><p>Amused, he said, \u201cRemember how to have sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Remember how to be a woman.\u201d</p><p>His heart lurched. He wanted to reassure her she was all woman, but he didn\u2019t interrupt, as he suspected this was something she\u2019d never admitted to herself, let alone to anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been asexual for so long, mother, professional woman, daughter, that I let the part of me that loves sex, that loves to be bold and fun in bed, the part that loves the feel of a man\u2019s hands on me, his arms around me...God. Just to be held like this. Do you know how long it\u2019s been? It\u2019s like I slammed the door on that part of myself and never even peeked inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you regret me kickin\u2019 that door wide open?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo. Never. Especially now that I know what I was missing behind that door with you.</p><p>Do you think it\u2019s weird I had the overwhelming urge to tell you the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lawyer speaking the truth? What is the world comin\u2019 to?\u201d</p><p>Ginger laughed again.</p><p>\u201cWhen did that door on your sexual being close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after Hayden was born. I tried to recoup some of what I\u2019d lost. But then I realized I never had it in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it Hayden\u2019s father who did such a number on you?\u201d</p><p>Her body went rigid. \u201cI never talk about it. About him. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Kane ignored her clipped tone. \u201cThen sugar, I think it\u2019s long past time you did.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Ginger had wondered if this would ever come up.</p><p>So far she\u2019d avoided the subject with her son.</p><p>But she knew there\u2019d be no avoiding it with this man.</p><p>But strangely, she trusted him. She wanted to tell him.</p><p>\u201cGinger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Just wrestling with where to even start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about at the beginning?\u201d</p><p>She toyed with his chest hair, purposely not looking at him. \u201cAfter I graduated from law school I landed a job with a big law firm in Los Angeles that specialized in contractual law in the entertainment industry. It was a highly sought-after job and I was damn lucky to have gotten it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood perks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing perks. Anyway, after my intern period passed, I was assigned permanently to the contractual dissolution team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were hired to find loopholes to break existing contracts.\u201d</p><p>His fingers never stopped moving on her back. \u201cIs that big business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery big business. I worked directly under the senior partner, Chas Daly. I admired him because he was brilliant and charismatic. He treated me like a rising star. He introduced me that way. \u2018Here\u2019s Ginger, our newest rising star.\u2019 It was heady stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the late nights, case overload and me being a rookie who needed supervision, Chas and I spent a lot of time together. One thing led to another, and within a year of my assignment we were engaged in this torrid affair.\u201d</p><p>At that comment Kane\u2019s fingers stilled.</p> <p>\u201cChas was married, which I knew. He fed me those clich\u00e9d bullshit lines about he and his wife drifting apart, she didn\u2019t fulfill his sexual needs. The man had a voracious sexual appetite. In hindsight it was probably due to Viagra. I eagerly bought his lies, becoming the adventurous lover his wife wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Even if we only hooked up in his office. I knew if I stayed the course, Chas would eventually leave her for me. Obviously that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out three pieces of information that absolutely devastated me. One\u2014his wife\u2019s father had started the law firm and he was inexplicably tied to it and to her. Two\u2014he was older than I\u2019d thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much older?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThirty years. I was twenty-seven. He was fifty-seven.\u201d Shame burned her cheeks. \u201cBut it was LA.</p><p>Everyone looks at least a decade younger. I figured he was in his late forties, because that\u2019s how old his wife looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the third thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t the only woman he was having an affair with. The guy was a real womanizer with a string of conquests a mile long. Most of them bimbos. Anyway, after I found all this out, his wife, Lucinda, caught wind of our affair. I wasn\u2019t his run-of-the-mill stripper floozy. So I was summarily canned, without notice. And before you say something like \u2018why didn\u2019t I sue?\u2019 I\u2019ll remind you this law firm was the premier law firm in breaking contracts. I was seriously fucked.</p><p>\u201cThree weeks after I lost my job, I moved out of my high-priced condo because I couldn\u2019t afford the rent without the high paycheck, I discovered I was pregnant. More than three and a half months, according to the doctor. It was a shocking development, to say the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you contact Chas and let him know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I muddled through the pregnancy on my own. From the day he was born, Hayden had health issues. Although we didn\u2019t have health insurance, my son received the very best care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd while you were struggling, you didn\u2019t consider askin\u2019 Chas to support his child? To take responsibility for his actions?\u201d</p><p>Ginger recognized Kane\u2019s anger. She lifted her head and looked at him. \u201cYes, I did. Several times.</p><p>There were days when I suspected I\u2019d doomed my baby by holding onto my pride. But when I held that sweet baby in my arms, I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t share custody of Hayden with Chas. Ever. It sucked. I had no one to talk to about any of it since I\u2019d ostracized myself from my law colleagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to know about my pregnancy. The sad fact was I\u2019d been too busy building a career to maintain female friendships. My mother was embarrassed I\u2019d become unwed, underemployed, single mother. My dad...well, my dad was great. For the first time in my life he supported me. Emotionally and financially. When we had a bad month...he was there to help out. He wasn\u2019t ashamed of me and he adored Hayden from the start.\u201d She swallowed hard.</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just stubborn or stupid, but whenever I went to pick up the phone to call Chas, something stopped me. I knew myself well enough that if I hadn\u2019t set a firm date to let Chas know he had a son, I\u2019d keep stalling. So I promised myself I\u2019d tell Chas after Hayden\u2019s second birthday.\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI never got the chance. Chas had a massive heart attack out on a fishing boat off the Catalina coast and died when Hayden was twenty-two months old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months later I found out through a mutual work friend that Chas\u2019s wife and his daughter from his first marriage were in a huge lawsuit over his estate. That\u2019s when I knew it was some kind of karma that\u2019d kept me from contacting him. Chas wasn\u2019t meant to be in Hayden\u2019s life in any capacity. And I decided not to subject Hayden to any of Chas\u2019s bullshit family stuff. I finally realized there were more important things than money or prestige.\u201d</p><p>Kane tucked a stray hair behind her ear. \u201cDid you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Chas?\u201d She chewed her lip, considering her answer. Not for Kane\u2019s sake but for hers. \u201cI thought I did. But when he sacrificed my career without even blinking? I hated him. I hated him for taking away everything I\u2019d worked for. I hated him for a long time. Which is so bizarre because he gave me the most important thing in my life. He actually gave me the ability to love, because until I had Hayden, I didn\u2019t even know what love was.\u201d</p><p>Kane brought her face to his and kissed her. So sweetly tears pricked the back of her eyelids and seeped out the corners of her eyes. Then he kissed her tears away.</p><p>\u201cHayden doesn\u2019t know any of this, Kane. The only person I\u2019ve ever told is my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Hayden ever asked about his father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he asked you? While you two were doing Little Buddies stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. That\u2019s actually one of the topics we\u2019re supposed to steer clear of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart. I steer clear of it too.\u201d She dropped her head back onto his chest.</p><p>He toyed with her hair for a time before he spoke again. \u201cDid you practice law after you had Hayden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I moved to San Diego and worked as a file clerk in the county prosecutor\u2019s office. I hated that job and decided to hang out my shingle for a solo law practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat go better for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the first month? I didn\u2019t have a single client walk through my door. Then one day, this seventeen-year-old punk with attitude swaggered in. She\u2019d signed a modeling contract and paid the agency owner five grand for a portfolio. When she arrived at her first photographic \u2018shoot\u2019 she discovered the guy wasn\u2019t a modeling agent\u2014he was making porn. She demanded her money back and the contract voided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy refused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Most young girls would\u2019ve walked away and chalked it up to a stupid mistake. Or they would\u2019ve taken his offer of \u2018earning\u2019 the fee back by appearing in an adult film or two. That type of scam happens all the time in LA. But Ava, my client, refused to back down. I didn\u2019t find out until later that money wasn\u2019t an issue for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer parents were loaded. They didn\u2019t approve of her chasing her dream to become an actress, so she\u2019d hired this guy on the sly without their knowledge or approval. But it was her mess and she was determined to clean it up without Mommy and Daddy riding to her rescue.</p><p>\u201cWith my background in contract law, I sent the sleazeball a letter outlining my plans to file a lawsuit, regarding his blatant breaking of California sexual predator laws since Ava was a minor\u2014which he knew when she signed the contract. Within two days we had the money and a voided contract.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cDespite our age difference, Ava and I became great friends. We still are. She was so impressed with the results, she sent me more clients. I vetted all her professional contracts up until I moved to Wyoming and she hit the big leagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig leagues?\u201d he asked, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cAfter her first TV series was a runaway smash, she transitioned into movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho we talkin\u2019 about here, Red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva Dumond. Her stage name is Ava Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit? The teeny blonde with the big\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cThe big...role on that vampire show? That Ava Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne in the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. I\u2019d wondered if you knew any of them Hollywood stars, bein\u2019s you\u2019re from LA. Turns out you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the only one I keep in contact with. I worry about her. She\u2019s highly driven, with boatloads of talent, and she\u2019d avoided drugs and alcohol and all those self-destructive clich\u00e9s. Now if she could just stay out of the tabloids. She\u2019s got lousy taste in men and a tendency to end up in compromising positions, which always seem to end up on tape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine havin\u2019 that kinda lifestyle.\u201d</p><p>Ginger really loved this, being wrapped in Kane\u2019s arms. She honestly couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d lolled around naked in bed with a hot man, just talking.</p><p>That\u2019s because this is a first.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t Kane be shocked to know that?</p><p>So tell him.</p><p>No. She\u2019d come across...pathetic, probably.</p><p>\u201cYou must be awful good at keepin\u2019 secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComes with the territory of my job. Now that I\u2019ve told you my biggest secret, let\u2019s hear some of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 to tell. I\u2019m just a simple Wyoming rancher.\u201d</p><p>Was his tone a little testy? \u201cYou\u2019ve never been married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver come close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver been in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDozens of times.\u201d</p><p>Ginger went completely still.</p><p>\u201cLasted until I ditched the condom, sometimes even a day or two after that. Never longer than a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That was a harsh insight.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you wanna hear my past secrets and lies, sugar? \u2019Cause they sure ain\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike mine were?\u201d she shot back.</p><p>Kane laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re both a little touchy, ain\u2019t we?\u201d He began that soothing stroking motion on her back again. \u201cYou showed me yours, I\u2019ll show you mine. I guess the easiest way to say this is that I lost my virginity at age fourteen. Got my first taste of sex and never looked back. When I wasn\u2019t workin\u2019 on the ranch or raisin\u2019 hell with my McKay cousins, I was sweet-talkin every woman in my path hopin\u2019 to get into her pants. And truth be told, it didn\u2019t take much for them to fall into my bed. Or into my truck. Or wherever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor the longest time it seemed like I had the perfect life. Workin\u2019 the land that\u2019s been in my family for a couple generations. Livin\u2019 in a house with my brother and my cousin. We had damn wild times. Lots of women, lots of booze, no regrets. We enjoyed the hell out of our bad-boy, love \u2019em and leave \u2019em reputations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women you were with didn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. They wanted braggin\u2019 rights for bangin\u2019 a McKay. Or two. The more adventurous chickies?</p> <p>We\u2019d invite them to get really wild. Threesomes, foursomes, you name it, we did it.\u201d</p><p>She thought back to his mother Kimi\u2019s comment that Kane had horrible taste in women. \u201cSo those were the women you...loved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved \u2019em when I was with them. Afterward? Sometimes I couldn\u2019t even remember the woman\u2019s name. How\u2019s that for true love?\u201d</p><p>Ginger wondered if Kane was trying to shock her.</p><p>\u201cDisgusted yet?\u201d he said with an edge.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened that made you change. Was it intentional? And if not, do you regret being forced to accept the change? From what I\u2019ve seen of you, you\u2019re not that same guy hustling to get laid all the time.\u201d</p><p>Kane kissed the top of her head. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot runnin\u2019 out of here screamin\u2019 about my raunchy past. Then again, you ain\u2019t exactly up to runnin\u2019, are you?\u201d</p> <p>Ginger poked him in the rib.</p><p>\u201cPart of the change was intentional. For a year before Colt went into rehab, I knew he was outta control, bad kind of outta control. I couldn\u2019t do nothin\u2019 about him blowin\u2019 off his ranch responsibilities, but I figured if I went everywhere with him during prime bar cruisin\u2019 hours, I could at least keep an eye on him. Bastard got damn wily at ditchin\u2019 me. Then our cousin Dag died and I totally fucked up things between Kade and Skylar.</p><p>\u201cWithin a two-month period my life changed dramatically. Kade left for almost a year to head up a grazing experiment on a new stretch of land we\u2019d bought. Colt quit drinkin\u2019 and whorin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you quit too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am. The changes in their lives forced me to change. Might make me sound like a simpleton, but I wouldn\u2019t have done it on my own. Guess I\u2019ve always been more of a follower than a leader when it comes to that kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>Ginger couldn\u2019t tell whether or not it bothered him. She ran her fingers down his arm.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s something I\u2019ve never told anyone. The biggest turning point in my life was the night I watched a guy beat the shit out of my brother because he thought Kade was me.\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence passed.</p> <p>\u201cBein\u2019 a self-centered prick, I never realized how many times that\u2019d happened to my brother. He\u2019d been forced to deal with my messes our whole lives because we were born with the same face. Probably sounds stupid, but right after that? I grew a mustache and a beard, shaved most my hair off and tried to set us apart. Not for my sake, for his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that also when you changed your name?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cJesus. What was my mother thinkin\u2019? Naming identical twins Kane and Kade? And it don\u2019t help matters that Uncle Carson\u2019s boys all start with \u2018C\u2019. It was like they purposely set out to confuse everyone. Anyway, the name Buck didn\u2019t stick. Pissed my mama off good, too, that I tried to change it.</p><p>Kade, Colt and Keely thought callin\u2019 me Buck was hysterical. But only the kids call me that now. Mostly because of that movie Uncle Buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, those kids can\u2019t possibly confuse you with John Candy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that was downright sweet. When Colt built his own house and Cam offered to buy the Boars Nest, it was another decision I went along with. I bought a trailer and got me a dog, which I\u2019m pretty sure in the world of bachelors, is equal to single women havin\u2019 cats.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cThen Kade startin\u2019 havin\u2019 kids, and it seemed all my McKay cousins paired off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. To combat the extra time on my hands since I wasn\u2019t out carousing, I took on more responsibilities at the ranch. Helped my other McKay cousins expand. And I joined up with the Little Buddies program, which is one of the best things I ever did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Ginger wanted to tell him how much his presence influenced her son. How she appreciated Kane not trying to make Hayden into a mini-me, how he\u2019d played on Hayden\u2019s strengths, not exploiting Hayden\u2019s weaknesses.</p><p>They remained twined together, lost in thought.</p><p>Kane\u2019s mouth connected with her ear. \u201cIf you could do anything right now, what would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. Sit up. Hold tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d she said to his nicely muscled back.</p><p>Kane reappeared holding a garbage bag and a roll of packing tape.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely. I can make your cast leak proof. But that ain\u2019t what worries me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat worries you?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to her shoulder. \u201cYou usin\u2019 your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful when I\u2019m washing my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess maybe you don\u2019t understand, but you won\u2019t be takin\u2019 this shower alone.\u201d</p><p>Her hormones, which had been lazing like a sated cat, leapt to attention.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna take a shower, and I wanna play some water games with you. Sounds like a perfect way for us both to get what we want.\u201d Kane slipped the garbage bag around her cast. He did some twisty thing with the tape, wrapping and rewrapping the plastic. More taping. Then he looked up at her. \u201cLet\u2019s test \u2019er out and see if she\u2019s water tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut first...\u201d Kane tugged on the ponytail holder, releasing her hair. It fluffed around her head like an angry red cloud. She was about to apologize for her appearance, when he murmured, \u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>Ginger wiggled until she sat on the side of the bed, cast on the floor and her bum arm dangling by her side. \u201cI look ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you look hot as hell,\u201d Kane corrected.</p><p>\u201cSilver-tongued cowboy.\u201d</p><p>He moved in front of her. She leaned forward and placed a kiss on the bulge tenting his boxers out.</p><p>He sucked in a breath. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already wet when you look at me like that, Kane.\u201d</p><p>Although his grin was quick and playful, his eyes smoldered. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a bit of a silver tongue yourself, counselor.\u201d</p><p>In the bathroom, Kane dropped his boxers and climbed into the shower. Once he had the water settings where he wanted them, he held her steady as she stepped into the tub.</p><p>As soon as the curtain closed, Kane\u2019s mouth devoured hers. The need ignited between them. Ginger was surprised steam didn\u2019t rise off her body wherever his greedy hand roved.</p><p>Water pounded on her back as Kane kissed her, and kissed her, bringing the kiss to a level of passion where she thought of nothing but his lips, his tongue, his mouth. The synchronized beating of their hearts.</p><p>She whimpered when he tore his mouth free and buried his face in her neck.</p><p>\u201cGod. Ginger. I\u2014\u201d His labored breathing flowed across her wet skin, causing her to shiver. His entire body was rigid\u2014not just his hard cock digging into her abdomen.</p><p>Finally, after holding her as if he couldn\u2019t bear to let her go, he lifted his head and kissed her softly on the lips. \u201cSorry. Just needed a second to get control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. In fact\u2014\u201d she walked her fingers up his chest, \u201c\u2014your \u2018my way or the highway\u2019</p><p>attitude really does it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><p>He gifted her with his devastating grin. \u201cI\u2019ll give that idea a full test drive later. For now...how about if you let me wash your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Kane turned her. \u201cBe easiest if you brace your hand on the wall.\u201d He placed her palm above the soap dish. \u201cNow tilt your head back and close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Warm water cascaded down her scalp, soaking her hair completely. Droplets hit the plastic covering her cast, making dull splat splat splat sounds. Then Kane\u2019s big, strong hands were gently massaging her scalp, surrounding them with the sweet scent of her lavender shampoo. Soapsuds flowed down her back, over her buttocks and the outside of her legs.</p><p>He rinsed. He even repeated.</p><p>\u201cI need conditioner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know sugar. I\u2019ve got it right here.\u201d He smoothed it through her hair from roots to the tips. \u201cTurn around.\u201d He pressed her back against the wall. \u201cNow where else do you need scrubbed while we\u2019re lettin\u2019</p><p>the conditioner set?\u201d</p><p>Ask him.</p><p>Don\u2019t be an idiot.</p><p>Kane leaned closer. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>A blush crept up her neck. \u201cI need to shave. And if I attempted it with my left hand, I\u2019ll just cut myself.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cCan\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was waiting for her to ask him. \u201cEven though it might be kind of weird...would you mind shaving my legs and my underarms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere. Askin\u2019 me for help wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He smooched her wrinkled nose. \u201cSuck it up. Lift your left arm above your head.\u201d</p><p>Kane circled her wrist with one hand and soaped her armpit with the other. His concentration was absolute as he passed the blade across her skin. Once. Twice. Three times. He held the razor under the shower spray. Then he cupped her right elbow and held her arm out chicken wing style. More soap, three quick passes with the razor and her underarms were smooth again.</p><p>\u201cLegs next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d But the suds his hands created were mesmerizing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He noticed her focus was on his hands on her tits. \u201cI figured I\u2019d give you the whole body treatment.</p><p>You know. Makin\u2019 sure you were clean everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to soap up my tits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d He started on her neck and quickly moved across her clavicle and shoulders. Then he coated his hands with more suds and swept them over her breasts. Under her breasts.</p><p>Cupping and squeezing. Rasping his thumbs across the beaded tips of her nipples. Over and over.</p><p>Ginger watched him. The absolute lust in his eyes as his slippery hands mapped every inch and curve of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou have the greatest tits I\u2019ve ever seen. Just so damn perfect. Responsive.\u201d He pinched the left nipple a little harder than she was used to and looked at her to gauge her reaction.</p><p>The initial sharp sting mellowed into a delicious heat. \u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It surprised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever worn nipple clamps?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>While he talked, he continued lathering every inch of her breasts. \u201cI\u2019d like to get them hard with my mouth and put clamps on. The kind with the chain between them. Then I\u2019d fuck you. Slowly. Every so often I\u2019d yank on the chain. When you were ready to come, I\u2019d remove the clamp and suck hard until all the blood returned. Suck until you came again. Then I\u2019d do the same thing to the other side.\u201d</p><p>A rush of moisture trickled from between her thighs. Moisture that owed nothing to water from the shower. \u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Kane\u2019s dark eyes searched hers. \u201cThere\u2019s so much I wanna do to you, Red. I wanna make you forget every man\u2019s touch but mine.\u201d He kissed her again, with the brutal intensity that stole her sanity.</p><p>Then just as quickly, he backed away. He snagged the handheld shower and rinsed her; his gaze tracked the rivulets of soap.</p><p>Her stomach cartwheeled when he dropped to his knees and the stubble of his closely shorn head brushed her belly.</p><p>\u201cHold still. I\u2019ve never shaved a woman\u2019s legs before and I don\u2019t wanna cut you.\u201d</p><p>Right. He was down there to shave her legs. Not to bury his face in her pussy.</p><p>Ginger\u2019s whole body became a mass of goose bumps as his hands stroked her legs. She even forgot her embarrassment about being hairy. The plastic wrap around her cast rattled as he maneuvered the razor above it.</p><p>\u201cThere. Done.\u201d He rinsed her legs. As he stood to replace the handheld showerhead in the base on the wall, he looked at it, then her. \u201cDo you ever get yourself off with this?\u201d</p><p>Dammit. She was a thirty-seven-year-old woman. She wasn\u2019t supposed to blush.</p> <p>Kane crowded her. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you use the pulsing option full blast on your clit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If I\u2019m getting myself off, I want it to happen as fast as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buildup?\u201d he asked silkily. \u201cNo teasin\u2019, enjoying the feel of the warm water flowing over your cunt, makin\u2019 it wetter? Softer?\u201d</p><p>Her pulse raced. Was there a question in there?</p><p>\u201cAre you wet right now, Ginger? After havin\u2019 my hands all over you? After me tellin\u2019 you all the raunchy things I wanna do to you? After havin\u2019 my mouth\u2014\u201d he placed his lips on her ear, \u201c\u2014this close to that sweet, sweet pussy?\u201d</p><p>His deep, husky voice zinged in an electric current as if she\u2019d stepped on a high wire. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open when Kane was on his knees again. He uttered a harsh, \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d The instant she gave him enough room, his mouth was on her.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d His thumbs traced the shape of her sex from the top of her pubic bone through the slick folds to her opening. His tongue darted inside. Again and again. Kane lapped and licked and sucked.</p><p>Biting. Growling. He fucked his tongue into her channel so deep she felt the press of his teeth into her tender tissues.</p><p>Ginger\u2019s legs shook. Her skin was on fire.</p><p>Kane retreated, rubbing his beard across her upper thighs, the rise of her pubic bone, the curve of her hip.</p><p>She glanced down at him.</p><p>He licked his lips and smiled naughtily. \u201cGuess I was wrong. You are wet. Wet and soft and tasty. I\u2019m gonna need another bite or two to tide me over until I fuck you.\u201d Then he bent his head again and ravaged her with his mouth.</p><p>But this time he also used his hands. This time he slid his thumb into her pussy as the fingers of his other hand held open the flesh above her clit so he could suck on it unimpeded. His thumb slipped in and out of her cunt, and he added another finger. Two, three, four times those digits plunged deep while he teasingly nibbled on her clit.</p><p>She wanted to beg him to hurry, but Ginger suspected it\u2019d spur him to slow down even more. So she bit her lip, closed her eyes and let herself go, giving her pleasure over to him.</p><p>Kane sensed her surrender. He stopped tonguing her long enough to say, \u201cGood girl.\u201d His thumb slipped back into her pussy, and his index finger, wet with her juices, began to stroke the bud of her anus.</p><p>Lightly. Then persistently.</p><p>Her orgasm hovered close enough to taste.</p><p>He made a feral, snarling noise that vibrated against her sensitive tissues. His mouth suctioned to her clit and he sucked strongly as his finger slipped into her ass.</p><p>That bite of pain gave away to indescribable pleasure as he thrust the two digits in and out, pressing his thumb and finger together on the thin wall separating the two passages.</p><p>Ginger screamed as the climax overtook her. Every part of her body, her clitoris throbbed against Kane\u2019s flickering tongue. Her internal muscles clamped down on his fingers, trying to bring them deeper into her body with each clenching pulse. Her nipples tightened, as if suckled by phantom mouths. The orgasm drew the breath from her lungs.</p><p>And still Kane didn\u2019t let up.</p><p>She should\u2019ve pushed his head away, needing a break from the consuming sensitivity. But he remained in place. Sucking her. Fucking her pussy and her ass with his fingers. Rebuilding that ball of sexual energy until her skin prickled and another orgasm slammed into her.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God. Yes. Yes!\u201d She thrashed, against him, against the wall, unable to hold still. A slight tinge of pain reminded her of her bum arm. Her hand landed on Kane\u2019s head as she pressed his face into her needy cunt.</p><p>The blood quit pounding in her head, her ears, her nipples. Between her legs. The haze of pleasure cleared, but didn\u2019t fade completely.</p><p>Ginger glanced down at his dark crown. He\u2019d pressed his forehead into her lower belly. His breathing stuttered across her wet skin.</p><p>Kane looked up at her, fire in his eyes. Without a word he removed his fingers lodged within her body. He stood. He placed a soft kiss on the section of her skin where neck met shoulder. Holding her by the waist, he turned her around to face the short wall. \u201cBend over.\u201d</p><p>Any relaxation she\u2019d attained vanished when Kane layered his muscled body to hers. He put his knee between her legs and widened her stance, canting her hips to his liking.</p><p>Kane\u2019s chest felt like an electric blanket pressing on her back. He trailed firm-lipped kisses up her nape. The head of his cock nudged her pussy. Then he rocked his hips and filled her with a single stroke.</p><p>His impatience was arousing. Ginger gasped with his every forceful thrust. All the way out, all the way back in. Hard. Fast. Without pause.</p><p>He\u2019d curled his hands around her hips. Even in his lust filled state, he showed his concern for her injury. Which was sweet.</p><p>But that was the only sweet thing about Kane McKay right now. Sounds of flesh slapping flesh, his guttural noises, the splash of water around their ankles, spun Ginger into distorted reality. That familiar sensation bloomed in her core. No. She couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d just had the two best orgasms of her life\u2014back to back. There was no way she could come again.</p><p>Was there?</p><p>The pressure of Kane\u2019s fingers on her hips increased and he switched to short, shallow jabs.</p><p>When Ginger felt his cock go harder yet inside her, she bore down and he flew apart. Ramming into her without care or concern.</p><p>His hips kept moving as he muttered. After he slowed and stilled, he slumped across her back, breathing hard, still lodged inside her.</p><p>Although he couldn\u2019t see it, she permitted a smug smile.</p><p>Kane pushed her hair aside to sink his teeth into the back of her neck.</p><p>She held very, very still. She\u2019d sworn she\u2019d seen or read something about the neck biting in the aftermath of mating as a mark to ward off other males.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cWe still need to rinse your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the water has gone cold by now.\u201d</p><p>Kane took a step back and returned with the showerhead. \u201cTilt your head back. I see your hair flowing down your back and your ass at that sexy angle. Christ, Red. You make such a goddamn pretty picture, it almost makes me hard again.\u201d</p><p>His hot words washed over her, warming her as thoroughly as the lukewarm water that flowed through her hair. She pushed upright and turned to see Kane scrubbing his head with one hand and his body with the other. He grinned. \u201cSee? I\u2019m pretty low maintenance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you look damn fine all the time.\u201d</p><p>He placed a dot of soap on her nose.</p><p>Kane made her stay in the shower until he\u2019d toweled off. He dried her off, removed the plastic from the cast and even combed her hair.</p><p>One thing he didn\u2019t do? Help her get dressed. He informed her he intended to have her at least once more before the school bus pulled up. Getting dressed was pointless.</p><p>When Ginger yawned, he tucked her in bed and told her to rest up while he fixed lunch.</p><p>Sex. More sex. Snuggling. A shower complete with multiple orgasms? Now food served by the virile cowboy who\u2019d also served up the delicious orgasms?</p><p>In her estimation, days didn\u2019t get much better than this.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>After five days of looking after Ginger and Hayden, Kane was at loose ends.</p><p>During Ginger\u2019s nap, after their mind-blowing shower, he\u2019d rounded up Hayden and Dash\u2019s dirty clothes. He\u2019d washed four loads of laundry. He\u2019d fixed lunch and organized leftovers for supper. He\u2019d loaded the dishwasher. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he hadn\u2019t minded a bit. In fact, he would\u2019ve done more if he could. Might make him a pussy, or at least as domesticated as a house cat, but he liked talking care of her.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d sat down to read the paper, Ginger had woken up. Upon seeing her sleep-tousled hair, her drowsy smile and all that naked freckled skin, he\u2019d wanted her again.</p><p>And he\u2019d had her again. A bit less frenzied than the first three times, but the sexual heat erupting between them was astounding. He\u2019d suspected Ginger would be an earthy, lusty lover once she\u2019d become comfortable with his sexual demands and she definitely hadn\u2019t disappointed.</p> <p>He had been disappointed this morning when he\u2019d driven Ginger to work, wishing they could have a few more days together. But Ginger distanced herself from him the instant she\u2019d donned that severe black business suit. She\u2019d insisted on walking up the stairs to her office unaided. She\u2019d dismissed his concerns that she wasn\u2019t up to a full day of work. Even with her receptionist, Rissa, at her disposal, Kane knew Ginger wouldn\u2019t ask for help until it was too late. Then she\u2019d politely rejected his offer to take her to Doc Monroe\u2019s for her follow up visit and showed him the door.</p><p>It sucked. Kane was flat out crazy about the woman. And he hadn\u2019t a clue what he could do about it except show a little patience.</p><p>Luckily time was one thing he had plenty of.</p><p>Nine Days Later...</p><p>Another quiet Friday night. Kane sipped a cup of coffee liberally laced with Jameson whiskey and stared at some nameless comedy on the boob tube. He was fried. They\u2019d spent all day rounding up strays.</p> <p>Most had been eager to rejoin the herd after the small blizzard had separated them the day before. A few older sows had gone to their favorite birthing spots, which worried him. They weren\u2019t set to start calving for another month.</p><p>The driving wind and blowing snow had taken it out of him. After spending the day with Kade crisscrossing the land on four-wheelers, he\u2019d been damn tempted to burrow under the covers until morning.</p><p>Shep growled in his sleep and Kane automatically patted the dog\u2019s head. Shep had refused to venture into the frigid weather. Kane looked at the Border collie, concerned by his lethargy in recent weeks. Kade mentioned Shep hadn\u2019t been his usual sparky self with the girls over the long weekend. And this morning, the dog that lived to chase stray cows hadn\u2019t moved from the sofa when Kane called him. Shep wasn\u2019t a pup, but he\u2019d never seen the dog so sluggish. He ruffled Shep\u2019s ears. \u201cMust be the weather, eh?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d begun to drift off when his cell phone rang. Never fucking failed. He\u2019d left messages with his cousins about canceling their poker game, but one of them was probably calling to harass him. He answered without looking at the caller ID. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna whine about poker night. Save it. I\u2019m draggin\u2019</p><p>ass tonight and don\u2019t feel like losin\u2019 a pile of money. Catch me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a unique way to answer the phone.\u201d</p> <p>Shit. Not his one of his cousins. \u201cSorry, Dash. Been a long damn day and I was half-asleep. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo things. Hayden couldn\u2019t remember what time the workshop started tomorrow and I can\u2019t find the flyer with the information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt starts at ten. Does he still need me to pick him up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, since it\u2019s not like I can hop into my Mercedes and get him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of... That is one sweet ride.\u201d Far as Kane knew, the SL500 Mercedes Ginger drove used to belong to Dash. \u201cHow fast will it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had it up to one forty the last time I cut loose.\u201d</p><p>Kane whistled. \u201cNice. As much as I love to bullshit about cars I can\u2019t afford, what was the other reason you called?\u201d</p><p>A heavy sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s Ginger. She\u2019s working herself into the ground making up for lost time after her accident. She hasn\u2019t been home until after ten o\u2019clock the last two nights.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at the clock and saw it was nearly nine. \u201cShe\u2019s still not home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m worried about her dozing off as she\u2019s driving. Could be a deadly mistake with this cold snap, especially when the girl acts like she\u2019s in LA and refuses to wear proper winter attire. Which also made me realize it\u2019s time to change out the battery in the Mercedes, so I worry she\u2019ll have car trouble.\u201d</p><p>The image of Ginger huddled in her paper-thin leather coat, no gloves, wearing fuck-me stilettos, as she froze inside her dead car along the side of the road, shook Kane out of his sleepy state.</p><p>\u201cHas she been out of contact with you? Because I could call Cam at the sheriff\u2019s office and have him start lookin\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I know she\u2019s still at the office working. I spoke to her right before I called you. I hate to impose, but is there any chance you can check out her car and see if there\u2019s an issue with the battery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. No problem. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>Another hesitant pause. \u201cCould you check on her? I\u2019m aware she\u2019s a grown woman, but she pushes herself to the limit.\u201d</p><p>If Kane didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d suspect this was the old man\u2019s attempt at matchmaking. \u201cI can do that. You want me to call you after I check on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If I don\u2019t hear from you I\u2019ll assume no news is good news.\u201d Dash hung up.</p><p>Shep didn\u2019t budge when Kane got up from the couch. He didn\u2019t wag his tail with interest when Kane donned his outerwear. He just blinked his eyes and went back to sleep.</p><p>Smart dog.</p><p>The thermometer in Kane\u2019s truck read twenty degrees below zero. Not an ideal night for a drive. But it\u2019d be worse if Ginger called him at two in the morning because her car had crapped out.</p><p>Would she call you?</p><p>Yes. Who else did she have to call?</p><p>How about AAA?</p><p>He snorted. She\u2019d rather walk home than admit to anyone in town, let alone that gossipy old tow truck driver Barney Troller, that she needed help. Damn stubborn woman.</p><p>The lights shone in her office. Her car remained parked in front. No streetlights, no easy access in case her battery was dead.</p><p>He parked beside her Mercedes and scaled the steps, two at a time. Kane got a little pissy when he walked right inside her office because she hadn\u2019t bothered to lock the front door.</p><p>He rapped on her office door four times. \u201cGinger?\u201d</p><p>Footsteps on the other side, then the door flew open. \u201cKane? What are you doing here?\u201d A stark expression crossed her face. \u201cHas something happened to Hayden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s fine and your dad is fine.\u201d Kane understood he might have to cover Dash\u2019s butt. \u201cI was in town and I noticed your office lights were on. Then I saw your car and wondered why the hell you\u2019re workin\u2019 this late on a Friday night.\u201d</p><p>Ginger lifted her eyebrows. \u201cYou just happened to be in the neighborhood? Bullshit. Did Hayden send you? Or my dad?\u201d</p><p>Busted. Before she flew off the handle, Kane pointed out, \u201cDash worries about you, Red. He feels pretty helpless. He couldn\u2019t check up on you himself, so I volunteered to make sure you were okay on his behalf. It\u2019s damn cold out there tonight. Sub-zero.\u201d His gaze swept over her. She looked fantastic in a figure-flattering suit jacket and matching short skirt the color of coffee. Tan lace peeped from between the lapels of the jacket and her nylon-clad feet were bare. \u201cPlease tell me you brought more weather appropriate clothing to wear home?\u201d</p><p>Those brown-green eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t start on me.\u201d</p><p>Kane stepped closer. \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a sassy mouth. Damn, I missed it the last week.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened. \u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p><p>He fused his lips to hers, stopping her protest. He groaned softly at the dark, sweet taste of her and deepened the kiss.</p><p>Immediately Ginger melted into him. Both arms circled his waist as her mouth clung to his in a kiss that was both sweet and compelling.</p><p>When he went to touch her face, he realized he hadn\u2019t even taken his damn gloves off. He broke their lip-lock and studied her. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff. Doc said I only have to wear it at night. I\u2019ve actually gotten pretty proficient at attaching it myself.\u201d She pointed to her right calf. \u201cThe cast is gone too. No ligament damage. She was shocked about how fast I healed up.\u201d</p><p>Both of those bits of good news should\u2019ve warranted a phone call. \u201cNo need for me anymore?\u201d</p><p>Ginger flirtatiously kissed his soul patch. \u201cYou almost sound sad about that, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He let her think on it for a few seconds before he said, \u201cYou about done here so I can follow you home? Or am I takin\u2019 off my jacket and stayin\u2019 awhile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should take off your pants too,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if I did?\u201d</p><p>The humorous light left her eyes; they turned liquid with pure sexual heat. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d be forced to service your needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForced?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his crotch, then returned to his eyes. \u201cLast night I dreamt of you. We were at some party and you got this...hungry look in your eye, the same one you\u2019re sporting right now. You took me by the hand and led me to a bathroom. You locked the door, leaned against it and started to unbuckle your belt, all without saying a single word.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. Kane swallowed the ball of lust stuck in his throat. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaited until you gave me the signal. You put your hand on my shoulder and pushed me to my knees to suck you off. Then I woke up hot and bothered and pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissed? Why? Because of my highhanded behavior? Or because you liked bein\u2019 obedient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. I was pissed because I was horny as hell. I knew if I\u2019d been allowed to finish the dream you wouldn\u2019t have left me wanting.\u201d Ginger placed both palms on his chest. \u201cYou would\u2019ve seen to my needs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can still see to your needs, sugar,\u201d he said with a silken drawl. \u201cRight after you see to mine.\u201d Kane tugged off his gloves and threw them aside. His coat hit the floor someplace behind him. Keeping his eyes locked to hers, he unhooked his belt buckle. He lowered his zipper. He dropped his jeans and boxers mid-thigh and pulled out his fully erect cock. \u201cYou know what I want.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, she lowered before him. She kissed the head of his penis, grabbing it at the base with her right hand. She stroked, and outlined the flared rim of his cockhead with her tongue.</p><p>Kane hissed in a breath. He about shot his load when Ginger gave him that vixen-like smirk and sucked him to where her hand circled his dick.</p><p>He let her play. Tease and retreat. Taking his full length into her heated mouth while she rolled his balls between her fluttering fingers. He had to clench his butt cheeks together a couple of times to keep from taking over and fucking that sassy, sucking mouth.</p><p>Ginger slid her hands around to cup his ass and stopped. She allowed his dick to slide free from her mouth. \u201cHoly crap. Your butt is like ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you it was cold out there,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She tongued the tip and smiled cheekily. \u201cBut it\u2019s nice and warm right inside here.\u201d She canted her head and swallowed him to the root.</p><p>Kane thrust his hands into her hair, keeping her head in place as a not-so-subtle reminder that he was in control.</p><p>Their eyes met. The surprise he saw reflected in hers morphed into heat. She knew. She handed him the reins.</p><p>He released the tight grip on her head and pulled back, thrusting in, showing her his preferred rhythm.</p><p>This blowjob wouldn\u2019t take long. Between her sexy-ass dominant dream and the fact she\u2019d dropped to her knees\u2014well, he was hard and ready and that pretty much guaranteed he\u2019d be quick on the trigger.</p><p>When Ginger started sucking him harder and squeezing his ass, Kane grunted as his balls grew tight.</p><p>His cock lifted in anticipation of release. Instead of driving deep and feeling her throat muscles working him, he withdrew halfway, resting the sweet spot on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cThere it is. Goddamn.\u201d He let his head drop back, keeping a firm hold on her head so she couldn\u2019t move. Spurt after spurt fired out and he felt her swallow every time his dick contracted. The pleasure was so potent his legs began to shake, rattling the loose belt buckle around his knees.</p><p>Then he felt a humming sensation, which he attributed to her laughter.</p><p>As he eased out of her mouth, he warned, \u201cTwo can play at that game.\u201d He cupped her left elbow and helped her to her feet. His mouth enclosed hers in a forceful kiss. A primitive noise escaped when he tasted himself on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cTake off your nylons. Those ankle-breakin\u2019 heels you prefer are around someplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you take off the hose, put them shoes back on.\u201d</p><p>She ditched the hose and waited for his instruction, which quite frankly, shocked the crap out of him.</p><p>He half expected the lawyer inside her would point out they weren\u2019t in a bedroom, so technically, he wasn\u2019t in charge. He yanked up his pants, zipped and buckled. \u201cSit in your office chair and slip on your heels.\u201d</p><p>Ginger sat like a lady and inserted her feet into the pointy-toed brown patent leather pumps.</p> <p>Damn damn damn. That was one smoking hot image. Kane spun the chair so he could drop to his knees, half under the desk.</p><p>\u201cKane, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHike up your skirt and put your feet on the desk. Just like that. Now angle your hips...perfect.\u201d Then his mouth was on her, his tongue separated her soft, pink folds. He loved how she was already wet. As he licked and lapped at her slick sweetness, his cock hardened. This woman fired him up in no time flat.</p><p>Her hips began to lift and he noticed the death grip her fingers had on the arms of the chair.</p><p>He raised his head. \u201cGinger, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Passion-glazed eyes met his. \u201cWhy? You planning to torment me with that talented mouth, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d He flattened his tongue and dragged it up her wet center. \u201cOn.\u201d He reversed course, zigzagging his tongue back down. \u201cYou.\u201d A long, slow lap up. \u201cSaying.\u201d A meandering flicker of just the tip of his tongue as he made his way to the entrance to her body. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes to what? I\u2019ll say yes to anything if you just make me come right now.\u201d</p><p>Kane grinned and blew a stream of air across her engorged tissues. \u201cAnything, counselor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe what you\u2019re doing is called \u2018leading the witness\u2019 and my God, this time I won\u2019t object.</p><p>Please, Kane.\u201d</p><p>He let his thumbs glide up, mapping the outer swells of her cunt, until they met at the top. He gently separated the pliant skin, exposing her clitoris and lightly grazed his teeth over it.</p><p>Ginger jerked against his mouth with a gasp.</p><p>Then he formed a circle around the nub with his lips and sucked while his tongue flicked back and forth.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m already so close...\u201d</p><p>His belt buckle dug into his abdomen and his cock probably had permanent zipper marks, but Kane didn\u2019t move. He remained fully focused on proving how much he loved to be between her thighs. Her taste coating his tongue. Her wetness dampening his mustache and goatee. And the squeaking moans she only made when his mouth was on her like this.</p><p>Her legs trembled and her hands went from gripping the armrests to gripping his head. \u201cMore. Suck harder. Like that. Yes! Yes! Yes!\u201d</p><p>At the peak of her orgasm, a burst of wetness coated his chin and he wanted to burrow into her completely.</p><p>As the pulses slowed, then faded, her grip on his head loosened and she ran her fingers over the stubble.</p><p>With one last soft smooch, he pulled away.</p><p>The sated, dazed look in Ginger\u2019s eyes made him want to roar, the alpha male who\u2019d pleased his mate. He circled her ankles and put her feet on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be scared of that twinkle in your eye, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late, you already said yes to anything I want, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was under duress,\u201d she half protested.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Kane stood and moved behind her. \u201cHow\u2019s about you move outta this chair and sit on the desk, facing me.\u201d He nibbled on the shell of her ear. \u201cLose the skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I have the feeling I\u2019ll be losing my shirt too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are one smart cookie.\u201d Kane toed off his boots, shucked his pants and underwear and plopped in her chair. \u201cNice. The material feels good against my bare ass.\u201d</p><p>Ginger whirled around after her skirt and panties hit the carpet. Her eyes narrowed on his cock, sticking straight up like a flagpole. \u201cYou are hard again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fault.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cAnd on my honor, I\u2019m not one bit sorry. But if I\u2019m totally naked, you\u2019d better be too.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers slipped under the first button on his shirt. She undid them all and made a disgruntled sound when she saw he wore a T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cSome of us know how to dress for the weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of us like to play with your chest as much as you like to play with mine.\u201d</p><p>Kane brushed a curl from her forehead. \u201cNext time, you can play all you want. This time, you\u2019re gonna be facin\u2019 forward.\u201d At her perplexed look, he said, \u201cReverse cowgirl style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever done it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis position definitely has its charms. Lemme show you.\u201d He turned her around. \u201cBrace your hands on the desk and spread your legs.\u201d He rolled the chair closer. \u201cNow scoot back, that\u2019s it, keep your legs wide. Hang on a sec.\u201d Kane lowered the chair arms, allowing her thighs to straddle his.</p><p>\u201cKane. I\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Trust me. Lift your ass a bit. Damn do I love this ass. I cannot wait to grind my cock into it and feel how tight you squeeze me with those muscles.\u201d</p><p>Ginger looked over her shoulder at him. \u201cI figured you\u2019d like anal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you like everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart mouth.\u201d Then he thrust into her pussy to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cOh Lord, you could\u2019ve warned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve been payin\u2019 attention, not thinkin\u2019 so hard about how much you want my dick in your ass.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cBastard. Stop talking and fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna hafta do some of the work, sugar. Push back into me. Yeah, just like that.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her tits, feathering his thumbs across her nipples. They built a rhythm without words, letting their motions do all the talking. Sweat dripping, skin slapping skin, sighs, moans, the squeak of the office chair.</p><p>Ginger centered her left hand on the desk and her right hand disappeared between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cAre you touchin\u2019 yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need direct contact with my clit in order to come.\u201d</p><p>When her stroking fingers accidentally brushed where they were joined, Kane\u2019s balls drew up.</p><p>Knowing she was pleasuring herself did it for him in a big way. He kept playing with her nipples and brought her upper torso back so he could scatter kisses across her back. \u201cCome on, Red,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cSend yourself over the edge and take me with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, your voice is like sandpaper on my nerve endings. I love that husky rasp. Keep talking to me.\u201d</p><p>Kane pumped his hips and licked the slope of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI wanna mark you here.\u201d He sucked and felt the goose bumps rise on her skin. \u201cWhen I see you all fancied up in your suit and fuck-me heels, I\u2019ll remember this. Me fucking you in your chair, you bent over your desk, touchin\u2019 yourself. No one will know that always-in-control Ginger Paulson, lets me, a simple rancher, have her any way I want. Any time I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake us there. Now.\u201d He sank his teeth into her nape and pinched her nipples hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She started to come. Her muscles clamped down on his dick and he was done. He came so hard and fast he was damn glad they were sitting because he doubted his shaky legs could hold them up.</p><p>Kane placed a kiss on the teeth marks on her shoulder before he slumped back into the chair.</p><p>Ginger emitted a soft sigh. Then she rested against him, wrapping her arm around the back of his neck. \u201cYou were right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout?\u201d He nuzzled her head above her ear.</p><p>\u201cThat position does have a certain charm.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou hold all the charm for me. Doesn\u2019t matter what position we\u2019re in or where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you upset that you didn\u2019t hear from me since last week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI sort of figured. I just...don\u2019t know what we\u2019re supposed to do now, Kane. I\u2019m not ready to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand why you\u2019re wary and want to keep \u2018this\u2019\u2014whatever it is\u2014on the down low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do? And you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>Hell yes, I mind. Kane wasn\u2019t keen pretending he was cool with it, but he wasn\u2019t willing to sacrifice time with Ginger to save the sting to his pride. \u201cI like bein\u2019 with you. You already know that. You\u2019ve got enough pressure in your life and I won\u2019t demand more than you\u2019re willin\u2019 to give me.\u201d Because he wanted it all. He kissed her neck. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out as we go along, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>As Ginger donned her winter clothes, Kane shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t have any snow boots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Every pair I\u2019ve ever seen are butt-ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are frostbitten toes. They turn black and fall off. Then how would you wear them sexy-assed heels you\u2019re so fond of?\u201d</p><p>She waved him off. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Kane counted to ten. \u201cGive me your keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s twenty degrees below zero out there and I want to warm up your car so your damn legs don\u2019t freeze. Plus I need to check your battery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She offered him that smile that would\u2019ve gotten her anything. \u201cThank you. What would I do without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the question oughta be\u2014what would you do with me if you had me all the time?\u201d</p><p>Before he acted even more like a lovesick fool, asking foolish questions, he stomped outside.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>The basement of the community center was absolute chaos.</p><p>Over the past two years Ginger had attended plenty of Little Buddies events, so her bout of nerves baffled her.</p><p>You know exactly why you\u2019re nervous. Two words: Kane McKay.</p><p>She and Kane hadn\u2019t been together in a crowd and she wondered if people who knew them both would notice a difference in their dealings with one another.</p><p>Maybe Ginger had been a bit disappointed last night when Kane admitted he was fine sneaking around with her. Part of her wanted that public acknowledgment.</p><p>Her gaze was drawn to him like a magnet. His dark head was a contrast to Hayden\u2019s blond one as they bent over the model on the table. Their concentration was absolute. She hung back, content to watch them together.</p><p>It\u2019d been a sticky subject when her father had suggested Hayden needed more hiking, hunting, fishing\u2014Wyoming type of outdoor activities to supplement the boy\u2019s tendency to bury his nose in a book.</p><p>And it\u2019d pained her dad to be handicapped because he couldn\u2019t share his love of the great outdoors with this only grandson.</p><p>Ginger had been skeptical of signing on for the Big Buddies/Little Buddies program. She suspected half the single or divorced ladies in the tri-county area had signed up hoping to snag a husband. It\u2019d given her a sense of relief that many of the volunteers were married men. Fathers whose children had grown up.</p><p>Men who wanted to give back to the community by providing a positive example to boys who didn\u2019t have a consistent male influence in their young lives.</p><p>She hung back, content to watch them together. But Ginger wasn\u2019t the only one watching Kane. Four mothers hung on the periphery as their sons\u2019 Big Buddies helped with the model cars. None of the other male volunteers garnered the type of interest Kane did. Because he was sexy as sin and single? Partially.</p><p>But she suspected the other reason Kane held appeal was because he didn\u2019t appear to be paying attention to any of those hungry-eyed women. An aloof man was a trickier target, and therefore, more prized if obtained.</p><p>She supposed it wasn\u2019t really Kane\u2019s fault women flocked to him. He was a striking man, with his dark good looks and easy grin. His Built Ford Tough body was definitely sigh-worthy, as were those stunning blue eyes.</p><p>The next thing she knew, that intense blue gaze was directed at her.</p><p>A delicious warmth unfurled as Kane studied her from beneath lowered lashes. No one else could tell he was watching her. But Ginger knew. When that secret smile played around the corners of his sinful mouth, the smile indicating he\u2019d been conjuring raunchy sexual images, her mind flashed to last night\u2019s sexcapades.</p><p>It\u2019d been easy to let go with Kane. To be the sexual woman she\u2019d forgotten she could be. To hand the reins to him, knowing he wouldn\u2019t abuse her trust. Knowing he was as helpless as she to ignore the passion that exploded between them. Anytime, anyplace.</p><p>And this is definitely not the time nor the place to be thinking about sex with Kane McKay.</p><p>She forced herself to look away.</p><p>\u201cGinger?\u201d</p><p>She spun around and faced Stacy, the director of the program. \u201cHi! Looks like you\u2019ve got a great turnout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than last year, which hopefully means more fundraising profits.\u201d Stacy smiled. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tend to...let Hayden and Kane do their own thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that bad? Is there more I should be doing?\u201d</p><p>Stacy patted Ginger\u2019s arm. \u201cNo, not at all. In fact, I wish some of the other mothers would follow your lead. Some women have to tag along at every event, and quite frankly, that defeats the purpose of the organization.\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s gaze returned to Hayden and Kane. \u201cCan\u2019t you point out the obvious to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ve always maintained an \u2018open door\u2019 policy for our members. Anyone can come to any event that involves their child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis program has been good for Hayden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. And between us, consider yourself lucky you ended up with Kane McKay. There are lots of mothers requesting him as their son\u2019s Big Buddy.\u201d</p><p>There was that flare of unexpected feeling of jealousy. \u201cDo you take that into consideration when pairing boys with mentors?\u201d</p><p>Stacy shook her head. \u201cMostly we have to work around how many boys each Big Buddy can handle.</p><p>Some guys do well with three or four boys. Others only have time for one. Since we\u2019re short on volunteers, our priority is not to overload the volunteers we have. The only solution is to put prospective Little Buddies on a waiting list.\u201d</p><p>The question How many boys does Kane oversee? danced on the tip of Ginger\u2019s tongue, but she knew Stacy couldn\u2019t give her that information.</p><p>She squinted at the table. Another boy, younger than Hayden, sat next to Kane. Her gaze moved to the woman with her hands on the back of boy\u2019s chair. She appeared to be chattering away to Kane.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Stacy said and drifted off.</p><p>Ginger headed toward her son and his mentor, deciding at the last second to cut behind the bank of tables behind Kane and Hayden. That way she could eavesdrop and neither would be the wiser.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, son,\u201d the stacked blonde cooed. \u201cBut maybe you oughta let Kane show you how to paint that stripe a little straighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doin\u2019 a fine job, Lock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him be, Daphne,\u201d Kane warned softly. \u201cMaybe you oughta go get a glass of punch and let us finish up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay. I\u2019m not really very thirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom! I didn\u2019t see you standing there,\u201d Hayden said.</p><p>There went her great eavesdropping plan. Ginger smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to interrupt you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome and look at this. Kane helped with the design, but isn\u2019t it cool?\u201d</p><p>Ginger angled over Hayden\u2019s shoulder. \u201cVery cool, very creative. I love the silver flames. What happens when you\u2019re finished with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a contest. First place gets a big blue ribbon.\u201d</p><p>She was acutely aware of Kane\u2019s gaze on the back of her head and of Daphne\u2019s air of hostility. She glanced up and met the woman\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Daphne sent her a tight smile. \u201cYou must be Hayden\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Ginger Paulson. And you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaphne Martin. My son Lock is also Buck\u2019s Little Buddy.\u201d She draped herself over her son\u2019s chair, closer to Kane. \u201cMaybe now that Hayden is almost finished, Buck can finally help you?\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s eyes never strayed to Daphne\u2019s cleavage, which seemed to have its own gravitational pull toward Kane\u2019s face. \u201cSure. What\u2019s left to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat whole side is messy,\u201d Lock said glumly. \u201cMaybe I oughta just paint over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly this section. The rest is good,\u201d Kane offered.</p><p>Hayden rose up on his knees to watch. Kane glanced up and smiled at him. \u201cHang tight, sport. We\u2019ll get that last stripe on in a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Buck, are you gonna stick around for the after party?\u201d Daphne asked.</p><p>\u201cI usually do. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered if I could talk to you about a couple of things.\u201d In private wasn\u2019t said, but it was heavily implied.</p><p>Ginger curled her hands around the back of Hayden\u2019s chair, instead of into fists. Unhappy with the urge to publicly remind Kane what they\u2019d done in private last night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hayden said, \u201cWe\u2019re staying for the after party, right Mom?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze hooked Kane\u2019s and his blank expression felt like a punch in the solar plexus. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, please? That\u2019s when we watch a movie and eat popcorn and stuff. Buck sneaks us candy too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe always have such a good time with the boys, don\u2019t we, Buck?\u201d With saccharine sweetness, Daphne said, \u201cIf you have other plans, Hayden is welcome to sit with us. He usually does since he always seems to be here by himself.\u201d</p><p>Ooh. Snap.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Hayden pleaded.</p><p>Kane said not a word.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019ll see. Excuse me.\u201d She spun on her heel and dodged kids on her way to the punchbowl.</p><p>Her hand shook as she poured the creamy lime green goo into a plastic cup. She grabbed a brownie.</p><p>Ginger hadn\u2019t attended many of these functions, believing, probably mistakenly, that Hayden needed guy time, whether it was with Kane or with the other boys in the program. Now as she looked around, she saw she was in the minority. Most mothers were here with their sons.</p><p>Did people think she didn\u2019t show up because she didn\u2019t care? Or she was too busy? Did they think she used the Little Buddies program as a daycare service?</p><p>Oh. God. What if people assumed she thought that her participation in the program was beneath her?</p> <p>She\u2019d run into that lawyers-are-idiots mindset many times. Or worse, lawyers-are-money-grubbing-charlatans. Or lawyers talk above everyone else. Even Kane had made a couple of cracks about not being on her intellectual level.</p><p>Normally she couldn\u2019t give a rip what other people thought about her, but it bothered her to think they were feeling sorry for Hayden because of her actions\u2014or lack thereof.</p><p>\u201cIf you have things to do today, Red, I can run Hayden home after the movie. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>No big deal. Maybe not to Kane, but it was to her. Rather than snapping at him, Ginger stuffed the entire brownie in her mouth. She chewed. And chewed.</p><p>And chewed.</p><p>Dammit. It hadn\u2019t looked that big on the napkin.</p><p>Kane stepped in front of her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She pointed to her mouth and chewed. Then she took a swig of the punch and about gagged. She hated lime sherbet and mixed with 7-Up? It tasted like pond scum. She swallowed the sticky lump, but she still had to clear her throat several times. \u201cThanks for the offer, but I\u2019m taking Hayden with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to explain my reasons to you, Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do, when he\u2019s looked forward to this movie day for the last couple weeks.\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she known that about her son? Ginger hated to be on the defensive and her first response was always to lash out. \u201cI\u2019m Hayden\u2019s parent, you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes turned ice cold.</p><p>But she\u2019d stepped in it too deeply to back down. \u201cI\u2019ve been working late nights this week. I\u2019ve barely seen him so I planned something special for the two of us. Besides, it seems you\u2019ve already lined up an after-party movie date with Lock and Daphne. I wouldn\u2019t want Hayden to be a third wheel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t punish Hayden for your jealousy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Jealous? Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaphne is an annoyance to me. That\u2019s all. But you? You, are...\u201d He snarled, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t tryin\u2019 so goddamn hard to keep my cool right now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d what?\u201d she taunted.</p><p>His voice dropped to a low rumble. \u201cI\u2019d throw you over my shoulder, take you home and spank you.\u201d</p><p>The gleam in his eye suggested his idea of spanking would only have the slightest playful edge.</p><p>Something warm and liquid pooled in her belly, despite the anger still lingering in the air between them.</p><p>Kane stepped back and rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cLook. Whatever you decide to do, at least let Hayden stay for the contest announcement winners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, counselor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His gaze landed on her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ve got brownie in your teeth.\u201d</p><p>Damn man. At least he hadn\u2019t pointed out her food avoidance tactic again.</p><p>After a quick trip to the bathroom to remove the brownie evidence, Ginger struck up a conversation with Hayden\u2019s first grade teacher. She ignored Kane McKay, although it was difficult with the way Hayden was practically hanging off him.</p><p>Maybe Hayden had gotten the idea from Daphne.</p><p>Ooh. Double snap.</p><p>The announcement of the contest winners quieted the room. Hayden won third place and a red ribbon.</p><p>Two older kids took the top spots. A lot older. How long were boys allowed to remain in the Little Buddies program anyway? She\u2019d never thought to ask and wow, did that make her feel even more out of the loop.</p><p>Hayden bounded over, waving his ribbon, Kane meandering behind him. \u201cI got third!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. That\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m proud of you. Grandpa will be excited for you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we staying for the movie?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you argue, maybe I won\u2019t take you to Spearfish.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened beneath his glasses. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were going to Spearfish.\u201d</p><p>Neither did I. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Hayden looked torn. He glanced at the volunteers setting up the movie screen and the chairs, then at Kane. Then back at her.</p><p>Kane put his hand on Hayden\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGo on and have a good time with your mom. She mentioned she\u2019d worked late all week and she was lookin\u2019 forward to spendin\u2019 time with you. We can catch the next movie, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks, Buck. See you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive safe and have fun,\u201d Kane said to her and walked away. Back to Daphne.</p><p>And whose fault is that?</p><p>Ginger let Hayden pick out a new model airplane at the hobby store. She\u2019d also bought him a new Xbox game. The kid\u2019s athletic shoes were too small. While Hayden tried on every pair in the store, she browsed the snow boot section. She found a pair that weren\u2019t...hideous. Would Kane be happy she\u2019d taken his warnings about frostbitten toes seriously?</p><p>He\u2019d probably be happier if you owned up to the fact you were consumed by the green-eyed monster today and probably deserved the spanking he\u2019s threatened.</p><p>Why did the suggestion of Kane\u2019s big hand connecting with her bare ass cause her belly to flutter?</p><p>His growling challenge brought out a strangely submissive need\u2014another new feeling for her.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>She focused on her son. \u201cSorry. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I buy this for Buck?\u201d</p><p>The ball cap in his hand was the same midnight blue as Kane\u2019s eyes. Above the bill was a patch that read Superstar! in red, white and blue lettering.</p><p>\u201cHe likes to wear ball caps when he plays poker with his cousins. He told me the luck had run out of the last one. I think this one would bring him good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very nice you\u2019re thinking of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always bringing me cool stuff and I never give him nothin\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d Ginger automatically corrected.</p><p>\u201cI never give him anything, well, except the stuff I\u2019ve made for him.\u201d</p><p>Did Kane keep the Lego cars and airplanes, and robot inventions Hayden gave him? Did he display them around his house? Or hide them in a drawer?</p><p>You\u2019d know if you\u2019d ever been to Kane\u2019s house.</p><p>That jarred her. She knew he lived in a trailer on McKay land off of Highway 14A. Hayden had spent time out there, considerable time in the summer. Which was why it seemed weird she\u2019d never picked her son up at Kane\u2019s house. Kane had always brought Hayden home.</p><p>Maybe it was time she went to him. She owed him an apology anyway\u2014she had been jealous.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mom, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Hayden fell asleep on the way home. Ginger\u2019s thoughts were as scattered as the patches of snow blowing across the interstate. By the time they reached home, it was after eight and they were both starving.</p><p>After a quick supper, she was still restless.</p><p>Her father\u2019s interest in model airplane building had rubbed off on his grandson. They conspired on the best way to start this newest project and Ginger knew they\u2019d be engrossed all night.</p><p>She rarely went out on the weekends. Definitely never just happened to \u201cdrop by\u201d a man\u2019s house more than twenty miles away. She slipped on an emerald green cashmere sweater with a deep \u201cV\u201d in the front that showcased her cleavage. She shimmied on a pair of western jeans. She fluffed her hair. Touched up her makeup. And put on her new sheepskin-lined snow boots.</p><p>Her father noticed her improved appearance, but didn\u2019t comment. But Hayden said, \u201cHey, Mom, where you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut for a little while. Grandpa\u2019s in charge, so when he says go to bed, I expect you to listen to him.\u201d</p><p>She kissed the top of his head. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d She bussed her father\u2019s cheek and whispered, \u201cI have my cell if you need anything. Don\u2019t wait up.\u201d</p><p>Her nerves nearly got the best of her when she pulled up to Kane\u2019s trailer and saw four other pickups parked in the drive. Was he having a party?</p><p>What if one of those trucks was Daphne\u2019s?</p><p>She stomped up the steps and pounded on the aluminum screen door.</p><p>The porch light went on. The inner door opened. A tall, lanky and deeply dimpled cutie poked his head out. \u201cPlease tell me that you\u2019re the surprise entertainment. And you\u2019ll be actin\u2019 out the, \u2018I\u2019m havin\u2019</p><p>car trouble and these winter clothes are so constricting\u2019 fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pasties under my coat. But I can come back later if this is a bad time?\u201d</p><p>The kid was jerked out of the doorway and Kane opened the screen door. \u201cGinger? What the devil are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not good. \u201cSorry to disappoint you. Sounds like you were expecting a stripper?\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cFor Christsake, Dalton, what the hell did you say to her?\u201d Kane shook his head at whatever was said behind him. \u201cIgnore my bonehead cousin and come on in.\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden this seemed like a really lousy idea. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to crash your party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t a party. Just a poker game and...Jesus Christ. Are you wearing...snow boots?\u201d</p><p>She swiveled her toe in the snow. \u201cYes. That\u2019s why I came over.\u201d</p><p>His intense gaze didn\u2019t waver from her eyes. \u201cYou drove all the way out here to show me your new snow boots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, since you nag at me for not wearing proper winter wear, I thought I\u2019d prove that I do listen to you. You are a smart man, who\u2019s usually right, and I am an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Kane continued to give her an inscrutable look.</p><p>\u201cShit. Sorry. Dumb idea. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Then he was right in her face. \u201cYou take one step off the porch, Red, and I\u2019ll tackle you in the snow and drag your ass inside my house by the heels of your new snow boots.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Wow. That caveman growl was sexy as hell.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Kane? I know your mama raised you better than to let a beautiful woman shiver outside in this frigid weather. Come on in, darlin\u2019. I\u2019ll warm you up.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou touch her, I break your hand,\u201d Kane snarled.</p><p>Really Neanderthal behavior. Really hot behavior.</p><p>Kane grabbed her by her coat sleeve and led her inside.</p><p>Four guys\u2014all dark-haired, ranging in age from early twenties to late twenties\u2014grinned at her and crowded around her, despite Kane\u2019s back-off vibe.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ginger, nice to see you,\u201d Bennett McKay said. \u201cYou\u2019re lookin\u2019 fantastic as usual.\u201d</p><p>Kane made a growling noise.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ben.\u201d</p><p>Brandt McKay leaned forward. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna offer my hand, bein\u2019s psycho here\u2014\u201d he pointed to Kane, \u201c\u2014would probably cut it off. But I\u2019ll echo Ben\u2019s sentiments. You are lookin\u2019 mighty fine tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Brandt. Is every one of you McKays born with a silver tongue?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d the cute, lanky one said. \u201cThe more we use our tongues the better we get with them.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cDalton McKay, at your service.\u201d</p><p>Ginger bit back a smile the same time Kane reached around and cuffed the impudent Dalton in the back of the head. \u201cDalton, don\u2019t make me grind you into dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways with the violence, cuz. Do you want Miz Ginger here to think we\u2019re all as uncivilized as you?\u201d Tell McKay winked at her. \u201cSome of us do have manners.\u201d</p><p>Ginger had grown up surrounded by hot guys in California. Surfer types. The All-American types.</p><p>The brooding types. The small town sports hero wannabe Hollywood-star types. But the Wyoming McKays were in a class by themselves. Talk about an irresistible natural charm. Lord. No wonder every woman wanted a piece of them.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of bad manners, I\u2019m sorry I interrupted.\u201d</p><p>Kane said, \u201cNo, they were just leavin\u2019.\u201d He stared at each one of his cousins hard.</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah. Right. Poker night is over at...ten o\u2019clock on a Saturday night?\u201d Ben said, glancing at his watch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of givin\u2019 all my money to Dalton anyway,\u201d Tell complained. \u201cLet\u2019s hit the Golden Boot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cI\u2019ll buy the first round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys do what you want. I\u2019m out. I\u2019m headin\u2019 home,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d Dalton repeated.</p><p>Brandt glared at him.</p><p>\u201cDalton. Let it be,\u201d Tell warned.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck I will. We both know he ain\u2019t goin\u2019 home, bein\u2019s she called less than ten minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Dalton sneered. \u201cForget about her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Both Brandt and Tell cuffed their younger brother upside the head, shutting him up. \u201cThanks for the game, Kane. We\u2019ll see you in church tomorrow mornin\u2019, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out.\u201d</p><p>Amused male laughter.</p><p>Ginger ducked her head to keep from joining in.</p><p>Four men donned boots, hats and outwear, taking their own sweet time, bullshitting among themselves, trying to engage her in conversation, while Kane folded his arms over his chest and glared at them.</p><p>Finally the trucks roared off and they were alone.</p><p>Kane began to stalk her with that look in his eye. The look that told her when he caught her, he\u2019d do all sort of naughty, wicked things to her, without apology, and probably, without her permission.</p><p>Ginger stopped.</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t until he crowded her against the wall. \u201cWhy are you really here?\u201d</p><p>Damn, he smelled good. Even with whiskey on his breath. His body heat permeated her clothing, seeping into her skin, setting her needs on fire. She wanted to lick him up one side and down the other.</p><p>Bury her face in his neck. His chest. His groin.</p><p>\u201cGinger?\u201d he prompted. \u201cAre you gonna answer the question?\u201d</p><p>Question. Right. Refocus. \u201cUmm. I\u2019m here because you were right today. I lied. I was jealous of Daphne. Really jealous and I feel stupid about it because that\u2019s never happened to me before.\u201d</p><p>He offered her a feral smile. \u201cA lawyer recanting? Sugar, you sure your license to practice law ain\u2019t gonna be revoked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you I\u2019m sorry for acting like a jerk to you. And I\u2019m also sorry for the snotty way I pointed out that I\u2019m Hayden\u2019s parent, when you\u2019ve been so good for him, Kane. I see you with him and I\u2014</p><p>\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed,\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t seem to stop babbling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I broke up your poker party too. And. Well. Umm.</p><p>That\u2019s it. I should be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d Then Kane crushed her lips beneath his and rocked her world with a tongue-thrusting kiss.</p><p>Then his hands were tearing at her clothes. Coat. Gone. Shirt. Hanging open. Jeans. Unbuttoned and unzipped. Kane\u2019s hand followed the curve of her belly over the rise of her mound. He slipped one finger between her wet folds and plunged it inside her pussy.</p><p>She gasped, breaking the kiss.</p><p>Kane nestled his face in her cleavage, rubbing his beard across the tops of her breasts. \u201cTake them off.\u201d</p><p>A little dazed, she said, \u201cWhat? The boots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boots, the jeans, your panties. All of it. Off. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to quit finger fucking me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth brushed her ear and he removed his hand. \u201cI love it when you talk dirty. I love it more when you act dirty.\u201d</p><p>Ginger pushed him back a step and kicked off her boots. Her hands weren\u2019t cooperating and she struggled to peel off her jeans. Once she was naked from the waist down, Kane pressed her against the wall again, plastering his chest to hers. His cock dug into her belly.</p><p>She realized he\u2019d only lowered his Wranglers past his knees. But he had unsnapped his shirt so she could run her hands all over him. Thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p><p>The instant she widened her stance, his fingers were pushing inside her again. He fucked in and out while using his teeth on her nipple. Then he pulled his fingers free and held them to her lips with a guttural</p><p>\u201cLick them.\u201d</p><p>Keeping her eyes locked on his, Ginger parted her lips and sucked his fingers inside her mouth. The taste of her own juices on the roughness of his skin sent a spike of desire straight to her core. She felt her pussy soften. Moisten.</p><p>He tugged his fingers free and traced the damp digits down her chin, her throat, between her breasts and right back into her pussy. He thrust harder, deeper.</p><p>The friction only made her eager for the thicker, longer length of his cock to fill her completely.</p><p>\u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth cut off her protest. The wild, desperate kiss had her whimpering, clawing at him.</p><p>Kane\u2019s tongue and fingers slid free from inside her body simultaneously. His hands circled her waist.</p><p>\u201cJump up and wrap your legs around me.\u201d</p><p>Ginger was too far gone to care about him bearing too much of her weight. Those big, strong, wonderfully rough hands grabbed a handful of her ass, holding her in place as his cock impaled her.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you feel amazing.\u201d He rammed into her hard. \u201cWet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>She wreathed her arms around his neck, scattering kisses and little love bites wherever her mouth landed.</p><p>Kane made sexy, masculine groans and grunts as he fucked her like a man possessed.</p><p>Harsh breathing, the scent of sex, the rapid pistoning of Kane\u2019s pelvis spun Ginger out of control. She flew apart on his next thrust, digging her nails into his back, arching hard for more contact on her clit, squeezing her legs, her ass, her pussy, trying to make the orgasm last as long as possible.</p><p>And it did.</p><p>Kane followed her over the edge. She swallowed his surprised shout in a blistering kiss, holding on as he came.</p><p>He slowed his frantic thrusting, then stopped moving entirely, gentling the kiss. Ginger knew she made mewling, whimpering moans, but she loved his surprising tenderness in the aftermath of their no-holds-barred passion.</p><p>Wetness trickled down the inside of her thigh as Kane brought her back down to her feet. Luckily the wall held her up because her legs were wobbly.</p><p>They were both still breathing hard.</p><p>Kane strung a line of kisses from the hollow of her throat, across her jawline to the section of skin in front of her ear. \u201cThat was the very best apology I\u2019ve ever received.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSo I\u2019m forgiven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then some.\u201d He nuzzled her cheek. Her throat. Her hair. \u201cI wish you could stay with me tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe too.\u201d She slid her hands down from around his neck and framed his handsome face. \u201cCome over tomorrow. Eat with us. Hang out with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know Hayden would love to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust Hayden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ginger pecked his frowning mouth. \u201cI\u2019d love to see you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>After they helped each other dress, Kane insisted on walking her out to her car. Just before she pulled away, he knocked on her window.</p><p>\u201cThanks for showin\u2019 me your snow boots.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled all the way home.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>How many times had Kane knocked on Ginger\u2019s front door in the last two years? If he averaged once a week, the number would be over a hundred.</p><p>Why was he nervous now?</p><p>Because everything had changed last night when Ginger had come to him. Her invitation to spend the day with them hadn\u2019t been issued lightly. Neither had her apology.</p><p>And what an apology it\u2019d been. The sounds she\u2019d made. Her utter lack of inhibition. The wet clasp of her pussy around his cock and the greediness of her kisses.</p> <p>Jesus, McKay, that\u2019s just what you don\u2019t need\u2014to sport a goddamn erection when Ginger opens the door. She already believes you\u2019re some sex-starved beast who ruts on her the instant she\u2019s within grabbing distance.</p><p>While Kane wrestled with getting his libido under control, Hayden answered the door with a huge grin. \u201cBuck! What\u2019re you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d swing by, see what\u2019s up since you left early yesterday. You busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Hayden grabbed his coat sleeve and dragged him inside. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for ya. It\u2019s in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. Lemme get my boots off so I don\u2019t track snow all over your mama\u2019s floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get it. You stay right here. Don\u2019t move,\u201d he warned and disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Kane ditched his gloves, coat and boots. When he glanced up, Ginger was inclined against the wall, smiling at him. Damn if he didn\u2019t grin back at her like a lovesick fool. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d Her gaze encompassed his body with blatant appreciation, ending at his black cowboy hat. \u201cSo the boots come off but the hat stays on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to rethink that.\u201d</p><p>Hayden raced back into the foyer, skidding to a stop in his sock-clad feet. He held something behind his back, and wore an enormous grin. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>He whipped out a ball cap. Navy blue with Superstar! emblazoned on it. \u201cI got you a new cap since you said your other one was unlucky. This one looked lucky.\u201d</p><p>That little shit. That little, sweet shit. Kane took the ball cap, keeping his face shadowed beneath the brim of his cowboy hat. Not only was it a thoughtful gift, it proved Hayden listened to him. Sometimes with kids, he wasn\u2019t sure how much they tuned out.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d He removed his cowboy hat and handed it to Ginger. He adjusted the cap and smiled again. \u201cFits great. Thanks, Hayden. My cousins better look out. I\u2019ll be winnin\u2019 piles of money from them the next poker night.\u201d</p><p>The boy still grinned. \u201cCool. So you wanna play my new Xbox game?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Ginger. \u201cIs it okay if I hang out for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Would you like to stay for supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whether you\u2019re makin\u2019 liver and onions.\u201d He winked at Hayden. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making beef and noodles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite,\u201d Hayden inserted. \u201cIt\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d be happy to stay.\u201d His gaze strayed to the living room. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking a nap. Why?\u201d Ginger asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 I\u2019ll challenge him to a game of poker later. See if my new lucky hat can break my losin\u2019</p><p>streak with him.\u201d</p><p>Any awkwardness vanished as the afternoon flew by. Hayden beat him three games out of four on the Xbox. He won seven out of ten hands of poker with Dash, but Kane suspected Dash let him win, so Hayden could see the ball cap was indeed lucky.</p><p>The beef and noodles were delicious. It surprised him that Ginger was such a great cook. The few professional women he\u2019d dated couldn\u2019t cook worth shit. Then again, having a child with food allergies changed everything.</p><p>Dash seemed strangely subdued and retired to his room shortly after they\u2019d eaten. Ginger disappeared for a few minutes as she helped Dash settle in. Kane remembered Dash\u2019s embarrassment the nights he\u2019d stayed here and helped Dash into bed. It\u2019d been no big deal for Kane, holding the wheelchair steady as Dash pulled himself onto his mattress.</p><p>It\u2019d taken a lot out of Dash, so the next night, Kane had just picked the man up without asking.</p><p>Luckily Dash hadn\u2019t rolled out of bed on his watch, but Kane suspected if they installed folding hospital rails, Dash wouldn\u2019t fall out of bed at all. Since Kane wasn\u2019t family, he didn\u2019t feel comfortable bringing it up with either Ginger or her father.</p><p>Hayden yawned and asked his mother if Kane could tuck him in. Kane sat on the edge of the bottom bunk. \u201cSo your mama don\u2019t read you stories before she tucks you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. Sometimes I let still let her.\u201d His eyes looked so much bigger without his eyeglasses.</p><p>\u201cDid your mom read to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she had time or if me\u2019n Kade weren\u2019t in trouble. Truth is, my dad liked to read us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did? What did he read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdventure stories he\u2019d saved from the magazines he\u2019d had growing up.\u201d</p><p>A somber expression settled on Hayden\u2019s face.</p><p>In that instant he looked exactly like Ginger. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to have a dad?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d taken classes through the Big Buddies program on how to address this question, but faced with it now, he couldn\u2019t remember a damn thing on how he was supposed to answer. \u201cWell, since I\u2019ve always had one, I guess I\u2019ve never really thought about it.\u201d</p><p>Hayden\u2019s small fingers pleated the dark green comforter. \u201cYou look like your dad.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Kane knew what was coming before Hayden opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I look like my dad? Because I don\u2019t look like my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who? I was just thinkin\u2019 that you look exactly like her. Especially when you\u2019re thinkin\u2019 hard.</p><p>You both get this little crease between your eyebrows. And you definitely have your mama\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>Nervous, Kane tugged the sheet into a straight line. \u201cLookin\u2019 like someone else...well, that ain\u2019t really a picnic, to be honest. I look exactly like my brother. But neither of us looks anything like our mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is kind of...little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one thing me\u2019n Kade aren\u2019t, is little. Genetics are a weird thing. If I mate a Hereford cow, the ones with the reddish-orange bodies and the white faces? With a Black Angus bull, the calf will have a white face and a black body. It don\u2019t look nothin\u2019 like its mama or its daddy. But it don\u2019t matter none to the mama cows because it\u2019s their job to protect and care for their babies, no matter if they look like them or not. Kinda reminds me of your mom.\u201d</p><p>Relief replaced Hayden\u2019s somberness. \u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Kane brushed the hair out of Hayden\u2019s eyes. \u201cNow, get to sleep. If you ever need to talk about anything, you can call me. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019ll see you sometime this week, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be here in the morning?\u201d</p><p>I wish. \u201cNope. I\u2019m headed home shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, sport.\u201d</p><p>After Kane left Hayden\u2019s room, he slumped against the wall in the hallway. Had what he\u2019d said made a lick of sense to the boy? Should he tell Ginger her son had asked about his father? Or would mentioning it violate Hayden\u2019s trust? As he listened to Ginger doing dishes in the kitchen, he wondered why Hayden had brought it up tonight.</p><p>Maybe it came about because you\u2019re in his house, hanging out with him, his mother and his grandfather. Wouldn\u2019t that make him wonder what it\u2019d be like to have that life all the time?</p><p>Probably. Because as Kane sat at the dining room table tonight, he let himself imagine, just for few minutes, this was his life. A beautiful, smart, sensual wife. A great kid. An old timer to keep things in perspective. The only thing missing in the picket-fence scene was a dog.</p><p>Was it ironic the dog was the only thing Kane had in his life right now?</p><p>\u201cKane? Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Ginger had poked her head around the corner.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Great. I should probably be goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019re finally alone...you\u2019re bailing on me? I thought we could make out on the couch for a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d He towed her into the living room, tugged her onto his lap and smothered her squeak of protest with a kiss.</p><p>She melted into him, running her hands up and down his arms. \u201cGod. I want to touch you everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He dragged his wet lips across the smooth expanse of her throat. \u201cI want that too, Red, but I think we oughta talk.\u201d</p><p>Ginger lowered her head, her eyes connecting with his. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Kane threaded their fingers together and kissed her knuckles. \u201cI want to keep seein\u2019 you. I realize you\u2019re in a tricky situation with Hayden and your dad.\u201d</p><p>Those expressive hazel eyes tapered to fine points. \u201cAre you suggesting we sneak around?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. I want everyone to know we\u2019re a couple and you\u2019re mine. \u201cSneaking around sounds a little tawdry, don\u2019t it? How about if we call it a private preliminary test drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you haven\u2019t had law classes?\u201d</p><p>He slapped her ass hard. And wasn\u2019t that interesting? Ginger didn\u2019t yelp. Or protest. She sort of...moaned.</p><p>\u201cI want to keep seeing you too, Kane, but the issue is where? I can\u2019t spend the night at your place.</p><p>You can\u2019t spend the night here. It seems high schoolish to have you show up after Hayden and my dad are in bed. And as totally hot as it was for you to fuck me in my office, I do have clients show up unannounced during the day. I can\u2019t make them wait in the reception area while we\u2019re going at it on the floor.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d take the floor idea as a challenge for a future hook-up. \u201cBut you get a lunch hour, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI usually eat lunch at my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat you at your desk,\u201d he offered with his best big, bad, wolf growl.</p><p>She whapped him on the bicep. \u201cStop derailing my train of thought with that suggestive tone, mister.</p><p>Keep it G-rated tonight since XXX ain\u2019t happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t. Kane smoothed her hair over her shoulder. \u201cOur nighttime options are limited, Ginger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are our daytime ones, especially since my dad is here during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every day,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThere\u2019s always my place. It\u2019s further out, but it\u2019d be more private.\u201d</p><p>Kane placed a kiss on the hollow of her throat. \u201cOr we could meet halfway and do it in my truck.\u201d</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>Damn her and that charming, girlish giggle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done it in a pickup before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a dedicated, lifelong pickup owner, it\u2019s my sworn duty to show you the kinky pleasures of the flesh that can be performed in a pickup, while tryin\u2019 to avoid bangin\u2019 your head into the steering wheel, and smackin\u2019 your ass into the dash.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all kinds of fun poppin\u2019 your pickup cherry, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Lunch. Tomorrow. Here. We\u2019ll save the truck rendezvous for another time. Will one o\u2019clock work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe here with a hard-on.\u201d He pulled her closer and teased her mouth with his until her lips trembled.</p><p>Then he kissed her soundly and released her. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta hit the road.\u201d</p><p>At the door he switched out his ball cap for his cowboy hat. He rolled up the cap and stuck it in the inside pocket of his coat.</p><p>\u201cHayden was pretty insistent you needed a new hat. I\u2019m glad you liked it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like everything he gives me. He\u2019s thoughtful. Not many kids his age are.\u201d</p><p>Ginger smooched his chin. \u201cYou are thoughtful too, Kane McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be because mine and Hayden\u2019s mamas raised us right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a silver tongue. See you tomorrow, cowboy. Drive safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Red.\u201d</p><p>On Monday, Ginger had been so frantic to get her hands on him that Kane had found himself flat on his back, in the middle of her bed, with Ginger going to town on him like a Pony Express rider\u2014almost before he\u2019d even said hello. He went with it, because hey, there were worse things than a smokin\u2019 hot woman moaning his name and bouncing on his pole until he came. But she seemed to have forgotten his</p><p>\u201cin charge\u201d rule and he intended to remind her on their next lunch date.</p><p>So Wednesday, he brought his handcuffs. At first Ginger balked at being bound, even slightly. He\u2019d waited for her to accept his control by spending several long minutes just kissing her bare arms. Sucking on her fingers like he sucked on her nipples. Once he\u2019d earned her trust and promised not to tickle her, she relaxed.</p><p>Kane spent half their allotted time toying with her breasts, just because he could, just because it made her crazy, made her wet. After he\u2019d wrung one orgasm from her, he straddled her chest and fucked those luscious tits, sliding his dick in the tight valley until he couldn\u2019t hold back. He finished by jacking off on her chest and belly, fighting the urge to roar with male satisfaction at seeing her marked with his seed. Then he settled between her legs and sucked on her clit until she screamed.</p><p>Yeah, the counselor was a little late getting back to the office that day.</p><p>On Friday, Kane had walked into Ginger\u2019s house and saw her naked on the living room rug, getting herself off with a vibrator. After witnessing the live floorshow of her oh-so-sexy act of self-pleasure, he stripped and fucked her, right there on the floor. Twice.</p><p>Then he\u2019d confiscated her vibrator, knowing the weekend loomed without the prospect of another naked lunch. He informed her that if he wasn\u2019t getting off, neither was she.</p><p>Lunch was becoming his favorite part of the day.</p><p>When five o\u2019clock rolled around the following Friday, Ginger gathered her paperwork and separated the piles into appropriate folders.</p><p>A knock sounded and her assistant, Rissa, poked her head in. \u201cI\u2019m going. Need anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Have a great weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>She sagged deeper into her chair. She had another splitting headache. The other symptoms had been building all week and she faced the truth. The little sniffle she\u2019d noticed last weekend wasn\u2019t a simple cold; it\u2019d morphed into a full-blown sinus infection.</p><p>She\u2019d never suffered from allergies as a kid, nor as an adult, and she\u2019d gone through the various allergy tests along with Hayden, mostly to allay his fears that the tests didn\u2019t hurt. Her tests had come out negative. Since sinus infections were a recurring problem, Dr. Monroe suggested the dry air and higher elevation wreaked havoc on her sinuses because the infections surfaced after she\u2019d relocated to Wyoming.</p><p>Ginger called DeWitt\u2019s Pharmacy and ordered the two-week cycle of antibiotics Doc Monroe had left on file for her. She was so damn tired. She wanted to go home and crawl in bed. Heck, she\u2019d felt so out of it today she\u2019d sent Kane a text message canceling their lunch date.</p><p>Kane McKay. Lord, that man had turned her into a stick of dynamite\u2014one smoldering look or one heated touch from him and that fuse fired. She\u2019d spent the week in a sexual daze. When she wasn\u2019t in the throes of experiencing the combustible, amazingly hot sex, she was thinking about it. Constantly. After he\u2019d confiscated her vibrator, she\u2019d wondered how Kane would kick up the sexual scenarios the following week.</p><p>Woo-boy. Kick them up he had.</p><p>Monday\u2019s lunch menu consisted of an appetizer of sixty-nine, a position she\u2019d rarely enjoyed until Kane showed her the delicious benefits of mutual pleasure. She\u2019d barely caught her breath from her orgasm while his cock was buried in her mouth, when he flipped her over and fucked her from behind. He\u2019d kept one hand gripped in her hair, holding her head in place, and the other hand curled around her hip, ordering her to rub her clit until she came. His sexual aggressiveness allowed her to unlock a side of herself she\u2019d been too tired, too afraid to access. Kane didn\u2019t exploit that compliant part of her; he used it to take her\u2014them\u2014to new sexual heights.</p><p>Although they hadn\u2019t been scheduled for a lunch date on Tuesday, Ginger had been so...frantic to experience the feelings of sexual empowerment he\u2019d aroused in her, that she\u2019d driven out to his place and surprised him in the barn. She\u2019d dropped to her knees, willing\u2014eager even\u2014for him to take her mouth without any thought to her pleasure, only to his own. Kane had been a little rough, but she\u2019d loved it.</p><p>Loved that he trusted her with a side of himself that was more animal than man.</p><p>And after he\u2019d roared his climax loud enough to spook the horses, he\u2019d taken her into the cab of his pickup. While the heater warmed the frigid winter air, and country tunes drifted from the radio, Kane slowly, thoroughly made love to her. Face to face, as she straddled his lap. He\u2019d worshipped her breasts, knowing how wild it made her, whispering erotic, raunchy words in her ear, across her skin. He coaxed two orgasms from her before he\u2019d allowed another one for himself. As she\u2019d pulled back onto the highway, headed for town, he leaned against his pickup door, snow swirling around him, watching her go with a big smile on his face.</p><p>Wednesday, she\u2019d marked off two hours for lunch. Kane was already in her bedroom, already naked, a rope dangling between his fingers. The spike of uncertainty increased when she\u2019d noticed the bottle of lube on the bed.</p><p>When she saw his wicked, wicked grin, she actually turned and ran out of the room.</p><p>He chased her. His laugh resembled a pleased growl of intent. When he caught her, Ginger gave herself over to him entirely.</p><p>Kane stripped her, bound her wrists behind her back with the rope, and centered her on her bed. Then he kissed her everywhere. The sensation of his firm lips, wet tongue and the scrape of his facial hair was mind-boggling. Every single inch of her skin was subjected to Kane\u2019s questing mouth. Her first orgasm, courtesy of his tongue flicking her clit, hit her from out of left field. The second orgasm built with each drive of his cock into her pussy until they\u2019d sailed over the edge of the abyss together, silent besides their labored breaths, body plastered to body by sweat.</p><p>Without the use of her hands, Ginger was entirely at Kane\u2019s mercy. She missed touching him, mapping those work-defined muscles with her fingertips. Digging her nails into his ass as he pumped into her. Because she was bound, he took extra care to ensure her comfort. He verbally admired the way the position straightened her shoulders, thrust out her tits, and showcased her toned arms. He smoothed and petted her, murmuring erotic words that would\u2019ve been enough to keep her primed.</p><p>Then he\u2019d cracked open the container of lube and said, \u201cThis sweet, sweet ass is mine today.\u201d He\u2019d kissed her while he\u2019d prepared her, gently, but she didn\u2019t suspect that would last long. Kane\u2019s eyes had darkened with feral intensity. His movements were quick. Sure. Demanding. Impatient.</p><p>When Kane determined she was ready, he hiked her hips up. He gripped the backs of her thighs, spreading her legs wide, leaving her balanced on her bound arms and shoulders. The slick head of his cock prodded the puckered entrance. Once. Twice. On the third jab, the thick crown popped past the rigid ring of muscle and he pushed his cock into her anal passage to the hilt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ginger wasn\u2019t a virgin to anal sex, but that first stroke hurt. She bit her lip and held her breath, hoping the pain would ease and give way to that hazy feeling of floating.</p><p>Kane\u2019s focus wasn\u2019t on her, and strangely that didn\u2019t bother her\u2014rather, it turned her on. The visual of his cock balls-deep in her ass must\u2019ve been an erotic sight; he couldn\u2019t tear his focus away from where they were intimately joined. He pulled back, coming completely out of her ass, the tiny hole rippled open again as his entire shaft slid in. And back out. And in again. Harder. Faster. Deeper. And as Kane fucked her ass, she felt a thrilling sense of his possession. No other man had touched her the way he had, physically, emotionally.</p><p>The knowledge freed her. The bite of pain as his hard length scraped her delicate tissues became an exquisite ache\u2014a welcome ache. She countered his thrusts, meeting his urgency. His need. Silently encouraging him to take.</p> <p>His climax rolled through them both, his hot ejaculate burst against her inner anal walls. As soon as his dick softened, he eased out. He scooted down the mattress and circled his lips around her clit, suckling strongly until she came against his mouth.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been much to say after that. He\u2019d unwound the rope from her arms, rubbing until the circulation returned, kissing her shoulders, nuzzling her nape, brushing her nipples across his forearm. He understood the rasp of his body hair on the tips was almost an orgasmic experience itself.</p><p>They\u2019d kept the silence as they\u2019d dressed, even after he\u2019d kissed her with a lover\u2019s surety and a whispered goodbye. She listened as his truck roared off, with her forehead pressed into the doorframe, completely undone.</p><p>Ginger\u2019s cell phone buzzed on her desk, startling her out of her sexual flashback. \u201cHey, son. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming home soon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty quick. I have to make one stop first. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa says to tell you we\u2019re out of cereal and bread. He\u2019s making fish sticks for supper and they smell gross. Now he\u2019s mad that I don\u2019t wanna eat his food, but I\u2019d rather starve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s why he\u2019s mad.\u201d</p><p>As many times as she\u2019d told her father he didn\u2019t need to help out in the kitchen, every once in a while he got it in his head that he could cook. Never mind his culinary skills were limited to heating prepackaged frozen entrees, canned soup and dishing up ice cream. Even Ginger admitted the thought of eating fish sticks turned her stomach. \u201cWhat would you rather have for supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpaghettiOs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving the office now.\u201d</p><p>By the time Ginger picked up her prescription and stopped at the grocery store, her head pounded with such force she felt her eyeballs pulsing.</p><p>Playing intermediary between her son and father didn\u2019t help her headache. Once she\u2019d finished kitchen duties, she downed her pills, crawled in bed with a box of Kleenex and a hot compress on her sinuses and was dead to the world.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Chase. That\u2019s like the fifth hand in a row,\u201d Bennett complained.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m still up more than you,\u201d Chase pointed out. \u201cI\u2019m playin\u2019 smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a professional bull rider, you\u2019re playin\u2019 it awfully safe.\u201d</p> <p>Kane watched his cousin Tell sweep Chase\u2019s cards into a pile. Then Tell looked at him. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>Tell dealt then faced his brother Brandt. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bettin\u2019 on a pair, boys,\u201d Dalton announced.</p><p>\u201cShut your pie hole,\u201d Brandt grumbled.</p><p>Dalton, the youngest McKay of the group, just grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll be takin\u2019 three cards myself, bro,\u201d he said to Tell.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m takin\u2019 two. Kane, bid\u2019s to you.\u201d</p><p>Kane knocked back a sip of his Budweiser. Full house. Threes and queens. Maybe he could bluff his way into winning the pot. \u201cI\u2019ll raise three.\u201d</p><p>All around the table, trash talking ensued between the brothers and cousins. These biweekly poker nights had become a tradition in the last year. Kane didn\u2019t kid himself it was his great planning that brought them together. Things had always been somewhat strained between his Uncle Casper and his three brothers, Carson, Charles and Calvin, hence a strained relationship existed between the McKay cousins from that branch. The original McKay homestead had been equally divided between the four brothers, which meant they were tied together in the ranching business until one of them bought the other three out. With the value of the ranch, no one had that kind of cash, and the McKays were beyond stubborn so the chances of that ever happening were slim to none.</p><p>Uncle Carson had quadrupled the size of his holding, and that didn\u2019t include the pieces of land his sons had purchased. Kane\u2019s dad had added to his original section too, but not as substantially. He only had Kane and Kade to help him work it, not four or five sons. Uncle Charles had added acreage in the last few years when he\u2019d turned over the majority of the ranch responsibility to Quinn and Bennett. Chase returned to Wyoming and helped his brothers when he wasn\u2019t on tour with the PBR. Except it seemed Chase\u2019s Raising Kane</p><p>return home lately was to avoid the tabloids. Kane admitted pride in the kid, for taking the bad-boy, hell-raisin\u2019 McKay reputation to a whole \u2019nother level\u2014a national level.</p><p>But the biggest reason for them spending time together, besides the fact they were all still single, happened after Luke McKay\u2019s death.</p><p>The remaining sons had a falling out with their father, a rift that still hadn\u2019t healed. Uncle Casper had a bug up his ass about something, and he\u2019d further alienated his brothers and nephews. It made for awkward conversation when dealing with ranch business. Especially since Brandt, Tell and Dalton purchased a tract of land on their own. As their father was the only McKay descendant who hadn\u2019t added on\u2014it\u2019d always been a bitter point of contention for Uncle Casper and he\u2019d taken it out on his sons.</p><p>Yeah, they were just one big happy fucking family.</p><p>Kane knew this type of poker game wouldn\u2019t have happened in his younger years, when he was in the same age group as Brandt, Tell, Dalton, Bennett and Chase. At almost thirty-seven, Kane was the old man in the group. Uncle Casper and Aunt Joan had started their family later than his brothers, and had four boys in six years. Luke had been just turned twenty-seven when he died. Brandt had just turned twenty-five; Tell had turned twenty-four and Dalton twenty-one.</p><p>On the Charles McKay branch of the family, Quinn was going on thirty-four. Bennett was twenty-nine and Chase had passed the quarter-century mark and turned twenty-six.</p><p>Why did age\u2014his and his other family members\u2019\u2014matter to him?</p><p>Because all Kane\u2019s male cousins had been married by his age. Most married with families. And he wasn\u2019t enjoying the bachelor lifestyle these days, not like he had when he\u2019d lived at the Boars Nest. Hell, he hadn\u2019t even missed having an active sex life. He avoided the bars, knowing he\u2019d run into a woman or fifteen he\u2019d fucked at some point in the last two decades, usually a woman he\u2019d fucked over. The sad truth was, Kane had been with so many women...he didn\u2019t remember all of them.</p><p>Talk about great husband and father material. Jesus. No wonder he was single.</p><p>His thoughts drifted to Ginger. At times, he believed they could make a good life together. But other times, he wondered why she\u2019d want him long-term. They were already getting it on every chance they had.</p><p>He was already a father figure to her son. She wasn\u2019t looking for security or a provider. Hell, she probably made more money in two months than he made all year. He knew she wasn\u2019t looking to take this to another level.</p><p>And that sucked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s thinkin\u2019 about bein\u2019 on his knees in front of some big biker dude with a pierced cock, wearin\u2019</p><p>leathers, holdin\u2019 a whip.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s focus zoomed back to the present and he stared at his cousin Tell. \u201cWhat the hell were you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Dreamin\u2019 of your new boyfriend,\u201d Tell answered.</p><p>Chase made kissing noises.</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>\u201cFuck off. All of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sayin\u2019...we tried to get your attention, but you were off in dreamland. We\u2019re all mighty curious to know whatcha were thinkin\u2019 about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinkin\u2019 about all the ways I\u2019m gonna spend the money I win tonight when I kick your pansy-asses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it.\u201d Tell pointed to Kane. \u201cNo one raised after you, so show your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFull house. Threes over queens.\u201d</p><p>Bennett threw down three kings.</p><p>Dalton had a flush, all spades.</p><p>Tell showed a straight, ten high.</p><p>Brandt spread out a full house, aces over jacks, and grinned. \u201cKitty pay me.\u201d</p><p>Boos, fuck yous and cards flew. Chase passed out another round of beer. And they settled in to the next game.</p><p>\u201cSo Chase,\u201d Dalton drawled, \u201cwhich buckle bunny hottie you bangin\u2019 this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta ask him which buckle bunny he\u2019s runnin\u2019 from this week,\u201d Bennett said slyly.</p><p>Chase took a long pull of his beer. \u201cNeither. I\u2019ve given up women for Lent.\u201d</p><p>Guffaws broke out.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. We ain\u2019t Catholic and it\u2019s a goddamn long time until Easter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue story, I swear. Since that tabloid shit went down with Vivica, my publicist said to cool it. And my buddy Marshall bet me I couldn\u2019t go four months without sex. So cousins, I\u2019m sittin\u2019 here before you, a man who hasn\u2019t fucked a woman since New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then laugher.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be pullin\u2019 our leg,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>Chase shook his head. \u201cTen thousand dollars is on the line.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dalton\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cChrist, cuz, you bet that kinda money on keepin\u2019 your dick in your pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t a cash bet.

Kristol and Marisol. And here\u2019s the kicker.\u201d Dalton leaned in. \u201cThey wanna play musical brothers. Hell, when we go out, we ain\u2019t ever sure which one we\u2019ll end up with that night.\u201d</p><p>They high-fived again.</p><p>Kane shifted in his seat. He remembered those days. Mostly. Quite a few days, even a few months were a blur, but he\u2019d been in plenty of threesomes with Colt and their woman of the night. Funny thing was, he couldn\u2019t recall the faces of the female players.</p> <p>But he could recount every freckle on Ginger\u2019s skin.</p><p>What did that say about him?</p><p>You\u2019re pussy-whipped, boy. Big time.</p><p>\u201cHow about you, Bennett?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a hook up whenever I want it.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnd gentlemen don\u2019t kiss and tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when are the McKays considered gentlemen?\u201d Dalton volleyed back.</p> <p>Laughter.</p><p>Kane expected the question to be directed at him next, because none of his cousins had uttered a peep about Ginger showing up on his doorstep two weeks ago. And it\u2019d been apparent the only briefs he and the fiery redhead had intended to discuss were the ones on his body.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s phone rang.</p><p>Tell and Dalton exchanged a look before Brandt picked up.</p><p>\u201cJessie? Why\u2019re you\u2014\u201d He stood abruptly. \u201cNo. It\u2019s okay. I can be there in twenty-five minutes.</p><p>Come on, Jess, calm down. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d Brandt clicked his phone shut. \u201cSorry guys, I\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on this time?\u201d Dalton asked. \u201cIs her kitty-cat stuck in a tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd big, brave, Brandt is the only one who can rescue her poor little pussy?\u201d</p> <p>Kane sucked in a breath. Talk about harsh.</p><p>Brandt stiffened. \u201cFuck off, both of you. Jessie had a pipe freeze in her trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have her call a plumber,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Dalton added.</p><p>\u201cWhy you guys bein\u2019 such a dicks about me wantin\u2019 to help her?\u201d Brandt demanded.</p><p>Tell leaned back and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cBecause she\u2019s always needin\u2019 your help, bro.</p><p>And every time she calls, you drop whatever you\u2019re doin\u2019 and go to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun to her is more like it,\u201d Dalton corrected.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to remind you that dad kicked her off the place she shared with Luke? Left her damn near destitute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s the reason we all took a stand against Dad.\u201d Tell spit tobacco juice into an empty beer can.</p><p>\u201cLook, we get that you have feelings for her, Brandt. And without bein\u2019 an ass, she ain\u2019t reciprocating those feelings or else you\u2019d be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke\u2019s been dead a little over a year,\u201d Brandt snapped. \u201cShe ain\u2019t hardly had time to get used to bein\u2019 a wife and then she was a widow. So yeah, maybe I feel guilty for what Dad done. Hell, I feel guilty for what Luke done to her. What am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no,\u201d Dalton said quietly.</p><p>Brandt whirled on him. \u201cWhat the fuck did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. Say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s usin\u2019 you. Knowin\u2019 Jessie, she ain\u2019t even aware she\u2019s doin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>Tell nodded and Dalton kept talking. \u201cIn the year before Luke died, she\u2019d started callin\u2019 you when she couldn\u2019t rely on Luke to get anything done. Don\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s gut twisted. Brandt carrying a torch for Jessie would only end badly. But he admired Brandt\u2019s brothers for addressing something that\u2019d been building for a long time.</p><p>\u201cWe all care about Jessie. But there comes a point where you\u2019ve gotta man up.\u201d</p><p>Brandt sagged against the wall as he pulled on his boots in angry, jerking movements. \u201cMeanin\u2019</p><p>what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her know you don\u2019t wanna be her handyman. If she ain\u2019t interested in bein\u2019 with you, walk away.\u201d Tell\u2019s voice dropped. \u201cMe\u2019n Dalton see how it\u2019s rippin\u2019 you up. Seein\u2019 her everyday... We\u2019re all still hurtin\u2019 about Luke. Seein\u2019 her makes it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor some of us more than others.\u201d Brandt stomped his feet into his boots and clapped his hat on his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Dalton demanded.</p><p>\u201cGrieving over Luke hasn\u2019t stopped you and Tell from getting all the pussy you possibly can every goddamn weekend, has it?\u201d</p><p>Tell and Dalton stood simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cJust cause you can\u2019t get the pussy you want\u2014Jessie\u2019s\u2014don\u2019t mean you can take it out on us,\u201d</p><p>Dalton said hotly.</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of women around here who\u2019d take you on if you\u2019d take the fuckin\u2019 blinders off,\u201d</p><p>Tell said.</p><p>\u201cLike the skanky bar rats you two are screwing on a regular basis?\u201d Brandt shot back. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Jack off all alone in your trailer until your goddamn hand falls off, thinking about your precious Jessie. But I can guaran-damn-tee she ain\u2019t sitting around home, thinking about you,\u201d Dalton sneered.</p><p>Kane intervened. \u201cEnough. Everybody sit down and calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Kane. This don\u2019t concern you,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck it don\u2019t. I won\u2019t sit here and watch brothers cut each other down to the bone just because you can. Just because you\u2019re all hurtin\u2019. Jesus. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019d be like to lose Kade.\u201d He gestured to Bennett and Chase. \u201cI\u2019d bet they feel the same way about Quinn. For Christsake, our fathers can still turn on one another in a heartbeat. Don\u2019t make their mistakes. Don\u2019t do something or say something you can\u2019t undo.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Dalton spoke first. \u201cWill you at least help us talk some sense into him? Bein\u2019 at Jessie\u2019s beck and call ain\u2019t good for either of them. Jessie needs to learn to do things herself.\u201d</p><p>Kane looked at Brandt, slumped against the door. \u201cCome clean, cuz. Do they have a reason to be concerned about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have a reason to be concerned about you and Colt takin\u2019 cheap shots at each other every chance you get? Jesus. What\u2019s goin\u2019 on with you two?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know. They\u2019d never gone this long without trying to patch up their differences. Kane pointed at Brandt. \u201cThis ain\u2019t about me. So I\u2019ll ask you again. Do your brothers have a reason to be concerned?\u201d</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t answer immediately. Finally, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say no to her. The hell of it is, I don\u2019t want to say no to her. I wanna be there for her because Luke never was. I fuckin\u2019 hate that she only sees me as the guy who\u2019ll change her battery, or help her haul feed, or fix her goddamn pipes. I shouldn\u2019t care about her so damn much. She\u2019s my brother\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>No one corrected him that she was now Luke\u2019s widow.</p><p>\u201cYour brothers are right,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cYou have to find out how Jessie feels. Maybe part of the reason she\u2019s callin\u2019 you all the time is because she wants you. Havin\u2019 you do \u2018man stuff\u2019 for her is the only way she can get you to come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think so?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>Heads nodded. None of them really believed it, but they were too conscious of Brandt\u2019s difficult position to point it out.</p><p>\u201cLook, sorry I was a dick. I appreciate your concern and I\u2019ll think over what you said.\u201d He gave his brothers an apologetic look. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p>Beer was consumed in the quiet. Kane changed out all the poker chips on the table for real money, just to have something to do.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was fun... not,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>\u201cGood strategy, bringing it up in front of witnesses when we weren\u2019t out feedin\u2019 cattle or something,\u201d</p><p>Dalton said to Tell. \u201cHe\u2019da put us both on the ground and beat the livin\u2019 shit outta us.\u201d</p><p>Chase looked back and forth between them. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Carson\u2019s kids ain\u2019t the only ones to settle sibling matters with their fists.\u201d Tell drained his beer. \u201cChrist. Brandt and Luke used to get into a knock-down, drag-out fistfight at least once a month.</p><p>Me\u2019n Dalton let them have at and stayed on the sidelines. It never solved a damn thing anyway.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Kane understood that reaction but it\u2019d never seemed to matter to him or Colt. They tended to let fists fly first and then worry about the talking bullshit afterward.</p><p>\u201cWere their fights about ranch business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. But mostly, in the last year, they were about Jessie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell you what. I ain\u2019t ever gonna be at the beck and call of any woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen, brother.\u201d Dalton and Tell high-fived. As did Bennett and Chase.</p><p>Fools. He\u2019d love to be at Ginger\u2019s beck and call. He\u2019d just be goddamn happy if she called him at all.</p><p>It\u2019d been two days since he\u2019d heard from her.</p><p>Dalton stood. \u201cI ain\u2019t really in the mood to play poker anymore.\u201d</p><p>Tell followed his lead. \u201cMe neither. Thanks, cuz. Keep the beer cold for next time, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>Chase and Bennett were also donning their winter clothing.</p><p>\u201cThat was a bit of a buzzkill,\u201d Bennett said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChase, you gonna be around in two weeks?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHitting the event in Memphis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>After he picked up trash and shoved the remaining beer in the fridge, he plopped on the couch. Too early to hit the hay. He snagged the remote and started flipping through channels. About ten minutes into mindless surfing, his cell phone trilled. He looked at the caller ID. It read: private caller.</p><p>Ginger.</p><p>Kane answered on the fifth ring. \u201cHello?\u201d His smile dried. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I told you to call me. I\u2019ll be right over.\u201d</p><p>By the time Brandt reached Jessie\u2019s trailer on the outskirts of Moorcroft, he\u2019d lost the edge of rage his clueless brothers\u2019 comments had invoked.</p> <p>Few people knew about his temper. Brandt took great pains to keep it hidden, as it was an embarrassing trait he\u2019d inherited from his father. He scowled. He\u2019d rather have male pattern baldness than sudden bouts of fury with no outlet besides taking it out on the people he cared about.</p><p>He sat in his truck and counted to one hundred before he got out.</p><p>Jessie answered the door in pajamas. Not sexy ones. Flannel. No lace. No frills. Which described Jessie to a \u201cT\u201d. She still looked damn sexy. It made Brandt feel like a fucking pervert to wonder if Jessie had worn skimpy lingerie in the two years she\u2019d been Luke\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cBrandt. Thank God you\u2019re here.\u201d She stepped aside and waited for him to remove his outerwear and boots before heading down the hallway. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bathroom. I turn on the taps for the shower and nothing happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked fine when I showered yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot water in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did for a while, but now it\u2019s tapered off to nothing.\u201d</p><p>Brandt scratched his chin. \u201cTo be honest, it sounds like a major problem. If the entire system is frozen, you\u2019ll have to crawl under the trailer and see what section froze up and try to thaw it with a torch.</p><p>Chances are good if it\u2019s broken and leakin\u2019, it\u2019s caused more freeze ups down the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her pretty face fell and she absentmindedly batted a stray strawberry-blonde hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I held the flashlight when we crawled under there?\u201d</p><p>Jessie just assumed he\u2019d crawl under her trailer? At ten o\u2019clock at night? With the temp stuck at three degrees?</p><p>Not likely. Not even for her.</p> <p>She\u2019s using you. She\u2019s using your guilt about Luke.</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u2019s wrong is gonna have to wait until mornin\u2019 and you can get a plumber or another qualified professional out here to take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed you could fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fix everything, Jess.\u201d Brandt sidestepped her and returned to the living room.</p><p>He paced in front of the pictures\u2014dozens of them, all of Jessie and Luke. The room wasn\u2019t a shrine, but as far as he could tell, it was awful damn close. Thing was, he didn\u2019t blame her. He dropped onto the couch, too keyed up to relax into the puffy cushions.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a beer?\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cSoda, if you\u2019ve got one, bein\u2019s I have to drive back.\u201d</p><p>Jessie handed him a Diet Coke.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help matters that she sat close enough to him he could reach out and touch her. He cleared his throat. \u201cSo, you heard anything from your dad lately?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cHe called me from some podunk rodeo in Oklahoma. We didn\u2019t talk long. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious. Chase is back for a spell and it reminded me that your dad is still traveling the circuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase does a lot better as a professional rodeo cowboy after just a few years than my dad has in his entire rodeo career.\u201d</p><p>Brandt sipped his soda. \u201cHow\u2019s your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I guess. She\u2019s working at a coffee shop in Riverton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty place, Riverton.\u201d Lame, Brandt.</p><p>\u201cShe invited me to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go.\u201d Pause. \u201cSo, you guys busy at Sky Blue? Or is January as slow there as it is everywhere else?\u201d</p><p>The space between her eyebrows puckered with confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with all the questions, Brandt?\u201d</p><p>He bristled. \u201cWhat? I can\u2019t ask you about your family? Or your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that... it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou prefer to keep the conversation focused on my dead brother? Or whatever chore or \u2018favor\u2019 you require of me?\u201d</p><p>Her face turned as red as a radish and Brandt felt like a total heel. But his brothers had been right about one thing: it was time to fish or cut bait where Jessie was concerned.</p><p>\u201cIf you hate helping me out so much then why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Brandt locked his gaze to hers. \u201cYou know why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Jessie blushed even more furiously. She started to get up but Brandt clamped his hand around her thigh, keeping her in place.</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo. Are you blind?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I run right over here every damn time you call me? Because I love fixin\u2019 wiring or haulin\u2019 shit around in my truck? No. I come here to see you. And the only time I can get your attention is when I\u2019m helpin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about this later. At my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. You\u2019re out of water. I want you to come home with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Awareness of the strings to his offer flashed in her eyes. The color drained from her face. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s past time, Jessie.\u201d He brought her hand to his lips. \u201cI care about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you came all the way out here to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I cut short my poker game because you called me and begged me to come. I had time to think on the way over. Time to get up my courage to ask about you and me...if there is a you and me. Or even a chance for a you and me in the near future.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fairly shimmered with tears. \u201cYou thought that you and I...\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cBrandt, I think of you as my brother.\u201d</p><p>Holy fuck that stung.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine us being...\u201d</p><p>Jesus, Jessie, just say the fucking word.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Brandt snapped, \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine us bein\u2019 lovers?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Vehemently.</p><p>Direct hit. She could imagine him crawling under her goddamn trailer house, but couldn\u2019t fathom him crawling into her bed?</p><p>Grief, so raw and debilitating, nearly doubled him over.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>After what seemed an eternity\u2014but was probably only a minute\u2014Brandt managed to stand. He didn\u2019t say a word to her as he slipped on his boots and outerwear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jessie blurted. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to give you false hopes.\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>He whirled on her. \u201cIf you say it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me, I swear to fuckin\u2019 God I\u2019ll punch a hole in this cheap-ass paneling.\u201d</p><p>Jessie was taken aback by his violent outburst. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna say me. I was gonna say...it\u2019s Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d And again, Brandt felt like a fucking heel for making her flinch.</p><p>\u201cI know. But even after more than a year, neither one of us has really let him go, have we?\u201d</p><p>Brandt froze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset, I understand. I\u2019ve spent the last year and a half upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry? Yeah, me too. Go home, forget about this, and we\u2019ll talk later, okay?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell her it was all or nothing. He couldn\u2019t be just friends and her errand boy anymore.</p><p>The words stuck in his throat.</p><p>\u201cDrive safe, Brandt. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>And Brandt knew she would. Probably tomorrow.</p><p>But he also knew the next time Jessie\u2019s number flashed on his phone, he wouldn\u2019t pick up.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Kane made it to Ginger\u2019s house in record time. Hayden stood at the door waiting for him, his face pale.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awful sick and I thought she\u2019d get mad if I called 911.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your grandpa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s having one of his away weekends...\u201d The boy\u2019s voice broke and his chin trembled.</p><p>\u201cHayden. It\u2019s okay. You did the right thing callin\u2019 me.\u201d Kane shed his winter clothing. \u201cHow long\u2019s she been sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince she came home from work yesterday. She got up when the senior bus picked Grandpa up this morning. And after he left, Mommy went back to bed.\u201d</p><p>Hayden had been fending for himself since this morning? \u201cWhat\u2019ve you been doin\u2019 all day?\u201d</p><p>Guilt colored his cheeks. \u201cPlaying Xbox.\u201d</p><p>At least the kid didn\u2019t lie. \u201cTell you what. How about if you let me check on your mama and then we\u2019ll figure out what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d But instead of staying in the living room, Hayden clutched Kane\u2019s hand and followed him down the hallway to Ginger\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t bother knocking. Ginger was sprawled in the middle of the bed in a skimpy nightgown, but he didn\u2019t allow his gaze to linger on her generous, nearly naked attributes. The tangled covers were an indication she hadn\u2019t been resting peacefully. He glanced at the window. She had to be feverish to crack the window open when it was nine degrees outside.</p><p>\u201cIs she gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she needs to go to the hospital I\u2019ll take her myself. We\u2019ll both take her.\u201d</p><p>Hayden leaned against him, pressing his face into Kane\u2019s rib cage.</p><p>Poor kid. Kane gave him a one-armed hug and moved to sit on the bed. He placed his hand on Ginger\u2019s forehead. Damn, she was burning up. \u201cDo you know where your mama keeps the thermometer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh-huh. Want me to get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Kane watched the uneven rise and fall of Ginger\u2019s chest. Choppy breathing. Flushed face.</p><p>Sweat soaking her skin. He swiped away a few stray tendrils stuck to her damp neck. \u201cAh sugar, what am I gonna do with you? You still won\u2019t ask for help when you need it.\u201d He ran the backs of his knuckles down her cheek and murmured, \u201cI\u2019m stickin\u2019 around to take care of you, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p> <p>Hayden returned and handed him the thermometer.</p><p>Kane hadn\u2019t a clue how to use it. \u201cHow does this thing work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hafta put it in her ear. Probably she should be awake.\u201d Hayden stood in front of Kane and shook Ginger\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>Hayden whispered, \u201cI couldn\u2019t wake her up before, either.\u201d</p> <p>It pained him to do it, but Kane pinched the underside of her arm.</p><p>\u201cOuch. Stop.\u201d She mumbled, \u201cLeave me alone,\u201d and attempted to turn away.</p><p>\u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>She rolled flat, blindly reaching for Hayden\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m here. Just give me a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to take your temperature.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened. She blinked at Kane as if he was a hallucination. \u201cKane?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. Let\u2019s get you upright.\u201d He supported her with a hand on her back. \u201cHold still.\u201d He pointed at the thermometer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it since you know how it works.\u201d</p><p>Hayden inserted the plastic tip into Ginger\u2019s ear. \u201cIs it in?\u201d</p><p>Ginger adjusted his hold on it. \u201cOkay. Now it\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>Click. Pause. Then a drawn-out beep.</p><p>Hayden studied the digital read out. \u201cIt says 102.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so hot. And I can\u2019t keep my eyes open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you taken anything to drop your fever?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJust antibiotics. I get these nasty sinus infections and sometimes I get a fever and sometimes I don\u2019t. This time I did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want aspirin or Tylenol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTylenol. It\u2019s in the middle drawer in my bathroom vanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you a glass of water,\u201d Hayden said and took off.</p><p>Kane shook out two pills and handed them over when Hayden returned with the water. \u201cBottoms up.\u201d</p><p>After Ginger drained the water glass, she rolled back down on the mattress. Her eyes were still cloudy with fever as her gaze flicked between Kane and her son. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout ten minutes. Hayden called me because he was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost eleven.\u201d</p><p>She squinted at the window. \u201cEleven...at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Shock flashed across her face. She looked at Hayden. Her eyes glazed with tears. \u201cOh, baby. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been alone...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. But when I couldn\u2019t wake you I called Buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am mighty glad you did, sport. Why don\u2019t you head to the kitchen and figure out what you wanna eat? I\u2019ll be there in a sec.\u201d</p><p>Hayden laid his head on his mother\u2019s chest. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of you, Mommy. Just like me\u2019n Buck did last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Ginger broke down the second Hayden fled the room. \u201cI am the most horrible mother on the planet.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down her face. \u201cLeaving an eight-year-old boy to fend for himself while I was sacked out in my room? What if he\u2019d gotten hurt? What if he\u2019d locked himself outside? What if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. C\u2019mere.\u201d Kane gathered her in his arms. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. He\u2019s a smart boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Kane, don\u2019t be nice to me. I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d She muffled her cries against his chest and he felt the heat of her feverish skin through his shirt.</p><p>\u201cGinger, sugar, cut yourself some slack. You can\u2019t help bein\u2019 sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m never sick. And even if I am, I can still take care of my kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis might be what you lawyers call \u2018extenuating circumstances\u2019, doncha think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good excuse for neglecting my child.\u201d</p><p>Kane rested his chin on top of her head. \u201cNothin\u2019 I say will ease your guilt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d she stuttered.</p><p>\u201cHow about the fact Hayden played Xbox all day while you were conked out?\u201d</p><p>She made a sobbing laugh sound. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Probably was a good thing he let you sleep because you must\u2019ve needed it. But don\u2019t you dare rat me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She tipped her head back and looked at him. \u201cThank you for coming over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d He smoothed the tiny wild curls springing up from her hairline. \u201cYou hungry? I can fix you something while I\u2019m makin\u2019 Hayden a snack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Ginger gave him such a somber look his heart sank. Was she throwing him out, now that she was awake?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, a little testily.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired of coming to my rescue?\u201d</p><p>Never. Kane smooched both her cheeks. \u201cNope. I like playin\u2019 the part of the brave knight who saves the beautiful damsel in distress. Besides, lookin\u2019 after you and Hayden ain\u2019t exactly a chore, Ginger. I like doin\u2019 it. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? My whole life Kade\u2019s been seen as the responsible one. The stand-up guy. And I\u2019ve been seen as the good-time guy. No responsibilities beyond ranch work. People around here assume I prefer bein\u2019 a bachelor and tryin\u2019 to score with every hot chick...rather than look harder to see the real truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the real truth, Kane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the life everyone thinks I\u2019m tryin\u2019 so hard to avoid. It don\u2019t matter how much I\u2019ve changed...</p><p>they see me as they want.\u201d Kane traced the indent in her chin. \u201cIt means a lot that you see me differently. I know you want my help even when it nearly kills you to ask for it when you don\u2019t think you need it. I like that you let me take care of you. Even when it\u2019s hard as the dickens to admit you like me takin\u2019 care of you.</p><p>You trust me with your son. You trust me on a level no one ever has, Red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never given me a reason not to trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I hope that don\u2019t ever change.\u201d He resettled her on the pillow. \u201cNeed anything before I continue my knightly duties?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and closed her eyes.</p><p>Would Ginger remember that he\u2019d basically poured his heart out? He sure hoped so.</p><p>In the kitchen, Hayden sat at the counter eating a bowl of Oreos cereal. Kane frowned. \u201cI thought I was fixin\u2019 you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>Hayden shrugged. \u201cI like cereal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you eaten today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCereal.\u201d</p><p>Kane rolled his eyes. \u201cFine. But tomorrow, you\u2019re eatin\u2019 real food. No cereal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man.\u201d Hayden looked up at him and shoved his glasses back in place on his nose. \u201cAre you staying over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019d probably be best, don\u2019t you? In case you or your mama needs something during the night?\u201d</p><p>Hayden nodded. \u201cWhere are you sleeping? Cause I\u2019ve got Lego junk on the bottom bunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll crash on the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could stay in my mom\u2019s room. I bet she wouldn\u2019t mind. I wouldn\u2019t mind either.\u201d</p><p>Nice, the other male in Ginger\u2019s life gave him permission to share her bed. He fought a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>When Hayden started to yawn, Kane let him check on his mother before he started his bedtime rituals.</p><p>Then Kane tucked him in the upper bunk.</p><p>Kane cleaned up Hayden\u2019s mess in the living room and the kitchen. He locked the doors and debated on switching on the TV, but the chance to watch Ginger while she slept had a stronger pull than mindlessly flipping through channels.</p><p>In her bedroom he stripped down to his T-shirt and boxers. She didn\u2019t move when he crawled onto her bed. He straightened out the quilt and sheet that\u2019d twisted into a ball because Ginger had kicked them off in her feverish state. He left her half of the covers in the middle of the bed and tucked the other half around himself.</p><p>As many times as Kane imagined spending the night\u2014the whole night\u2014in her bed, he hated she was sick and hurting. He reached for her hand, wanting to offer her comfort, wanting to assure her that he was right beside her if she needed him. He strummed his thumb across her knuckles, content just to touch her.</p><p>She emitted a satisfied-sounding sigh, threading her fingers though his.</p><p>A few hours later, the bed started to shake, instantly putting Kane on alert. He touched her arm to wake her. \u201cGinger? You all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m c-cold. Like I have ice in my veins c-cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fever must\u2019ve broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Her body shook.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere. I\u2019ll warm you.\u201d</p><p>She scooted beneath the pile of covers, pressing her cheek into his chest, curling into him\u2014nearly on top of him. Her skin had gone from fiery to clammy. He pulled her more tightly against his body, trying to stop the worst of the tremors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as toasty as a furnace,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cJust hot-blooded, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn many ways.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, stroking her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you don\u2019t mind taking care of me, Kane. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t think that makes me weak, or clingy or needy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed, you are the strongest woman I know.\u201d</p><p>Kane thought she\u2019d fallen asleep, but she spoke again very softly. \u201cDo you know I haven\u2019t slept in the same bed, all night, with a man...since I was about twenty-four?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t say as I\u2019m unhappy to hear that.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her face on his pec. \u201cYou\u2019ve pretty much ruined me for any other man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>No response.</p><p>\u201cGinger?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d fallen asleep.</p><p>When Ginger woke up alone, she assumed she\u2019d dreamt of Kane cuddled up to her all night. He\u2019d been so warm and solid. Sweet. Comforting. Saying such loving things. Showing his vulnerable side while offering reassurance he didn\u2019t see her as weak.</p><p>Had to\u2019ve been a dream.</p> <p>She\u2019d scooted up to rest against the headboard when Hayden tiptoed in. \u201cMom! I came to see if you were still sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake now. Has Grandpa fixed you breakfast?\u201d</p><p>Hayden frowned at her. \u201cMom. What are you talking about? Grandpa\u2019s in Deadwood, remember?\u201d</p><p>But...if that was the case, who\u2019d been watching Hayden?</p><p>Kane sauntered in and set his hands on Hayden\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMornin\u2019, Red. How\u2019re you feelin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Like a total idiot. Like I lost an entire day in a fever-fueled daze. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t a dream,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>Kane frowned. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I feel like I\u2019ve got cement in my sinuses. My body aches. And I need a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything I can do?\u201d A tiny gleam shone in Kane\u2019s eye. He was probably recalling how thoroughly he\u2019d washed her back, her front and everything in between the last time he\u2019d \u201chelped\u201d her shower.</p><p>\u201cNo. Thanks. I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re all scrubbed clean, we\u2019ll be in the living room.\u201d</p><p>She stayed in the shower until the water ran cold. The steam helped her sinuses. With her hair combed, her teeth brushed and a layer of her favorite scented lotion applied, Ginger almost felt human. She debated on wearing jeans, but chose comfy, fuzzy sweats instead.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d expected Hayden and Kane to be playing Xbox, but Kane\u2019s dark head was bent close to Hayden\u2019s blond head as they worked on a jigsaw puzzle spread out on the portable card table.</p><p>Kane sensed her immediately, leaving Ginger no time to dissect the warm feeling of rightness as she watched the two of them together. He smiled the charming, sexy grin that made her heart skip with joy.</p> <p>\u201cYou look better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She crossed the room to look over their shoulders. \u201cHow goes the puzzle project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow.\u201d Hayden sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t ever wanna put another one of these together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun for a while, but then it\u2019s boring. I\u2019d rather play with my Legos or do something else.\u201d</p><p>Hayden wormed his way out of the chair. \u201cYou wanna work on it?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to decline, but Kane rather chivalrously pulled the chair back. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>After she sat, she watched her son open the closet door and start dragging out his winter clothes. \u201cYou going someplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut to shovel.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck said I\u2019m old enough to do chores because you shouldn\u2019t have to do everything around here.\u201d</p><p>Ginger faced Kane. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, but wariness entered his eyes. \u201cYou already do plenty. All kids need chores so they learn how to do basic stuff. Shoveling was Hayden\u2019s idea of how to pull his weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I\u2019m gonna have big muscles just like Buck.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed behind Hayden. About three seconds later Ginger slapped a hand over her mouth to stifle a giggle. It didn\u2019t work. She kept giggling, quietly.</p><p>Kane got the strangest look on his face.</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love to hear you laugh, Red.\u201d He angled closer and smothered her next giggle with his mouth. The kiss wasn\u2019t a tonsil scratcher, but decisive\u2014as if Kane had made his mind up about something and this kiss sealed the deal.</p><p>Ginger smiled at him and set her hand on his cheek. \u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, shucks, ma\u2019am, I\u2019s just bein\u2019 neighborly.\u201d He turned his head until his mouth connected with the corner of her palm. \u201cNow let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t make some progress on this puzzle.\u201d</p><p>When Hayden returned inside, his cheeks red, his eyes shining, nearly busting his buttons with pride, Ginger realized Kane understood the things Hayden needed that she didn\u2019t, not because she was a bad mother but because she was female.</p><p>How much different would her son be if Kane hadn\u2019t come into his life via the Little Buddies program?</p><p>Maybe you should ask yourself how great it would be if Kane was a permanent part of your life as well as your son\u2019s. Not as his Big Buddy but as his father.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be totally cool, huh Mom?\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s focus snapped to Hayden. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Buck and I went out on the ATVs in the snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be very cool.\u201d She didn\u2019t add, If you wore a helmet and the proper safety gear, and carried a GPS tracker, knowing he\u2019d accuse her of treating him like a baby, especially in front of his hero.</p><p>\u201cYou guys ready to eat?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starved,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cChores really make you hungry, huh?\u201d</p><p>Kane fixed grilled soy cheese sandwiches and sliced up carrots and apples. Ginger stuck with hot tea and soda crackers. The antibiotics upset her stomach and half the time she felt like barfing\u2014not that she\u2019d mention that to either of them. She stayed at the table with them while they ate.</p><p>\u201cSurprised me that Dash is off to Deadwood,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>\u201cThe Sundance Senior Group goes twice a year. Deadwood caters to an older crowd so there are plenty of handicapped-accessible rooms. He has a blast. Plus, the coordinators look after him so I don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder he whupped my butt at blackjack if he\u2019s been playin\u2019 the tables in Deadwood,\u201d Kane grumbled.</p><p>\u201cLast time he was the big winner at the Silverado. He took the entire group out for steak and crab legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa says that\u2019s why they tolerate an old wheelchair cripple like him on those trips, and at the senior center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he has money.\u201d</p><p>Ginger frowned. She knew her father donated to the Sundance Senior Group and to the senior center, but surely he didn\u2019t believe that was the only reason they kept him around?</p><p>\u201cI think your Grandpa was pullin\u2019 your leg, sport. I bet they\u2019d let him go along on those trips for free.\u201d Kane mock-whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve heard redheads are really wild. Ol\u2019 Dash is probably the crazy man of the bunch and the life of the party, even when now he looks like a mild-mannered white haired old man.\u201d</p><p>Hayden\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so, but it\u2019s probably best if we don\u2019t let on we know his secret,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>Her son grinned.</p><p>After lunch, her sinus headache returned. She tried to hide it and act normal, but Kane was very attuned to any change in her.</p><p>\u201cGinger, you\u2019re lookin\u2019 a little peaked again.\u201d</p><p>Lie and tell him you\u2019re fine.</p><p>No. Give him a reason to stay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back to feeling like my head wants to explode.\u201d</p><p>Kane was by her side in an instant, his hand on her forehead. \u201cYou feel hot. You need to take some Tylenol and get back in bed right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I salute too, Mr. Bossy?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you flip me off as long as you do it while you\u2019re layin\u2019 down.\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d taken her pills and crawled in bed, Kane checked on her. Retucking the sheet, setting a glass of water on the nightstand, restocking her Kleenex supply. Touching her. She loved the way he touched her, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 I\u2019ll need to stay another night, since you still ain\u2019t your chipper, contrary self yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He feathered his lips across her forehead. \u201cGood. Get some rest, counselor.\u201d</p><p>Ginger was faking it.</p><p>Not orgasms. God knew she didn\u2019t ever have to fake those with Kane. She was faking being sick.</p><p>Although she still didn\u2019t feel one hundred percent, she could\u2019ve sent Kane on his merry way.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want him to go. She liked having him here.</p><p>After Kane tucked Hayden in, she heard him rattling around in the kitchen. Then the house became quiet. Thirty minutes passed.</p><p>What was the man doing?</p><p>Don\u2019t you mean: what\u2019s he doing that\u2019s keeping him out of your bed?</p><p>Ginger donned a robe and tracked him down. He wasn\u2019t watching TV; he was working on the puzzle.</p><p>His forehead wrinkled in concentration, his fingers sifting through the piles of pieces.</p><p>\u201cYou determined to finish that tonight?\u201d</p><p>Those indigo eyes locked onto hers. \u201cNo. Actually, the more I work on this the more I agree with Hayden. It is boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come to bed.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not up for anything more than us just sharing sleeping space.\u201d</p><p>Kane eased his chair back and stood. He took her hand and led the way to her bedroom. Undressed, under the covers, wrapped in each other, any tiredness vanished. They talked for a good hour about everything from Hayden to TV shows and his large family before she yawned.</p><p>The next morning, while still in the realm of sleep, Ginger felt Kane\u2019s hands on her. Hiking up her nightgown. His lips trailed the curve of her jaw with light, yet insistent kisses. Her back arched of its own accord as his mouth hit all the good spots, spots he\u2019d already memorized.</p><p>\u201cSugar, I\u2019m wantin\u2019 you real bad. Let me have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me? This must be a dream.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sank his teeth into her earlobe. \u201cYou must be feelin\u2019 better if you\u2019re bein\u2019 contrary first thing.\u201d His warm breath drifted across her cheek. \u201cSay yes, Ginger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ginger,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that smart mouth I\u2019ve been missin\u2019 something fierce.\u201d He kissed her, sealing their lips together.</p><p>Clothes disappeared. Kane pushed inside her on a long, smooth glide and her body was ready for him.</p> <p>He made love to her sweetly, passionately. The intimacy of being cocooned in their own little world in the predawn hours amazed her. Body to body, heart to heart, face to face.</p><p>When his pace increased, it sent them spiraling into the abyss of pleasure together.</p><p>More dreamy kisses. More feather-light caresses. He whispered, \u201cGo back to sleep, sugar. No reason for us both to be up.\u201d He headed for the shower as she snuggled into the sheets that smelled like him.</p><p>Ginger awoke an hour later. She saw Kane\u2019s wristwatch on the nightstand and knew she hadn\u2019t been dreaming.</p><p>\u201cAnd then Buck came over. We took care of Mom and we worked on the puzzle and we played some games. And he made me do chores! So when Mom napped we went to Buck\u2019s house to check on his dog and other ranch stuff,\u201d Hayden added.</p> <p>Ginger sipped her tea and watched her father\u2019s reaction to the news Kane McKay had spent both nights here while he\u2019d been out of town.</p><p>Her dad smiled. \u201cSounds like you had a great time while I was gone.\u201d</p><p>Hayden nodded but Ginger saw the hint of sadness in her dad\u2019s eyes. \u201cFor some of us, it wasn\u2019t a great time. I still don\u2019t feel back to normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go in and see Doc instead of self-medicating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. If I\u2019m not better by the time I\u2019m done with this cycle of antibiotics.\u201d She stood and started clearing supper plates. \u201cWho wants a brownie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d</p> <p>She looked at her dad. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>Odd. Brownies were his favorite dessert.</p><p>Hayden stuffed his entire brownie in his mouth and raced away from the table.</p><p>\u201cSomething on your mind, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs what you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason that you don\u2019t feel comfortable having McKay in the house overnight while I\u2019m here?\u201d</p> <p>Her face flamed. \u201cIt\u2019s not that. Kane wouldn\u2019t have been here if I hadn\u2019t been sick. I didn\u2019t call him.</p><p>Hayden did.\u201d She pointed at him. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t get to act pissy about Kane showing up to help out, because if I recall, you called him and insisted he check up on me at my office.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cTrue. It\u2019s just...it seems...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad, tell me.\u201d</p><p>His voice dropped. \u201cI don\u2019t care that you\u2019re sleeping with him, Gigi. You\u2019re a grown woman. You\u2019ve sacrificed your personal life for both Hayden and me the last few years. While I appreciate it, I don\u2019t want to be an excuse for you.\u201d</p><p>Confused, she said, \u201cAn excuse for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you to act like you don\u2019t need the happiness that only comes from an intimate relationship.</p><p>While your mother and I were mismatched from the start, when I met Linda, it was like the clouds had lifted and I was finally standing in the sun.\u201d</p><p>Ginger reached for his hand. Her dad rarely talked about the woman he\u2019d married after moving to Wyoming. Ginger had only met Linda once, but she\u2019d made her father happy. She knew it wasn\u2019t a coincidence that his arthritis had taken a turn for the worse the year following Linda\u2019s death from cancer.</p><p>That\u2019d also been around the same time Ginger had given birth to Hayden. Her father had reached out to her and she\u2019d grabbed for him with both hands and hadn\u2019t looked back. She couldn\u2019t imagine her dad not being in her life.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is I\u2019ve had my happiness. I\u2019d never stand in the way of yours.\u201d</p><p>He pushed away from the table and left her staring after him, wondering if that was his stamp of approval as far as Kane McKay went.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>An unexpected winter storm blew in. Ginger paced, watching the snow pile up outside her office window. At one-thirty she sent Rissa home before the Wyoming Highway Patrol closed the roads. At three she called the Sundance retirement home, making sure they had room to keep her dad overnight. The change in accommodations didn\u2019t bother him; he\u2019d dealt with unpredictable Wyoming weather much longer than she had.</p><p>Hayden\u2019s school field trip to Casper caused her the most concern. The potential for fifty kids and four teachers stranded in an old school bus out in the middle of the prairie? Not good.</p><p>When she heard on the radio that I-25 had been closed from Casper to Wheatland, she knew Hayden wouldn\u2019t be coming home, which alleviated her safety worries. She just hoped he wouldn\u2019t eat dairy, or shellfish, or strawberries. She hoped he wouldn\u2019t run around like a madman and need to use his inhaler. If she could just talk to him, tell him she loved him, tell him to be careful, maybe she could stop wearing a hole in the carpet in her office.</p><p>At four o\u2019clock the principal called and assured her the kids were fine, tucked away in a hotel in Casper. Here she was freaking out and Hayden was probably having the time of his life, hanging out with his buddies with no parents around.</p><p>Still, she worried because Kane hadn\u2019t texted her back. So much of his time was spent out in the elements, in places where no one could get in touch with him. Hopefully he was hunkered down in his trailer with his dog, riding the storm out.</p><p>Ginger had no choice but to outwait the blizzard in her office. She checked the food situation. Four packages of instant oatmeal, six packages of Cup o\u2019 Noodles, half a package of Fig Newtons, two protein bars and a Snickers. She ripped open the candy bar wrapper. Her first course would be chocolate.</p><p>And truthfully, it wouldn\u2019t be bad being snowed in. She had a couch and a blanket. She could work as late as she wanted without guilt about neglecting her family. If she got bored, she could watch TV shows on Hulu. If she got lonely...no cure for that. She spent so little time by herself in recent years she really didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>She\u2019d just tossed the empty Snickers wrapper when a loud bang sounded at the front of the building.</p><p>The strong gusts had probably blown the door open. She left her office and started down the stairs only to see a large hooded figure lurking in the foyer. She screamed.</p><p>The head whipped around and the hood fell back. Kane snapped, \u201cJesus, Ginger. You scared the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? What about me? I\u2019m here alone and then I see the abominable snowman lurking in my foyer!\u201d</p><p>His sheepskin coat was coated with snow, as were the coveralls and snow boots.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, the wind\u2019s whistlin\u2019 a little too loud for me to knock politely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? The roads are terrible, or closed, according to the radio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to get a couple of portable propane tanks in case something freezes. I saw your car and wondered what the devil you\u2019re still doin\u2019 here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Mercedes isn\u2019t exactly an all-terrain vehicle. Plus I was waiting to hear about Hayden\u2019s class, and I had to verify the folks at the retirement home are keeping dad tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo once again you worried about everybody except yourself.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019m safer here than trying to get home. I decided to stay put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart cookie. But I have a better idea.\u201d He gave her the hot grin that could\u2019ve melted polar ice caps.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come home with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going back out in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo choice. This close to calving I\u2019ve gotta check cattle in the mornin\u2019, even if it\u2019s still blizzarding.</p><p>So what\u2019s it gonna be, Red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Hayden\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs in Casper. Cam told me about Anton, Kyler and Hayden getting snowed in on the school field trip.</p><p>They won\u2019t be back until tomorrow at the earliest, and if Hayden needs to get in touch with you, he\u2019ll call your cell anyway, right?\u201d</p><p>He had a point.</p><p>\u201cYou and me, spendin\u2019 the whole night together. Alone. You gotta admit this chance ain\u2019t gonna come along very often.\u201d</p><p>Wow. She hadn\u2019t considered that. Cuddled up to Kane all night, instead of camping out on the lumpy office couch? \u201cOkay. Let me get my stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuickly. And bundle up. I\u2019ll wait here so I ain\u2019t draggin\u2019 snow all over the carpet.\u201d</p><p>Ginger shut down her computer. She shoved her cell phone and the charger in her purse and switched out her low-heeled pumps for snow boots. Coat on, hat on, scarf on, gloves on, she turned off the lights, grabbed her bag and returned to the foyer. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>His critical gaze stopped at her knee length skirt. \u201cDon\u2019t you have pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope we ain\u2019t gotta walk anywhere far.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s big truck plowed through the snowdrifts in town. Once they were out of town, visibility was nearly zero and their progress slowed considerably.</p><p>The sky remained a pitch-black backdrop as the truck\u2019s headlights cut through the swirling flakes, which weren\u2019t falling softly\u2014en masse the flakes became a blur of pure white. Wind whipped icy crystals with enough gale force they created a pinging sound against the windshield. The truck bumped over piles of snow blocking the road. A couple of times she caught sight of drifts several feet high before the truck broke them into a powdery spray that floated away on the wind.</p><p>Ginger stayed quiet throughout the drive. She had no idea where they were or how far they\u2019d gone.</p><p>Nearly forty-five minutes had passed since they\u2019d left Sundance.</p><p>The truck slowed. Stopped. Kane leaned forward and squinted. \u201cCan you see any light out there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike a yard light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you cut the headlights.\u201d</p> <p>Kane clicked the lights off, even the interior lights.</p><p>Talk about dark and spooky. Ginger focused on the blackness out her window. A snow squall faded and she caught a fleeting glimpse of light. \u201cThere. Straight ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope you\u2019re right, Red. If I run over a fence, you\u2019ll be out here fixin\u2019 fence with me early summer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know how to wield a pair of wire cutters, so bring it, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>Kane gunned the truck. For a second it felt as if they were airborne. They landed hard and Ginger held onto the support strap hanging from the top of the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Snow covered the windshield as they annihilated another drift. The wipers whisked away the remnants in a rapid slap slap slap and they skidded to a stop.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Ginger made out the faint orange glow of the porch light. Snow had drifted in front of the screen door up to the door handle.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019m gonna hafta shovel again before we can get inside. Sit tight. No reason for you to be out in this.\u201d Then he bailed from the truck.</p> <p>She watched him shoveling snow until he\u2019d created a pile as high as the deck rails beside him. Despite the freezing-ass weather, something warm moved through her. Clearing a path for her through the snow was akin to him throwing his coat over a mud puddle. But Kane had proved himself thoughtful and chivalrous to the core numerous times. For the first time they\u2019d be alone tonight\u2014all night\u2014and they could do whatever they liked.</p><p>Ginger had a few specific things she\u2019d like to do with him.</p><p>Kane returned to the truck, killed the engine and pocketed the keys. \u201cNeed help getting out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d She grabbed her bag and hopped down. The snow reached her knees and completely filled her snow boots. She trudged to the steps and Kane was already there, holding the door open.</p><p>She moved aside to give Kane room as they ditched their winter clothing. He hung both sets up on pegs that resembled fossilized feet. \u201cInteresting pegs. Are those chicken feet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurkey feet. My buddy Ash, over in Lingle, is a taxidermist and he makes \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>She stepped off the small square of linoleum. Her wet nylons clung to her legs. Shep was stretched out on the floor, eyeing them with \u201cyou poor suckers\u201d canine smugness.</p><p>Even Kane noticed it. \u201cShep, you better get out there and get your business done before it gets any worse.\u201d</p> <p>Shep scooted behind the chair.</p><p>Kane laughed. \u201cLazy damn dog.\u201d</p><p>Ginger tossed her bag on the coffee table and looked around. The last time she\u2019d been here, Kane had literally thrown her up against the wall and fucked her. Then she\u2019d left.</p><p>The kitchen and living areas were in the front of this trailer. She assumed the bedrooms and bathroom were down the hallway. From where she stood she could see the tidy kitchen and the dining room alcove, which boasted a felt-topped gaming table instead of a traditional dining room set.</p><p>A half shelf divided the rooms, but all the spaces screamed bachelor. No knickknacks, no artwork, no colorful rugs or extra throw pillows. The furniture consisted of one long black leather couch, one oversized black reclining chair. A chrome and glass coffee tabled piled with mail. A fifty-two-inch flatscreen TV</p><p>mounted on the largest wall with AV equipment stacked beneath it.</p><p>Ginger glanced at Kane, who watched her taking stock of his place. He\u2019d set his jaw in a hard line as if he expected her to pass judgment.</p><p>Silly man.</p><p>She closed the distance between them, wrapping her arms around his waist and placing a kiss on his neck. \u201cThank you for inviting me into your home, Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s yours and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>Kane kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold. I hope you\u2019ve got some sweat clothes to lend me because this is all I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I can hook you up with something.\u201d He snagged her hand and towed her down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWait. I\u2019ll need my phone in case Hayden calls.\u201d She grabbed her phone from her bag, expecting Kane to protest, but he didn\u2019t. Again, she realized she should stop making assumptions about this complex man.</p><p>His bedroom was bigger than she imagined, with a king-sized bed covered in a puffy navy blue comforter, and yet another big TV atop a dresser. On the opposite side was a simple desk with a lamp and a laptop.</p><p>\u201cSo this is your bedroom.\u201d Way to be obvious, Ginger.</p><p>\u201cI hope you weren\u2019t expectin\u2019 a swingin\u2019 bachelor pad. It\u2019s just a basic bedroom. Nothin\u2019 fancy.\u201d</p><p>Ginger slid her hands up his chest and trapped his face between her palms, looking him straight in the eye. \u201cStop. Do you really think I care that you live in a trailer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Hell. It\u2019s just...not what you\u2019re used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Clean and quiet?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cI am unbelievably happy to be here with you, so please don\u2019t think I\u2019m looking around and finding anything lacking. Because really, when I\u2019m with you? All I see is you.\u201d</p><p>Kane pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cYou undo me sometimes, Red.\u201d His lips drifted down her hairline. \u201cI know we just got here, but the truth is, if I see you takin\u2019 your clothes off in my bedroom? Well, sugar, I\u2019m gonna want you to leave \u2019em off for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? But won\u2019t I be cold if I\u2019m naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you warm.\u201d Kane\u2019s mouth grazed the top of her ear. \u201cVery warm. Hot, even.\u201d Moist lips meandered down to the spot on her neck below her ear. The spot that caused her knees to buckle and made her panties damp. \u201cI\u2019m dyin\u2019 to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence. I\u2019m dying to have you touch me.\u201d</p><p>Kane ate at her mouth as he unbuttoned her white blouse. His rough hands skated over her arms as her shirt slid to the floor.</p><p>Drugged by his kisses, Ginger let her head fall back as Kane removed her bra and unfastened her skirt. He snapped the waistband of her pantyhose. \u201cTake these off while I get nekkid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as long as you get nekkid fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t gonna be a problem.\u201d</p><p>Ginger shimmied her pantyhose off and pulled back the covers on his bed. She sighed deeply when her skin touched the flannel sheets.</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that sigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your flannel sheets.\u201d</p><p>Kane crawled across the bed toward her. \u201cI really like the look of you in my bed on my flannel sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use that sweet-talk when I\u2019m a sure thing. Crawl under here with me. It\u2019s toasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the bossy one? In my bed, no less.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were trouble the second I set eyes on you.\u201d He nuzzled her cheek. \u201cStretch your arms above your head.\u201d</p><p>Ginger pushed the pillows aside and placed her palms flat against the headboard. \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d He trailed kisses down the center of her torso, stopping briefly to suckle her left nipple, then her right. His tongue dipped into her belly button and followed in a straight line over her mound.</p><p>When his tongue probed her folds, she spread her legs and arched into him. His fingers squeezed her inner thighs. Ginger realized that was one of her favorite things about oral sex with Kane\u2014the feel of him holding her in place. Holding her steady to receive the pleasure he gave her. His tongue flicked her clit, teasingly, precisely, but always with unbridled passion.</p><p>Kane took his time tasting her, not in a teasing manner; he just slowly, thoroughly feasted on her pussy. When the telltale contractions started, Kane fastened his mouth to her clit, bringing her to climax with soft, gentle nibbles interspersed with butterfly licks as she came with a soft wail.</p><p>Right after the last pulse, Kane\u2019s cock was driving inside her still-throbbing tissues, immediately bringing her to the verge again. He buried his mouth in her throat, thrusting into her, making this bonus orgasm last.</p><p>Soon as her head stopped spinning, she opened her eyes and smiled at him. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wow factor is always a good sign.\u201d Kane slid his hands up her arms and threaded their fingers together. \u201cLook at me while I\u2019m lovin\u2019 on you, sugar. See exactly what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>Something big shifted between them in that small moment.</p><p>Ginger molded her mouth to his, desperate to taste his passion as well as feel it. The kiss never veered out of control. It stayed as easy and steady as the way he made love to her.</p><p>When his thrusts became faster and his hands squeezed hers, she wrapped her legs around his waist and bowed into him.</p><p>Kane threw back his head and groaned, eyes closed, neck taut, mouth slack, absolutely beautiful in the moment that he let everything go.</p><p>He blinked at her, as if clearing the fog away, and smiled an endearingly shy and somewhat boyish smile.</p><p>That\u2019s when she knew what the elusive something was: love.</p><p>She loved him. Holy crap. She was in love with him.</p><p>\u201cWhy so serious?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Instead of blurting out, Because I just realized I love you and I\u2019ve never been in love and it\u2019s scaring the living shit out of me, Ginger hedged. \u201cI seriously like looking at you. You are one hot hunk of cowboy manflesh, Kane McKay.\u201d</p><p>Kane blushed. \u201cDammit, Red, knock it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take a compliment any more easily than I can ask for help.\u201d She framed his ruggedly handsome face in her hands. \u201cI say, \u2018you are gorgeous\u2019 and you say, \u2018thank you\u2019\u2014go on let\u2019s try it. Kane, you are gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not gorgeous,\u201d he said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. And you are one of those men who looks better as he ages. You are beautiful. Not just here.\u201d She stroked his cheekbone with her thumbs. \u201cInside too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her then. With such sweet surrender she felt tears prickling the back of her eyelids. She felt him get hard again. He rocked into her as he kissed her. Their mouths weren\u2019t apart for any longer than a second or two, as they remained locked together, lost in each other. The waves of pleasure didn\u2019t crash over them, but built slowly, sweetly, until they were swept away.</p><p>After lolling in the moment, Kane withdrew and rolled to his back. He kept holding her hand and kissed her knuckles. \u201cSo you warmed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And sleepy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got nowhere to be. Go ahead and take a little nap if you want.\u201d</p><p>Ginger snuggled into him, resting her head on his chest. \u201cWill you stay with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed. Wake up. Hayden\u2019s on the phone.\u201d</p><p>She jackknifed, completely disoriented. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour cell rang and I answered it. Hope you don\u2019t mind but I didn\u2019t want you to miss the call.\u201d He handed her phone over.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom? Guess what? We\u2019re snowed in and the hotel has a pool and an elevator and me\u2019n Anton and Ky are in the same room! And tomorrow morning there\u2019s breakfast and this is such a blast!\u201d</p><p>She smiled and slid up the headboard. \u201cYou\u2019re okay? You\u2019re not scared of the storm or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom. I\u2019m not a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I was scared when I heard your class was stuck in Casper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s totally cool. Mrs. Dunnigan let me use her cell phone to call you and I gotta go so Anton can call his mom and dad next.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cLove you, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d she said to the dial tone.</p><p>\u201cSo Hayden\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s having the time of his life.\u201d</p><p>Kane sat on the bed. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She liked that he sensed her melancholy. \u201cI guess. I\u2019m not away from him very often. Kind of makes me...\u201d She didn\u2019t know what it made her. Not the type of parent who lived vicariously through her kid.</p><p>\u201cMakes you an awesome mother. Are you hungry? I heated up some chili.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. But I need clothes.\u201d</p> <p>Kane handed her a pair of black sweat pants, a plaid flannel shirt and a pair of white athletic socks.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, but there is one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>His fingertip trailed across the tops of her breasts. \u201cNo bra while you\u2019re wearin\u2019 my shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the idea of bein\u2019 able to pop these buttons anytime I want and putting my hands on them. Or my mouth on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a good idea.\u201d Ginger dressed and found Kane in the kitchen, talking to his dog. She leaned against the doorway to the living room. A pang of loneliness spiked in her gut. She had two people to come home to every night. Kane had his dog. Was he lonely?</p><p>Aren\u2019t you sometimes? Even when you\u2019re rarely alone?</p><p>He turned toward her with a sheepish grin. \u201cAnd yes, before you ask, Shep does answer me back.\u201d He looked at the dog. \u201cShep. Speak your mind.\u201d</p><p>Shep barked.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>Ginger laughed.</p><p>After they ate and finished the dishes, Kane gave her a considering look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything in particular you wanna do tonight? We are sort of limited for entertainment options. I doubt the satellite is workin\u2019 in this weather, so TV is out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we just hang out and watch a movie? Make some popcorn?\u201d</p><p>Kane frowned. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it sounds heavenly. I never get to watch the types of movies I want because Hayden is too young for them and Dad doesn\u2019t like anything with explosions, car chases or romance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have a selection for you. Action movies are about all I own.\u201d</p><p>Cuddled up to a sexy, sweet man, sharing a bowl of buttery popcorn, a few intensive make out sessions snuck in between the movie action scenes and Ginger was in heaven.</p><p>No, silly, you\u2019re in love.</p><p>Ginger in his bed was too big a temptation to resist.</p><p>Kane woke up in the middle of the night wanting her. As he touched her, she murmured sleepily, clinging to him, letting him know with her body that his attentions were welcome. And in the aftermath of sating his need for her, she curled back into him and fell asleep.</p><p>Kane wanted this. Ginger in his arms every night, seeing her beautiful face first thing every morning.</p><p>Because he was an early bird, he got up and checked the weather. He\u2019d intended to let her sleep in, but the aroma of coffee brought her into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019. How\u2019d you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a rock. A warm rock cuddled up to another warm rock. And I had this amazingly vivid dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the star, Mr. McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence. I had the same kind of dream. Only in mine, you were the star, counselor.\u201d</p><p>She smiled coyly as he handed her a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cDamn, woman, you look much better in that flannel shirt than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I keep it?\u201d she cooed.</p><p>\u201cHell no. Every time I wear it from here on out, I\u2019m gonna think of how perfectly the material hugged those tempting tits of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlatterer.\u201d</p><p>Kane grinned.</p><p>\u201cThanks for leaving out the extra toothbrush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I need to head out and check cattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. Depends on if I run into any problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always check cattle by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do when both my Dad and Kade are snowed in.\u201d</p><p>Ginger set down her cup. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with you going out there alone, Kane. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to protest, but really, he\u2019d appreciate her company. Even if she didn\u2019t say a single word. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s find you all the gear you\u2019ll need to bundle up.\u201d He dug through the closet, coming up with an extra pair of coveralls, an extra coat and a pair of hiking boots.</p><p>She dressed without complaint until she was covered from head to toe. \u201cI look like Ralphie from A Christmas Story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019ll be on the ATV you\u2019ll be grateful for the layers, trust me.\u201d Kane crouched down and spoke to Shep. \u201cYou wanna come along?\u201d</p><p>Shep just gave him a baleful stare.</p><p>\u201cGuess not.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d quit snowing, but the wind still blew like a bitch. He\u2019d opened the gate before they\u2019d gone in the barn to fetch the ATV.</p><p>The path he usually followed to the cattle shelter and stock tank was impossible to see, so he drove along the fence line, keeping an eye on the odometer to gauge how far he\u2019d gone. He knew this ranch like the back of his hand, but blizzards fucked up everything and he could get turned around ass-backward in a helluva hurry if he didn\u2019t pay attention.</p><p>Kane cranked the wheel to avoid getting stuck in huge drift that resembled a foamy, curling ocean wave. Ginger\u2019s arms tightened around his midsection when they caught air.</p><p>Then he saw the wooden shelter, which really wasn\u2019t any more complex than a snow fence. Except they kept bales of hay stacked on one side just for situations like this. The cattle were milling around, waiting for the food fairy to appear. He shouted over the howling wind. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta spread out some hay.</p><p>Sit tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I help?\u201d she shouted back.</p><p>\u201cSure. Come on.\u201d</p><p>They trudged through the snowdrifts until they were at the backside of the shelter. The structure offered some respite from the wind, but not much. Kane scrambled on top of the haystack and kicked away as much snow as he could. Then he hefted two bales to the ground. He hopped back down and took out a pocketknife. He sliced the twine on the bales and yelled, \u201cSpread it out. Along the length of the shelter.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Ginger spread out the hay and didn\u2019t panic with the cows started to surround her, looking for food.</p><p>Kane knocked down eleven bales. By the time he finished, there were only three bales left to break apart. Since Ginger was doing such a fantastic job, he headed to the stock tank.</p><p>Frozen. Dammit. The solar panel was supposed to store enough energy that this didn\u2019t happen, and it was the fourth time it\u2019d happened this winter. He dug through the snow until he unearthed the crowbar he\u2019d left for just this purpose. He broke the top layer of ice and yanked the biggest pieces out. Thirsty cows came to drink. While Kane tried to catch his breath, he counted cattle. Seventy-five. Two were missing.</p><p>He squinted across the horizon and saw nothing but acres of white. He hoped the cows were hunkered down someplace safe and he wouldn\u2019t find their bloated corpses come spring thaw.</p><p>Kane turned around and saw Ginger cornered by one of the more curious cows. He jogged back and came up behind it, slapping it hard on the right flank. The old girl\u2019s head swung round and she bellered at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you be getting sassy with my girl, or I\u2019ll turn you into hamburger, you old sow.\u201d Then he reached for Ginger\u2019s hand and led her out of the tight mass of hungry cattle. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m freezing.\u201d</p><p>By the time they returned to the barn, over three hours had passed. And Ginger seemed grumpy.</p><p>Maybe because the sky looked to be clearing up and their alone time was coming to an abrupt halt?</p><p>He\u2019d just have to make the next couple of hours memorable.</p><p>First thing Ginger did after peeling off the layers of clothes was check her phone.</p><p>\u201cAny news?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>\u201cOne message from Hayden\u2019s teacher. They\u2019re opening I-25 at two this afternoon, so that\u2019ll put them back at the school around five.\u201d</p><p>Kane glanced at the clock. Almost eleven. \u201cThat gives us a little time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I want is time to warm up. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever been this cold.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better strip them clothes off and crawl in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was right in her face. \u201cNo arguin\u2019 with me. Do it. Now.\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s hazel eyes sparked defiance for a second. But she whirled around and stomped to the bedroom. About halfway down the hallway, she tossed out, \u201cThis\u2019d better be good, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Any leniency he might\u2019ve had vanished with that challenge.</p><p>He snatched a bottle of lube and his other supplies from the bathroom. He locked the bedroom door and saw the outline of her body beneath the covers. \u201cGinger, I\u2019m givin\u2019 you a choice. Handcuffs or rope?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, the covers peeled back. Her hair appeared first, since it stuck straight up from static electricity. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Choose or I will.\u201d</p><p>Ginger smoothed her hair back and studied him. \u201cRope.\u201d</p><p>Kane lifted his hand and let the length of rope dangle from his fingertips. \u201cOn your knees, arms above your head, palms on the mattress.\u201d</p><p>It might\u2019ve surprised him that she turned over and assumed the position without argument.</p><p>He used a slipknot to bind her wrists, a binding that\u2019d be easy to get out of, if she knew the secret. But if she didn\u2019t, well, that gave him more time to play.</p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous, all stretched out before me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cThis is where you say, \u2018thank you\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so hard. Now widen your knees. That\u2019s good.\u201d Kane climbed behind her. He skimmed his hands over her body, starting at the crease where her ass met her thigh, and moving up her back. \u201cYou are cold.\u201d He levered his fully clothed body over her naked form. He placed a kiss on her nape, loving how quickly goose bumps bloomed across her skin.</p><p>\u201cSo warm me up.\u201d She remained with her forehead to the mattress, almost in a submissive manner.</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t give her a warning. His open palm connected with the center of her right ass cheek.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>He smacked the left cheek.</p><p>Another gasp.</p> <p>Then he went a little wild; the visual of his red handprint on her white skin brought out his primitive side. He peppered her ass with strategically placed swats, some hard, some playful, so Ginger never knew what to expect.</p><p>His cock was fully erect and digging into his zipper. Despite being chilled only ten minutes ago, his skin was on fire; he was actually sweating.</p><p>Kane smelled her arousal, saw the slightest movement of her ass pushing back, silently asking for more. He obliged her until he couldn\u2019t stand it. He had to feel that beautifully heated flesh on his face. He had to taste it.</p><p>He shoved back, first running his tongue down the crack of her ass. Then he rubbed his face over her flaming butt cheeks, letting his goatee tickle and tease.</p><p>Ginger whimpered. Her hands clenched into fists.</p><p>Kane used his tongue to bathe the red hand marks. Lapping. Licking. Leaving openmouthed kisses from the sexy dimples above her ass cheeks to the curve at the bottom. He lost his mind in the feel of her, the scent of her, her willingness to explore his kinky side without hesitation.</p><p>He gripped her lower body at the base of her thighs and lifted, using his thumbs to pull apart her cheeks, revealing that pink pucker and the glistening mouth of her sex. Kane plunged his tongue into her cunt and then dragged it up, over the bud of her anus. He flicked the very tip of his tongue over that tiny closed hole, painting it with his saliva. When he stopped, Ginger made a keening wail, sounding mighty displeased he\u2019d halted his attentions. Then he rammed his tongue in deep and repositioned his hand so his middle finger could rapidly flick her clit.</p><p>She came with a half gasp, half scream.</p><p>After the orgasmic pulses stopped and she slumped forward, Kane released his hold on her, smoothing his hands across her still heated skin. He unbuckled his belt, freed his cock from the confines of his zipper and dropped his jeans and his boxers to his knees. He grabbed the bottle of lube and slicked up his shaft.</p><p>Then he squirted the gel on his fingers and worked both fingers into her ass, preparing her with decisive strokes.</p><p>He leaned across her body, bracing his left hand by her left shoulder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d was her muffled response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided since you\u2019ve been so good, that it\u2019s time I give back your vibrator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, right now.\u201d Kane nuzzled the back of her head, breathing in the lavender scent of her shampoo.</p><p>\u201cMy cock pounding into your ass and your vibrator in your cunt. You\u2019ll be double teamed, but by one man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to lube up the vibrator since she was already wet and loose from her orgasm. He inserted the phallus completely into her pussy and turned it on.</p><p>Her body trembled, from her bound arms to her toes curled into the mattress.</p><p>Kane prodded her tiny entrance, slipping just the cockhead in past the contracting muscle, which tried to keep out the intrusion. Oh hell, between the tightness of her body, the vibration from her sex toy and his anticipation, this wasn\u2019t going to take long. He shoved into her ass until the root of his cock was pressed against her anal opening and his balls slapped against her pussy.</p><p>Ginger arched up.</p><p>He stopped, despite how fast his heart hammered. His body shook and it didn\u2019t have a damn thing to do with the vibrator. \u201cHow does that feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even... It feels full. Really, really full.\u201d</p><p>Kane withdrew from her back channel, again letting just the tip remain inside her. He snapped his hips, bumping the vibrator into his groin as he plunged in completely. Then he set to fucking her like a man possessed, his fingers digging into the reddened, soft globes of her ass. The visual was hotter than fire, seeing that hole stretching to accommodate his dick, his big hands spreading her wide and holding her in place for his assault.</p><p>His sac was already drawn up. Kane craved the rush of sensation as his cock emptied, feeling those close-fitting anal walls clamping down, milking every ounce of seed from his aching balls.</p><p>Now, now, now became the rhythm in his head, his blood, his body as he fucked her. He closed his eyes, lost to everything but the overpowering need. When that familiar pulling began at the top of his head, tightening every muscle from his scalp to his Achilles, he groaned. When the first spurt shot out the end of his dick, he gritted out, \u201cBear down on me, harder. Fucking Christsake that\u2019s good. So goddamn...\u201d He reamed her one last time, letting the white noise of pure sexual pleasure in his head take over, if only for a minute.</p><p>The buzzing against the underside of his shaft roused him from that happy pecker place. Staying embedded in her ass, he reached down between them and slid the vibrator out of her cunt, rubbing it up over her slit.</p><p>\u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome for me, sugar.\u201d He nestled the rounded end on her clit and held it there.</p><p>Ginger bucked against him, dislodging the vibrator.</p><p>\u201cHold still. Let it happen.\u201d</p><p>Although she stopped wiggling, her breath remained uneven. Kane wanted to press his mouth between her shoulder blades and taste the perspiration dotting her skin. He wanted to lay his head there and hear her heart beating.</p><p>Then she tensed and the throbbing pulses from her orgasm constricted her anal passage around his dick, and he felt every spasm as she came.</p><p>Kane eased out and retreated to the bathroom to clean up. He returned, placing the cool cloth over her ravaged tissues and unwound the rope.</p><p>Ginger slid forward to rest on her belly and groaned.</p><p>Was that a good groan? Or a bad groan?</p><p>He reached for her hand, noticing the red rope burns on her wrists. Holy shit. What was she supposed to say when her clients saw those rope marks? \u201cOh, ignore those. My rough and raunchy secret lover likes to tie me up when he fucks me in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Maybe you should be more worried about what her son will say when he sees them.</p><p>Or her father.</p><p>Kane froze. What the fuck was wrong with him? Ginger wasn\u2019t some bar wench who was up for anything-goes domination bedroom games. Ginger was a well-respected woman in the community. A mother. A daughter.</p><p>A classy broad too good for the likes of you.</p><p>No kidding. No wonder she didn\u2019t want to go public with their relationship. She probably never would. And once again he was reminded of the chasm between them. How much longer would she be willing to play the dirty-rancher-seduces-the-horny-lawyer bedroom games? Chances were pretty good once she caught sight of the hickeys and rope marks on her body it\u2019d be over.</p><p>He lifted her arm, tenderly kissing the red marks. \u201cI got a little rough.\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Her cell phone rang. Since she didn\u2019t look like she had the energy to pick it up\u2014or maybe she was too embarrassed to look at him\u2014Kane handed it to her without a word.</p><p>She rolled onto her back. \u201cHello? Hey, Hayden. Really? I can\u2019t wait to hear about your adventure.</p><p>Tell Ms. Dunnigan I\u2019ll come and get you. Okay. Bye.\u201d She tossed the phone on the bed. \u201cI need to go to the office right now. I hope the senior bus can deliver Dad home. I really don\u2019t want to dig my car and our van out of the snowdrifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you do all that. But first...\u201d Kane captured her mouth, intending to give her a possessive kiss, but changed his mind at the last second, trying to keep it relaxed.</p><p>Ginger pulled away immediately. \u201cEnough, don\u2019t you think?\u201d She rolled off the bed, snagged her clothes and shut the bathroom door with a decisive click.</p><p>Yeah. The word enough summed up everything he was feeling\u2014and none of it was good.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Brandt\u2019s cell phone buzzed in his front shirt pocket for the fourth time. He ignored it, knowing it was her. Knowing she was having some other crisis and desperately needed his help.</p><p>Sad thing was he was so desperate for the sound of his brother\u2019s widow\u2019s voice he almost answered it.</p><p>What if she needs you? What if it\u2019s something serious? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ground his teeth. In all the times she\u2019d called him in the last year, nothing had been earth-shatteringly important.</p><p>Every time he and Jessie had connected in the last two weeks, he\u2019d managed to keep the phone call short. He wondered if she\u2019d noticed. Then in the last week he\u2019d stopped answering her calls altogether.</p><p>Goddammit, cutting Jessie out of his life hurt like a son of a bitch. He\u2019d realized the night he\u2019d raced to her rescue that she\u2019d never see him as anything but the helpful brother of her dead husband. Hell, she\u2019d even told him she considered him like a brother.</p> <p>Brandt grunted. His feelings for her were so goddamn far from sisterly it wasn\u2019t fucking funny.</p><p>\u201cBrandt. Buddy, you\u2019re up.\u201d</p><p>He took the cell phone out of his pocket and set it on the table. He grabbed his cue and lined up his shot, trash talking with Tell, Dalton and Ben as they finished up their weekly pool game. After he scratched on the eight ball, he grudgingly gave both his little brothers ten bucks, and listened to Ben grumble about his shitty pool playing as they returned to the booth.</p><p>The waitress swung by just as his cell phone vibrated on the tabletop again. Brandt looked up at her and smiled. She was sort of cute.</p><p>That\u2019s because she reminds you of Jessie.</p> <p>He\u2019d been tempted for about two seconds to ask for her number. Scratch that idea. \u201cI\u2019ll have another Coors.\u201d</p><p>Dalton plopped down across from him. \u201cMake it three. Nope, better make it four, Tell\u2019s gonna stick around for one more.\u201d</p><p>The phone continued to buzz.</p><p>His youngest brother frowned at him. \u201cAin\u2019t you gonna get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s nothin\u2019 important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour phone\u2019s been ringing a lot tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. This\u2019ll fix it.\u201d Brandt reached over and shut the phone off.</p><p>Jessie McKay paced in the kitchen in her tiny rented trailer. \u201cCome on, pick up,\u201d she muttered as she switched the position of her cell phone to her other ear. Voice mail clicked on for the fifth time and she snapped the phone shut.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Brandt. Where are you?\u201d She\u2019d had a lousy day and needed someone to vent to. Brandt never minded listening to her complain, but he\u2019d been pretty scarce since the night he\u2019d invited her home with him. She\u2019d chalked up his uncharacteristic moon-eyed behavior to the fact he\u2019d been drinking before he showed up. The poor man was probably embarrassed for making a pass at her.</p><p>She took the pot pie out of the microwave and dropped it on the lace placemat on the table. One placemat. On days like today, when it seemed like everything in the world had gone wrong, seeing that lone placemat, when there used to be two, could bring on a fit of tears like nobody\u2019s business.</p><p>Don\u2019t be a crybaby, Jessie.</p><p>How many times had she heard that? From her father? From Luke?</p> <p>Too many to count. But really, who\u2019d know if she sobbed at her dinette table like a lost little girl? She felt like one most days. It wasn\u2019t as if she had friends to confide in since moving to Moorcroft. She\u2019d started to make friends with the women she worked with at Sky Blue, but that wasn\u2019t a good way to cement a friendship, by whining about how sucky her life was.</p><p>Jessie didn\u2019t have family to count on either, unless she counted Brandt, but he was Luke\u2019s kin, not hers, and then she was back to wondering why he\u2019d started ignoring her calls.</p><p>Maybe because you call him all the time.</p><p>So? Her surly side countered. He\u2019s my friend. Friends call each other.</p><p>Yeah? How many times has your \u201cfriend\u201d called you?</p><p>Jessie frowned. Brandt had called her...hadn\u2019t he? Curious, she flipped open her phone and checked received calls. Two calls from her boss at Sky Blue. Twenty-seven from Brandt in the last month.</p><p>See? He calls me.</p><p>All the calls were in response to you calling him first. How many times have you called him?</p><p>She scrolled down to the Dialed option. One hundred fifty-two outgoing calls. In the last two months... Holy crap. Only ten of those calls had been to someone other than Brandt McKay.</p><p>She\u2019d called him one hundred and forty-two times in the last two months.</p><p>Hot mortification rolled through her like acid. My God. Why had she called Brandt that many times?</p><p>Because you\u2019re lonely. Because you know that Brandt is missing Luke too.</p><p>So why was it Luke didn\u2019t come up in their conversations very often?</p><p>He does. It\u2019s one-sided on your part. You insist on extolling Luke\u2019s virtues, you talk about how much you miss him and Brandt just lets you ramble.</p><p>A little dismayed by that thought, she recalled the last few times she\u2019d seen Brandt.</p><p>He\u2019d helped her unload hay.</p><p>He\u2019d helped her deal with the dead battery in her truck.</p><p>He\u2019d helped her fix the broken door on the barn.</p><p>He\u2019d helped her unload more hay.</p><p>He\u2019d shown up when she\u2019d had plumbing issues.</p><p>Except he\u2019d refused to do anything. And yeah, maybe she\u2019d been a little upset about it at the time, his reluctance to fix the problem for her lickety split. But when she\u2019d thought it through the next day, she understood Brandt wasn\u2019t a miracle worker with everything.</p><p>That was the first time that\u2019d happened since Luke died; Brandt McKay encountered a problem that he couldn\u2019t fix for her.</p><p>Or maybe it was one he wouldn\u2019t fix?</p><p>Jessie grabbed a beer from the fridge and started to pace again. Angry at Luke for dying. Angry with herself for doing exactly what she\u2019d sworn she wouldn\u2019t the day Casper McKay had kicked her off their land: rely on a man. And worst of all, the man she\u2019d come to rely on was another McKay.</p><p>Would she never learn? She slumped against the wall and swallowed a big gulp of beer. The aftertaste made her shiver with disgust and she looked at the bottle. Why the hell was she still drinking Coors? She didn\u2019t even like Coors\u2014it\u2019d been Luke\u2019s favorite beer, not hers.</p><p>Poor, pathetic doormat Jessie. She hadn\u2019t even mustered the guts during her marriage to buy the kind of beer she liked. She\u2019d gone along with whatever Luke wanted because...</p><p>Why? She thought he\u2019d love her more if she never rocked the boat? She was afraid he\u2019d leave her, like her father had left her mother? Her \u201cYes, dear\u201d attitude hadn\u2019t mattered one whit. Luke had left her anyway\u2014maybe not bodily, but the last six months of their marriage had been sheer hell because he\u2019d never been around. Too busy shacking up with some bimbo. Probably she\u2019d stocked Luke\u2019s favorite beer, too, in hopes of keeping him around.</p><p>Hah. That hadn\u2019t worked for her either. Luke was dead to both of them.</p><p>A burst of anger surfaced and she threw that half-empty bottle across the room and it shattered against the wall.</p><p>Her dog whimpered and hid behind the easy chair.</p><p>You are the clingiest girl I ever met. Jesus, Jessie, can you just let me do some things on my own? We ain\u2019t joined at the hip. We don\u2019t gotta do everything together just because we\u2019re married.</p><p>Yeah, that mindset had worked out well for him, especially since he\u2019d encouraged her to dump her</p><p>\u201clowlife\u201d friends after their wedding, promising they\u2019d make new friends. Couple friends.</p><p>That\u2019d never happened. Why? Because Luke never allowed it to happen. Luke had called all the shots from day one. And she\u2019d been so freakin\u2019 happy to have Luke McKay\u2019s attention that she would\u2019ve danced naked around the Sundance flagpole if he\u2019d asked her.</p><p>More fury raced through her.</p><p>Let it go, Jessie. No man wants a wife who\u2019s a shrew. No man wants a wife who nags, yells, cries and whines all the damn time. No wonder I\u2019m not here as much as you like. You\u2019re drivin\u2019 me away.</p><p>Funny, how whenever she\u2019d stuck up for herself Luke considered her a shrew, but if he put his boot down and ended the discussion, he was just being the man of the house, not a controlling asshole.</p><p>Something inside her shifted and shattered.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking self-centered prick. You set this all up from the beginning, didn\u2019t you? Having the perfect little doormat wife at home, cooking your meals, washing your clothes, making nice with your asshole father, doing your ranch chores, trying to get pregnant to birth your babies. While you were out fucking any woman that looked your way.\u201d</p><p>Jessie slid to the floor and started to cry. Not tears of grief for a change. Granted, it wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d shed tears over Luke\u2014not even the first time today, but goddammit, it\u2019d be the last. As she cried, the rage built to the point she tipped her head to the ceiling and screamed, \u201cI\u2019m done with you, you cheating bastard! You hear me? Done. You and your whole rotten goddamn family can go straight to hell.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed. Lexie slunk next to her and licked her hand. That made her cry harder. Bringing Lexie home as a surprise gift was the one nice thing Luke had ever done for her.</p><p>Eventually her cries quieted. Her eyes dried because she literally had no more tears. She\u2019d cried herself out. Jessie dragged herself up from where she\u2019d curled into a ball on the floor. She ate, showered and decided to wear her nicest jeans and her favorite shirt, rather than lounging around in ratty sweats. She styled her hair, put on makeup, feeling foolish because really? Who would see her tonight besides her dog?</p><p>Don\u2019t make yourself look good for a man. Make yourself look good for yourself for a change. You can change.</p><p>Whoa. That was a new voice inside her head offering advice. Good advice.</p><p>She\u2019d just sat and turned on the TV when her cell phone rang on the kitchen counter.</p><p>Her first thought: Finally! Brandt called me back.</p><p>Her second thought: He can suck it. I\u2019m done with him.</p><p>Jessie sighed and stood, promising herself she wouldn\u2019t answer if it was Brandt. But it wasn\u2019t. The caller ID read: Keely McKay.</p><p>She smiled. She adored Keely. The woman was fun, funny, smart, sweet, sassy and she didn\u2019t take shit from any man, especially none with the last name McKay. Although Jessie knew Keely had been beyond busy in the last year, Keely always made a point to check in with her to see how she was holding up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie! I was hopin\u2019 you were around. What are you doin\u2019 right now?\u201d</p><p>Sitting around all dressed up with no place to go. \u201cNot much. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m in Moorcroft with a few members of my new dart league team. Guess what? We just kicked the crap outta the Moorcroft Deadly Tips dart team, and we are seriously in the mood to celebrate.</p><p>And I thought, Jessie lives close, I\u2019ll see if she\u2019s in the party mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZiggy\u2019s. Come on down. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou surrounded by hot cowboys?\u201d</p> <p>Keely laughed. \u201cAbsolutely. And I\u2019ve even got a designated driver lined up so if we get shitfaced, we have a ride.\u201d</p><p>Jessie froze. Sometimes Keely cajoled her McKay male cousins into helping her outwit her five older brothers, since they continued to treat Keely like a twelve-year-old girl. She also knew Brandt had gotten roped into being Keely\u2019s cohort on several occasions. \u201cWho\u2019s lined up as your DD?\u201d</p><p>The phone rattled as Keely spoke to someone else. \u201cHey, darlin\u2019, what\u2019s your name again? Robbie?</p><p>My new friend Robbie,\u201d Keely cooed, \u201chas a tryout early tomorrow morning for a team ropin\u2019 event, and he\u2019s not drinkin\u2019 tonight, so he\u2019ll be our DD as long as we dance with him until closing time.\u201d Keely whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s hot, Jess, like really freakin\u2019 hot, and he loves to dance as much as you do. You should come and check him out.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cPlease? I haven\u2019t seen you in forever. I\u2019m only in town this one night. When was the last time you went out and had fun?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long damn time, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I say you\u2019re past due to cut loose.\u201d</p><p>Years past due. Jessie glanced at her reflection in the window glass above the sink. She didn\u2019t look half-bad for a twenty-six-year-old widow. She wasn\u2019t ready for any kind of intimate relationship, not even a one-night stand, but it\u2019d do her good to make friends in the community. It\u2019d do her good to start her life again.</p><p>If you don\u2019t grab this opportunity, you\u2019ll regret it.</p><p>Every journey started with one step. It was past time to stop living in the past.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you convinced me. But you\u2019re buying the first round.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Two weeks later...</p> <p>More snow.</p><p>Kane sipped his coffee and stared out the window to the sea of whiteness. He\u2019d promised Colt he\u2019d pick up a load of cake\u2014supplemental cattle feed\u2014before they all got busy with calving season. Best to wait to see if the road conditions improved before he loaded up the trailer.</p><p>On his way to the bedroom, he nearly tripped over Shep, stretched out in the middle of the floor. Shep slunk toward the door.</p><p>\u201cReady to go out?\u201d</p><p>His tail thumped.</p><p>Kane petted his head. After the dog lumbered outside, Kane started his computer. Might as well get something accomplished besides pining for Ginger.</p><p>Man. He was so whipped over that woman. Seriously fucking whipped. It was a no-brainer they both enjoyed their explosive sexual chemistry, but they\u2019d clicked out of bed too. Things had changed between them since they\u2019d gotten snowed in. Sure, they\u2019d kept up their lunch dates during the week, but two out of the four times they\u2019d been together, they hadn\u2019t even had sex. They\u2019d had...lunch.</p><p>And the hell of it was, he hadn\u2019t minded. He liked talking to her. Laughing with her. Making sandwiches with her. Ginger hadn\u2019t invited him over for supper again, but she\u2019d tagged along when he\u2019d taken Hayden to the rodeo, although the twisty drive had made her sick. They exchanged text messages several times a day.</p><p>As much as Kane wanted to push their relationship to the next level\u2014telling family they were a couple\u2014in some ways, he liked romancing her in secret.</p><p>He focused on updating the cattle records. By the time he\u2019d finished and glanced at the clock, he realized two hours had passed. Kade would be along soon.</p><p>Shit. He\u2019d forgotten about Shep. Kane returned to the living room and opened the front door, seeing one set of tracks leading away from the house, but he couldn\u2019t see beyond the carport. Feeling guilty, he donned his winter weather gear and trudged outside.</p><p>First place he checked was the barn. \u201cShep? Come on out. I know you\u2019re probably pissed off and hungry.\u201d He checked the stalls and the tack room. No sign of the dog in his usual spots. Kane checked them all twice.</p><p>Although the sun wasn\u2019t shining, the white reflection of the snow made everything blindingly bright.</p><p>After he retrieved his sunglasses from his truck, he followed the tracks leading away from the house. They were scattered pell-mell as if the dog had sniffed everything in sight. Around the tractor, to the gate leading to the pasture, to the stock tank. But no sign of him.</p><p>Kane hunkered deeper into his coat against the icy blast of wind. He would\u2019ve worn his Carhartt coveralls if he\u2019d thought he was going on a wild dog chase.</p><p>He called out, \u201cShep?\u201d</p><p>No answering bark.</p><p>The tracks morphed into a straight line, rather than the random sniff and explore variety he\u2019d been seeing. Snow eddied around him, cutting visibility. He hurried. He\u2019d have to find the dog before the elements erased the tracks.</p><p>Kane stopped to catch his breath and looked back to see how far he\u2019d gone. He was maybe a quarter mile from his trailer. He spun back around, taking in the dark outline of the lone cottonwood tree, an anomaly out here on the high plains. The big tree towered above the gnarled scrub oaks clustered in ravines. A creek popped up in the spring and trickled through the shallow gouge in the earth before summer heat returned it to a dry creek bed again. It\u2019d always been one of Shep\u2019s favorite places. He\u2019d lounge in the shade while keeping an eye on the cattle drinking at the stock tank.</p><p>He squinted, focusing on the base of the tree.</p><p>Was that a black lump?</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He ran, the snowdrifts slowed his progress and he felt as if he wore cement shoes.</p><p>By the time Kane reached the tree, he was out of breath. And when he saw his dog, curled up in a ball, he knew he was too late.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Shep.\u201d Kane dropped to his knees in the snow. Shep\u2019s head rested on his front paws, as if he\u2019d just laid down for a brief rest. His eyes were even closed, which was uncommon with his always-alert dog. His fluffy tail was tucked under his nose. The wind ruffled his black fur, blowing away the crystals of snow that\u2019d accumulated on his still form.</p><p>He flashed back to the first time he\u2019d seen Shep. His dad\u2019s buddy Walt Collier had suffered a stroke, forcing him to move into the Sundance nursing home and give up his dog. Old Walt had owned Shep since he was a puppy. Around that same time Kane had moved into his trailer and was feeling a mite lonely.</p><p>When Kane\u2019s dad asked if he\u2019d be interested in taking the dog, he\u2019d immediately said yes.</p><p>The first month had been rough. Shep mourned Walt. He hadn\u2019t shown much of an appetite or interest in tagging along with Kane out on the range. Kane had begun to wonder if his company wasn\u2019t even fit for a depressed dog.</p><p>But one afternoon when the cattle came in from the pasture to drink from the stock tank, a couple of calves raced off. Shep gave chase, snapping at them, driving them back to the herd where they belonged.</p><p>After that day, Shep had been a great cattle dog and a great companion.</p><p>\u201cDamn, dog. Had to make a dramatic exit, didn\u2019t ya?\u201d He\u2019d seen things like this happen too often on the ranch to chalk it up to coincidence. Animal instincts never ceased to amaze him.</p><p>Kane stayed crouched down, his gloved hand absently petting Shep\u2019s head. He hadn\u2019t realized he was crying until he couldn\u2019t move his face, which had become covered in frozen tears.</p><p>\u201cKane!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn around at his brother\u2019s shout. He\u2019d come out here anyway.</p><p>Kade stopped behind him, huffing and puffing after trudging through the knee-deep snow.</p><p>\u201cKane, what the hell are you doin\u2019... Oh shit.\u201d</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t say a word. Couldn\u2019t speak around the lump lodged in his throat.</p><p>\u201cAw, man, I\u2019m sorry. Really fuckin\u2019 sorry.\u201d Pause. \u201cHow long...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went out this mornin\u2019 and didn\u2019t come back so I went lookin\u2019 for him.\u201d More tears fell and he didn\u2019t bother to swipe them away. \u201cDamn dog.\u201d</p><p>After a bit, Kade clamped his hand on Kane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThis just sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Kane stood and shivered. \u201cI\u2019m gonna head back to the barn and get a shovel. The ground\u2019ll be a bitch to dig since it\u2019s so fuckin\u2019 frozen, but I ain\u2019t gonna just leave him out here as buzzard and coyote bait...\u201d Kane\u2019s voice broke.</p><p>Kade squeezed his shoulder. \u201cLemme take care of this for you, bro.\u201d</p><p>Kane looked at his twin, knowing the sunglasses masked his red eyes, but also knowing Kade didn\u2019t need to see his eyes to know he\u2019d been crying. \u201cThanks for the offer, but I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo man oughta hafta bury his own dog, Kane. I\u2019ve been around Shep a lot too. This is the least I can do for you and for him.\u201d</p><p>No sense arguing. Kane said, \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll get the shovel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where the shovels are. How about if you head to town and get that cake loaded? Then I\u2019ll meetcha at Dewey\u2019s for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Kane nodded. They plodded through the snow in silence. Kade cut to the left toward the barn when the buildings came into view, while Kane went straight for his truck. He loaded the trailer. He hadn\u2019t meant to look back, but just as he started down the driveway, he glanced in his rearview and saw his brother traipsing through the snow, dragging two shovels.</p><p>He cranked on the radio for the drive into town, but he flipped it off when Blake Shelton\u2019s \u201cOld Red\u201d</p><p>came on.</p><p>At the feed store he wasn\u2019t in the mood to make idle chitchat with Denny, but this was a small community, and Kane had been trying like the devil the last few years to overcome his previous brusque reputation. Once he and Denny finished jawing about the weather, the Broncos\u2019 lousy season, the rash of new McKay babies and the upcoming calving season, Kane was ready to load up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took forever to load, which was odd because it wasn\u2019t a full order.

If Colt had intended on getting the cake all along, why had he made such a big deal about Kane picking it up right away? It incensed him further when he saw Colt\u2019s rig\u2014loaded with the other half of the cake\u2014parked across from Sandstone Building.</p><p>Probably wasn\u2019t the smartest thing, storming into the Sky Blue and India\u2019s Ink in his present mood, spoiling for a fight. But Kane scaled the steps and burst through the door anyway, sending the cowbell door chime clanking. Not even the sweet scent of lavender that Ginger favored calmed him down.</p> <p>Colt looked up from the magazine he was thumbing through. He yelled over his shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s just Kane, Indy.\u201d</p><p>Just Kane. He fought a sneer.</p><p>\u201cSo what brings you by, cuz?\u201d Colt asked as he strolled from behind the counter. \u201cLookin\u2019 for some sweet-smelling potion to lure the ladies into your lair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>Colt froze. His eyes narrowed. \u201cJesus. What crawled up your butt and died?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou. I get sick of your wisecracks like I\u2019m still some horny fuckin\u2019 teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLighten up. I was jokin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t funny. And it hasn\u2019t been for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t you in a special mood? Why in the hell did you bust in here and decide to take it out on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know goddamn good and well why I\u2019m here.\u201d Kane pointed to the street. \u201cWhy\u2019d you only pick up half the order of cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re runnin\u2019 low.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s we?\u201d</p><p>When Colt didn\u2019t answer, Kane stepped closer. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you pick up the whole order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously chewing my ass for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Because you made it clear I needed to get to town ASAP and pick it up. So after a spectacularly shitty morning, I finally get to the feed store and find half our order is missin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t missin\u2019, Kane, it\u2019s right there in the goddamn trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? So you\u2019re gonna deliver that half to the hopper out by the old Foster place?\u201d</p><p>Colt stared at him coolly.</p><p>Which gave Kane the answer he needed. \u201cYou son of a bitch. You took half the cake for your separate cattle operation with the Glanzers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo? I didn\u2019t take it all. And for Christsake, it\u2019s supplemental feed. Not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>Kane glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhen the feed store told me they were gonna be temporarily out of stock for a week, I took what we needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about what we need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? We\u2019ll get the other half next week when the Glanzers\u2019 order comes in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deal is, you\u2019re more worried about your little side cattle deal with Trevor, Chassie and Ed than you are with what\u2019s goin\u2019 on with our herd right before calving.\u201d</p><p>Colt stepped forward, his eyes blazing fire. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? All\u2019s I know is you made a big hairy damn deal about havin\u2019 this cake order handled early and now you\u2019re tellin\u2019 me it don\u2019t matter? You\u2019re tryin\u2019 to cover your ass. Probably so you can pass off the really shitty stuff that needs done to me, Ben, Brandt, Tell and Dalton when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fuckin\u2019 lecture me about what needs done before them calves start droppin\u2019. We own\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you even think about sayin\u2019 that you guys own more than we do,\u201d Kane warned, \u201cor I will punch you right in your smart mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe facts are the facts, Kane. Between me and my brothers, we own four times as much as of the McKay Ranch as the rest of you combined.\u201d</p><p>Kane reacted instinctively. He cocked his right arm and his fist connected with Colt\u2019s jaw with a loud crack.</p><p>Caught off guard, Colt staggered back. Before he recovered from the first punch, Kane drew his fist back again and nailed Colt in the eye.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you. And this has been a long time comin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it, fucker.\u201d Colt jumped him. A blow landed on Kane\u2019s chin, then on the side of his head by his temple. He jabbed and connected with Colt\u2019s gut, and then quickly followed with a shot to Colt\u2019s ribs.</p><p>When Colt doubled over, Kane used an uppercut on Colt\u2019s jaw and knocked him to the floor. Then he pounced on his cousin, fists flying.</p><p>Colt dodged the blows and bucked, throwing Kane sideways. But Kane recovered quickly only to feel a fist plow into his mouth. The taste of blood seeped through his teeth and ran down the back of his throat and down his chin.</p><p>He popped back up on his feet, only to see Colt do the same. They bobbed and weaved like prizefighters. Colt feinted left, catching Kane\u2019s eyebrow with his wedding ring.</p><p>The instant Kane felt the slicing sting, he roared and intended to leap at his dumbass cousin, but found himself immobilized.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ. That\u2019s enough. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>When the hell had Kade shown up? He blinked trying to clear the blood dripping into his eye, and saw Brandt had a similar hold on Colt.</p><p>\u201cLet me fuckin\u2019 go,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let him go,\u201d Colt taunted, \u201cI ain\u2019t done kickin\u2019 his sorry ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad your lips ain\u2019t swollen shut like your eye is,\u201d Kane shot back. \u201cBut I can change that in about one second when I punch you in the fuckin\u2019 mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, both of you. Nobody\u2019s hittin\u2019 nobody. What the fuck happened?\u201d Kade demanded.</p><p>Kane breathed hard and glared at Colt. Colt was having his own difficulty breathing. And yeah, maybe it was petty to see that Colt only had one eye to shoot daggers at him, but it made Kane happy he wasn\u2019t the only one sporting blood and bruises.</p><p>\u201cThey got into a fight about cake,\u201d India said.</p><p>Kane\u2019s head swung her direction. She stood behind the counter, white-faced, holding Hudson as he tried to scramble onto the counter.</p><p>Fucking awesome, Kane. Getting into a fistfight with your cousin in front of his kid. Way to be mature.</p><p>Talk about a stellar fucking start to his day.</p><p>He turned his head and spoke to his brother. \u201cLet me go. I ain\u2019t gonna go after him again.\u201d</p><p>Almost reluctantly, Kade released him.</p><p>Kane picked up his hat. Adjusted his clothes. He looked Colt in the eye. \u201cYou think on what I said.</p><p>Bottom line is I don\u2019t give a shit if their cattle starve. But I care if ours do.\u201d</p><p>He walked out of the store and hit the halfway point to his truck before he muttered, \u201cFuck it.\u201d He headed the opposite direction, to the one place Colt wouldn\u2019t track him down: the Golden Boot.</p><p>Looked like he\u2019d be having lunch in town after all. A liquid lunch.</p><p>An hour later Ginger found Kane hunched over the bar in the far corner of the Golden Boot. Two empty shot glasses in front of him next to a bottle of Bud light.</p><p>So far he hadn\u2019t noticed her. He was engrossed in breaking the pretzels in the bowl in front of him into tiny brown pieces.</p><p>Her heart stumbled upon seeing his animated face so miserable. She wanted to put her arms around him and hold him tight. Comfort him and take care of him like he\u2019d done with her.</p><p>So why don\u2019t you?</p><p>Before she even took off her coat, Ginger came up behind Kane. She rested her chin on his shoulder, close to his neck, and slipped her hands underneath his arms. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Kane remained frozen for a second, then he turned his head and buried his nose in her hair. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed him a little tighter.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here, Red? Lookin\u2019 for a nip to get you through the afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Looking for you.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201cMind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He spun on his barstool to help her take off her coat. Even when he was distracted and miserable he showed her gentlemanly courtesies, not because he was trying to impress her, but because that was his way. Kane\u2019s gaze landed on her feet. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t bust your ass wearin\u2019 them heels.\u201d</p><p>She placed her burgundy pump on the metal part of his stool, using it as support as she sat next to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you like these shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d He smiled, but it didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u201cWhat are you drinkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it horribly lame if I say...ginger ale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. It\u2019s kinda cute.\u201d Kane waggled his empty bottle at Lettie and said, \u201cAnd bring her a ginger ale.\u201d</p><p>Ginger looked around the bar. Completely empty. Which was unusual. She said, \u201cSlow day, huh?\u201d</p><p>when Lettie brought her drink.</p><p>\u201cWe hit a few of those this time of year. We\u2019re actually closed for inventory today. But I made an exception for one of the wonder twins.\u201d She didn\u2019t stick around to chat with them\u2014also unusual.</p><p>Or maybe it was the \u201cdon\u2019t fuck with me\u201d vibe Kane was throwing off that sent Lettie scurrying away.</p><p>Kane sipped his beer.</p><p>She sipped her ginger ale. She caught their reflection in the bar mirror. From here she could see the door and the entire length of the bar. So he had known when she\u2019d walked in.</p><p>\u201cSo, counselor, if you ain\u2019t here for a three-martini lunch, which one of my meddlin\u2019 relatives called you? Kade? Skylar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia.\u201d</p><p>That shocked him. \u201cIndia ratted me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She... Omigod, is that...blood on your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. What\u2019d India say?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t care he\u2019d been bleeding? \u201cIndia said you were here drowning your sorrows and maybe I ought to check on you. Then she gave me a message for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis oughta be good,\u201d Kane muttered.</p><p>\u201cShe said Colt might be an asshole on occasion, but he was her asshole and she didn\u2019t appreciate you messing up his pretty face.\u201d Her eyes searched his. \u201cDoes that mean something to you?\u201d</p><p>Kane smiled. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s not pissed off at me for getting into a fistfight with her husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a second. You and Colt got into a...fistfight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Wasn\u2019t the first time, probably won\u2019t be the last.\u201d</p><p>Ginger stared at him, her mouth hanging open. \u201cYou\u2019re both grown men! Whatever would possess you to take a swing at one another?\u201d</p><p>He bristled. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand. Me\u2019n Colt... Let\u2019s just say we\u2019re both just hotheaded.</p><p>We get pissed, come out swingin\u2019 and then we\u2019re done. Fine. Back to normal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia didn\u2019t tell you that Kade and Brandt had to break up the fight between me\u2019n Colt at Sky Blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She just told me that you\u2019d had a bad morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndy thinks Colt is completely tamed. Sure, he hasn\u2019t been drinkin\u2019, druggin\u2019 and whorin\u2019 around for a few years. He\u2019s happily married to a woman he worships and now they\u2019ve got this perfect little boy. But there\u2019s a dark side to him. A side that likes to inflict pain and receive it in return. Colt\u2019s brothers have never understood it. Kade never understood it about me, either. But me\u2019n Colt? We recognized it from the time we were kids and accepted that violent side. And it might sound barbaric, but every once in a while? We just need to beat the ever lovin\u2019 shit out of each other. Today was that day.\u201d</p><p>She honestly didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cWhen Colt hears why I was a major asshole today, well, he\u2019ll probably show up at my place with a damn puppy. That\u2019s just the kind of guy he is.\u201d</p> <p>Ginger placed her hand on Kane\u2019s thigh. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about Shep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Ah. Thanks.\u201d He swigged from his bottle. \u201cSeems a little silly, cryin\u2019 in my beer over my dead dog. Jesus, I\u2019m livin\u2019 the clich\u00e9d country song\u2014my dog died, I had a knock-down, drag-out fight with my kin and now I\u2019m at the local watering hole drownin\u2019 my sorrows about the suckage of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine so,\u201d Ginger murmured. \u201cBut your woman hasn\u2019t left you.\u201d</p><p>Kane muttered something that sounded like \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>She wanted so badly to soothe him. Kane constantly touched her when they were alone together.</p><p>Tender lover\u2019s caresses on her face. Running his work-roughened fingertips down her neck. Twisting sections of her hair around his fingers. Playing dot to dot with her freckles on her.</p><p>How could she show him the same loving care he\u2019d shown her?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Lettie happily supplied Ginger with what she needed. She returned to the bar with a washcloth and a bowl of hot water.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to clean you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t stand to look at me with blood on my face?\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>\u201cBlood, swollen spots and bruises on your handsome mug does affix you with a sort of sexy, rugged meanness. But the truth is, I was hoping for one of your amazing kisses. The taste of blood might spoil it.\u201d</p><p>His stoic face softened. \u201cI\u2019ll give you all the kisses you can handle, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then hold still and let me play doctor.\u201d Her gaze zoomed to the broken skin below his lips.</p><p>\u201cTurn \u2019bout is fair play, right?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. She just gently dabbed the spots until all the blood was gone. There wasn\u2019t a damn thing she could do about the bruises, except offer them a healing kiss, which she did. On his mouth, his jaw, the cut by his temple, his cheek. She also pressed soft kisses on the section of his lips that weren\u2019t swollen.</p><p>\u201cGinger,\u201d he said huskily, nuzzling her hair, \u201cYou make me want...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But right now, I want to dance with you, Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because I want an excuse to wrap myself around you and just hold you. \u201cBecause there\u2019s no one here to see my two left feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cReally. I fell down the stairs, remember? I\u2019m utterly graceless. I\u2019ve watched you with Hayden.</p><p>You\u2019re a wonderful teacher. I figured if anyone could teach me, you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But I get to pick the songs.\u201d</p><p>Kane hopped off the barstool and made a beeline for the jukebox.</p><p>She yelled, \u201cNo \u2018Honky Tonk Badonkadonk\u2019, Kane McKay. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and started shoving in quarters.</p><p>Selections chosen, he stood on the edge of the empty dance floor and held out his hand.</p><p>Ginger wasn\u2019t sure why she felt nervous; she just did. As she started toward him, the Eddie Arnold classic \u201cMake the World Go Away\u201d drifted from the jukebox. When Kane\u2019s rough fingers enclosed hers, the heat lingering beneath the surface sparked. When he enfolded her in his arms, that same spark ignited.</p><p>She wanted skin on skin, mouth on mouth, wanted to feel him above her as his body sought the entrance to hers.</p><p>But this cheek-to-cheek, chest-to-chest, pelvis-to-pelvis position was a good temporary substitute.</p><p>They drifted together through the mellow song, not talking, just dancing. The second song kicked in, Barbara Mandrell\u2019s \u201cSleeping Single in a Double Bed\u201d and Kane kicked up the pace, deftly swinging her into two-stepping. Just when Ginger thought she might have to take a breather, the third song started: Big and Rich\u2019s \u201cLost in This Moment\u201d. She sighed. How had he known she loved this song?</p><p>Kane barely moved as they slow-danced. Ginger was truly lost\u2014in the solid heat of Kane\u2019s body, surrounded by his earthy scent, his hard muscles pressed against her softness.</p><p>\u201cI like dancin\u2019 with you, counselor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna know a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that you\u2019re tall. I don\u2019t have to crouch down to dance with you and wind up with a crick in my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing an Amazonian throwback does have advantages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna know something else?\u201d he whispered, sending a tingle strait to her core.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have two left feet. You just needed to be with a man who takes the lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho takes the lead in all things,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cComplaints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life, cowboy. You\u2019ve been avoiding me since the blizzard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden misses you.\u201d I miss you too.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>That was it? They weren\u2019t going to talk about the over-the-top, totally domineering sexual encounter in his bedroom? How she\u2019s sensed his regret as he\u2019d untied the ropes and she\u2019d been more pissed off by that than by his intensive use of her body? It\u2019d scared her how much she\u2019d liked it. How much she\u2019d wanted it again. How easily she could give everything over to this man. That was what\u2019d bothered her. Not his rough side.</p><p>Tell him.</p><p>No. It\u2019d be better to wait. See how things played out.</p><p>The song ended too quickly.</p><p>Ginger tilted her head back to look at him. \u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened. The sadness was still there. She hadn\u2019t expected that a couple of dances and some sexual teasing would erase the day\u2019s events, but his suffering distressed her nonetheless.</p><p>She framed his face in her hands. \u201cCome home with me. Have dinner with us. I\u2019ve already got a roast in the Crock-Pot and I\u2019ll even let tonight be Hayden\u2019s Xbox night. Please.\u201d</p><p>Gratitude swam in his eyes before he looked away and kissed the inside of her wrist. \u201cI\u2019d like that, Red. I\u2019d like that a whole helluva lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ve got a couple of hours left at the office...\u201d She stopped talking. \u201cYou know something?</p><p>Nothing needs to be done today. It can wait.\u201d</p><p>That surprised him. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stay here and dance a little longer.\u201d Ginger pressed a soft kiss to his lips. \u201cBut now it\u2019s my turn to pick the music.\u201d</p><p>Ginger rode along with Kane as he unloaded the cake. Although many of her clients were ranchers, she wasn\u2019t sure what their daily lives entailed. She appreciated the glimpse into Kane\u2019s life. No wonder the man was so muscle-bound; it appeared everything he did required strength.</p><p>They picked Hayden up from school instead of at the bus stop. During the ride home, her son was subdued. Maybe it hadn\u2019t been the brightest idea to tell him about Shep, but Hayden deserved to understand Kane\u2019s melancholy mood.</p><p>Her father sat at the kitchen table working on a crossword puzzle. He gave no indication of shock at seeing Kane making himself at home in the living room. Most days Hayden and his grandfather shared an after-school snack, but today, Hayden left his snack untouched.</p><p>Ginger watched covertly as her son stood in front of Kane, shifting from foot to foot.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, nothin\u2019. I\u2019m sorry about Shep. He was the coolest dog ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna miss him, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna miss him. Big time.\u201d</p><p>Then without another word, Hayden crawled right onto Kane\u2019s lap and rested his head against Kane\u2019s chest, curling his arms around Kane\u2019s neck.</p><p>Kane hugged Hayden back without hesitation. He closed his eyes and they sank into the couch cushions.</p><p>Oh God. Ginger had to turn away, lest she start sobbing. Her sweet baby boy had such a kind heart.</p><p>Kane knew that. He celebrated it. And it was never more apparent they had a unique bond than when Kane openly welcomed Hayden\u2019s comfort. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was totally in love with this man.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do about it.

Not only that, if she confessed her feelings, would he think she was no different than the other mothers in the Little Buddies program, angling for a permanent piece of him?</p><p>She\u2019d never want Kane to think she prized his potential as a father over everything else that made him such a good man. And she wouldn\u2019t put the weight of her confession of her feelings for him when his day had already been filled with emotional upheaval.</p> <p>Ginger felt her father\u2019s curiosity as he watched the boy and the man still snuggled on the couch.</p><p>Without a word, or even a look her direction, he refocused on his crossword puzzle.</p><p>She put her father\u2019s guarded reaction out of her mind and prepared supper. After they ate, her father pleaded a headache and retired to his room. She thought about finishing paperwork in her home office, but she was content to sit between Hayden and Kane as they trash talked, wielding battling game controllers.</p><p>When Hayden\u2019s bedtime rolled around, he hugged Kane before skipping off to his room with Ginger following to tuck him in.</p><p>She returned to the living room and saw Kane staring out into the darkness, his hands shoved in the front pockets of his Wranglers, his shoulders hunched almost to his ears. She slid her arms around his waist and kissed the back of his neck.</p> <p>Kane made a pleased-sounding rumble.</p><p>She kissed him again. \u201cStay with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>His hands came out of his pockets and he turned around. \u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another longer, deeper kiss quelled his protest. She eased back to murmur, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I want to be with you tonight. All night. You and me. In my bed. If you\u2019re worried about your virtue, you can sneak out before sunrise.\u201d</p><p>He playfully nipped her bottom lip. \u201cYou sayin\u2019 my virtue is safe with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But we\u2019ll come up with a cover story if Hayden wakes up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Ginger undressed him slowly, loving the way Mr. Take Charge gave control over to her. She soothed him with a deep tissue back massage, relaxing him to the point he fell asleep. She rested on top of him, her right cheek pressed between his shoulder blades, her pelvis curled over his buttocks, their legs entwined.</p><p>Kane woke up refreshed, ending her control. But he didn\u2019t push her to that deliciously dark edge of sexual pleasure. He touched her everywhere, from the soles of her feet to the tips of her earlobes with such sweet possession she had to bite her lip to keep from crying.</p><p>\u201cRide me,\u201d he\u2019d urged in that husky voice.</p><p>After she sent him soaring, she collapsed in his arms and fell asleep.</p><p>Kane\u2019s cell phone buzzed at five a.m. Groggy, he patted Ginger\u2019s nightstand until his fingers connected with the plastic casing. Without opening his eyes, he said, \u201cYeah?\u201d He listened. \u201cNo, Dad. Just wait. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Ginger asked.</p><p>\u201cThe first calf dropped about an hour ago. Then two more. Dad\u2019s got one lined up in the barn at my place that we\u2019ve gotta pull.\u201d</p> <p>He rolled to the side of the bed and gathered his clothes from the floor. He felt Ginger\u2019s eyes boring into the back of his neck. \u201cLook, I know this is gonna sound like a brush off, but I ain\u2019t gonna be around much for the next three weeks.\u201d Kane faced her. \u201cNot for our lunch dates, not on weekends, not even for the Little Buddies events. The cell service sucks, so don\u2019t think I\u2019m avoidin\u2019 you or nothin\u2019 when I don\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalving is tiring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe. Sometimes I fall asleep standin\u2019 up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when you\u2019re done, will you let me take care of you for a change?\u201d</p><p>Kane had known he loved her almost from the start. Right then, Kane realized he had to stop playing it safe\u2014they both did. This was real, this was forever. But there wasn\u2019t a damn thing either of them could do about it now.</p><p>\u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cI\u2019m puttin\u2019 in my request for you to wear one of them sexy harem-girl outfits as you\u2019re hand feedin\u2019 me grapes and coolin\u2019 me down with palm fronds.\u201d</p><p>She held her hands in prayer position and blinked her eyes. \u201cAnything else, master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, see if you can\u2019t round up some of them nipple clamps on a golden chain. And a satin pillow.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cFor your knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Two weeks later...</p><p>Kane was having a devil of a time keeping his eyes open. He yawned, knowing it\u2019d be another long night out in the cold and snow. But at least he had this place to crash in.</p><p>Two years ago, the McKay \u201cboys\u201d, as their collective fathers called them, had all chipped in and built a bunkhouse. The structure wasn\u2019t anything fancy, just one room with three sets of bunk beds, a big conference-type table, an old refrigerator and a small counter that held a hot plate, a microwave and a coffee pot. For warmth during the freezing-ass winter months, they\u2019d bought several space heaters. For cooling off during the hot-as-hell summer months, well, they could leave the door open. A gas-powered generator provided electricity, but there was no running water, just a water tank. No bathroom either, just an outhouse in the trees. As far as amenities, it was damn primitive. Although it was out in the boonies, it was centrally located on the ranch. They\u2019d even had an old-fashioned barn raising, building a small metal structure where they could keep equipment, and a place for calves to spend a night or two, if needed.</p><p>He kicked his chair against the wall. He hadn\u2019t bothered to look at the schedule to see who he was working with tonight. The schedule was more or less a joke anyway. He was always here, Brandt was always here and Tell was always here. The others came and went whenever the hell they felt like it. Truth was, Kane didn\u2019t begrudge them. This time of year was exhausting, but he looked forward to the annual birth cycle in a way he couldn\u2019t explain without sounding like a sappy damn fool.</p><p>The door opened and shut quickly. But even so, Kane felt the rush of cold air. Boots stamped. Clothes rustled. He finally opened his eyes.</p><p>Colt stared back at him.</p><p>Fucking awesome.</p><p>So far they\u2019d managed to avoid working with one another. It\u2019d been a childish hope on Kane\u2019s part that the avoidance would last through calving season.</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re gonna jump me again, I\u2019d rather you got it out of your system now, instead of when we\u2019re elbow deep in a cow\u2019s birthin\u2019 canal.\u201d</p><p>Kane smiled, even when he didn\u2019t want to. \u201cBut I like the element of surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow well I know that,\u201d Colt said wryly, rubbing his jaw.</p><p>Be the bigger man. This can\u2019t go on with your cousin forever. Kane picked up his mug of nearly cold coffee. \u201cLook. I was an ass that day. I\u2019m sorry. You didn\u2019t deserve me comin\u2019 after you and certainly not in front of your wife and kid.\u201d</p><p>Colt poured himself a cup of coffee and refilled Kane\u2019s. Then he sat across from him. \u201cWell, it was as much my fault as it was yours. And fuck, Kane, I\u2019m really goddamn sorry about Shep. If I\u2019da known...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have hit me back?\u201d Kane supplied.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t go that far. We both know that fight had been building a long time.</p><p>That\u2019s what happens when we don\u2019t beat the tar out of each other on a regular basis. And lifting weights and hitting a punching bag is a poor substitute, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Shocks people that we still like mixin\u2019 it up, don\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why we\u2019ve always done it in private,\u201d Colt muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be mature. Solve all our problems with words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a family man, for Christsake. I should know better. But there are times...\u201d</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t have to spell it out. Kane understood. There was no substitute for the real thing, nothing like bleeding and hurting that really made you feel alive. That\u2019s where they were alike. The only other person in their family who had that same impulsive, primitive need was Brandt and he\u2019d always refused to talk about it. Kane knew it\u2019d come to a head for Brandt one of these days, probably sooner rather than later.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d Colt offered. \u201cI fucked up. I forgot to do a whole buncha shit that week, and it wasn\u2019t your fault. I took it out on you because I could. So it ain\u2019t an excuse, but I\u2019ve been so goddamn distracted lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Colt ran his hand over the top of his head. \u201cIndy\u2019s pregnant again, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongrats, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound too happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. It\u2019s just... There\u2019s so much more to bein\u2019 a husband and a father than I imagined. It\u2019s like calving all the damn time.\u201d Colt shot Kane a dark look. \u201cAnd if you ever repeat that to Indy I will beat you bloody.\u201d</p><p>Kane held up his hands in mock surrender.</p><p>\u201cJust when I think I\u2019ve got a handle on it all, the kid is sleeping through the night, the puppy is house trained, and I\u2019ve got my sexy wife back...I find out I knocked her up again. And that day, when I looked at you, without all the damn worries about this family stuff, I was jealous of your freedom. It only lasted a minute or so, but it was there.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky man. Your life wasn\u2019t such hot shit before Indy, remember? And I\u2019d give my left nut to have those kind of family worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeakin\u2019 of...\u201d Colt pinned him with a look. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on with you and the fireball attorney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell knows? One day it\u2019s great. The next... I can\u2019t get a bead on her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen it\u2019s probably the real deal and she\u2019s running scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not the type of guy she thought she\u2019d end up with,\u201d he said, hating he sounded like a fucking whiner.</p><p>Colt frowned at him. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talkin\u2019 about? You feelin\u2019 like you\u2019re not good enough for her? So she\u2019s a lawyer. Big deal. That just means when you do something stupid and get your ass tossed in jail she can give you a helluva defense.\u201d</p><p>Kane laughed. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen to me. Don\u2019t be a dumbass and waste any more time. Do the adult thing and quit mopin\u2019</p><p>around. It\u2019s annoying as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do you know I\u2019ve been moping? You ain\u2019t been around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike anything can be a goddamned secret for long in this family.\u201d</p><p>Before he could tell Colt to mind his own fucking business, the door blew open and a whole mass of people crowded in. Kade, Cord, Colby, Cam and Quinn.</p> <p>Kade spoke up. \u201cWe\u2019re staging an intervention.\u201d</p><p>Kane glared at Colt. \u201cWas this your doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Colt smirked. \u201cPayback\u2019s a bitch, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p>All the guys grabbed a cup of coffee and took a seat.</p><p>When he couldn\u2019t take their amused stares and total silence any longer, he snapped, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Evidently Kade was the designated spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been where you are, so we\u2019re gonna give you the benefit of our experience.\u201d Kade leaned forward. \u201cBuy a goddamned ring and marry the woman.</p><p>Don\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>Heads nodded in agreement.</p><p>Kane looked at his relatives like they\u2019d all gone insane, because the road to happily ever after hadn\u2019t been easy for any of them. \u201cThat\u2019s your advice? That\u2019s why you\u2019re all here?\u201d</p><p>Colby exchanged a look with Quinn and Colt and said, \u201cPartially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re using this \u2018intervention\u2019 as an excuse to avoid their wives, since they\u2019re all pregnant,\u201d Cam tossed in.</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Cam,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true,\u201d Cam argued.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all pregnant?\u201d Kane asked. \u201cDid you guys plan that or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Blame the last blizzard,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>Quinn nodded.</p><p>Kade said, \u201cWell, Skylar ain\u2019t pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Colt said, \u201cAnd Indy was pregnant before the blizzard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar as I know, AJ ain\u2019t pregnant.\u201d Cord grinned. \u201cYet, but it sure ain\u2019t for lack of tryin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Cam sighed. \u201cAs for why they\u2019re here tonight, they each told their missus that they had to talk some sense into you about Ginger. Which if they\u2019re anything like Domini, they\u2019re all teared up thinking we\u2019re the greatest guys in the world, looking out for you.\u201d</p><p>Kane snorted.</p><p>\u201cAs much as we do care about you finally strapping on that old ball and chain like the rest of us,\u201d</p><p>Quinn said, \u201cwe are here for another reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>Colby crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cPoker.\u201d</p><p>That jarred him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know you\u2019re playin\u2019 poker regularly with Brandt, Tell, Dalton, Bennett and Chase. We\u2019re pissed you didn\u2019t invite us, and we want in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. We admire the hell outta you, Kane,\u201d Cord said. \u201cYou\u2019ve actually tried to fix the rift between our families and Uncle Casper\u2019s. None of us could do it, even when we all wanted to. Hell, even when some of us tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the next poker game after calving? We all expect an invite,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cBesides, if it was just supposed to be a gathering of the single McKays, then you\u2019re gonna get kicked outta the club pretty soon, anyway,\u201d Kade pointed out.</p><p>Kane muttered, \u201cGod I hope so.\u201d</p><p>Cam threw a deck of cards on the table. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an hour before we need to check cattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove the way you said \u2018we\u2019, little bro, when you\u2019ve got no intention of climbin\u2019 on an ATV when it\u2019s ten below outside,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m handicapped.\u201d</p><p>Boos rang out, followed by laughter and trash-talking.</p><p>Kade leaned over. \u201cSeriously. Don\u2019t wait to tell Ginger how you feel about her until you think she\u2019s ready to hear it. If she\u2019s anything like Sky, and I suspect she is, she already knows how you feel. She just needs tangible proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice, but I ain\u2019t getting a tattoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll be surprised what you\u2019ll do in the name of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two done sharin\u2019 hairdo tips and secrets so we can play poker?\u201d Colt rubbed his hands together with glee. \u201cI\u2019m feelin\u2019 lucky.\u201d</p><p>That reminded Kane he was wearing his lucky ball cap. It also reminded him that he missed Hayden as much as he missed Ginger. Rather than dwell on what he couldn\u2019t change tonight, but what he was goddamned sure he was gonna change as soon as humanly possible, he readjusted his cap and grabbed the cards. \u201cAnte up, boys.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Ginger missed Kane. It was an odd feeling. She\u2019d never had a man in her life that she cared enough about to miss.</p><p>And it\u2019d only been a week.</p><p>Despite feeling lousy, Ginger allowed Hayden to invite his friends Kyler and Anton McKay for a sleepover. The boys amused themselves, but seeing Kyler reminded Ginger of Kane. The boy was all McKay with his dark hair, blue eyes and boyish cowboy charm.</p><p>Week two didn\u2019t fly by any faster than week one had.</p><p>When Ginger threw up her breakfast, lunch and supper for three days straight, she knew she\u2019d have to break down and make a doctor\u2019s appointment. It\u2019d been a lousy winter regarding her health, between the accident and the sinus infection that\u2019d dragged on for a solid month. Her immune system was slacking; she\u2019d caught every virus that\u2019d come down the pike. Grateful as she was that neither Hayden nor her father had contracted anything from her, she was damn sick of being sick.</p><p>Doc Monroe ordered a bunch of tests. The worst one was the influenza A test, when the nurse stuck a tube up her nose to gather mucus. Urine and blood work were a piece of cake in comparison.</p><p>She sat in the exam room, staring at her sock-clad feet. She\u2019d felt so rotten and off-balance the last three weeks she hadn\u2019t even worn high-heeled shoes.</p><p>Ten minutes ticked by. She rolled down on the exam table. Even that simple movement sent her stomach churning. She curled into a ball, pulling the blanket under her chin. Maybe if she closed her eyes the room would stop spinning.</p><p>\u201cGinger?\u201d</p><p>She jumped and sat up, completely disoriented. \u201cSorry, I fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019re overbooked today.\u201d</p><p>Ginger rearranged the sheet across her thighs after she tugged down the hospital gown. She looked at Joely, flipping back and forth between pages in her medical chart. \u201cSo Doc, what\u2019s the prognosis?</p><p>Influenza A?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You tested negative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Is it swine flu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tested negative for that too.\u201d</p><p>When Dr. Monroe set the clipboard aside and pinched the bridge of her nose, Ginger had her first feeling of alarm. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of questions first. You were on a ten-day cycle of antibiotics after your accident, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then, according to your patient\u2019s report, you filled a fourteen-day-cycle prescription of antibiotics for a sinus infection four weeks before that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But it didn\u2019t seem to work, so I refilled it again a couple of weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, you should\u2019ve set up an appointment instead of getting a refill, an oversight I\u2019ve corrected by canceling your standing prescription at DeWitt\u2019s. I\u2019m curious to know the details of your sinus infection symptoms, and why you didn\u2019t feel the antibiotic worked.\u201d</p><p>Ginger frowned. \u201cBesides my head being stuffy? I constantly have a headache. My equilibrium is off and I get motion sick very easily. So I\u2019m nauseous and dog-tired all the time.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Monroe crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cGinger. You\u2019re a smart woman. How could you not read the warning labels on the drug information sheet? I know you got them. I know you scour them if it\u2019s Hayden\u2019s medication. But you don\u2019t do that for yourself?\u201d</p><p>Not a good sign, getting her ass chewed by her doctor.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the CliffsNotes version of pharmacology. Antibiotics can render birth control pills ineffective, especially the low dosage type you\u2019re currently taking. I would\u2019ve made a point of discussing it with you if I\u2019d known you were sexually active\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis hasn\u2019t ever been an issue before because I\u2019ve been a freakin\u2019 monk since I moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did your abstinence status change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter my accident. When Kane stayed with us. It just sort of...happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was a one-time thing?\u201d</p><p>Ginger bit her lip, tempted to lie. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a one-time thing. God. He\u2019s become like this...addiction. We\u2019re doing it all the freakin\u2019 time. I can\u2019t keep my hands off him and Kane can\u2019t keep his hands off me. I\u2019ve never felt this way about any man.\u201d Ginger inhaled slowly and steadily. \u201cIt\u2019s like my hormones have taken control of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hormones are in control, Ginger, because you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open and all the air emptied from her lungs. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou honestly had no clue?\u201d Dr. Monroe asked gently, but with a hint of skepticism.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYour last menstrual cycle ended...just after New Year\u2019s?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She paused and counted. \u201cOh. My. God. It\u2019s...March!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means, in my estimation, that you are eight weeks pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Holy hell. She\u2019d probably gotten pregnant the very first time they\u2019d had sex. Ginger\u2019s thoughts bounced like a million rubber balls. Her tears fell\u2014part frustration, part relief, part fear. \u201cHow am I going to tell Kane? He\u2019s been calving for almost three weeks and he has limited cell phone service...\u201d Not something she wanted to tell him over the phone anyway.</p> <p>But Dr. Monroe didn\u2019t have any magical advice about how to break the news to the father-to-be. She helped Ginger sit up. \u201cEat small meals until the morning sickness passes. I\u2019ll give you vitamins. And obviously you can stop taking the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Ginger dressed. She ran her hand down her stomach. Was it her imagination or did she have pooch there? Already?</p><p>She dreaded going back to the office, so she wandered down the sidewalk and found herself standing in front of Sky Blue.</p><p>Coincidence?</p><p>The aroma of sage, lemongrass and lavender greeted her. Followed by the sweet scent of wild summer roses, the crisp, clean tang of freshly laundered clothes hanging on the line, and an earthy trace of newly mown grass.</p> <p>\u201cGinger! Good to see you,\u201d Skylar said behind her.</p><p>She spun around. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been in to browse. There are so many new products.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should try the goat\u2019s milk soap. It\u2019s unbelievably creamy and the almond scent is to die for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019d you start this line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months ago. Kade\u2019s cousin Chassie raises goats and she has leftover milk from cheese making, so we experimented and came up with a few products. They\u2019ve been very popular. We\u2019re working on a new liquid hand soap that\u2019ll infuse the scent of chokecherry blossoms.\u201d</p><p>Ginger set two bars of soap on the counter. \u201cHow do you do it all? Run a business and have time to experiment with new products while you\u2019ve got a husband and three kids at home?\u201d</p> <p>Skylar rested her chin on her hand. \u201cNo clue. Some days it\u2019s easy. Some days I wonder when I decided to join a circus. A flea circus with all the damn strays Eliza drags home,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI imagine you have days like those, running a law practice, raising a kid and having your dad living with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s manageable. Or it was until I realized that I\u2019ve got no backup plan in case something unexpected happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your accident?\u201d</p><p>Like the accidental pregnancy. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re fully recovered from your fall?\u201d</p><p>With the exception of falling in love with your brother-in-law.</p><p>Man, she was punchy today. \u201cSo far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad Kane was able to help you out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe volunteered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise move on his part because I doubt you would\u2019ve asked him.\u201d</p><p>Ginger met Skylar\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to ask for help. Trust me, I get that. It\u2019s a continual struggle for me, even now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to deal with things myself.\u201d</p><p>Sky looked at her thoughtfully. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking about your law practice, are you?\u201d</p><p>Ginger shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about how you and Kane met and how you ended up married to his twin.\u201d</p><p>If Skylar thought the question bizarre, it didn\u2019t register on her face. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t know all the gossip. My first date wasn\u2019t with Kade but with Kane. The man was a total asshole. Such an asshole, that when I saw him on the street a week later, I called him out on his horrible behavior. He blushed and stammered and was so contrite, that when he swore he\u2019d make it up to me...I let him. We started seeing each other. Turned out the guy with the guilty conscience wasn\u2019t Kane, but Kade. And it was Kade I fell in love with, but it took me a long time to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until Eliza was five months old. The abbreviated version\u2014when I discovered he\u2019d been lying to me, I broke it off. At that point I was already pregnant. Due to his responsibilities to the ranch, Kade left for a year and when he came back he learned he had a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him you were pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to get ahold of him after I found out, but it was easier to give up than to track him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Kade upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And no. He just accepted Eliza, moved in and basically took control of owning up to his responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>That sounded exactly like something Kane would do.</p><p>\u201cKnow my biggest regret?\u201d Skylar mused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t accept Kade at face value. There was no ulterior motive in him wanting to be with me. He wasn\u2019t like any other man I\u2019d ever met and I was wrong to expect he\u2019d disappoint me like every other man in my life. Kade was exactly the good guy he appeared to be. He still is. And every minute of every day I count my lucky stars that he\u2019s in my life. He is my life. Does that sound sappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds heavenly, Sky. You are a very lucky woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be lucky too, Ginger.\u201d Skylar pinned her with a look. \u201cI suspect we have more in common than you\u2019ll admit.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, we both got knocked up by one of the McKay twins.</p><p>Ginger managed a wan smile. \u201cThanks for talking to me.\u201d She pointed to the lavender shampoo on the display wall and slid her credit card across the counter. \u201cBefore you total me up, I need a bottle of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny. Kane bought the exact same kind yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cKane was in here? Yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He watched the twins for me in the morning for about twenty minutes when I ran to the bank.</p><p>Then he said he had some errands to run. Why?\u201d</p><p>Be cool. \u201cOh, I thought he was calving. He hasn\u2019t been around for any of the Little Buddies events for the past few weeks and Hayden\u2019s been asking me when Buck is coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been back a couple days.\u201d Skylar totaled up the sale and swiped Ginger\u2019s credit card.</p><p>So. Kane had been around for two days and he hadn\u2019t bothered to call her?</p><p>Maybe he has a good reason.</p><p>Or maybe three weeks away hadn\u2019t made Kane\u2019s heart grow fonder.</p><p>Can you blame him? When you won\u2019t acknowledge you\u2019re a couple?</p><p>But that\u2019d been Kane\u2019s idea\u2014to sneak around. She\u2019d never suggested it, let alone demanded it.</p><p>Yet you\u2019ve done nothing to change it, even after everything changed between you. What if you\u2019ve waited too long? You waited after the blizzard to contact him because you didn\u2019t want to seem...needy. You never told him you loved his rougher edges when you knew he feared he\u2019d stepped out of line. You didn\u2019t tell him you love him because you\u2019re waiting for him to tell you first.</p><p>Her stomach churned.</p><p>Dear God, no. Not now. She swallowed repeatedly against the bile rising in the back of her throat.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your card\u2014my goodness, Ginger, are you all right? You\u2019re almost green. Maybe you\u2019d better sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine. Thanks. I just need some fresh air.\u201d She quickly signed the slip and hustled out.</p><p>But once she was back outside in the frigid air, she had the same sense of displacement. She didn\u2019t want to go back to her office. She looked at her watch. Noon. She needed to compose her thoughts and she couldn\u2019t do it at Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish, where she\u2019d be forced to make small talk with whoever crossed her path. Plus, she\u2019d have to try not to barf in public.</p><p>Ginger she cut through the alley and entered the Golden Boot.</p><p>Lettie smiled at her after she plopped on the barstool. \u201cWhat\u2019s your poison today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA glass of Sprite would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComin\u2019 right up.\u201d Lettie slid the glass in front of her. \u201cNeed anything else, just holler.\u201d</p><p>Ginger hunkered down and considered her options. She could call Kane and demand he come into her office so they could discuss this situation like rational adults. She\u2019d be on her turf, in professional mode.</p><p>A surgically enhanced blonde sidled up to the bar. When the woman faced her, Ginger inwardly groaned. Of all the people she could run into today, did it have to be her?</p><p>Daphne frowned at Ginger prettily. \u201cI know you. You\u2019re Hayden\u2019s mom, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. How are you, Daphne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirsty.\u201d Daphne dropped a ten dollar bill on the bar top when Lettie asked for her order. \u201cVodka sour.\u201d</p><p>The woman was in the bar at noon, having a drink?</p><p>You\u2019re in the bar at noon, and if you weren\u2019t pregnant you\u2019d be having a drink yourself.</p><p>Self-chastised, Ginger politely asked, \u201cSo wasn\u2019t it scary when the boys got snowed in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock didn\u2019t go on that field trip since he and Hayden ain\u2019t in the same class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if you did, since Lock and Hayden don\u2019t run in the same crowd. Lock is a sports nut and he hates being in the classroom. He tells me Hayden is some kind of genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d Ginger demurred.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Lock has real trouble with his homework.\u201d</p><p>Ginger bit back her retort, \u201cHe\u2019s struggling in third grade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchool wasn\u2019t really my thing neither, so he probably gets that from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d Ginger asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a nail technician.\u201d Daphne twisted a section of hair, bleached to blinding white platinum, around her index finger, which boasted a fake gemstone that nearly reached her knuckle. \u201cHow about you? You ain\u2019t from around here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI moved to Wyoming a few years ago to take over my father\u2019s law practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>Ginger almost laughed at the comical look on Daphne\u2019s face. She half expected Daphne to blurt, \u201cBut you don\u2019t look that smart!\u201d Wouldn\u2019t have been the first time Ginger had heard that. \u201cYes, I am. Are you originally from Sundance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBorn and raised in Lusk. Moved to Sundance to be with Lock\u2019s daddy, but the man took off before Lock was born so it\u2019s just been me and him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d Ginger offered.</p><p>\u201cMen. Only good for one thing. Since my daddy took off too, I wanted something different for my boy, so I signed up Lock for that Little Buddies program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been great for Hayden.\u201d</p><p>Daphne gave Ginger a curious once-over. \u201cYou mean Buck\u2019s been great for Hayden?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you request Buck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hayden was assigned to Kane from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I specifically requested him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Daphne pursed her pink frosted lips around the straw and sucked. \u201cThose dreamy McKay blue eyes, that hard, toned body, that sexy grin? The man is prime. And now that he\u2019s officially dropped out of the Little Buddies program? He\u2019s fair game.\u201d</p> <p>All the air left Ginger\u2019s lungs. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Daphne smirked. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know Buck resigned from the program?\u201d</p><p>Stunned, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHe called and left a message on our home phone yesterday. Supposedly to let Lock know he was quitting, but I can read between the lines.\u201d Daphne leaned closer and confided, \u201cHe was letting me know he\u2019s free. There\u2019s always been a spark between Buck and me, even when I knew he\u2019d never act on it because of what\u2019d happened with Brandi.\u201d</p><p>For Christsake. Who the hell was this Brandi person? And why did it seem everyone in town knew more about the man whose child she carried than she did?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what happened with Kane and Brandi?\u201d Daphne prodded.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ginger waited, expecting Daphne to confide in her.</p><p>But Daphne just gave her a smug smile and grabbed her drink. \u201cSee ya around.\u201d</p> <p>Ginger huddled into her coat and left the Golden Boot via the side door. Arctic wind gusts blasted her face as she returned to her office, but she scarcely noticed because she was absolutely numb. Maybe Daphne wouldn\u2019t tell what the hell had gone on between Kane and Brandi, but she knew someone who would.</p><p>She dialed Stacy Lynnwood, director of Crook County First Start, which oversaw the Big Buddies/Little Buddies program.</p><p>Stacy\u2019s assistant patched Ginger through. \u201cThis is Stacy Lynnwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStacy. Ginger Paulson. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Are you all healed up from your accident?\u201d</p><p>All except for the accidental pregnancy. Ginger cleared her throat. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not calling me on an official legal matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A little more personal. Kane has been Hayden\u2019s Big Buddy for two years and I\u2019m wondering why he resigned without warning. Was it his choice? Or was it a decision the board handed down because he\u2019d violated the board\u2019s policy?\u201d</p><p>A long pause ensued and Ginger assumed Stacy was mentally composing a brush off. Papers shuffled in the background.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard there\u2019s been disciplinary action taken against Kane before. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I suppose it doesn\u2019t really matter now, anyway,\u201d Stacy grumbled. \u201cKane McKay was put on notice from his very first Little Buddy assignment. He almost got kicked out of the program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInappropriate behavior.\u201d</p><p>Rather than jump to conclusions, she said, \u201cMeaning what? Inappropriate behavior on whose part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the boy\u2019s mother\u2019s exhibited inappropriate behavior toward Kane. He immediately requested her son be transferred to another Big Buddy. The woman turned belligerent and accused Kane of punishing her son because she\u2019d turned down Kane\u2019s sexual advances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane was cleared because it was a lie. Several people substantiated Kane\u2019s side of the story. Sadly, the woman\u2019s son was banned from the program because of her actions.\u201d</p><p>Ginger paced in front of the window. \u201cKane\u2019s been in the clear since then? No misconduct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been an exemplary mentor. We are very upset to be losing him.\u201d</p><p>Too bad for you, but I\u2019m not going to lose him.</p><p>Ginger wasn\u2019t about to wait around for Kane to come to her. Screw that. For the first time in a long time she\u2019d be proactive, instead of reactive. No more keeping her heart hidden, afraid that Kane might crush it or break it.</p><p>No, Ginger was going to throw herself on his mercy and hope like hell he wouldn\u2019t sentence her to a life of misery without him.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Although another vehicle was parked in the drive at Kane\u2019s place, Ginger gathered her courage, got out of the van and scaled the steps. But she didn\u2019t see a patch of ice on the top stair. Her feet went out from underneath her and she landed face first on the deck with a loud \u201cUff.\u201d</p><p>The door flew open and Kane skidded to a stop in his bare feet. \u201cGinger?\u201d He dropped to his knees beside her in the snow and rolled her over. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>With the wind knocked out of her, she couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Red. Don\u2019t do this to me.\u201d He scooped her into his arms, as if she were a waif-like child, and carried her inside his trailer, shouldering past Kade who held the door open. Kane laid her on the couch and brushed the snow from her face and hair. He unzipped her coat.</p><p>Kane was oblivious to his brother standing behind him as he ran his hands all over her body with obvious familiarity. Starting at her neck and clavicle, down both arms to check her wrists and palms. Then down the center of her torso, individually poking her ribs, curling his hands around her hips to see if she winced. Venturing south, over her thighs, knees and shins. His hands stopped at the top of her fleece lined snow boots. He met her gaze.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the ankle-breaking shoes that are the problem, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m such a klutz and an idiot\u2014\u201d</p><p>He placed his fingers over her mouth. \u201cStop. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAbout gave me heart failure when I heard that god-awful crash on the deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout gave me heart failure when I heard you\u2019ve been back and you haven\u2019t called me, but you managed to call Daphne.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Kade cleared his throat. \u201cAh. I\u2019ll just be takin\u2019 off. Call if you need me, bro.\u201d The door slammed behind him.</p><p>\u201cDid you come here to chew my ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d The instant she was upright, Kane began to pace, which was completely unlike him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you resign from the Big Buddies/Little Buddies program?\u201d</p><p>That stopped him in his tracks. \u201cHow\u2019d you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaphne told me when I ran into her at the Golden Boot. Is it true?\u201d</p><p>Surly, he said, \u201cWhy you askin\u2019 me? You already seem to have the answer.\u201d</p><p>Ginger wagged her finger at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to pull that bullshit evasion. I\u2019m asking you to tell me all of it right now. Full disclosure, Kane.\u201d</p><p>His voice dropped lethally low. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in court, counselor. I ain\u2019t some witness you\u2019re cross-examining.\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cFine. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. I found out because ninety percent of my job is research. After Daphne dropped the bombshell, I called Stacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she just told you?\u201d he said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYes. You are assigned to my son, so your resignation does affect me.\u201d She met his perplexed gaze head on. \u201cI hated that you called Daphne and not me. I hated that Daphne acted as if she had a claim on you. After what\u2019s happened with us the last couple months, it pissed me off. I have a claim on you first, Kane.\u201d</p><p>Kane moved in and braced his hands on the back of the couch, forcing her to look up at him. \u201cYou have a funny way of showin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Daphne? You thought... I told you once how I felt about Daphne. Dammit, Ginger. Do you think I fall in love with every woman whose son I mentor? You\u2019re the first. You\u2019re the only.\u201d</p><p>When Kane realized he\u2019d admitted he loved her, he immediately retreated.</p><p>But Ginger wouldn\u2019t allow it. She grabbed handfuls of his shirt and held him in place. \u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her with that damnable inscrutable look.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question, Mr. McKay. Do you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Goddammit, I\u2019m in love with you. Must you interrogate me about every damn thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019m not done badgering you. Second question. Do you love me because you care about Hayden so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If it weren\u2019t for Hayden, we wouldn\u2019t have crossed paths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re so different, you and I? Because I wear heels and you wear boots? Because I study the law and you study the land? Because I\u2019m a homebody and you used to be a party animal? Well, here\u2019s a newsflash, Kane, I was too intimidated by you to make a move on you. For two years! You were this gorgeous gentleman cowboy and my son worshipped you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAre you serious? Wanna hear something totally fuckin\u2019 sappy? I still remember what you wore the first time we met. A pink and white flowered dress and pink spike heels with the sexiest strap that crossed at the ankle. I acted as tongue-tied as a fourteen-year-old boy. Talk about bein\u2019 outta my league.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. Kane recalled that vividly what she\u2019d worn? She\u2019d taken special care not to dress provocatively, and she remembered he\u2019d barely given her a second glance. He\u2019d focused all his attention on her son. And she hadn\u2019t minded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut these last few months when I\u2019ve gotten to know you? How I feel about you has nothin\u2019 to do with Hayden. Besides the fact he\u2019s such a great kid because he\u2019s got such a great mom.\u201d</p><p>Tears flooded her eyes. \u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish. Yesterday, as soon as we finished calving, I stopped by Stacy Lynnwood\u2019s office and resigned as a mentor in the Big Buddies/Little Buddies program. I didn\u2019t give her a specific reason.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cI assume Stacy told you about what\u2019d happened with Brandi?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot in detail, just the general gist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you understand why I didn\u2019t want our relationship to be dissected by the organization or anyone else?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo I resigned. That wasn\u2019t something I was gonna tell you over the phone. I don\u2019t want to be in your life only as Hayden\u2019s mentor. I want to be in your life as your lover and your partner. I want us to be a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt.\u201d He dropped to his knees and gathered both her hands in his. \u201cI\u2019d hoped to do this differently, but I ain\u2019t gonna wait for the right time because I\u2019m tired of wasting time. Ginger Paulson, I love you like crazy. Will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>Oh dear God. The man wanted to marry her before he knew she was pregnant? She swallowed hard.</p><p>But the nauseous feeling that\u2019d been building wouldn\u2019t go away. Saliva pooled in her mouth and she swallowed over and over, but it was pointless. She said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d She clapped her hand over her mouth and stumbled to the bathroom, barely making it before she puked.</p><p>After her stomach emptied the last of the Sprite, she flushed the toilet, wobbled to her feet and rinsed her mouth. Feeling dizzy, she rested against the shower door and slid to the floor, eyes closed in absolute mortification.</p><p>She heard Kane enter the bathroom. Water ran. A cool washcloth pressed against her forehead. The warmth of Kane\u2019s body and his familiar scent enveloped her as he sat beside her. Without thought, she leaned into him.</p><p>Kane said, \u201cSo the thought of marryin\u2019 me makes you physically ill?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes flew open. \u201cNo. God no. Don\u2019t think that. It\u2019s so far from the truth you have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>Ginger lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Every bit of color drained from Kane\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cEvidently you\u2019re supposed to use alternative methods of birth control when you\u2019re on the pill and taking antibiotics.\u201d</p><p>Kane slumped back against the shower door. \u201cI\u2019ll be goddammed. How far along are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess about two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess it ain\u2019t a blizzard baby like everyone one else\u2019s,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan this. I feel like such a freakin\u2019 idiot. Another unintended pregnancy? I\u2019ve had one.</p><p>You\u2019d think I\u2019d have learned my lesson by now. But no. Here I am. Thirty-seven years old, pregnant again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly since this morning. When I heard from Skylar that you\u2019d been in town for two days, and Daphne said you called her last night...\u2018Hey, you\u2019re gonna be a daddy\u2019 is not exactly news I wanted to break over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you understand why I wanted to tell you and Hayden in person that I\u2019d resigned from the program?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ginger looked at him. \u201cI wanted to tell you this in person too. I love you. You\u2019re only the third man I\u2019ve ever said that to in my life, the first two being my son and my father. You\u2019re too good to be true, Kane McKay, and why no other woman has snatched you up for herself absolutely boggles my mind. I\u2019ve probably fucked this up completely by acting neurotic and jealous and needy. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget about me accidentally getting pregnant.\u201d A small sob escaped.</p><p>\u201cHey. Hey.\u201d Kane trapped her face in his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. It rips me clean apart. The only way you\u2019ll screw this up is if you say no to marryin\u2019 me.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cI love you too, sugar. And at the risk of soundin\u2019 smug, I ain\u2019t exactly gonna be cryin\u2019 in my beer over the fact that I knocked up the smartest, sexiest, funniest, most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>More tears leaked out. \u201cYou are so sweet. And not so sweet.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>\u201cI like your rougher edges. Even in bed. It surprised me how much I liked you just taking what you wanted that morning after the snowstorm. I freaked out a little because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because I did like it so much. It scared me to think I could give up everything to you if you asked. But that\u2019s the real truth, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019ll never ask for more than I\u2019m willing to give you and you\u2019ll give me what I need even when I\u2019m not exactly sure what that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGinger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I never meant to make you think I couldn\u2019t handle it. Or you. I like all sides of you, Kane McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes to my marriage proposal?\u201d</p><p>Ginger snorted. \u201cYes. As if there was ever any doubt that I\u2019d marry you.\u201d</p><p>He beamed a grin that caused her heart to skip a beat. \u201cWanna know something else?\u201d He laughed a little nervously. \u201cI was busier than you know while I was sneaking around in town yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStopped by your house and asked your father for his blessing to marry you. I wasn\u2019t gonna ask the ornery bugger for his permission and give him a chance to say no, but I didn\u2019t want to spring it on him, either. He\u2019s a big part of your life, which means he\u2019ll be a big part of mine too.\u201d</p><p>This sweet, fiery, protective man had thought of everything that was important to her. \u201cDoes Hayden know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I figured we could tell Hayden together if I got you to say yes and had the ring on your finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already bought a ring?\u201d</p><p>His face flushed crimson. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic. But I never thought I\u2019d be showin\u2019 it to you in the crapper.</p><p>Christ Almighty, talk about romantic.\u201d</p><p>Ginger touched his jaw. \u201cThat you want to be with me forever is highly romantic.\u201d</p><p>He rummaged in his vest pocket, bringing out a small black velvet bag with a gold drawstring.</p><p>She reached for it and he moved it out of reach.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Close your eyes and give me your left hand.\u201d</p><p>Cool metal circled her fourth finger.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Now you can look.\u201d</p><p>Even in dim bathroom lighting the ring sparkled. The round emerald was nestled in the middle of silver vines, connected to clusters of small pink stones surrounded by rectangular diamonds that fanned out to create flowers. She gasped and blinked at him. \u201cOh my God, Kane. This is exquisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe green stone reminded me of your eyes.\u201d His thumb swept over the center of the ring. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a custom design, but it seemed like fate when I saw it. The pink diamonds reminded me of the dress you wore when we first met, so I just went ahead and bought it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Kane blushed again. \u201cColt called me a pussy and told me to man up, grow up and marry you. So he and Kade dragged my ass to Spearfish when we had a small break durin\u2019 calving.\u201d</p><p>Ginger brought his hand to her lips and kissed his rough-skinned knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m so going to love being married to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I buy you jewelry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because you are the best man, with the biggest heart, that I\u2019ve ever known, and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have found you. I\u2019d take you to bed to prove it, but I\u2019m still feeling barfy.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes clouded with concern. \u201cIs this normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. It was a blur being pregnant with Hayden, especially those early months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sugar, I\u2019ll be involved every step of the way this time so don\u2019t even think about tryin\u2019 to handle any of this on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough havin\u2019 a baby is gonna be cool, the bonus is I get Hayden as mine. I want to adopt him, Red. Make him my son in name too.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always suspected Hayden had been Kane\u2019s son in his heart. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Kane helped her to her feet. He wrapped his fingers around her upper arms and studied her intently.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think he\u2019s gonna react?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cHe\u2019ll throw up?\u201d</p><p>Ginger smiled. \u201cProbably. Then he\u2019ll strut around like he hit the lottery.\u201d She tapped him on the chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to take full credit for us getting together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the Little Buddies program?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because of the lucky hat he gave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked. I\u2019m unlucky at cards, but I\u2019m damn lucky in love.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Two weeks later...</p><p>Kane whistled as he scaled the steps to Ginger\u2019s office.</p><p>He found himself whistling all the damn time in the last two weeks since Ginger agreed to make him the happiest man alive. So far they\u2019d only hit a few bumps in the road in melding their lives together.</p><p>They\u2019d decided on a small ceremony at the courthouse, keeping the attendance to immediate family: Hayden and Dash, his folks, Kade and Skylar and their girls. Ginger\u2019s best friend, Ava Dumond, was flying in from California to stand up for Ginger and he\u2019d tapped Kade as his best man.</p><p>But the after party, held at the Golden Boot, courtesy of his parents and Dash Paulson, would include all his McKay relations, as well as relatives from the West side, and all of Dash\u2019s friends and clients over the years. His mother was in hog heaven planning the shindig with his Aunt Carolyn, who\u2019d been through her fair share of McKay wedding receptions. Dash just rolled his eyes and opened his checkbook. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hayden had taken the news of them becoming a family far better than either he or Ginger anticipated.</p><p>When Kane mentioned adoption, Hayden immediately stopped calling him Buck and started calling him</p><p>\u201cDad\u201d, which had been beyond cool in Kane\u2019s opinion. But it also drove home the point there was a big difference between being a Big Buddy and being a father. But he couldn\u2019t imagine loving any kid more than he did Hayden.</p> <p>Kane knocked on Ginger\u2019s office door. He heard a muffled \u201cCome in,\u201d and entered the room.</p><p>The redheaded woman of his dreams stood in front of the window behind her desk, her left arm braced across her lower belly, her left hand up by her face.</p><p>\u201cGinger? Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and he was by her side instantaneously.</p><p>Kane turned her to face him. His heart plummeted at seeing her tear-stained face and red-rimmed eyes. \u201cDo you feel all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her arms circled his waist. She sobbed against his chest. She cried so hard he couldn\u2019t make heads nor tails of the words.</p><p>He held her, attempting to soothe her. When her cries faded, he tipped her chin up and wiped her tears. \u201cYou\u2019re scarin\u2019 me. What\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my dad. You know he\u2019s supposed to stay at the retirement home temporarily while we\u2019re on our honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>Kane nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, he told me he\u2019s moving in there permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t want to get in the way of us becoming a real family and it\u2019d be best all around if he just moved out. Why would he even say that?\u201d</p><p>Because the old coot was being a damn fool and still making assumptions.</p><p>\u201cI just want to scream at him. Then I think great, if I\u2019m even remotely considering berating a handicapped man...what kind of mother am I going to be to this baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. Hey. C\u2019mere.\u201d Kane\u2019s heart broke with her every stuttered sob. He led her to the couch in the corner of her office. \u201cSit. Relax. Better yet, lay down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to lie down. I have to talk to him. Right away, before we get married and go on our honeymoon. I have to make him understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to chill out. Getting all worked up ain\u2019t good for you. Now I want you to lay here and think happy thoughts until you\u2019ve calmed down.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled and released a long sigh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl. I\u2019ll go talk to Dash. See if I can\u2019t get to the bottom of it, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know by now that I\u2019d do anything for you?\u201d He pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t just about you. It affects all of us. You don\u2019t have to do any of this alone any more, Ginger.\u201d</p><p>Tears shimmered in her eyes again. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Stop cryin\u2019, sugar. I\u2019ll send Rissa in with some tea before you upset yourself to the point you start barfin\u2019 again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late. Oh God. Hand me the garbage can.\u201d</p><p>Lightning fast, he had the small garbage can by the edge of the couch. \u201cYou want me to stay and hold your hair?\u201d He\u2019d gotten in a lot of practice holding her hair and rubbing her back as she suffered through morning sickness. Although he felt guilty as hell their child was making her the vomit queen, he was so damn excited about this baby he could hardly stand it. But he\u2019d hold off on telling her his mother\u2019s suspicions on why Ginger was so sick...at least until after the honeymoon and Doc Monroe confirmed it at their first prenatal appointment.</p><p>\u201cNo. Go. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>With one last, lingering look, he left and spoke to Rissa before heading outside.</p><p>In a town the size of Sundance, it took him about four minutes to walk to the retirement home. He brushed off the snow from his clothes and hat, thinking in three days he and Ginger would be in sunny California enjoying a week at Ava\u2019s beach house, just the two of them.</p><p>He walked up to the kiosk and recognized the woman manning the desk as a former classmate. \u201cLucy.</p><p>How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I hear congratulations are in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Lucy leaned closer. \u201cTell me the truth, wild man McKay. Are you nervous about settling down with just one woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Been waiting for her all my life.\u201d Kane smiled because the question didn\u2019t bother him.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you stashed Dash Paulson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoom twelve.\u201d</p><p>He skirted wheelchairs and carts until he stood in front of the right door. It was fully open, but he knocked anyway. \u201cDash? You in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d</p><p>Kane fought his Testy much? response.</p><p>\u201cYou might as well come in and sit down.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly a hearty welcome. Kane crossed the tile floor. It was the first time he\u2019d been in this side of the nursing home/assisted living facility. The space had a living area with a big picture window, and a loveseat and a chair. The TV was on an end table, shoved against the wall. A kitchenette consisted of a countertop with stools beneath and a small refrigerator and a microwave on the opposite wall. No stove. A doorway off to the left led to a bedroom and a bathroom. Everything in the place was brand new and handicapped-accessible.</p><p>\u201cDid my daughter send you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I volunteered.\u201d Kane took off his coat and plopped on the couch. He waited for Dash to wheel to the open spot beside the recliner. \u201cSo what\u2019s this bullshit about you movin\u2019 in here permanently?\u201d</p><p>Dash straightened in his wheelchair, notching up his stubborn chin. \u201cNot bullshit. It\u2019s time I permanently settle in a place like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is the bed comfier here?\u201d</p><p>That gave Dash pause. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTastier food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Kane glanced around the room. \u201cIt can\u2019t be lure of the luxury atmosphere that\u2019s makin\u2019 you uproot your life. This place is more bland than my trailer.\u201d Kane\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIs this about sex? Are you knockin\u2019 boots with a horny widow and you want privacy to get it on?\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s mouth dropped open. Then snapped shut. \u201cWhat in the hell is wrong with you, McKay? Even if I was, what business is it of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days from now, what happens in this family definitely will be my business. So if you ain\u2019t upgraded to a place that\u2019s better, why would you wanna leave the comforts of the home you\u2019ve already got?\u201d</p><p>When Dash cocked his head and studied him, Kane was glad he\u2019d never stood before this man when he\u2019d been Judge Dash Paulson.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re a straight shooter, I\u2019ll give it to you plain. I never intended to live with Ginger and Hayden forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d</p><p>Dash nodded. \u201cMy daughter seemed eager to create that happy family vibe she\u2019d been denied growing up and I went along with it to make her happy. I\u2019d always hoped she\u2019d find a good man and settle down.</p><p>Now that she\u2019s about to get married, it\u2019s time for me to let her have her own family life.\u201d</p><p>Kane looked at Dash coolly. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re bein\u2019 honest and all... Have I ever given you the sense that I don\u2019t want you around?\u201d</p><p>Another confused look. \u201cWell, no. But you\u2019ve got to admit taking on the responsibility of a wife, a young boy, and soon enough, a baby, is plenty to have on your plate. You\u2019ll still be ranching fulltime too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe I can\u2019t do it all...because I ain\u2019t got a college degree? That juggling several roles is beyond my limited capabilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the real reason for you bailin\u2019 on your family?\u201d</p><p>Dash glared at him. \u201cBlast it, boy, I\u2019m giving you an out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy making sure that taking care of an infirm old man isn\u2019t on your list of roles. Despite the fact I\u2019ve hired a male nurse to assist me with personal needs I can no longer do for myself, I\u2019d still be underfoot all the time. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d be happy about that.\u201d</p><p>Kane counted to ten. \u201cYou think I\u2019m that shallow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe at first I wasn\u2019t thrilled when I figured out you two had feelings for each other.\u201d He pointed at Kane. \u201cAnd yes, this was before you volunteered to \u2018help\u2019 out after her accident. I worried about your previous ladies\u2019 man reputation and I believed you\u2019d get fed up with her after a spell and Ginger would end up getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>Her take-charge nature appealed to him, but he appreciated that she was comfortable enough to let him call the shots.</p><p>\u201cSince she\u2019s established herself here, it\u2019s not like she can run away, like she did after that rotten business in California.\u201d</p><p>Again, he fought the urge to defend himself. \u201cI sense a \u2018but\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was wrong to be worried. I\u2019m glad I kept my damn fool mouth shut and let this play out between you two without my interference. You\u2019re a good man and the best thing that\u2019s happened to her since she moved to Sundance. You two need a chance to...bond or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Ginger\u2019s mornin\u2019 sickness is proof of how well she and I have already bonded,\u201d Kane said dryly.</p><p>The corners of Dash\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Hayden? He\u2019s always spent so much time with you. Doesn\u2019t your grandson get his say about how this move will affect him?\u201d</p><p>Sadness flickered in Dash\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat boy can come and see me a couple of times a week. Besides, you\u2019ll need time to build a father bond with Hayden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the father bond you\u2019ve finally built with Ginger?\u201d Kane countered. \u201cYou just gonna throw that away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Dash placed his gnarled hands on his knees. \u201cBut be honest, wouldn\u2019t it be better if I wasn\u2019t there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBetter for who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Kane gave him a long, measured look. \u201cDid you know that my Grandpa McKay lived with us from my fourth birthday until he passed when I was almost thirteen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI vaguely recall something about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Carson was older than my dad by like ten minutes, Grandpop deeded him the family ranch house after my grandma died. Plus, Uncle Carson and Aunt Carolyn kept havin\u2019 all them kids and needed the space. Grandpop didn\u2019t much like his son Casper, so movin\u2019 in with him was out as an option. And he wasn\u2019t too fond of my Uncle Charles\u2019 wife, Vi, neither. So he came to live with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d your mama feel about that? Wasn\u2019t there bad blood between the Wests and the McKays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor years. But my Ma never got along with her own father, and Grandpop never had a daughter, so surprisingly, the two of them hit it off like gangbusters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to like your mama.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is something else.\u201d Kane smiled. \u201cSo Kade and I were raised by both our parents and our grandfather. It didn\u2019t cause problems because Ma and Dad handled all the discipline. Grandpop never butted in\u2014at least if he did, it wasn\u2019t in front of my brother and me. He taught us everything from how to hunt and fish, to how to rope and ride. How being honest wasn\u2019t a character trait to be discarded when it suited.\u201d</p><p>Dash was quiet for a spell and Kane wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d gotten his point across.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s where I\u2019m back to reminding you that I can\u2019t do any of those things with my grandson because I\u2019m in this damn wheelchair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs frustrating as that must be to you, who taught Hayden how to play chess? Or to use critical thinking skills? You\u2019ve passed on your love of history to him. The kid devours books. Just because you\u2019re not out on a horse with him or worming a fishhook for him don\u2019t mean you\u2019re useless to him. Far from it, Dash.\u201d When the man opened his mouth to argue, Kane braced himself to fight back with everything he had.</p><p>\u201cThe McKay family is massive. Now Hayden will have cousins, aunts and uncles and more family than he can shake a stick at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut none of them will replace you. I ain\u2019t lookin\u2019 to replace you either.\u201d</p> <p>Dash frowned.</p><p>\u201cLook, havin\u2019 my grandpop in my life growin\u2019 up didn\u2019t seem special or cool because we didn\u2019t know any other way. He was always there. Always part of the family. That\u2019s where me\u2019n Hayden are alike. It\u2019s what I knew. It\u2019s what Hayden knows. You\u2019ve been in his life every day since he moved here. I\u2019d bet he can\u2019t remember a day when you weren\u2019t around. You are his family. So don\u2019t do this to him. Or to Ginger.</p><p>Or hell, even to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you?\u201d he repeated skeptically.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m a selfish bastard. I want Hayden to continue havin\u2019 this same kind of childhood\u2014growin\u2019</p><p>up in his house surrounded by his family\u2014that I did. His life wouldn\u2019t be the same without you in it every day, Dash. Neither would Ginger\u2019s. And I don\u2019t want you cheatin\u2019 this baby out of the same chance to know you because you have some misguided sense of pride. Please. Swallow it and come back home with us where you belong.\u201d</p><p>Silence floated between them. Kane stood and gazed out the window, allowing Dash time to compose himself. He needed time to get a handle on his emotions too. He hadn\u2019t realized how strongly he felt about this until he\u2019d said it out loud.</p><p>Finally, Dash spoke. \u201cAll right, McKay, you made a very convincing argument. I\u2019ll agree to live there, as before, on one condition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn lawyers and their conditions,\u201d Kane muttered. \u201cWhat\u2019s the condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never getting out of this wheelchair. My body will eventually fail me. The time will come when I\u2019ll require fulltime care and I won\u2019t put that burden on my daughter, on my grandson, or now, on you. So promise me when that day arrives, you\u2019ll back me, despite whatever claim my daughter makes that she\u2019ll be happy caring for me in perpetuity. She\u2019ll need to let me go. You\u2019ll have to side with me, Kane. Against her. It won\u2019t be easy, but I deserve to leave the situation with a little dignity.\u201d</p><p>Kane whirled around and faced him. \u201cDammit, Dash. I don\u2019t even wanna think about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we wait to make that decision until that time comes?\u201d</p><p>Dash shook his head. \u201cI need the promise now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a man of your word. To be honest, this has been weighing on me for a while. I knew I\u2019d never get Ginger to stick to it. But you? You will.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth. Found the words stuck in his throat. He swallowed a couple of times. \u201cOkay.</p><p>You have my word.\u201d</p><p>Dash was visibly relieved. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow can I tell your daughter you had a change of heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Kane skirted the recliner and stopped to place his hand on Dash\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThank you. I mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, son.\u201d He covered Kane\u2019s hand with his. \u201cI look forward to whipping your butt in poker for many years to come, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it. And don\u2019t cry foul when I end up with a whole pile of your money.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s laughter followed Kane out of the room.</p><p>He\u2019d cleared the doorjamb when Ginger launched herself at him. She squeezed him so tightly he could barely breathe.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI thought maybe you\u2019d need backup, so I hung out here, but you did fine on your own. Better than fine actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make a damn good lawyer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBite your tongue,\u201d Kane shot back.</p><p>Ginger smirked. \u201cHave I told you lately that I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the last hour.\u201d</p><p>She peppered his face with kisses. \u201cI love love love you, Kane McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love love love you too, Red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling much better. How about if we pick Hayden up from school and go out for an early family dinner?\u201d</p><p>Kane brushed the curls from her face, wondering if he\u2019d ever get used to the idea that this beautiful, perfect, smart, sexy woman had picked him. \u201cSounds good. Glad to see you\u2019ve got your appetite back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only appetite I\u2019ve got back,\u201d she purred.</p><p>He chuckled and untangled her arms from his neck. \u201cHold that thought.\u201d He walked the twenty steps back to Dash\u2019s room and yelled inside. \u201cHey, Gramps? Think you can make yourself presentable before I come back to get you in an hour or so? We\u2019re all goin\u2019 out for supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that offer include beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>Ginger looped his arm through his as they walked past the front desk. \u201cWhy an hour? Why don\u2019t we just load him up now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s my job as your baby daddy to sate all your appetites. And guess which one will always get priority?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. And giggled.</p><p>He so was going to love being married to this woman for the rest of his life. \u201cWe have an hour, an empty house, and it\u2019d be a damn cryin\u2019 shame to let it go to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEffective time management. Just another thing I love about you, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? My mama raised me right.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
