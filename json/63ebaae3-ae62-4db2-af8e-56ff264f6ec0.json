Especial y to his face.</p><p>My satisfaction lurches to a stop when I see Mom\u2019s eyes, swol en and red-rimmed, and her mouth, clamped tight in a failed attempt to restrict the trembling of her lower lip. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t an absurd maternal response. If memory serves, I had a little too much to drink and then crashed my car into a house. Not one of my more reassuring exploits.</p><p>In a futile effort to divert attention from the bodily-harm part of my vehicular mishap, I ask, \u201cUm, how\u2019s the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the car? How\u2019s the car?\u201d Dad\u2019s eyebrows almost meet his receding hairline. \u201cThat\u2019s what you choose to inquire about first, after this debacle? Do you have any notion of the destruction of property you\u2019ve caused, not to mention what you may have done to your career?\u201d Would it have been that hard to just tel me the damned thing was totaled?</p><p>\u201cMark,\u201d Mom\u2019s lower lip quivers, \u201che\u2019s alive. Everything else can be fixed.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if she means fixed, like the emergency appendectomy that landed me in the hospital last fal right in the middle of filming my last blockbuster, or fixed, like when I got busted a year ago at a party where everyone was smoking weed, but I got off for lack of evidence.</p><p>\u201cCan it?\u201d Dad shoots back, grabbing his jacket from the chair and heading for the door. \u201cGod dammit, Reid, I\u2019m not sure if anything about you can be repaired. You\u2019ve had a low regard for the needs of everyone else for some time\u2014</p><p>and now you\u2019ve extended that carelessness to your own life. I can\u2019t imagine what you were thinking.\u201d I don\u2019t answer. I figure he doesn\u2019t want to hear that not thinking was sort of the point.</p><p>Dori</p><p>I try to keep my voice encouraging, even though I\u2019m yel ing at the top of my lungs. \u201cOkay, guys, let\u2019s take it from the top!\u201d</p><p>That thing they say about herding cats? Try herding eighteen five-year-olds into practicing a vocal finale for Vacation Bible School Parent Night when they\u2019re intent on the swimming pool time they\u2019ve been promised for good behavior.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Dori?\u201d I feel a tug on the side of my denim capris.</p><p>It\u2019s Rosalinda, from whom I hear Miss Doooooriiiii? at least a dozen times a day.</p><p>\u201cYes, Rosa?\u201d I say, and before the words leave my mouth, seventeen five-year-olds are springing out of their seats and shouldering each other aside at the window to stare longingly at the pool shimmering just outside under a bril iant, haze-free June sky.</p><p>\u201cI need to go.\u201d Again? This kid has a bladder the size of a quarter.</p><p>\u201cCan you hold it another minute, sweetie? We\u2019re almost done\u2014\u201d A squeal sounds from across the room. Jonathan has scissors in one hand and Keisha\u2019s braid in the other.</p><p>\u201cJonathan, drop it.\u201d I bite my lip at the startled look on his face. Must not laugh. It\u2019s not funny. Not funny.</p><p>He blinks, eyes shifting from scissors to braid. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s start with Keisha\u2019s hair.\u201d He releases the braid and she runs to her friends, who gather around her while glaring at him. I\u2019ve never had a group of girlfriends like that\u2014a protective clique, a guardian posse.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Dori,\u201d Rosa whines, tugging harder. I take her hand to keep her from pul ing my pants down. I\u2019d never restore order if that were to happen.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, Rosa.\u201d I squeeze her hand gently.</p><p>\u201cJonathan,\u201d I say more sternly. \u201cBring me those scissors.\u201d Eyes on his untied sneakers, he shuffles over as slowly as is humanly possible. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get them?\u201d He holds the scissors out with both hands as though presenting a gift to royalty. Not fal ing for his fake contrition, I arch an eyebrow.</p><p>He chances a peek at my face. \u201cMrs. K\u2019s desk,\u201d he mumbles, scowling at his feet again.</p><p>Our church secretary, Filomena Kowalczyk, speaks with a heavy Polish accent despite having immigrated to the US</p><p>about a hundred years ago. She keeps a huge jar of candy on her desk and wears creaky orthopedic shoes which have the same effect as a bel on a cat\u2019s col ar. The kids hear her coming down the hal five minutes before she arrives. Judging by the smear of chocolate on Jonathan\u2019s mouth, I\u2019d say he sampled a Hershey Kiss or two before making off with her scissors.</p><p>\u201cDo we take Mrs. K\u2019s things without permission?\u201d I fix a disappointed look on him.</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cIs taking things that don\u2019t belong to you what Pastor Doug means by good behavior?\u201d</p><p>His wide, dark eyes snap up to mine. Bingo, kid. Pool time is in jeopardy.</p><p>\u201cBut Miss Dori!\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t cut it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about Keisha\u2019s braid yet. We\u2019re discussing you taking Mrs. K\u2019s scissors\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l put them back!\u201d Tears fil his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m s-s-sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sorry because you got caught,\u201d I say, and he bursts into tears. Oh, dear Lord.</p><p>\u201cMiss Dori!\u201d Rosa wails, cupping herself, one leg raised and pressing against the other.</p><p>I sigh in defeat, giving up on the program rehearsal for today. \u201cAl right, everyone line up for the bathroom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe first! Me first! \u201d Rosa says, keeping her death grip on my hand. As I walk to the head of the line, she hops lightly behind me on one foot.</p><p>\u201cJonathan, come stand by me.\u201d Rubbing tears away with his fist, he takes my other hand, and I leave the classroom with eighteen ducklings trailing behind.</p><p>In a few weeks, I\u2019l be on a mission trip to Ecuador. As exotic as that sounds, I\u2019l be doing much the same thing I\u2019m doing now\u2014I\u2019l just be doing it in Spanish.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>REID</p><p>I loosen the tie the second I turn to head out of the courtroom. The next thing to go wil be this crap in my hair that makes me look like one of my father\u2019s fuckwit subordinates.</p><p>\u201cPut that back on,\u201d Dad barks, his shoulders rigid. He\u2019s judged me guilty as charged even though the prosecution accepted our plea bargain\u2014sort of.</p><p>I contemplate ignoring him for half a second, until my manager\u2019s less dictatorial voice urges discretion. \u201cReid, there wil be press. School Pride is out in theaters. This is no time to look like a rebel. We\u2019ve already lost a couple of endorsements\u2014your image is suffering enough without you giving the impression that you\u2019re ungrateful to have gotten off easy for something that would land 99.9% of regular people in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cal that easy?\u201d I never snap at George, but I can\u2019t agree with his assessment. The judge\u2019s mandates for my plea bargain are beyond ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014as would anyone with half a brain,\u201d Dad butts in.</p><p>Subtlety has never been in my father\u2019s nature. \u201cPut the goddamned tie back on, Reid.\u201d</p><p>My jaw works overtime as I refasten the top buttons of the white Armani dress shirt and loop the perfect half-Windsor knot back into the understated Hermes tie. By the time I\u2019m thirty, I\u2019l have worn my teeth down to nubs.</p><p>Friends ask why I don\u2019t just ditch my dad. I\u2019m nineteen, an adult in every legal sense of the word (except the ability to drink legal y, which is annoying as shit). I\u2019m a legitimate Hol ywood star, with a manager, an agent, a PR guy, or woman, as the case may be\u2014Dad may have fired Larry when he didn\u2019t move fast enough to save those endorsements last week.</p><p>That\u2019s the thing. My father takes care of everything. He\u2019s the CEO of my life, and I\u2019m the product. He manages my career, my money, my legal issues... I don\u2019t have to do jack shit but show up for auditions, movie tapings, premieres and occasional commercial endorsements. I can\u2019t stand him any more than he can stand me, but I know he won\u2019t screw me over.</p><p>My manager was right. The media is camped out on the courthouse steps, ready to take my statement. I had nothing to do with writing it. George handed it to me last night when Dad and my attorney\u2014whose name I can\u2019t recal because I couldn\u2019t care less which junior kiss-ass partner wannabe Dad selected from his firm to represent me\u2014were reviewing the bargaining strategy for this morning. Time for my Oscar-worthy performance of contrition.</p><p>Dad fades behind me as planned while I\u2019m flanked by George and junior kiss-ass. I fix an appropriately repentant expression on my face. \u201cI just want to apologize to my fans.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry to have let al of you down. I assure you that this incident was a momentary lapse in judgment, and it won\u2019t be repeated.\u201d</p><p>Someone shoves a mike in my face. \u201cWil you go into rehab?\u201d</p><p>Cue the look of shame layered over remorse. \u201cThe judge didn\u2019t believe that would be necessary at this time. But I intend to fol ow the terms of the court\u2019s orders to the letter, and this occurrence wil not be repeated.\u201d A guy from one of the local Hispanic stations looks like his bul shit detector is set on high. \u201cWhat about the home you destroyed, and the family you displaced?\u201d Come on, asshat. It was one room of a house, and no one was in it, so no one was hurt. \u201cThe home owners are being compensated,\u201d I say. \u201cThe details are private, but the reparation has been agreed upon by al parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s paying them off, you mean.\u201d The hel ? This guy is persistent. Maybe he\u2019s related to them or something.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d I look him in the eye, al mano a mano. \u201cI was responsible for the accident. I\u2019m the one paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you feel comfortable cal ing it an accident when you, an underage boy, chose to drink yourself to more than double the limit for a legal adult, and then drive a two-thousand pound vehicle through a residential area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe owner of the property is a real estate company.</p><p>What about the family living there, renting the home?</p><p>They\u2019re hardworking people, but uninsured, and now they\u2019ve lost belongings they can\u2019t afford to replace, in addition to the fact that they\u2019re currently homeless. What about them?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. I want to kick this guy\u2019s ass so bad my fist is already knotted.</p><p>Junior kiss-ass decides this is the time to step in and earn that partnership. \u201cThank you, ladies and gentlemen\u2014</p><p>as Mr. Alexander\u2019s legal counsel, I assure you that he takes ful responsibility for his actions and intends to repair all of the damage done, and then some.\u201d</p><p>Isn\u2019t that what I just said?</p><p>And what the hel does he mean by and then some?</p><p>Dori</p><p>While Dad says grace, my mind wanders. I don\u2019t mean to be disrespectful, and I always keep my eyes shut, but sometimes I have so much to keep track of that my brain is making lists and checking off details any time it perceives a calm moment to do so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Parent Night rehearsals with the kids wil have to wait until next week. My Habitat for Humanity project has a more pressing deadline thanks to the self-centered, egocentric moron who drove his stupid sports car into the living room of our future family\u2019s rental place. I don\u2019t get people like him</p><p>\u2014people who think of no one, ever, but themselves. They just take up space on the planet, never contributing anything worthwhile.</p><p>He\u2019s the reverse of someone like my dad\u2014Pastor Doug to the parishioners of our church and the surrounding neighborhood. Dad would tel me that God wouldn\u2019t be pleased about my biases concerning Reid Alexander.</p><p>God has a purpose, even for him, Dad would say.</p> <p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Ugh, there I go again.</p><p>I\u2019l be spending the next several days straight working on the Habitat house. Luckily, we have much of it done.</p><p>Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t include the A/C, and it\u2019s already hot and hazy. Much of Los Angeles lives without central air; I shouldn\u2019t complain. I have a comfortable home, even if it\u2019s not chock-ful of luxury items like big-screen televisions and rooms of furniture where everything matches. Mom knows her way around with a paint brush, and she\u2019s amazing at using saris bought at the bazaar as colorful window coverings and table cloths, or plants to cover a stain on the carpet or a crack in the plaster wal s.</p><p>I\u2019ve got a few more things to get turned into UC Berkeley before I start next fal : AP exam results, graduation certificate, housing deposit. Almost everyone who knows me seems puzzled by the fact that I intend to pursue a degree in social work rather than music. I\u2019m often told that I have a beautiful voice, but that would be an impractical career path. I\u2019d rather do something.</p> <p>Dad\u2019s the only one who real y gets that sentiment. He\u2019s also where I get my voice. Mom and Deborah, my older sister, are absolutely tone-deaf, but they have useful natural sister, are absolutely tone-deaf, but they have useful natural and applied skil s. Mom\u2019s an obstetrical nurse specializing in low-cost prenatal care, and Deb recently began her hospital residency in Indiana\u2014she\u2019s going to be a pediatrician. Dad and I just had to be more creative about finding our ways to contribute.</p><p>This summer, like the last several years, I\u2019m working the summer program our church offers for the poverty-stricken neighborhoods nearby. The van picks the kids up in the morning, enabling their parents to go to work without worrying about what to do with them. The kids stay al day, which means we have to come up with lots of activities. The swimming pool was Mom\u2019s idea. Some members of the church finance committee balked at instal ing something so lavish, but Mom convinced them we could use it for VBS, family days and monthly baptisms.</p><p>Dad says Mom could talk the Devil into baking Christmas cookies.</p><p>\u201c...Amen,\u201d Dad says, and I open my eyes, banishing thoughts of Satan wearing an apron and icing reindeer.</p><p>\u201cDori, your dad has some news that might interest you.\u201d Mom hands me the bowl of mashed potatoes, and they\u2019re both watching me closely. Weird.</p><p>Dad clears his throat. \u201cYou got a cal just before you got home. I guess Roberta doesn\u2019t have your cel number.\u201d Roberta, my project leader at Habitat, doesn\u2019t get that people can be easily reached on the phone they carry around with them. Her cel phone is always in her bag and off, because she believes the battery wil run down if she leaves it on, and then it wouldn\u2019t be at the ready in case she gets mugged and needs it. I\u2019ve never asked her how she plans to hold the bad guy off while her phone boots up.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a new volunteer starting tomorrow, and she wants you to help him acclimate, show him the ropes.\u201d My brow furrows. While we appreciate volunteers, this isn\u2019t exactly huge or unusual news, plus my parents are being downright odd. \u201cOkay. No problem.\u201d Waiting for the punch line, I pass the potatoes to Dad. \u201cIs it someone with electrical experience, I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, I doubt that.\u201d</p><p>When he doesn\u2019t elaborate, I final y say, \u201cDad, spit it out.\u201d</p><p>Dad isn\u2019t meeting my eyes, unusual y cryptic. \u201cWel , this volunteer may be someone you know. Not know, exactly.</p><p>But know of.\u201d</p><p>Good grief, I\u2019m way too tired for this. \u201cAm I supposed to guess who it is?\u201d I sigh. \u201cIs it someone from church?</p><p>Someone from school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Reid Alexander,\u201d Mom blurts out, unable to contain herself any longer.</p> <p>\u201cWhat ? \u201d</p><p>Dad tries the logical spin. \u201cApparently working to get the house ready sooner for the Diegos was part of his plea bargain.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not happening. \u201cWait. So he\u2019s not even actual y a volunteer, then\u2014he\u2019l be on site under court-ordered coercion?\u201d They cannot expect me to babysit that self-absorbed, womanizing, probable alcoholic.</p><p>\u201cRoberta said that since you\u2019re about his age, she was hoping you could... er...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabysit him.\u201d I scowl. \u201cPlease tel me it\u2019s only for a day or two.\u201d</p><p>Dad shrugs and starts to eat. \u201cYou\u2019l need to ask Roberta that. I\u2019m just the messenger.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes for a moment, imagining the absurdity of Reid Alexander on site, the wasted time accumulating hourly. I\u2019d planned to tile the master bath\u2019s shower tomorrow. No way I could trust him to help with that\u2014tiling is pretty much skil ed labor, and while I\u2019ve done it enough to be proficient, he\u2019s probably never touched a trowel in his life.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d I hear his answer in my head before he says it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, honey. But there\u2019s a reason for everything.\u201d Dad pats my hand. \u201cWe\u2019l just have to wait patiently to see what it is.\u201d</p><p>As I do every time he says that or something like this, I bite back what I\u2019d say if I could reply honestly. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a reason for everything, and having faith doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m blind. I believe people make poor choices. I believe bad things happen to good people. I believe there\u2019s evil in the world that I wil never understand, but wil never stop fighting.</p><p>If I believed for two seconds that there was a reason behind some of the awful things that occur in this life, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cWel , this is promising.\u201d Dad walks across the kitchen, setting his attach\u00e9 on the granite-topped buffet.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother to reply. He\u2019s been goading me like this since I was a kid. Took me a while to learn not to take the bait and let him prove how much more intel igent he is. My father gets paid to argue\u2014and by the size of this house, the cut of his custom-made silk-blend suit and the cars in the garage, he\u2019s bril iant at it.</p><p>It must gal the crap out of him that I do what I do and earn more money than he does. Of course, he has no idea how hard I work when I\u2019m filming, but who cares. Let him think I do next to nothing. Just pisses him off more, which is fine with me.</p><p>\u201cI even made coffee.\u201d I gesture to the half-ful carafe, stil warming.</p><p>He fil s his travel mug and screws the lid on. \u201cIs your mother up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l need to cal a car to get to work,\u201d he reminds me,</p><p>\u201csince your license has been suspended for six months.\u201d He sounds way too satisfied about that.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were gonna take me.\u201d I blink my baby blues at him. His mouth opens and no sound comes out as I fight for a straight face. \u201cI\u2019m joking, Dad\u2014I already cal ed the service. They\u2019l be here in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Scowling, his mouth snaps closed. \u201cWel , fine then.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I should be amused or pissed that he\u2019s so surprised.</p><p>When I hand the driver the sheet with the charity build-a-house address, he studies it before looking at me with a perplexed expression.</p><p>\u201cYeah, dude, it\u2019s correct,\u201d I say, anticipating his question.</p><p>\u201cJust take me there, okay?\u201d</p><p>He opens the back door to the black Mercedes. \u201cYes, sir, Mr. Alexander.\u201d As we pul away, it occurs to me that this car wil be fucking conspicuous in the neighborhood where I\u2019l be for the next month. If I took a regular taxi it would only be marginal y better. To blend in, I\u2019d need to hire a gang member in a pimped out Monte Carlo to drop me off.</p><p>On the drive, I read through some of the scripts George and I are considering for upcoming projects, but none of them motivate me to look beyond the first page. A year ago, I\u2019d have been happy enough with several, but now I\u2019m thinking they\u2019re al the stupidest shit I\u2019ve ever read. I attribute this new perception to Emma, my costar in School Pride. She told me last fal she\u2019d rather do serious films than movies that have immediate blockbuster potential.</p><p>Why her viewpoint rubbed off on me at al , I have no clue.</p><p>Emma is also the only girl I\u2019ve bothered to pursue but not caught in years, and I screwed up any possible second chance by hooking up with other girls when she didn\u2019t cave.</p><p>I begged her for another shot, but the damage was done.</p><p>By the time the cast met up for the premiere, she was with Graham, another costar. My longtime ex, Brooke, wanted him. She offered me a devil\u2019s bargain: Brooke would seduce Graham, and Emma would fal right into my arms.</p><p>Graham didn\u2019t go for it, but thanks to Brooke\u2019s scheming, Emma thought he had. She was distraught.</p><p>Fragile. I had her right where I wanted her, but I couldn\u2019t do it. One of the few principles I have where girls are concerned: lying to get a girl in bed is cheating. If I cheat to win, I didn\u2019t real y win.</p><p>I got a little overly introspective after that. A short-lived state, luckily. I snapped out of it after my accident, when I had a few compulsory meetings with a court-appointed therapist who suggested that maybe I was trying to kil myself. I laughed in his face. I mean, there\u2019s a difference between being suicidal and not giving a shit if you live or die. Right?</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d the driver says. \u201cWe\u2019re here... if you\u2019re sure this is where you want to be dropped...\u201d</p><p>Outside the dark tinted glass lies a sea of generic bungalows\u2014paint fading, bars on windows and doors, each house separated by a few feet from the next one and surrounded by limp, untended palm trees amidst otherwise sparse vegetation. I stare at the partial y-completed house, which is literal y steps from the road\u2014just like al the others.</p><p>A house number sloppily painted onto a piece of raw plywood leaning against the front matches the number on the court info.</p><p>\u201cYeah, this is it. Be here at or before three to pick me up. I don\u2019t want to wait, for obvious reasons.\u201d I normal y wouldn\u2019t be caught dead driving through this neighborhood, let alone helping to build yet another piece-of-crap house.</p><p>This sucks ass.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I\u2019l be here by 2:45.\u201d</p><p>Activity around the house has come to a standstil , because everyone is staring at the guy exiting a chauffeured Mercedes in the gang-infested neighborhood.</p><p>Man, I seriously should have thought about arriving in some other mode of transportation.</p><p>As I walk up the unfinished pathway, a girl comes out to greet me... although greet is generous. She\u2019s glaring as she walks towards me, her brows drawn together in an expression I go to concerted efforts to avoid making, even when I\u2019m pissed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have about twenty seconds to sum her up physical y.</p><p>The process takes me ten.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing an oversized, faded t-shirt bearing the M.A.D.D. logo. Unintentional? Doubt it. I can\u2019t tel breast size or shape under that thing; ditto whether or not she has a waist. In my experience, if a girl has either, she\u2019s going to dress to at least hint at the fact. Her tent of a t-shirt tel s me she\u2019s hiding inadequacies, not assets.</p><p>Her shorts are so far out of style that I\u2019m not sure they were ever i n style. Sprinkled with flecks of paint, her construction boots are worn and scuffed. Stil , she manages to pul off this part of the manual laborer look because her legs are the only thing remotely hot about her.</p> <p>Her calves are perfectly shaped, strong and muscled. Most of the girls I know\u2014actresses, society girls\u2014want long, thin legs. But legs like hers are what I go for when I\u2019m feeling particular.</p><p>She\u2019s tan wherever I see skin. Not a Rodeo Drive sunless tan, either\u2014the real thing. I know this because there\u2019s a pale strip of skin on one wrist where she usual y wears something\u2014a thick-banded watch, maybe. I don\u2019t know a single girl who goes outside without a mil ion SPF</p><p>sunblock.</p><p>Hair\u2014generic brown and pul ed back from her face into a ponytail. Probably goes wel past her shoulders when down. Assuming she ever wears it down.</p><p>Face\u2014predictably, no makeup, not even a swipe of blush or lip gloss. Dark, dark eyes. A light smattering of freckles across her cheeks and the bridge of her nose\u2014the girls I know would have had those burned off or bleached out or whatever they do to remove freckles years ago.</p> <p>Final y, her mouth\u2014another oddity, like her legs\u2014her lips are perfect and ful , even set into a harsh line like they are now.</p><p>I stuff both hands into the front pockets of my jeans, stop a few feet from the street and wait.</p><p>\u201cMr. Alexander, I assume?\u201d she says, stil striding forward. I nod, adding something further to the short list of her attractive features: her voice. It makes me want to hear her sing, even though her inflection says she wishes the ground would swal ow me.</p><p>Legs, lips, voice. If one of these proves too appealing to ignore, a few veiled insults wil give her self-esteem enough of a hit to back off, though it seldom chases them off completely. Girls are irrational y attracted to assholes. I don\u2019t intend to be cruel, but I\u2019m not hooking up with some tiresome, bleeding-heart do-gooder. I just want to do my time and get the hel out.</p><p>Dori</p><p>A Mercedes? Really? I am so not looking forward to this.</p> <p>The moment His Highness arrived was easy enough to determine since everyone just flat-out stopped what they were doing to gawk at the big celebrity and his ostentatious car. One minute the house hummed with the sound of people talking, laughing and working side-by-side, and the next there was silence punctuated by hissed undertones, not a hammer or paintbrush moving. I fail to see how this sort of daily interruption wil be beneficial to the project...</p><p>but no one asked me.</p><p>He\u2019s dressed appropriately\u2014jeans, t-shirt, work boots\u2014</p><p>but I get the feeling those jeans were more expensive than the nicest outfit I own. Possibly ditto the t-shirt, which has some sort of insignia I don\u2019t recognize. I\u2019m guessing it isn\u2019t a brand found at Target.</p><p>When I walked out to meet him, he gave me a careless once-over\u2014I should have expected as much\u2014and dismissed whatever he saw. Most girls might be offended, or at least displeased, but I\u2019m grateful. I don\u2019t want Reid Alexander\u2019s interest. If I had my druthers, I\u2019d love for him to perform his community service elsewhere, but the judge wanted him to assist in building the home for the family he displaced, and I can\u2019t argue with that logic.</p><p>Cramming his hands into his pockets, he watched me indifferently, as though he couldn\u2019t care less about anything that has happened or wil happen. Out of nowhere an absurd feeling of inconsolable grief washed over me. Like nothing could be more tragic than this boy standing in front of me. Ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cMr. Alexander, I assume?\u201d I said, and he nodded shortly. I turned before he could see what I was thinking.</p><p>When it comes to having a poker face\u2014I don\u2019t. Usual y that\u2019s not a problem, since lying is something I strive not to do because I just don\u2019t see the point. But with someone like Reid Alexander, it would be unwise to let him sense any vulnerability where he\u2019s concerned. I live in Los Angeles, after al , and while I might not run in his circle, or even within the same galaxy as his circle, I know his type: careless, spoiled and heedless of anyone\u2019s needs outside his own.</p> <p>Even with that angel\u2019s face, he cannot be trusted.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder and he hasn\u2019t moved. Without slowing, I say, \u201cCome with me, please,\u201d and hope that he complies\u2014because no one\u2019s told me what I\u2019m supposed to do if he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Releasing a breath as I hear the crunch of gravel under his boots, indicating that he\u2019s at least fol owing me inside, I tel myself that I can put up with anything for a few weeks. I wanted to scream when Roberta told me that his community service agreement was for a month. Meaning he\u2019l be my problem for the entire three and a half weeks before I leave for Ecuador.</p><p>As we pass through the smal house, my fel ow volunteers gape, star-struck. Even grown men stop what they\u2019re doing, though the women are worse\u2014straightening their clothes, patting hair into place\u2014holy cow. You\u2019d think they\u2019ve never seen anything pretty before. That\u2019s the first thing I must admit and get past\u2014the sheer fact of how beautiful he is.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen the magazine covers, the posters on girlfriends\u2019 bedroom wal s, his likeness on backpacks of nine-year-olds who attend our church\u2019s after-school program, for Pete\u2019s sake. I knew he\u2019d be handsome. The fact of the matter, though, is \u201chandsome\u201d doesn\u2019t do him justice. Mom would term his hair dirty blond, and Dad would say it\u2019s a little too long. His eyes are a dark blue I\u2019d always assumed was photoshopped. He\u2019s so sensual y attractive that I should add every girl on whom he\u2019l turn his attention to my prayer list, because they\u2019re going to need al the divine intervention they can get to resist him. I\u2019m thankful that he dismissed me so quickly.</p><p>\u201cI was going to tile the bathroom shower today... but that\u2019s a complicated procedure and you\u2019d just end up watching me do it. So we\u2019re going to paint the bedrooms instead.\u201d We arrive in the master bedroom, the wal s and ceiling of which are unfinished. I texturized and primed last week. Carpet hasn\u2019t been instal ed, so at least I don\u2019t have to worry about him ruining the floor. \u201cI\u2019l do the ceiling, because it\u2019s more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplicated?\u201d he interjects, regarding me with an amused look.</p><p>I take a slow, deep breath. It\u2019s going to be a long three and a half weeks.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cSo, do you have a name\u2014or do I just cal you boss?\u201d Introductions: Basic Etiquette 101. The tips of her ears turn bright pink, but she otherwise doesn\u2019t blush.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She steps towards me, offering her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Dori.\u201d</p><p>I take her hand and give her one firm shake, annoyed that the combination of her pitch-perfect voice and the touch of her hand are like a tiny electric shock. \u201cCal me Reid. Only my subordinates cal me Mr. Alexander.\u201d Comprehending me instantly, she blinks and her ears turn an even darker shade of pink, and I decide that this month may prove more entertaining than I\u2019d thought. Any direct hits wil come with a visible signal. I\u2019l bet she wears her hair pul ed back every day, too.</p><p>She clears her throat and indicates the pile of stuff in the middle of the room, clustered around a ladder. \u201cOkay, then, Reid, here\u2019s the paint we\u2019l be using, and the rol ers, brushes, etcetera. Have you painted before?\u201d Is she serious? \u201cNot rooms.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cThen I guess you\u2019l be learning a new skil .\u201d Pul ing a smal metal instrument from her pocket, she squats next to the paint cans. I\u2019m trying not to focus on the line of muscle flexing from the top of her boot to where it disappears at the hem of her shorts.</p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019l feel the need to paint the wal s at my place any time soon,\u201d I say, scoffing at the notion of wasting my time doing any form of manual labor when I could pay some il egal immigrant almost nothing to do it.</p><p>She pries the lid off of a paint can, ignoring my comment and smiling at the sky blue inside. Without glancing up, she sets the lid aside. \u201cWhat if you accept a film role where you need to act like you can paint, but you don\u2019t know how? I can make you look like an expert by the end of the week.\u201d My estimation of her ability to manipulate goes up several notches. She\u2019s downright dangerous.</p><p>So she\u2019s going to make me an \u201cexpert\u201d at painting? How hard can it be?</p><p>I\u2019m rol ing paint on the final bit of the last wal , biceps and delts burning (at least I won\u2019t have to worry about deteriorating muscle tone while I\u2019m here), while Dori is on the ladder \u201ccutting in\u201d with a brush\u2014painting the wal space between the ceiling and the spot where the rol er can\u2019t go without hitting the ceiling. Which I learned the hard way.</p><p>The windows are open to save us from being asphyxiated by paint fumes, but there\u2019s no breeze to speak of and summer is gearing up to be a bitch. This would be a perfect day to be at the beach. Or alternatively, pretty much anywhere else.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fucking hot in here.\u201d I set the rol er in the tray and examining my hands, which are splattered in blue. There\u2019s blue on my nails, under my nails, speckling my forearms and the yel ow Prada t-shirt that, luckily, isn\u2019t a favorite.</p><p>Since the shirt\u2019s already streaked and spattered with blue paint, a few more smears from my fingers won\u2019t matter.</p><p>I pul the shirt over my head and toss it next to a pile of drop-cloths after mopping my face with it. Dori is on her ladder, motionless and staring at me while a line of paint runs from the upturned brush down the handle and continues along her arm. When I cock an eyebrow at her and she snaps her attention back to the paintbrush in her hand, dropping it into the shal ow paint tray hooked to the ladder.</p><p>Grabbing a cloth, I climb onto the ladder behind her, take her wrist in my hand and stop the drip of paint with the cloth.</p><p>This seems to unsettle the shit out of her.</p><p>\u201cThis ladder is only built to hold one,\u201d she says, taking the cloth from me.</p><p>Shrugging, I hop down. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Her legs, smooth and unblemished, are eye-level when my boots hit the ground. I resist the urge to run a finger over the soft spot behind her knee. She\u2019d probably fal off the ladder... at which point I\u2019d catch her... And then she\u2019d start screaming.</p><p>Holy shit, man, cut it out.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Ears pink, she unhooks the tray and avoids looking at me.</p><p>I\u2019ve been here half a day and I\u2019ve schooled her in manners twice. That\u2019s gotta sting. She\u2019s backing down the ladder with the paintbrush and tray when I ask if we\u2019re done with this room. Cocking her head to the side like she\u2019s trying to figure out if I\u2019m serious, she looks at me. \u201cNo... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>we\u2019re just taking a lunch break to give it time to dry so we can apply the second coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d I say. \u201cWe have to paint this entire room again? \u201d</p><p>She clenches her jaw, but resettles herself with one breath. \u201cYes. You\u2019l see why when we come back after lunch.\u201d Her voice is al patience and fortitude.</p><p>I possess neither of those traits. \u201cFine. Whatever. I\u2019ve got to be here for a month. Doesn\u2019t matter if I paint the same damned wal fifty times.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips set in a line, she huffs a breath and glances at me and away. \u201cCould you put your shirt back on, please?\u201d I have to grin. \u201cWhy? Does it bother you that I\u2019m shirtless?\u201d</p><p>She rol s her eyes in a big exaggerated gesture, and I struggle not to laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you want to strip naked.</p><p>But we have retired people helping out today... and some of them are of the \u2018no-hats-indoors\u2019 variety, so I doubt they\u2019d be thril ed to see you at lunch sans shirt. But suit yourself.\u201d</p><p>I grab the shirt off the floor and pul it on, fol owing her out of the room. \u201cStrip naked, huh? I don\u2019t know about that, Dori. We just met.\u201d She doesn\u2019t reply, but her ears go pink.</p><p>Score.</p> <p>Dori</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I just invited Reid Alexander to be naked in my presence. As if I didn\u2019t know he wouldn\u2019t take that sort of remark silently.</p><p>I was expecting to find him difficult to motivate and just as difficult to teach, but he listened (though he seemed bored out of his mind), and for the most part he fol owed my instructions. I had to let him try it his way first, because apparently he\u2019s a learn-the-hard-way type. (Shocking.) He didn\u2019t trust me about not getting too much paint on the rol er. Or rol ing in arches instead of straight lines on the first pass. Or not rol ing too near the ceiling.</p><p>In front of the first wal he painted, there are splotches of paint al over the floor. I had to point out several drippy globs he needed to back up and fix before they dried that way. And of course, he hit the white ceiling in two places and the baseboard in two more, trying to rol al the way to the crease. By the second wal , he\u2019d improved, more so the third, and the last was nearly perfect. I was starting to relax until he took off his shirt.</p><p>I\u2019ve managed to remain unaffected by male torsos for eighteen years, but good gol y, I\u2019ve never been confronted with a torso like his. He\u2019s like an ad for cologne or beachwear or gym equipment\u2014al perfect skin stretched over flawlessly-toned muscle. Luckily, his arrogance is such a turnoff that I didn\u2019t have any problem asking him to put his shirt back on.</p><p>Like the walk through the house this morning, conversations break off when Reid and I emerge into what wil be the back yard, once we lay sod. Twenty or so people sit on upturned buckets and folding lawn chairs scattered about the concrete patio, paper plates of tamales and tacos on their laps. Some workers wil be here every day\u2014</p> <p>notably the crew leaders like Roberta. Others vary day to day\u2014col ege students, church groups, garden clubs or employees from area companies that support community service projects by giving them time off to volunteer.</p><p>I walk to the water spigot to wash my hands and Reid does the same, and then splashes water over his face and runs his wet hands through his hair as though everyone out here wasn\u2019t watching him do it. Fol owing me to the card table where the food is laid out, he acts as though there\u2019s nothing odd about a Hol ywood celebrity being handed a paper plate and pointed to the plastic utensils and the cooler holding bottled water.</p><p>I sit on a step, balancing my plate on my knees, and he sits next to me. Everyone is stil staring, though whispered conversations are resuming.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t been arrested for drunken driving or gotten caught with a joint in your gym locker.\u201d</p><p>\u201c Um , no,\u201d I say, once I\u2019ve finished chewing. \u201cI\u2019m a regular.\u201d</p><p>He peers at me, and I can\u2019t decide if he\u2019s puzzled or amused. \u201cSo you do this al the time. Hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>While he\u2019s studying the other volunteers, appraising each one without any alteration in expression, I\u2019m gazing at his profile, waiting for him to continue. He has the longest eyelashes I\u2019ve ever seen on a guy, and his now-damp hair, darker blond when wet, curls at the ends over his ear and at the nape, grazing the neck of his paint-smeared t-shirt.</p> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI just wonder what else you have time to do, if you\u2019re doing this al the time,\u201d he adds, biting off half a taco. People like him never understand people like me. It\u2019s like we come from different species.</p><p>\u201cWel , since I don\u2019t make a habit of getting drunk, smoking pot, clubbing and sleeping with everything that moves, I have plenty of time for other activities.\u201d Ohmygosh. I did not just say that.</p><p>He laughs softly, turning to face me as I scowl. His blue eyes are striking, framed by thick, dark lashes. \u201cLet me guess\u2014Monday is book club, Tuesday is family game night... Wednesday is Bible study, and Thursday you meet up with the sewing circle to make quilts for the elderly... Am I close?\u201d</p><p>Without answering, I get up to go back inside. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been ridiculed for what I am, but for some reason\u2014maybe because it feels so incompatible with where we are\u2014it\u2019s more disheartening.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says, and for some stupid reason I stop, expecting him to apologize. \u201cWhen do you have time for the soup kitchen?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s chuckling when I go inside without looking back.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>REID</p><p>Wow, that was a dickhead thing to say. For someone so minimal y impressed by celebrity proximity, she\u2019s been cool enough. Right up to that laundry list of corrupt activities in which, truth be told, I do engage. Stil , Jesus. Superior much?</p><p>I stand to go inside when conversations taper off and people go back to whatever they were doing before break.</p><p>Those stil outside are stealing glances at me as I throw the plate and utensils away, finish the bottle of water and toss it into the recycling container.</p><p>\u201cMr. Alexander,\u201d someone says\u2014that Roberta woman.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d She smiles, oblivious to my sarcastic tone.</p><p>\u201cDorcas is one of our best volunteers. We\u2019re real y proud of her; maybe she\u2019l even teach you some new tricks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I answer, smiling at her while my brain processes\u2014 Dorcas? Who the hel names a kid Dorcas?</p><p>And by the way, lady, the day a little prude named Dorcas teaches me a new trick is the day I\u2019l be finding a nice tal teaches me a new trick is the day I\u2019l be finding a nice tal building to leap off of.</p><p>I go back to the room we were painting to find her with earbuds in her ears, an ancient model iPod clipped to her shorts, the wire threaded under her shirt. She\u2019s gathered the equipment she used to paint the ceiling this morning.</p><p>Pausing the music without removing the earbuds, she says,</p><p>\u201cYou know what to do in here; I\u2019m going next door to start on the ceiling, unless you need me here to supervise you.\u201d I bite back half a dozen forward answers. \u201cI think I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>She nods shortly.</p><p>As she gets to the door, I add, \u201cOh and Dorcas, I\u2019l need you to sign my sheet for the court before I go.\u201d Her shoulders stiffen, but she continues out of the room, her ears lit like a flare. I clamp my lips together to keep from laughing. Getting on her nerves is just too easy.</p><p>By 3:00, I\u2019ve finished the room. Dori shows up at 3:01</p><p>with a pen in her hand. As she glances around, checking my work, I pul the form from my back pocket and hand it to her. Except for a couple of blue swipes on the ceiling above the first wal (turns out she was right about not getting too close with the rol er), it looks pretty good. Without commenting, she signs the form\u2014 Dorcas Cantrell\u2014and hands it back.</p><p>I thank her, thinking she\u2019d love nothing more than to turn around and leave without replying, but she doesn\u2019t risk it after my earlier chiding. \u201cI\u2019l see you tomorrow,\u201d she says.</p><p>Her lyrical voice gives me a smal jolt, but she\u2019s already leaving the room.</p><p>My driver is waiting at the curb. He starts at the sight of me, sweaty and speckled in blue paint. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s imagining what my clothes wil do to those leather seats, but he says nothing beyond, \u201cGood afternoon, Mr.</p><p>Alexander,\u201d as he opens the back door and waits for me to get in.</p><p>One day down, nineteen to go.</p><p>Dori</p><p>Dad picks me up a couple of hours after Reid leaves.</p><p>Pul ing into traffic, he drums lightly on the steering wheel.</p><p>The trek home requires some freeway time, and he\u2019s got the classical station on to de-stress. Bach\u2019s Concerto for Two Violins fil s the car. I lean my head back and close my eyes, grateful I don\u2019t have to drive. I hate driving on LA freeways. Mom says it brings out the devil in me. The way people drive on 110, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019d today go?\u201d Dad is so obvious when fishing for information. Just the fact that he waited a few minutes into the drive to ask tel s me he\u2019s working to sound offhand.</p><p>What do I say? That Reid is as spoiled and arrogant as I thought, stubborn but teachable, and more beautiful than any guy has a right to be?</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I can\u2019t keep the exasperation out of my voice.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, I\u2019ve seen you wrangle two dozen munchkins into a chorus of little angels.\u201d He pats my knee. \u201cI doubt this wil be more difficult than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little angels were scared of me, Dad.\u201d He laughs. \u201cThe kids always love you, Dori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove and fear, Dad\u2014that\u2019s the key to motivation. Love and fear.\u201d</p><p>110 is a parking lot during rush hour. We\u2019re barely moving; I could walk faster. Literal y.

Music, to both of us, is the purest expression of emotion. When it\u2019s inspired, it leaves tears in my eyes, leaves me breathless.

Drag racing on the strip? Hot date?\u201d My father laughs at his little joke. I know he doesn\u2019t mean anything by it\u2014to him, I\u2019m an incorrigible good girl. I may be the only girl in the history of California whose father encourages her to stay out later with friends.</p><p>\u201cSure\u2014al of the above.

In other words, he\u2019s a male me.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s been trying to push us together since he transferred in during junior year. We\u2019ve been out a few times and stil hang out occasional y. He\u2019s nice enough, and certainly good-looking enough, but I can go for days without thinking about him. So I do.</p> <p>\u201cIs he aware of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, sheesh.\u201d I\u2019m amused by the fact that my father is interested in my love life. Or lack thereof. \u201cWe get along fine. He\u2019s nice. Fun. Easy to talk to.\u201d Everything Reid isn\u2019t.</p><p>Why am I thinking of him?</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Dad says, wincing. \u201cNo chemistry, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice, fun, easy to talk to\u2014sounds like you\u2019re talking about me!\u201d He glances over his right shoulder to change lanes, winking at me in the process.</p> <p>\u201cI could do worse than someone like you, Dad,\u201d I laugh.</p><p>He pretends to admire himself in the rearview mirror, waggling his eyebrows. \u201cTrue. There\u2019s no hurry, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m eighteen, so he\u2019s right\u2014there\u2019s no hurry. I don\u2019t tel him how much I want that sort of connection\u2014a relationship like he and Mom share. The trust and respect between them is plain to see, but I know that under the surface, their relationship simmers with passion. I don\u2019t tel him how much I worry it wil never happen for me. I don\u2019t tel him how some days, I feel as though everything I do is an attempt to be worthy of being loved like that.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>REID</p><p>Mom meets me at the door with a drink in her hand. \u201cReid!\u201d Plucking at the shirt, her eyes widen and her mouth screws up. Dropping the fabric like it\u2019s covered in manure instead of paint, she rubs her fingers together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just paint, Mom. And it\u2019s dry.\u201d I pul the shirt over my head and keep walking towards the curving marble staircase.</p> <p>\u201cDid you get any on the wal s?\u201d Clearly, a smartass temperament is genetic, and I was dealt a double dose.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I actual y did.

Damn. The judge didn\u2019t even count the time from the accident to my court date against it</p><p>\u2014he started the sentence from the court date, leaving five months, two weeks and four days to go.</p><p>John frowns, confused. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>I should know better than to expect my best friend to get why I won\u2019t be driving on a suspended license. He has no concept of consequences. He\u2019s the luckiest bastard I hang out with\u2014he never gets caught doing anything. It\u2019s bizarre.</p><p>Not to mention unfair as hel .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta lay low for a bit. First getting busted at that party, and now this DUI and community service crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they dropped the charges on the weed, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But standing there in front of a judge, you can\u2019t help feeling like he knows everything you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d John is one of those guys who frequently comes across as stoned off his ass. He\u2019s brighter than he seems</p><p>\u2014unless he\u2019s actual y stoned, in which case he\u2019s practical y brain dead.</p><p>We\u2019re heading into the Hil s for a party some girl is having. John says she\u2019s an heiress who\u2019s struggling to make it as an actress in Hol ywood. The houses we\u2019re passing on the way are as posh as my parents\u2019 place.</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019s real y struggling.</p><p>\u201cSo about this party\u2014any decent prospects for hookups?\u201d I want nothing more than to get total y wasted, grab some hot, legal y-aged, equal y wasted girl and find a room. No brown hair, no brown eyes. No supervision, direction or advice. No sarcasm. No talking.</p><p>\u201cYeah, man. Ample possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d I\u2019m thinking a tal , leggy, blue-eyed blonde with huge tits.</p><p>This is LA\u2014I can\u2019t throw a rock and not hit one of those.</p><p>Dori</p><p>Day three has not gone as I\u2019d envisioned it. Of course, neither did day two.</p><p>First, he showed up an hour late and hungover. He thought he was hiding it (with sunglasses\u2014real y?), but just because I\u2019m personal y na\u00efve when it comes to getting drunk or doing drugs doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know it when I see it. The neighborhoods where I work are rife with the ways and means people use to cope through their disappointing lives\u2014and those coping mechanisms sometimes include substances that don\u2019t do any more than mask the real problems and valid issues.</p><p>Frankly, his slightly bloodshot eyes and lack of energy\u2014</p><p>coupled with the tardiness and an even more contrary coupled with the tardiness and an even more contrary attitude than the previous day\u2014almost pushed me over the edge. I wanted to bundle him right back into the backseat of his fancy car and send him home. I\u2019m supposed to be above such reactions. Some social worker I\u2019l make, if I can\u2019t keep a more even keel. I\u2019l have clients with bigger personality limitations than he\u2019s got, as difficult as that is to imagine at the moment.</p><p>He was a walking safety liability. There was no way I could leave him alone with a paint rol er, not to mention what paint fumes might do to him in his already taxed physical condition. Anything with tools, especial y power tools, was out. The only task I could imagine assigning to him was helping to lay sod in the back yard. I thought I was doing him a favor\u2014he could wear the sunglasses and be out in the fresh air (such as it is\u2014this is LA, after al ), and he wasn\u2019t going to put a nail through his hand.</p><p>Of course, depositing him outside meant I had to abandon the tiling I\u2019d planned to do so I could paint, because somebody had to do it before the carpet arrives.</p><p>Determined to get back to work, I left him outside with Frank, who\u2019s in charge of landscaping.</p><p>When I came out to check on him just before lunch, hoping he hadn\u2019t given Frank any trouble, he was standing in the middle of the half-sodded yard, shirtless, leaning on a tamping tool and chatting up a cute girl in cut-offs and a pink tank top. Judging by the cooler at her feet, she was supposed to be passing out bottles of water. When she turned, I saw that she was Gabriel e Diego, the daughter of the people who would soon own this house\u2014and into whose rental house Reid had crashed his car.</p><p>Her family of five was living in a motel room because of him, and she was smiling up at him like he could crash into her house any old time, no big deal.</p><p>When she spotted me standing on the porch slab, she touched his arm and said something that made him turn.</p><p>Our eyes locked. Without severing that connection, he took a long swal ow from the water bottle, leaned close to her and spoke. At the sound of their laughter, my patience snapped. I stomped back inside and finished painting a second coat of pink on Gabriel e\u2019s bedroom wal s and a coat of primer on the boys\u2019 room without stopping for lunch or a break. By the time Dad arrived to pick me up, the muscles in my back were screaming for mercy. Reid must have gotten Frank to sign his sheet, because I hadn\u2019t seen him again until this morning.</p><p>We finished the master bed and bath wal s today, not speaking beyond obligatory Q &amp; A. He sat with Gabriel e at lunch, which made me uneasy. As I scrawl my name on the line marking the completion of his third day, I say, \u201cYou\u2019re not here to socialize, you\u2019re here to assist with construction of the Diegos\u2019 house, and possibly become more communal y aware.\u201d</p><p>He gapes before making a remark about my (f-word) humanitarianism and how he doesn\u2019t need a savior and if he did, it wouldn\u2019t be me.</p><p>Instead of biting my tongue, I tel him I wouldn\u2019t give him a glass of water if his hair was on fire, nor does he ever have to worry about me trying to save him because I learned years ago that some people aren\u2019t worth the effort.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014so according to you, someone like me isn\u2019t worthy of redemption?\u201d He smirks at such a preposterous notion.</p><p>I turn away from his smug expression and begin sweeping arches of thinset onto the shower wal with a trowel. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in wasting my time on hopeless cases.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWhat about me constitutes hopeless?\u201d I don\u2019t bother to look at him. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t constitute hopeless?\u201d I press a tile into the corner, add a spacer, pick up the next tile and line it up faultlessly level with the first one. \u201cFrom your language to your lack of morals to your inability to consider anyone\u2019s needs or hardships but your own\u2014honestly, what is there of any value to anyone?</p><p>Besides to yourself, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201c I \u2019 m here, in this shithole gangbanger barrio, volunteering to do manual labor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVolunteering? Manual labor? Real y?\u201d I scoff, ignoring his elitist estimation of the respectable blue col ar neighborhood. \u201cFirst, you\u2019re here by court order, and second, you don\u2019t do as much by lunch as the rest of us do before you arrive. You\u2019re done for the day the exact moment your plea bargain agreement specifies, or before, if you get distracted by something, or some one.\u201d He\u2019s actual y worked harder than I\u2019d expected him to, but his superior attitude just makes my usual unbiased judgment fly out the window.</p><p>\u201cAh, so I noticed an attractive girl. That\u2019s your problem?</p><p>Jealous?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sputter and shake my head. \u201cNo, far from it.

If you\u2019l excuse me, I have actual constructive things to do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in al of your altruistic training authorizes you to differentiate between hopeless and salvageable?\u201d he asks, ignoring my attempt to dismiss him. Something about his choice of words and his deadly calm tone makes me look up as he towers over me.</p> <p>I stand slowly. He\u2019s at least eight inches tal er and we\u2019re not two feet apart in the smal space, but this boy doesn\u2019t scare me. I see right through his arrogant indignation, so accustomed to getting what he wants that denial is incomprehensible. In al honesty there might be something worthwhile in there, but it doesn\u2019t matter because he\u2019l never acknowledge its existence. I\u2019m calm, because now I know why I felt such a wave of melancholy when I met him.</p><p>\u201cLike you said\u2014you don\u2019t want saving, Reid. That makes any effort pointless, assuming I planned to bother trying\u2014which I do not.\u201d My voice is as composed as his, but my anger has fal en away while his stil radiates from him like heat waves off of pavement.</p><p>\u201cMr. Alexander, your car is here,\u201d Roberta says from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says without turning.</p><p>I squat down and dip into the thinset again, smear another glob on the wal and begin to smooth it out. Hyper-aware of the fact that he\u2019s stil next to me, I refuse to acknowledge him further. He can stand there until his legs col apse for al I care.</p> <p>\u201cSo you only rescue those who fit into your preordained notions of worth? Doesn\u2019t seem like much of a victory.</p><p>Seems discriminatory and hypocritical, in fact.\u201d He turns and walks out, the front door slamming a moment later.</p><p>So ends day three. Holy Moses, this is going to be tougher than I thought.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean to let it get to this point, I honestly didn\u2019t.</p><p>Like driving in freeway traffic, Reid just brings out the devil in me.</p><p>Tomorrow, we\u2019l prime the baseboards, doors, and bathroom cabinets. I\u2019d like to finish tiling the master bath, but it\u2019s foolish to perform tasks that require a steady hand when angry. The tile needs to be perfectly level, not a crooked mess. I take a deep breath, and then another. I have an hour or two until Dad gets here\u2014plenty of time to push Reid from my mind and get a good start on this shower.</p> <p>Except for a nagging insinuation, one I\u2019m not even sure he\u2019s aware of having made. I cal ed him a hopeless case, and he cal ed me a hypocrite for writing him off as someone not worth saving\u2014right after tel ing me he doesn\u2019t need saving.</p><p>I don\u2019t like having to modify my position once I\u2019ve chosen one, but that doesn\u2019t make me incapable of doing so. So I can\u2019t help wondering\u2014was he merely set on winning a verbal battle, or did Reid Alexander just tel me he wants to be rescued from himself?</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>REID</p><p>You disgust me. This is such an unprecedented statement that I have no idea what to do with it. If she was anyone else, I\u2019d reject it as prejudice because I\u2019m young, famous, rich, entitled\u2014I\u2019ve heard it al , or thought I had. The only other reason for unreasonable animosity is the random girl who doesn\u2019t turn out to be the love of my life after a hot one-nighter\u2014and is somehow surprised by this. Please.</p><p>Could Dori be resentful that I haven\u2019t made an effort to get into her unfashionable shorts? I thought I had her pegged as the sort who wants nothing short of respect, though she can take a fair amount of mockery and come back curiously unperturbed. She may be the most patient person I\u2019ve ever encountered, besides George. No matter what I do, including showing up an hour late with a massive hangover, she tolerates it. Maybe that\u2019s her weird way of showing attraction. Maybe there\u2019s a girl under those ginormous t-shirts who just wants attention like the rest of them.</p><p>Or maybe I\u2019d add a sexual harassment charge to the drunk driving conviction.</p><p>Three weeks and two days to go. I\u2019ve worked on movie sets that were way more grueling, endured costars who were ridiculously unprofessional and survived directors whose tyrannical outbursts would send Dori running for cover. Three and a half weeks and I\u2019l be back to my life.</p> <p>John is about to chew through my last nerve. He and some other guys want to go out tonight. There are no unlame parties, so they\u2019ve decided to bounce through a few clubs.</p><p>And since we\u2019re al underage, they want me along because I can usual y get us al in anywhere, plus VIP treatment.</p><p>Most nights, no problem. Happy to oblige. Tonight, I\u2019m dead\u2014and I already had a couple of seven and sevens to cool down after that exchange with Dorcas. The last thing I need is noise, people and paparazzi. I just want to stay home and flip through the channels until I fal asleep, so I can get up again tomorrow and take a hired car to a pathetic unfinished house that I\u2019m helping to build and landscape... God, what an out-of-character inclination.</p><p>John is having none of it. \u201cCome on, man, just a couple of hours. Why not?\u201d He\u2019s like a whiny toddler. A self-absorbed, ful -grown, 19-year-old toddler.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m exhausted and sunburned and have to get up at the crack of ass again tomorrow, not that you give a shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s summer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to go out and party, not hibernate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, we live in Los Angeles. It\u2019s never time to hibernate. Whatever. I\u2019m dead. We\u2019l go out Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says, dejected. \u201cIf me and the guys are bored to death by then, it\u2019s on you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bother answering beyond repeating, \u201cFriday,\u201d and hanging up. I have a backup of texts al basical y wanting the same thing. Parties I\u2019m invited to, parties someone wants entrance to, requests to go out, people bored out of their minds and everyone wanting to score the next high to escape it. After making sure none of the texts or missed cal s are from George, I toss the phone on the table next to my bed and turn up the volume on the television before clicking it off again and walking around my room, clinking the ice at the bottom of my glass.</p><p>I\u2019m restless, and I never get restless. At the first hint of it, I\u2019m usual y out the door, not stalking around my room like a prisoner in a cel . What am I staying in for, anyway? So I don\u2019t have a hangover tomorrow morning that Dorcas wil disapprove of? Why would I even give a shit what she sanctions as acceptable behavior\u2014she\u2019s probably at home knitting for chrissake.</p><p>I grab the phone and cal John, who\u2019s on his way before I can change my mind.</p><p>A couple of nights ago I wanted to find the opposite of Dorcas Cantrel , but that didn\u2019t exorcize her from my head.</p><p>Tonight I\u2019m searching for her twin, as impossible as it wil be to find someone so plain in the hangouts we frequent.</p><p>Once I find her, I\u2019l be damned if she isn\u2019t begging me to screw her up against the bathroom wal before me and the guys take off.</p><p>Dori</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl. When do you leave for Ecuador?\u201d Deb must be exhausted, but she always makes time for me. I guess she could tel in our last few texts that I\u2019m stressed. She can always tel . It\u2019s like she\u2019s had a wireless connection to me since I was born.</p><p>\u201cTwenty days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it down to days, huh?\u201d I hear the smile in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you counting down \u2019til you go to Quito or \u2019til you leave LA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... I hear you\u2019ve got a daily celebrity sighting at Habitat.\u201d</p><p>I sigh heavily and moan, lying back on my bed. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him.\u201d</p><p>Deb laughs. \u201cOh, come on. You don\u2019t want to talk about him even a little? Hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was eight when you were born, Dori; I know you pretty wel . If you don\u2019t want to talk about him at al , he must be frustrating you in some profound way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, there\u2019s nothing profound about him. He\u2019s as superficial and vacuous as you\u2019d assume.\u201d Great. I\u2019m almost sputtering.</p><p>\u201cAl right, al right, I\u2019m just teasing.\u201d Deb is rarely unkind.</p><p>She\u2019s one aspect of my life that gives me the most joy and the most guilt. I have a loving and supportive family, always enough money for necessities\u2014food, clothing, books\u2014</p><p>while others have poverty, neglect, il ness, and the constant hunger of never enough. For some reason this line of thinking makes me think of Reid, which is absurd. He has every advantage and more, with no excuse for forcing his egocentricity on people who have so much less.</p><p>Pushing him from my mind, I ask Deb about her residency. After four years of col ege and another four years of medical school, she\u2019s final y Dr. Deborah Cantrel .</p><p>To become the pediatrician she\u2019s always wanted to be, she\u2019l be working crazy long hours for the next three years, making barely enough to feed herself and begin paying back her student loans.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how many ER cases are drug seekers.\u201d She sighs, frustrated. \u201cThey\u2019re desperate for a fix, so they come in with phony symptoms. The more experienced doctors assume that everyone who gives</p><p>\u2018pain\u2019 as a symptom is a fraud. We keep a list of the repeat offenders.\u201d</p><p>I try to imagine my sister in that environment, with her social idealism and her ambition to help people. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just what those other doctors need\u2014a balance to the pessimism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , it\u2019s going to be a contentious three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... met any cute doctors?\u201d</p><p>She laughs at my change of subject. \u201cYes, actual y\u2014one of the attending physicians. But as luck would have it, he\u2019s also the most cynical. Last night, he almost missed a possible placental abruption because the mother-to-be is a known addict. She claimed severe back pain, and he was about to send her out the door with Tylenol. I convinced him to let me do an ultrasound on her, for practice, and we had to do an emergency C-section. If she\u2019d gone home, the baby would have died and the patient could have bled to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I\u2019m not sure exactly what she\u2019s talking about, but it sounds intimidating. \u201cYou saved their lives, Deb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, wel . She swore she hasn\u2019t used since she knew she was pregnant, but to him, once an addict, always an addict.\u201d She breathes an exasperated sigh.</p><p>\u201cWe know that\u2019s not true.\u201d Our parents have helped dozens of people kick al types of drug addiction through the years. Though a depressing majority start using again, some stay clean. Dad says he has to keep fighting for those few, because you never know who\u2019s capable of kicking it for good.</p><p>\u201cBradford was brought up in a different environment than we were. He didn\u2019t know much about addicts or poverty until he became a doctor. I got him to talk about it a little bit today. He grew up in an upper middle class suburb, and the worst thing he encountered was other kids who smoked pot or did a little X. To him, someone who\u2019s hooked on cocaine or meth is forever hopeless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think of Reid, and how I told him he was hopeless. How angry he was that I deemed him unworthy of my time or attention. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s addicted to any particular substances, though he\u2019s certainly addicted to his hedonistic substances, though he\u2019s certainly addicted to his hedonistic lifestyle. But is he hopeless? Maybe he\u2019s right. Maybe my snap judgment concerning him makes me a hypocrite.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re educating Bradford about real life, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m attempting to, but he\u2019s the most opinionated, obstinate man I\u2019ve dealt with since Dr. Horsham in second year pathology.\u201d Deb almost quit medical school because of Dr. Horsham, until Mom convinced her to go back and prove she was made of tougher stuff than that.</p><p>After I hang up, I lie on my bed thinking about my sister fighting for an ex-addict. She was right this time, but she won\u2019t always be. There wil always be addicts who lie to get their fixes, taking hospital resources from those who have actual need. Stil , Deb wil find the people everyone else has given up on and resolve the most unmanageable problem\u2014assuming there is a solution. That\u2019s just how she is.</p> <p>Mom was pul ing twelve-hour shifts in the maternity ward when she found out she was pregnant with me. She spent the last two months of her pregnancy on doctor-ordered bed rest, so her intention to fix up the nursery was wrecked.</p><p>My sister\u2019s old crib, unearthed from the attic, stood pathetical y in the center of the otherwise bare room until Deb and Dad took over nursery decoration. Mom had a lamb-based theme planned, but that idea was tossed.</p><p>Thanks to the Discovery Channel, Deb was on a marine life kick, infatuated with the Great Barrier Reef. She insisted on decorating my room with fish.</p><p>Dad says I lucked out\u2014her next fascination was lizards.</p><p>Deb and Dad painted the room turquoise. Twisting up from the floorboards were sections of coral created from orange posterboard, and twenty-two fish were strung from the ceiling, cut in Dad\u2019s woodshop from a pattern and al painted the same iridescent blue-green. Mom had suggested that they be multihued, but Deb refused anything that wasn\u2019t identical to her National Geographic images of damselfish.</p> <p>The posterboard coral is long gone, and Mom and I repainted the room a lighter blue just before I started high school. The fish, though, remain. Attached to strands of transparent fishing line hooked to the ceiling, they swim in a school from my bedroom door to the window. My earliest memories are of those fish. As I lie with my head at the foot of my bed, they sway fluidly in the A/C-generated breeze, forever passing through.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cSupermodel checking you out, two o\u2019clock.\u201d I glance one direction and then the other. \u201cJohn, dude, that\u2019s ten o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>Aside from his inability to remember how to tel time on the face of an actual clock, my wingman is correct. Actual supermodel. Actual y checking me out. And now that I\u2019ve noticed, she\u2019s walking over. Stick-figure thin, she swings non-existent hips, her body and face al planes and angles, a long way from any Dorcas Cantrel doppelganger.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d John says.</p> <p>\u201cHel o,\u201d she offers me her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Dorika.\u201d Of course she is. And the only reason I\u2019l remember her name tomorrow is because it\u2019s ridiculously close to that of a girl she doesn\u2019t resemble at al , who I can\u2019t stop thinking about for some insane reason.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Reid.\u201d In her heels, we stand eye-to-eye. Makeup flawless, dark eyes half-mast and ringed with amethyst, she smiles when I graze her knuckles with my lips.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. Reid Alexander.\u201d She knows who I am.</p><p>Better and better.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m John.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze never wavers from my face; John doesn\u2019t even register with her, though he\u2019s not a bad-looking guy. He might be a little short for her, unless she\u2019s barefoot\u2014but she\u2019s got to be used to that. She\u2019s tal er than the majority of the guys here.</p><p>I motion to the waitress to bring her another drink.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from, Dorika?\u201d Her accent is eastern European.</p> <p>\u201cI am from Budapest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what brings you to LA?\u201d I couldn\u2019t care less about her answer; it\u2019s just part of the game.</p><p>\u201cThe handsome men, of course,\u201d she laughs, tossing waves of dark hair over her shoulder. Her look is calculated, and I chuckle along with her to confirm that I\u2019ve grasped her insinuation. \u201cAlso I am doing, how do you say it, a spread for Elle magazine.\u201d I sense a vulgar comment coming from John and flash him my shut-the-hel -up face. To my amazement, he complies.</p><p>The waitress removes the near-empty glass from Dorika\u2019s fingers and deftly hands off a fresh drink. \u201cIt is rather loud here,\u201d she says, sipping.</p><p>\u201cWel , this is a nightclub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a quiet bar nearby,\u201d John interjects, but he might as wel be mute, for al the attention she\u2019s paying to him.</p><p>\u201cMy hotel is a few blocks away. It is more comfortable.</p><p>Less noisy. You wil come with?\u201d</p><p>I regard her for a moment longer. There\u2019s no reason to say no. No reason at al .</p><p>Dori</p><p>I pul the stirring stick out of the paint to test the consistency, dribbling a spiral onto the smooth white surface, where the liquid squiggles disappear almost instantly. Perfect. I take a satisfied breath, the chemical aroma something I\u2019ve never disliked, even while it singes my nostrils.</p><p>Identical to the past three days, work slows to a standstil when Reid arrives. Now that he\u2019s acquainted with the layout of the house, I\u2019m determined not to go looking for him.</p><p>When the scent of espresso mingles with the odor of the paint, I know he\u2019s found me. I close my eyes for a count to three and a breath of composure before I turn, straightening.</p><p>He\u2019s holding two Starbucks cups, one of which he extends towards me. \u201cTruce?\u201d</p><p>I take the cup, confused.</p><p>He\u2019s smirking, having anticipated my reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s a double-shot soy latte. If you hate it, my driver can go back and get something else...\u201d</p><p>Blinking, I wonder what kind of stalking he did to know my favorite coffee drink.</p><p>Right. Because a celebrity is going to stalk me. \u201cNo, this is... fine. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He glances around the smal bathroom, takes a sip from his cup. \u201cSecond coat on the cabinets and trim today, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou finished the tiling? How late did you stay?\u201d He looks impressed, his fingers reaching towards the wal and curling back. \u201cIs it okay to touch it?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSure. It\u2019s dry.\u201d</p><p>Stroking one finger across the glossy white squares, he says, \u201cThey\u2019re so even.\u201d His laughter is unlike the derisive chuckle I\u2019ve become accustomed to over the past few days.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d done this, it would look like a shitty optical il usion.\u201d His half-grin dares me to disagree.</p><p>My mouth pul s up on one side, involuntarily. \u201cUm, thanks.\u201d</p><p>When I finish caulking the master bath shower, I check to see if Reid is on task with the cabinets in the second bathroom. I hear Gabriel e\u2019s voice before I round the corner, so I hover just outside the door, listening.</p><p>\u201cI just want to live my life, you know? I don\u2019t care about col ege. I\u2019ve been in school long enough.\u201d From what I remember of a conversation with her mother, Gabriel e spent the past six weeks in summer school after having floundered her way through tenth grade, more interested in boys and partying than keeping up with her assignments.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d He\u2019s noncommittal, when I would be trying to discourage such a foolish decision.</p><p>\u201cI want to be a model. And then an actress, you know, later. After I\u2019m too old to do, like, swimsuit shoots and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel e?\u201d They both start at the sound of my voice, which echoes in the smal room. I pretend not to notice their matching reactions. \u201cI thought you were working outside with Frank today?\u201d</p><p>She glares at me, petulant. \u201cI was just taking a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I say pleasantly, leaning a shoulder on the doorjamb and pointedly waiting for her to leave.</p><p>She huffs a sigh and rol s her eyes, turning back to Reid.</p><p>\u201cSee you at lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d His eyes flick to her and straight back to the cabinet, stroking the brush downward with the wood grain, remarkably straight. As he dips the brush into the paint, he looks up at me. \u201cNeed something, boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only sixteen, you know.\u201d</p><p>The brush stil s and he crooks an eyebrow, eyeing me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d His voice is pure chal enge, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>I straighten, running my finger along the groove in the door trim. He should have primed this when he primed the cabinets. Doing al of the priming first is more efficient.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the daughter of the people for whom we\u2019re building this house. I feel a responsibility to them where she\u2019s concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA responsibility to what?\u201d</p><p>I glance at him and know he\u2019s uber-aware of what he\u2019s doing. Making me spel it out. Fine. I can do that. \u201cA responsibility to make sure the court-ordered \u2018volunteer\u2019</p><p>understands that he needs to keep his distance from the underage girl while on this property.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a moment. \u201cSo if I run into her off property, for instance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not what I mean. I mean... just stay away from her, period. Why would you even\u2014I don\u2019t get why\u2014</p><p>don\u2019t you ever want to be a better person?\u201d My breath catches. I can\u2019t believe I just said that.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what?\u201d he says, taken aback.</p><p>That was so out of line, but before I can backtrack, he slams the brush down, surrounding it with a halo splatter of paint on the plastic sheeting. He stands up and glares down at me. \u201cWhat I choose to do or not do is none of your business. Who I choose to do or not do is also none of your business. Shit.\u201d</p><p>Shouldering past me, he goes straight out into the back yard. I should fol ow him and apologize, but I doubt he wants to hear anything I have to say. Besides, I\u2019m right about Gabriel e. She\u2019s young and she\u2019s starstruck. In no way are they on an equal playing field. I may think she\u2019s a little twerp, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from wanting to keep her from ending up emotional y damaged by a guy like Reid Alexander.</p><p>So much for that truce.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>REID</p><p>What the hel is it with this girl? No matter what I do, I can\u2019t catch a break from her nonstop condemnation.</p><p>Truth? That Gabriel e chick is hot, so in the interest of not being bored off my nut, I don\u2019t mind her flirting with me. I\u2019d also be wil ing to bet she\u2019s no virgin. But virgin or not, she should be hooking up with some guy her own age, if that\u2019s what she wants, not some guy who\u2019s wel past eighteen.</p><p>And since I\u2019m not a complete idiot, I don\u2019t need to be told that.</p><p>When I said that thing about taking her off the property, I was just pointing out the big fat hole in Dorcas\u2019s reasoning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Exhibit A: Gabriel e Diego is jailbait anywhere, not just \u201con this property.\u201d (Side effect of having a crack attorney for my paternal role model: if you\u2019re going to argue a point with me, don\u2019t leave gaps in your logic.)</p><p>I\u2019m so pissed my hands are shaking. Usual y this type of response fol ows a chat with my dad, after which I retreat to the basement to pound the shit out of a hundred pound heavy bag. We\u2019ve got an entire gym setup down there; my trainer meets me several times a week when I\u2019m not on location. Or performing compulsory community service.</p><p>The back yard is thickly populated, and of course this is where Gabriel e was banished. Judging by the look on her face, she assumes I fol owed her outside. When she glances at me with a provocative smile, a boredom-exterminating scheme pops into my head. One that wil drive Dorcas batshit crazy for the next three weeks.</p><p>Community service just got considerably more interesting.</p> <p>Dori</p><p>I\u2019l give him ten minutes to throw his temper tantrum before I bring him back inside. He needs to understand that messing around with Gabriel e is unacceptable. I would march outside and say it just like that, but he\u2019s evidently taking anything I say as a dare, which is the last thing I want.</p><p>Final y, I settle on apologizing to him for the better person comment\u2014I stil can\u2019t believe I said that\u2014and discussing my anxiety concerning Gabriel e with Roberta, privately. Hopeful y she can keep an eye on the situation.</p><p>Without me involved, he won\u2019t feel goaded to do something everyone would regret.</p><p>The back yard is teeming with volunteers because we got a shipment of trees and shrubs yesterday, which should be transplanted from containers to ground promptly. It doesn\u2019t take long to locate Reid, because every woman in the yard and most of the men are watching him. Much as I\u2019d like to, I can\u2019t blame them. The sight of him is simply compel ing.</p> <p>While digging a hole for one of the three 30-gal on live oaks that wil line the back fence and provide shade for the yard, he\u2019s stripped off his t-shirt. Hard lines of definition ripple across his back and shoulders as he as he plunges the shovel into the ground, heaving mounds of earth out and piling it to the side. His jeans ride low on his hips, showing off his enviable movie-star abs. Muscles flexing and contracting, it\u2019s clear that what he\u2019s doing is strenuous, yet he doesn\u2019t slow or tire when other volunteers take wheezing breaks for water.</p><p>Looks like I\u2019l be finishing the cabinets myself.</p><p>Before I turn to go back inside, I spot Gabriel e standing a few feet from Reid. After tossing one contemptuous look my way, she flips her glossy black hair over her shoulder and turns back to watch him. Though she\u2019s only two years younger than me, it feels like a lifetime of difference.</p><p>Testing her sexuality, she thinks she\u2019s caught a beautiful fish, when in reality, she\u2019s netted a shark. As soon as she gets too close, he could snap through the fragile filaments and consume her.</p><p>I want to trust Reid not to be what I fear he is, but I know better. There\u2019s not a trustworthy bone in that impeccably muscled body.</p><p>Chapter 10</p> <p>REID</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen Dori since I left her standing in the bathroom with her mouth hanging open. I wanted some privacy to get my shit together after that exchange, but with a yard ful of people, solitude wasn\u2019t an option. So, I did the next best thing\u2014I grabbed a shovel and dug a big fucking hole.</p><p>By lunch break, we\u2019ve planted three trees and half the shrubs. Dori materializes outside, talking with some tool I haven\u2019t seen before today. They load their paper plates and she takes the lawn chair next to him, eating her burger while he talks. He seems unfamiliar with a basic principle of conversation: reciprocal speaking. Despite this, she seems engrossed in his monologue. Either that or she\u2019s too polite to be real with people other than myself.</p><p>Gabriel e is literal y sitting at my feet in the stil -patchy new sod. I don\u2019t have to do anything to keep her enthral ed outside of an occasional smile. She\u2019s jabbering about her modeling and acting aspirations, her loathing of school and her immature classmates, and what kind of car her older ex-boyfriend drove. (A Mustang? Please.) I think this last is an attempt to il ustrate her experience with boys. And/or an attempt to il ustrate her experience with boys. And/or fast cars.</p><p>\u201cThe car you had was a Porsche, right?\u201d She flutters her lashes as though this isn\u2019t a peculiar subject for her to bring up, or for us to discuss.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. Had being the operative word.\u201d Her eyes widen. \u201cI guess you\u2019re pretty pissed it got wrecked, huh?\u201d As though my car wrecked itself.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>She lays her hand on my knee. \u201cAw, I\u2019m real y sorry, Reid.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but chuckle. This is the most awkward exchange ever. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry... that I drove my Porsche into your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you did it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>I laugh out loud and smile down at her, \u201cWel , that\u2019s true. I wish you\u2019d been the judge in my case.\u201d She beams up at me.</p><p>I hazard a glance at Dori, who\u2019s staring daggers into me.</p><p>I swear if we were within striking distance and she had a plastic fork in her hand, I\u2019d be concerned. Instead of returning her heated expression, I keep the grin affixed to my face and add a sardonic air to it\u2014one eyebrow arched, indifferent eyes. This look has been refined to perfection over many years with Dad. Sends him through the goddamned roof. Does it work on Dorcas?</p><p>Oh, yes. Yes, it does.</p><p>I can hear the guy next to her saying, \u201cUh, Dori? Did you hear what I\u2014\u201d just before she leaps up and charges inside without answering him. From the look on his face, this is uncharacteristic behavior for her.</p><p>I think I\u2019l spend the last couple of hours planting shrubs, and get Frank to sign my sheet. No sense in pushing her too far this afternoon. I have two and a half weeks to harass her to the edge of insanity.</p><p>Dori</p><p>\u201cI understand your concern, Dori, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019l actually do anything...\u201d Roberta\u2019s sentence trails off indecisively.</p><p>It\u2019s up to me to convince her. \u201cI\u2019d be less concerned if Gabriel e was assigned to work with someone who\u2019l keep a better eye on her, that\u2019s al .\u201d I feel like I\u2019m tattling. Having just told the project director that I suspect an adult volunteer of socializing too warmly with a juvenile volunteer, I guess I am tattling. \u201cJust to be safe,\u201d I add.</p><p>She taps her pen on her clipboard, gnawing her lower lip. \u201cWel , the least confrontational thing might be to reassign Gabriel e to you, and reassign Reid to Frank.\u201d A puzzling sense of disappointment settles over me, but I shake it off. \u201cThat works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel e doesn\u2019t come in on Fridays, so I\u2019l leave Reid with you tomorrow, and I\u2019l talk to him about moving to Frank\u2019s crew next week before he leaves for the day. We\u2019l get Gabriel e situated on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Roberta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, wel , better safe than sorry, I suppose.\u201d She bustles off as I clean up for the day and prepare for tomorrow. Reid off as I clean up for the day and prepare for tomorrow. Reid is going to be furious at the interference, and Gabriel e wil probably have a meltdown when she isn\u2019t al owed to hang around him. There\u2019s no way for her to see that we\u2019re trying to protect her; the separation wil look like pure malice from her point of view.</p><p>My last day to supervise Reid has been almost stress-free.</p><p>He showed up on time and made no comments or snide remarks (other than cal ing me Dorcas al day, and what can I say to that since it is my name). He was a model volunteer. He even kept his shirt on.</p><p>My iPod fried itself last night, so I brought a radio this morning and had it tuned to a pop station when he came in.</p><p>I told him he could change it to whatever he wanted, but he hasn\u2019t moved the station. As we\u2019re wrapping up for the day, the DJ plays a new duet. Without realizing it, I hum along. At the end chorus, Reid turns to me and sings into his paintbrush, \u201cWhere were you, baby, where were you? When I was al alone, with no one of my own?\u201d</p><p>I sing back, \u201cWhere were you, baby, where were you?</p><p>When I needed you there, when nobody else cared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was here, I was right here, looking for you, yeah...\u201d we both sing, and then we laugh at our own goofiness.</p><p>\u201cYou have a great voice,\u201d he says, but not like he\u2019s surprised.</p><p>I lower my glance and mumble, \u201cThanks,\u201d oddly pleased.</p><p>Coming from him, the words feel different, as though I haven\u2019t heard that exact expression of praise a hundred times before.</p><p>From the doorway, Roberta says, \u201cMr. Alexander, could you see me before you leave? I\u2019l be in the kitchen, checking the sink hookups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Sliding his eyes back to me when she disappears, his head tilts a fraction to the side and he asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. With Gabriel e gone al day, I almost forgot about her and the supervisor swap occurring on Monday. \u201cUm, something about work assignments. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork assignments? I thought you were the boss of me.\u201d His smile is tentative, like he\u2019s teasing me but also testing to see if there\u2019s something I\u2019m not tel ing him.</p><p>Coward that I am, I shrug and begin cleaning the paintbrushes, and Reid is silent for a moment before he hammers the lid onto a 5-gal on bucket of paint and then places his folded timesheet on the floor next to me. \u201cI\u2019l swing by to pick this up after I talk to Roberta.\u201d When he returns five minutes later, I brace for an offensive comment or another quarrel over my unwelcome judgments or interference, but neither occurs. He snatches the paper I\u2019ve signed without a word and leaves. As he storms out, I cringe, guilt-ridden after the il usory camaraderie in which we spent the day. At the inevitable slam of the front door, someone in the hal exclaims,</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d and a moment later, I remember to breathe.</p><p>Monday is going to be a nightmare.</p><p>Nick is coming over tonight. After he showed up at the Diego House yesterday\u2014a breath of fresh air in his non-designer jeans and thrift store t-shirt\u2014I couldn\u2019t say no when he asked if we could hang out.</p><p>I hear his voice downstairs, his courteous, \u201cGood evening, Reverend Cantrel ,\u201d though Dad has urged him countless times to cal him Doug.</p><p>As I leave my room, I glance at the clock on my wal .</p><p>He\u2019s exactly on time, the minute hand clicking onto the twelve as my father intones, \u201cGood evening, Nicholas.\u201d Nick fails to hear the playful nature I immediately recognize behind Dad\u2019s words. \u201cIt\u2019s actual y just Nick, sir.\u201d He spares a quick look in my direction as I reach the last step.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s just Doug, Nick.\u201d My father slaps his shoulder lightly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go out?\u201d Nick asks after Dad disappears back into his study. \u201cI think that movie starring your new associate is stil out... School Pride, right? I heard it was... cute.\u201d</p><p>Nick isn\u2019t into cute, and general y speaking, neither am I.</p><p>I\u2019d not even considered seeing School Pride, but now that Nick\u2019s mentioned it, I\u2019m curious. I know Reid Alexander from his fame, but I know nothing of his so-cal ed talent. I\u2019ve never seen a single one of his movies\u2014like Nick, I don\u2019t real y term them films. A film is something social y consequential or historical y evocative. A movie is hol ow entertainment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh my gosh. I\u2019m a film snob.</p><p>Despite my sudden compulsion to see Reid\u2019s movie, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m sitting through it with Nick. \u201cLet\u2019s order Chinese and watch something here. Dad just got a new batch of DVDs.\u201d Nick smiles his agreement. Pul ing the takeout menu from our menu drawer and grabbing the phone, I determine not to think of Reid again tonight. \u201cI\u2019m getting sesame chicken. Anything with chicken is pretty good. Their beef dishes, not so much.\u201d</p><p>When the food arrives, Dad materializes momentarily.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to watch the movie with us, Rever\u2014uh, Doug?\u201d Nick asks.</p> <p>Dad sighs and shakes his head. \u201cThis week\u2019s sermon is being a butt. I\u2019m determined to wrestle a few inspiring concepts down.\u201d Grabbing a diet soda, his carton of fried rice and a pair of chopsticks, he adds, \u201cI won\u2019t be leaving the study until your mother comes home.\u201d Then he winks at me, as though Nick and I plan to canoodle on the sofa (a Dad term more fitting for his parents\u2019 generation than his own). Mom\u2019s shift ends at midnight.</p><p>I\u2019m never sure if Dad just has absolute confidence that I\u2019d never do anything wicked, or if he actual y thinks I should loosen up. I hope it\u2019s not the latter, because if I\u2019m the girl whose pastor father thinks she\u2019s too uptight, that would be pretty darned depressing.</p><p>Nick takes the center of the sofa while I nestle into the corner, legs pretzeled. His elbow rests lightly on my bent knee in between bites. Everyone in my family tends to comment throughout anything we watch, but Nick never talks during films. It\u2019s a sure bet I\u2019l end up biting my tongue figuratively or literal y at least half a dozen times. Final y, the credits rol .</p><p>\u201cThat was less clever than the reviews promised,\u201d he observes, clicking the remote. His hand rests lightly on my knee, a non-insistent pressure not easily read. The world has gone dark outside, the room dim in the solitary lamplight without the glow of the screen. \u201cYour house is always so quiet. Mine is the exact opposite\u2014thinly contained chaos.\u201d</p><p>Nick is an only child, but his parents take in special needs foster children and train service dogs, and his house is in an almost constant uproar. I\u2019ve wondered but never had the nerve to ask if he ever yearned for the individual attention he would have been due as an only child, or if he felt neglected by his parents\u2019 dedicated care of other peoples\u2019 children.</p> <p>My eyes find our elderly dog, curled on her pil owed bed across the room. \u201cThat\u2019s true, Esther and I don\u2019t produce a lot of commotion.\u201d Her ears perk at the sound of her name, black eyes blinking as she waits to see if I require her attention. Her whitened muzzle rests on her equal y whitened paws.</p><p>Nick leans into my line of vision, pushing thoughts of Esther from my mind as he inclines his head and kisses me. His lips are warm and his kiss careful and gentle. I kiss him back, wishing he would deepen the kiss, that his hand would stroke my leg, or stray to my waist to pul me closer.</p><p>None of these things occur. This is not our first kiss, but each one we\u2019ve shared has been the same: pleasant.</p><p>He pul s away, smiling. I smile back, and tel myself I\u2019m not disappointed.</p><p>Neither am I in danger of losing control. Which is good.</p><p>Safe. And exactly what I need.</p> <p>Esther huffs a soft doggie sigh from her pal et and closes her eyes. Nick, even with the multiple dog and people scents attached to him, is no risk to me.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>REID</p><p>Dori doesn\u2019t trust me. I\u2019ve got that much figured out. She clearly has no idea of what a guy in my position is offered on a daily basis. I could sleep with a different girl, or several, every night. There\u2019s always another one, ready to go. I\u2019ve had offers\u2014which I absolutely do not accept\u2014from girls so young it makes me want to track down their parents and tel them they should be arrested for raising baby whores. Even when it comes to the ones who are borderline old enough, I won\u2019t do some chick who thinks she\u2019s al grown up just because she\u2019s experienced.</p><p>I underestimated Dori\u2019s determination to keep the Diego girl away from me. Not only did she manage to get me moved outside with Frank permanently, she\u2019s now supervising Gabriel e herself. I\u2019m not sure what was expected from this arrangement, but I bet it wasn\u2019t the shit-fit that went down this morning when Gabriel e found out about it.</p><p>Al egedly, she picked up a hammer and threw it. Not at a person, but supposedly it narrowly missed a window and lodged itself in the drywal of the dining nook. I didn\u2019t lodged itself in the drywal of the dining nook. I didn\u2019t witness this meltdown, but thanks to Frank being a gossip addict, everyone outside stays ful y informed of every rumor inside or out. It\u2019s not unlike a mini movie set.</p><p>\u201cRoberta threatened to cal her mother and send her home if she didn\u2019t calm down, but Gabriel e stil owes at least thirty hours.\u201d Frank looks at me and shrugs. \u201cI had no idea that girl would miss working with me so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams, old man,\u201d quips his wife, Darlene, who\u2019s loading bedding plants into a wheelbarrow. Her hair is entirely silver and longer than I\u2019ve ever seen on a woman her age. It hangs in a fat braid down her back. \u201cCome on, kid, let\u2019s get these pansies in the ground.\u201d I realize she\u2019s talking to me when no one else moves.</p> <p>By lunch I\u2019ve learned how to plant pansies (\u201cNot too deep! Not so close together!\u201d), and the fact that Frank and Darlene retired five years ago, declared themselves bored stupid six months later, and decided to design landscaping for Habitat homes instead of going on cruises and taking up crafts.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Frank mean, about Gabriel e owing thirty hours?\u201d I\u2019m staring at my hands, which are filthy. I couldn\u2019t plant flowers with gloves on (earning, \u201cNoob,\u201d from Darlene), so there are solid black lines of dirt under al ten fingernails. My manicurist is going to kil me.</p><p>\u201cThe families approved to get a house have to put in a few hundred hours of \u2018sweat equity.\u2019 Gabriel e\u2019s parents both work two jobs, and her brothers are too young to put in time.\u201d She gives me a weird look. \u201cUp until last week, Gabriel e was total y uninterested in helping out.\u201d I fol ow her to the tap where she rinses off the hand tools we just used. When she doesn\u2019t elaborate, I rol my hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you became a... volunteer.\u201d Ah. \u201cSo you think my presence, er, motivated her to participate.\u201d</p><p>She nods, giving me that squinty, old-lady, I-see-through-you look. Christ. Has Dorcas alerted everyone that I\u2019m preying on the under-aged girl?</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not interested in Gabriel e. She\u2019s a child. I want nothing to do with her, okay?\u201d</p><p>Several things happen at once. Darlene blinks, eyebrows rising, as she stares over my shoulder. In the same moment, I hear a strangled whimper and rapidly retreating footsteps.</p><p>Wel , shit.</p><p>Dori</p><p>I knew Friday that I was in for it today with Gabriel e. I spent the whole weekend dreading it. Even so, I misjudged the level her outrage would reach at being separated from Reid. I should have known.</p><p>The thunk of the hammer hitting the wal was, oddly enough, the catalyst for calming her. I think it stunned her that she could do something so destructive and potential y deadly. Thank God no one was in the path of that airborne tool; the claw imbedded itself into the drywal . Roberta, Gabriel e and I stood there in shock for a ful minute before Roberta cleared her throat and asked, \u201cMaybe you\u2019re too upset to work today?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel e\u2019s answer was a whisper delivered towards her feet. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Roberta and I exchanged a look and I gave her a faint nod. \u201cAl right, then. Fol ow Dori, and I\u2019l see you at lunch break.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel e and I spent the morning patching the damaged kitchenette drywal , fol owed by measuring, marking and dril ing holes in every cabinet door in the whole house for the hardware we\u2019l instal this afternoon. My ears were ringing from the constant high whine of the dril in confined spaces.</p><p>Gabriel e hadn\u2019t uttered a single word during the entire three hours. \u201cTwo more and then it\u2019s time for lunch,\u201d I said, turning to find she wasn\u2019t in the room. I had no idea how long she\u2019d been gone, but I had a good idea where I could find her.</p><p>\u201cRats,\u201d I muttered, stalking towards the back door.</p><p>I forgot to take off the goggles or leave the battery-powered dril behind. Thank the stars I was carrying the darned thing business end down, because as I yanked the back door open, Gabriel e bul eted through it. I jumped back as she lurched past me, crying.</p><p>\u201cGabriel e?\u201d The sound of my voice only sped her up.</p><p>She shoved the front door open, throwing, \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d over her shoulder. The engine on her twenty-year-old clunker thundered to life out front a few seconds later.</p><p>Reid.</p><p>As I stride onto the back patio, he turns from where he stands with Darlene at the faucet. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d I step closer and lower my voice when I notice the audience of people pretending not to listen. I don\u2019t care about embarrassing him, but Gabriel e\u2019s distress is no one else\u2019s business. \u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d I hiss.</p><p>His eyes travel the length of me, just as he did last week when we met, except today his gaze lingers on my legs, the dril clutched in my hand, and the safety goggles stil on my face. His answer is al lazy insolence. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Shoving the goggles onto my head, I raise my chin. \u201cI\u2019m talking about Gabriel e, who just stormed through the house, very upset. Stop acting like you\u2019re oblivious, when we both know you\u2019re the one who caused it.\u201d He steps closer and looks down at me. \u201cI didn\u2019t do or say a damned thing to her.\u201d He gestures towards Darlene without breaking our eye contact. \u201cAnd I have a rock-solid alibi, Dorcas.\u201d</p><p>Darlene steps closer. \u201cDori, calm down, hon. Gabriel e came</p><p>outside</p><p>overheard</p><p>something</p><p>misunderstood, that\u2019s al . She\u2019l get over it.\u201d I am stunned speechless. I cannot believe this. He\u2019s managed to win over Darlene! Is there a woman in this world, besides me, who\u2019s immune to him? I turn and stomp back into the house without replying, which is incredibly rude of me and I\u2019l have to apologize to her later.</p><p>I would dearly like to take a hammer to the drywal myself. It\u2019s too bad there\u2019s no demolition on this job, because I\u2019d be a whirling dervish of destruction today.</p><p>Gabriel e and I could team up and take down a house this size like twin tornadoes.</p><p>After lunch (during which Reid and I sit on opposite sides of the yard), I grab the ratchet screwdriver set, gather the handles, knobs and screws, and head for the master bathroom. I\u2019ve resigned myself to working alone for the rest of the day, which is fine with me, but it\u2019s boring with no music. I forgot to bring the radio today, and my iPod, tragical y, is unfixable. If I want music, I\u2019l have to provide it for myself.</p><p>Starting with the under-sink cabinets, I line up the screws with a chrome hinge while balancing the door on my foot, and fit the ratchet to a screw and crank it, click-click-click. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time I\u2019m adding the chrome handle, I\u2019ve got a slow, steady beat going and I\u2019m singing a soft song cal ed</p><p>\u201cGravity\u201d by Alison Krauss. It\u2019s about a girl who leaves home and kind of never looks back, because once she\u2019s gone, she realizes that life isn\u2019t as straightforward as she\u2019d once thought.</p><p>When I stand up to grab another hinge and set of screws for the next door, Reid is standing in the doorway, his hands shoved into his pockets. My voice falters, but I finish the last line before going silent. I don\u2019t know how long he\u2019s been there. For a moment he doesn\u2019t say anything, and then his eyes shift to the cabinet doors stacked against the wal . \u201cRoberta sent me to help with the cabinets.\u201d I grab a door without replying and position it as I did the last one. Since the hinges wil be placed on the opposite side from the last one, it won\u2019t be as easy to attach, but I know what I\u2019m doing, and it\u2019s not an impossible job to do alone. Aside from the fact that I\u2019d rather do it without him standing there staring at me.</p><p>When he doesn\u2019t take the unspoken hint, I say, \u201cI don\u2019t need help.\u201d</p> <p>I expect him to turn and go, but he doesn\u2019t. Bracing his shoulder against the doorjamb, he crosses his arms over his chest and watches me. I ignore him, balance the door, line up the hinge with the predril ed holes, and attempt to twist the screws in partway by hand.</p><p>The first screw doesn\u2019t catch, pops out of the hinge and flies across the ceramic tile floor, stopping when it bumps against his boot. Without missing a beat I grab another screw and repeat the process, with an identical result. \u201cHoly Moses,\u201d I mutter, which earns a rude laugh from Reid as he leans to pick up the screws at his feet. He jingles them in his hand like Dad does with loose change.</p><p>\u201cAny time you want me to hold something, or screw something, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. A patented Reid Alexander double entendre.</p><p>Final y, the screws catch, and I offer up a silent prayer of thanks while wondering how much trouble I\u2019d be in if I stood up and kicked him in the shin with my steel-toed boot.</p> <p>Hard.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>REID</p><p>I think she seriously wants to strangle me right now. I haven\u2019t decided if that\u2019s how I want her to feel or not.</p><p>I watch her attach the third cabinet door\u2014the one with the hinges on the right. She\u2019s left-handed, so it\u2019s easy enough for her. The last thing she wants is my assistance.</p><p>I\u2019m weighing the desire to keep her irritation level as high as possible against the suspicion that the longer I loiter in the doorway, the higher the likelihood she\u2019l refuse to sign my timesheet at 3:00.</p> <p>She sighs before lining up the hinges with the last door, and I imagine the words threading through her head as she pleads with the hardware to cooperate. The first time it begins to angle off course, I step up and take it from her, our fingers brushing. She jumps like my hand is fire, recovers quickly and begins twisting the screws in by hand.</p><p>When they\u2019re in as far as they can go without the screwdriver\u2019s assistance, she picks up the tool and drives them in the rest of the way as I brace the door. She doesn\u2019t speak, and neither do I.</p><p>I hate that watching her handle that screwdriver is turning me on.</p><p>I hate that I\u2019m waiting for an excuse to touch her again.</p><p>I hate that I narrowly resisted begging her to continue singing.</p><p>Fol owing her to the next bathroom, I\u2019m staring at the curved lines of her calves and the not-quite imperceptible sway of her hips (hidden under another oversized t-shirt\u2014</p><p>this one says D.A.R.E.). I get this sudden impression that she\u2019s psychic because I swear to God\u2014her ears are darkening like she can read my mind. So I concentrate harder.</p><p>When she sets the tool on the counter, I pick it up. \u201cI\u2019l do the next one,\u201d I say when she turns and sees me holding it.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be teaching me, right?\u201d Her mouth snaps closed and she spins back around to select the door. There are only two doors to instal in this microscopic bathroom that al three Diego kids wil share. The entire room would fit inside my shower.</p><p>Two minutes later: I admit that I thought this whole working-with-tools thing would be easier than it is. Getting the damned screw to stay connected with the driver bit is a bitch. One interesting note, though\u2014despite some of my more colorful curses, it\u2019s obvious Dori is enjoying the fact that I don\u2019t have the innate ability to wield a ratchet screwdriver with ease. Her smile is a little too smug for my liking.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m not a natural at this type of screwing,\u201d I say, and my God, her face. I\u2019ve just discovered the secret to spreading the blush everywhere.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t get it. So... she\u2019s hot, or not?\u201d John asks.</p><p>We\u2019re hanging out on the terrace of his 22nd floor apartment on Olympic, lounging on Adirondack chairs, a cold six-pack on the glazed concrete between us.</p><p>Downtown is alive and beckoning, but I\u2019ve persuaded him, for the time being, to take a break for one night.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d I answer, and he shoots me a confused look, tipping back the bottle in his hand as I stare out over the cityscape. For some reason, I mentioned something about Dori, and now, I\u2019d rather drop it.</p><p>\u201cTel me more about the apartment,\u201d I say. For the past couple of weeks, John\u2019s been trying to convince me to rent the penthouse suite that\u2019s opening up a few floors above him. I told him I\u2019d think about it, though I\u2019m not sure I want to be that near John 24/7. He starts rattling off square footage and view and party possibilities while I\u2019m trying not to answer his question in my head.</p><p>Dori Cantrel : hot or not?</p><p>She\u2019s nothing like my usual fare. Nothing at al .</p><p>But that doesn\u2019t exactly answer the question, does it?</p><p>Dori</p><p>\u201cI miss you.\u201d I try not to sound like I\u2019m pouting, but I feel Deb\u2019s absence more than I ever have. \u201cYou\u2019re so far away now.\u201d Technical y, she\u2019s been gone for eight years, but she did her pre-med undergrad and med school close to home.</p><p>Now she\u2019s in a different time zone, and the hours she Now she\u2019s in a different time zone, and the hours she keeps are impossible to figure out. Working a mind-numbing eighty hours a week at the hospital, she has no consistent schedule. Texting or cal ing me whenever she has five minutes has become the norm, if she isn\u2019t spending that five minutes eating or sleeping.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby girl.\u201d She sounds exhausted and I feel contrite for sulking. \u201cI miss you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s, um, Bradford?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a moment, and I read the silence between us. \u201cDori, can you keep a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsshh,\u201d I say. \u201cYou know I\u2019m the ultimate secret-keeper.\u201d I savor the sound of her warm chuckle in my ear. \u201cTrue.</p><p>Wel ...we had sort of a date Sunday night. I mean, it wasn\u2019t a date, real y... he just shared his take-out with me when I had ten minutes for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he sort of one of your bosses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not evaluating me\u2014the one time we interacted was because he was stepping in for someone else...\u201d The way her words trail off, she\u2019s either fal ing asleep on me, or she\u2019s thinking about what she isn\u2019t tel ing me. \u201cSo, um, how\u2019s the Habitat place going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting the days until I\u2019m gone.\u201d I\u2019m thinking to myself Deb and Bradford, sittin\u2019 in a tree... but I resolve to let her tel me about him at her own pace. We\u2019ve never hidden anything from each other indefinitely.</p><p>\u201cReid Alexander stil being a jackhole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l be in Ecuador soon. By the time you return, his community service wil be over, and you\u2019l never have to see or work with him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I\u2019m not disappointed at the thought of his absence. I\u2019m not. He does nothing, says nothing unless it\u2019s calculated to make me uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Deb says, a subtle chal enge before I change the subject to col ege concerns like dorm life and how to dodge the freshmen fifteen.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>REID</p><p>I was wondering when an uninvited film crew was going to show up. I\u2019m actual y surprised it took them this long.</p><p>Paparazzi, as careless as they appear, know better than to trespass on personal property. But the Habitat property is tiny, and telescopic lenses are standard for these guys.</p><p>Camped out in adjacent yards, the shrewd ones undoubtedly paid the neighbors off to get closer. This is the sort of thing George would term \u201cfree positive PR\u201d\u2014an occurrence that I, apparently, can\u2019t get too much of. The only hitch is the fact that I have to be here the rest of this week plus two more; this situation could morph into insanity central if it isn\u2019t managed.</p><p>Stripping the heavy work gloves off as I go, I wander inside to find Roberta. She\u2019s talking to the general contractor about what grade of insulation to use in the attic.</p><p>I could fal asleep from extreme disinterest any minute.</p><p>Luckily, they finish up in a minute or so and she turns to me warily. \u201cYes, um, Reid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to let you know that there are photogs out there\u2014paparazzi\u2014not on the property, but as close as they there\u2014paparazzi\u2014not on the property, but as close as they can legal y get. With me outside, it\u2019s gonna be a zoo.</p><p>Thought I should warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She\u2019s immediately flustered; obviously this is something new for her. She moves to a rear window.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re out there now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Peering out, she narrows her eyes, scanning, and then gasps softly. \u201cWhat in the world? There\u2019s someone balancing on top of a swing set... and on the roof next door!\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do? I guess I should have considered this probability...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going anywhere, now that they know where I am. I already cal ed my manager. He\u2019s sending bodyguards to make sure they keep their distance from me, and he\u2019s alerting the police to make sure they respect property boundaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police? Oh, dear.\u201d</p><p>Roberta continues to stare at the guy on the roof next door while I push off from the counter and head back outside, pul ing the work gloves on. Frank says we\u2019re demolishing an old fence at the back of the property\u2014so termite-ridden that one good kick could turn it into a cloud of splinters. Painting wal s was tedious. Tearing shit down?</p><p>Not.</p><p>Predictably, the photogs wake up when I exit the back door. Some of them try cal ing to me, like I\u2019m walking the red carpet or something, which pisses me off.</p><p>I\u2019m working. Can\u2019t they see that?</p><p>Dori</p><p>As I fel asleep last night, I considered tel ing Roberta to finish this job without me. I miss my VBS kids and their joyful, artless voices practicing the choral arrangements. I miss singing along with them. I miss babysitting people who are immature because they\u2019re five, not because they\u2019re arrogant buttheads. Most of al , I miss being unacquainted with Reid Alexander. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just when I think to myself what next, it turns out I shouldn\u2019t have wondered. Of course the paparazzi would show up. There\u2019s an A-list celebrity on the premises.</p><p>Pressed against the living room wal like a ninja assassin, I peek out the window. Reid continues to work, paying no attention to the photographers, who are simply everywhere. They remind me of a nature special about army ants that I watched in a state of unmoving horror when I was six. Devouring everything in their col ective path, ants swarmed across the landscape in a bold undulating line of black. I couldn\u2019t sleep for a week, until Deb convinced me that African army ants weren\u2019t general y known to raid urban California.</p><p>Exhausted after a night of tossing and turning, I consider whether or not I\u2019m hungry enough to risk appearing in even the outer fringes of those photos. This is ridiculous. Several hours stand between me and my next meal. I shouldn\u2019t feel the need to skulk around inside because of some sil y photographers. Besides, they aren\u2019t interested in me.</p><p>The Plan: go out, grab something to eat, dash back inside.</p> <p>Minutes later, I\u2019m skirting the crowd with a bowl of fruit and an iced tea when one of our corporate volunteers veers directly towards me, ogling the photographers gathered on the neighbor\u2019s roof. Realizing too late that she doesn\u2019t see me, I scoot as close to the patio edge as possible. As she passes, our sleeves grazing, I exhale in relief. And then she whips around and accidental y elbows me right off the patio\u2019s four-foot no-railing-instal ed-yet drop.</p><p>Everything is slow-motion. Eyes widening, mouth rounding into a shocked \u201cO,\u201d she grabs for me as I lurch over the edge, backwards. She catches nothing but air, and neither do I. The bowl flies up, chunks of fruit tossed in every direction. The tea levitates from the cup in an arc above me. And though I know I\u2019ve generated a squeak of surprise, I can\u2019t hear anything\u2014it\u2019s as though the world has been muted.</p><p>If you\u2019ve never fal en and been caught by someone before, I am here to tel you that the landing is not as smooth and effortless as Hol ywood portrays it to be. In reality, parts land where they land, and though hitting a human body is probably less painful than hitting the ground, it\u2019s not like landing on a sofa or a trampoline or anything that gives.</p><p>My limbs stil flailing uselessly, my head slams against a shoulder and I knee myself in the chin as the body I\u2019ve tumbled onto goes down under me. \u201cOof,\u201d he says as he hits the ground, my elbow jabbing into his abdomen as he absorbs my entire body weight.</p><p>I don\u2019t have to see his face\u2014I know the voice\u2014but I can\u2019t help looking. With a yard ful of people looking on, plus several yards ful of photographers, I\u2019m lying halfway on top of Reid, who is sprawled on the ground, holding me tightly, blinking as the blue sky rains fruit on top of us.</p> <p>Camera shutters whir and snap in the distance. And to think, I feared being in the peripheral background of a photo taken of him.</p><p>I scramble to rol off of him, and he releases me slowly enough that I\u2019m pul ing against his hold for a couple of seconds, until he realizes we\u2019re not actual y fal ing anymore.</p><p>My iced tea has splashed a swath across both of our white t-shirts, and pieces of pineapple, cantaloupe and various berries tumble from our clothes and hair as we move to sit upright.</p><p>People who a moment ago were al frozen, agog, are rushing towards us, asking if we\u2019re okay, helping us to our feet.</p><p>Mortified, I stare down at my soggy, fruit laden outfit. My legs are wet, too\u2014rivulets of iced tea dripping from my shorts and snaking down the bare skin. I can\u2019t look directly at Reid. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say in his general direction before mumbling, \u201cI need to go clean up,\u201d in answer to offers of assistance from half a dozen people.</p><p>Grabbing a stack of napkins, I walk inside, fighting the urge to run. The bathroom plumbing has been hooked up, thank God, though mirrors haven\u2019t been hung yet. After mopping the tea from my legs, I press a damp napkin into the shirt where the tea has stained it, though it\u2019s a hopeless gesture. Running my fingers over my head, I pluck out bits of fruit, struggling not to picture what might get into the gossip rags or, oh gol y, on the Internet tomorrow: Unbalanced Fan Tackles Heartthrob, see page 2.</p> <p>Clumsy Girl falls for Reid Alexander\u2014Click Here for Photos!</p><p>Good grief.</p><p>\u201cYou missed some cantaloupe.\u201d Reid stops me from turning, one hand on my shoulder, his fingers in my hair, plucking a thin slice of orange melon from my ponytail. \u201cIt could be worse, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I\u2019m sure he\u2019s correct, but at the moment, I can\u2019t imagine how.</p><p>\u201cSure. Spaghetti and meatbal s would be worse.</p><p>Chocolate milk. Sangria. That stuff stains anything, trust me.\u201d He dislodges a blueberry from my shoulder and it lands in the sink, rol ing, leaving a purple trail. I make a mental note to get some bleach-containing cleaner from Roberta to scour the sink so it won\u2019t discolor the white porcelain.</p><p>Picturing myself covered in spaghetti, I turn and face him without even a hint of a smile. \u201cWe don\u2019t usual y serve pasta. Or sangria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re safe from tomato sauce and red wine stains then.\u201d His expression is serious, but his eyes dance.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, make sure I don\u2019t have any stray fruit in my hair, wil you?\u201d He angles the top of his head towards me. \u201cI ran my hands over it, but I think I missed some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything... oh, wait. There are a few strawberry bits.\u201d I try to remove the squishy stuff without actual y touching his head, which proves impossible.</p><p>Raspberry seeds are tangled along a strand a few inches over, and I give up and comb my fingers across his scalp, checking for concealed fruit.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he says, as though he likes my hands in his hair, which is softer than I would have imagined. The bathroom suddenly feels very smal .</p><p>I drop the berries and seeds next to the one he flicked into the sink. \u201cI don\u2019t see any more...\u201d</p><p>He lifts his head, his eyes stil playful, and I have no idea what he\u2019s doing until he does it. At first I think he\u2019s spied another piece of fruit in my hair, so I don\u2019t react right away when he lifts his hand. The wal is only a foot or so behind me, and it takes little effort for him to push me to it, one hand cradling the back of my head and the other skimming my hip as he leans down. Something in my brain sparks awake and I jerk my face to the side as his mouth grazes the outer edge of my jaw. My hands come up to his chest and shove him. \u201cReid, no.\u201d</p><p>He backs up immediately, hands up and out. Smirking, one corner of his mouth turns up and he shrugs. \u201cSorry.</p><p>Won\u2019t happen again. Just, you know, curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what? \u201d My voice is somehow steady, when I\u2019m anything but. He almost kissed me. He almost kissed me.</p><p>He shrugs a second time, which makes me want to punch him. He\u2019s so whatever. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>Seriously. Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no responsibility to accept, because everything just happens around him, as though he\u2019s at the eye of a storm he has nothing to do with causing or sustaining. I shove past him, my heart hammering. He barely touched me, and he stopped the second I protested. He said it wouldn\u2019t happen again. Twice, in fact.</p><p>People glance up as I pass, ask if I\u2019m okay, and I fix a fake smile on my face, tel them I\u2019m fine, even while I feel like I might hyperventilate. Why? Because he\u2019s a rich celebrity? Hardly. Because he\u2019s beautiful? Because of his casual arrogance\u2014that intangible thing he exudes that some women find so irresistible? No, and no.</p><p>Okay. Then why?</p><p>Because everything I wanted to feel when Nick kissed me last Friday, I felt in the near-miss that just occurred.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>REID</p><p>Shit. Wel , that was stupid.</p><p>On the other hand, what the hel ? I haven\u2019t been shoved away that decidedly in a while. If ever. I\u2019m getting, like, Stockholm syndrome or something, and Dorcas is my jailer. That\u2019s why I tried to kiss her, obviously. I need out of this situation as soon as possible.</p><p>Maybe I should have let her hit the ground, but when I saw that woman knock her off the patio, I just reacted. It wasn\u2019t the most graceful fal or the most adept catch in the history of accidental dismounts. The consequences: my shoulder is bruised and one elbow is scraped raw, my abdominal muscles narrowly managed to withstand rupture, and I discovered\u2014inadvertently, I swear\u2014that Dorcas Cantrel is concealing some noteworthy curves under her col ection of enormous, altruistic t-shirts.</p><p>Once I\u2019m in the car, I cal George\u2014again. \u201cReid?\u201d He\u2019s surprised to hear from me within hours of the previous cal .</p><p>\u201cYeah, just an FYI on some photos that are probably being uploaded as we speak\u2014a girl at the house sorta fel off the patio, and I sorta caught her.\u201d</p><p>off the patio, and I sorta caught her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFell off the patio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone ran into her. Knocked her right off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, some inattentive middle-aged woman.\u201d</p><p>He ignores my quip. \u201cSo this girl you sorta caught\u2014</p><p>she\u2019s not underage, married, an il egal alien, a meth dealer...?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cEighteen, single, and straight as the road to hel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm-hmm. Anything else I should know?\u201d He hangs the question out there as he always does, no leading statements, no fishing for details. One of the many things I love about George. I trust him more than pretty much anyone and he knows it. He knows, too, that I\u2019l be up front with him, even if I seldom fol ow his good advice.</p><p>\u201cNothing anyone would be privy to. She\u2019s not interested in me, man.\u201d</p><p>Outside the car window, East LA flies by, everything worn out, decrepit\u2014the buildings, the sidewalks, even some of the light poles leaning\u2014weary of the dismal setting. A guy with massive tattooed biceps steers his wheelchair around a fire hydrant that might or might not work if needed to put out a fire. Inches from the curb, he whips around the hydrant like it\u2019s part of some serpentine course for wheelchair racing. If he misses a hairpin turn, he\u2019l be in the street and run over. Extreme sports, disability-style.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m flattered by George\u2019s disbelief. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s a genuine do-gooder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I heard we had one of those in LA.\u201d George is a funny guy. \u201cI guess it would be too much to ask that you leave her as you found her.\u201d</p><p>Minutes ago I was impatient to be finished with this Habitat gig\u2014and Dori. Tel ing myself that this too shal pass. George\u2019s al usion to the end of my association with Dorcas Cantrel , or rather my reaction to his al usion, tel s me I wasn\u2019t ful y connecting those two things. I\u2019m surprised to find that I\u2019m not ready for this to be over.</p><p>George sighs. \u201cOh wel , the suggestion was worth a shot.\u201d</p><p>I tel him what I always tel him\u2014and it\u2019s the truth, for what it\u2019s worth. \u201cThanks for the advice, man. I\u2019l consider it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>Dori</p><p>I\u2019m. Such. A.

In the dream, I didn\u2019t turn my head away. His mouth landed on mine rather than grazing my jaw. My hands pul ed him closer rather than pushing him away. And instead of backing away with a mocking grin, he moved closer, pressing me to the wal in a kiss that went on and on until I woke with a start, breathless.</p><p>Esther raised her head from the end of my bed as I sat up, her ears lifting in a canine question and her head angling when I pounded the bed with one fist and whispered, \u201cSon. Of. A. Biscuit.\u201d I touched my lips, half expecting them to be swol en because they were tingling, and then threw the covers off and stomped to the kitchen to make a cup of chamomile tea. Esther jumped down and fol owed out of either curiosity or solidarity.</p><p>I cal ed Roberta early this morning and told her they needed me at VBS and I couldn\u2019t report for Habitat duty the rest of the week. It wasn\u2019t exactly a lie. It wasn\u2019t exactly the truth, either, so I find myself clinging to the uncomfortable gray zone in the center. She was great\u2014al no problem and of course those kids miss you, and I felt ashamed until I thought about Reid and that almost-kiss. I need a break from this temptation, because that\u2019s al it is for me.</p><p>Temptation. For him, it\u2019s nothing more than gaining the upper hand, and I\u2019m not about to let him do it.</p> <p>I\u2019m supervising pool time and thinking about what we have left to do at the Diego house when I catch myself daydreaming about him again, as though al thought patterns eventual y lead to Reid. The earthy smel of him in that enclosed space. The contradiction of him shoving me to the wal with one firm hand while cradling the back of my head with the other. The deep blue of his eyes right before he dipped his head closer. Right before I pushed him away.</p><p>With effort, I force my thoughts to the kids and their impending performance, Deb and the chal enges of residency, my col ege checklist, Nick. Dad\u2019s waterproof watch on my wrist wil beep when it\u2019s time to go inside. If I could get it to zap me when my thoughts wander to Reid, I\u2019d be golden.</p><p>Forcing him from my mind isn\u2019t working so wel . I think I need an exorcism.</p><p>When I\u2019m finished for the day, I scrol through my texts. A couple are from Aimee and Kayla, friends from school I\u2019ve only seen twice since graduation. The two of them have been BFFs since junior high. They al owed me within the circle of their friendship during the first month of tenth grade. I\u2019ve never been as close to either of them as they are to each other, but that\u2019s okay. Neither of them have a sister like Deb.</p><p>Aimee: so when were you gonna tel us about REID</p> <p>ALEXANDER???</p><p>Kayla: Srsly, there are pics al over the internet of you two at that habitat place and you are ful frontal ON TOP OF HIM</p><p>I cal Aimee, knowing there\u2019s a ninety-nine percent chance she\u2019s with Kayla after their coordinated texts. At school, everyone cal ed them the twins because they did everything together. They took the same classes, joined the same groups, dated boys who were friends\u2014or brothers. In a few weeks, they\u2019re starting at UCLA.</p><p>Rooming together, of course.</p><p>\u201cDori!\u201d Kayla answers Aimee\u2019s phone. \u201cAre you friends with Reid Alexander? Are you more than friends?</p><p>Ohmigod, the parties we could get into... you will take me and Aimee, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t actual y friends, and we\u2019re certainly not more than friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that picture! You\u2019re stretched across him like he\u2019s wearing you!\u201d</p><p>Ugh, I can\u2019t believe she just said that. Can the photos be that bad?</p><p>The phone jostles and Aimee\u2019s hyper no-punctuation voice takes over. \u201cDori I know you don\u2019t real y trust guys and Reid Alexander is the last guy on the planet to trust but honestly this is not a trust or not trust sort of moment this is a once in a lifetime sort of moment!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t trust guys? What?</p><p>I sigh, knowing they would strangle me with their bare, perfectly manicured hands if they knew what happened in private a few minutes after I landed on top of Reid yesterday. \u201cYou guys know how the press manipulates things to look a certain way...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDori need I repeat myself you were on top of him!</p><p>Unless you are suggesting superb photoshopping that was not press manipulation.\u201d</p> <p>Wow. This is not good. \u201cI fel . He caught me. That\u2019s al that happened.\u201d</p><p>She sighs, as though I\u2019ve just confirmed a passionate affair. \u201cThat\u2019s what the stories are saying\u2014that you tripped off the edge of the patio\u2014freaking brilliant by the way! And then he caught you. So romantic...\u201d</p><p>My head stil feels bruised, my knee is abraded, and I\u2019m pretty sure I got felt up when we were going down, even if Reid wasn\u2019t aware of doing it... not exactly my idea of romantic.</p><p>\u201cDori.\u201d Kayla has taken the phone back. \u201cYou honestly aren\u2019t friends with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m real y not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , crap.\u201d I hear Aimee saying something in the background, and then Kayla\u2019s voice returns. \u201cCould you make friends with him?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help laughing. Aimee and I grew up with Hol ywood down the street, and Kayla moved here when she was a kid. We should al be a little less easily starstruck. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to be there again until next week, and I leave for Ecuador the week after that. Besides, he\u2019s a bigheaded celebrity. He\u2019s not interested in ordinary girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d Her tone is sul en. \u201cI guess we\u2019l just have to look forward to regular col ege boys, then.\u201d</p><p>This is particularly funny, considering the fact that I\u2019ve listened to the two of them wax poetic about col ege guys for the past three years solid.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>REID</p><p>The paparazzi swarm has bal ooned. George is fielding hourly cal s from journalists proposing in-depth, exclusive, one-on-one reporting of my rehabilitation. We both know they\u2019re far more interested in digging up juicy info about my possible hookup with a member of the peasantry.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t shocked when Dori didn\u2019t show up yesterday, between our little interface in the bathroom and the fact that my fansites were going crazy over photos of the two of us looking like we\u2019re making out in the back yard. I\u2019m accustomed to groundless rumors and misinterpreted photos. You have to laugh that shit off or you could end up in handcuffs after decking some asshole photographer or stalker weirdo... or turn into a recluse, hiding from public scrutiny.</p><p>Stil , I was sure Dori would bounce in today, sporting a tshirt proclaiming her loathing of some vice I\u2019ve reveled in at one time or another, if not on a regular basis. But Roberta just told me she won\u2019t be back until next week.</p><p>\u201cWas she that shaken up by al the photos online...?\u201d I gesture vaguely to the surrounding yards ful of photographers after grabbing a bottle of water from the cooler. What I don\u2019t say: Or was it the attempted kiss that freaked her the hell out?</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Roberta frowns, uncertain. \u201cShe\u2019s working with her church\u2019s VBS program, and they needed her this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVBS?\u201d</p><p>Roberta looks at me like I\u2019m an alien because I don\u2019t recognize the acronym. \u201cVacation Bible School?\u201d she prompts.</p><p>No help. Those three words don\u2019t go together in any way in my experience. \u201cSo what\u2019s she doing there that\u2019s so important?\u201d I twist the cap off the bottle and drink as we move towards the line for lunch.</p><p>\u201cActual y, she co-wrote the musical portion of the parent night program with the music director, and she\u2019s in charge of the kindergarten performance.\u201d Roberta\u2019s obviously proud of this accomplishment, but it\u2019s out of my sphere.</p><p>Church musical programs are the lowest form of community theater imaginable. Directing a religious musical program for five-year-olds? Kil me first.</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s awesome.\u201d (Seriously. Kil me first.)</p><p>\u201cHi, Reid.\u201d</p><p>Ah, Gabriel e. Just the distraction I need. \u201cSitting with me today?\u201d I say, smiling down at her. She must have forgiven me for that comment about wanting nothing to do with her.</p><p>Gabriel e tosses a look of defiance at Roberta before smiling and poking me in the chest. \u201cDuh, that\u2019s why I came over here.\u201d</p><p>Roberta purses her lips, wracking her brain to come up with a reason why the two of us can\u2019t fraternize at lunch.</p><p>When she comes up blank, I pretend not to notice.</p><p>Dori</p><p>Three days with no Reid, and I am so not conquering that temptation. I\u2019ve alternated between wondering if he caused any trouble in my absence and wondering if he was disappointed that I wasn\u2019t there\u2014if he noticed at al .</p><p>Tonight, in the privacy of my room, and in opposition to any good judgment I\u2019ve ever thought I had, I google Reid Alexander. First up: the sil y photos of the two of us, with me sprawled atop him like a linebacker sacking a quarterback.</p><p>There\u2019s rampant speculation online about who I am, and whether or not I\u2019m something more than just an uncoordinated girl from his volunteer site (I grit my teeth</p><p>\u2014 volunteer, my eye). His fans are also debating what we\u2019re doing in the photo, but we had more than enough eyewitnesses, so real y, the worst anyone could say is that I stupidly fel on him. Or, as Kayla and Aimee think, bril iantly fel on him.</p><p>The majority view is that I\u2019m a plain, unattractive nobody</p><p>\u2014stated more harshly in most cases. I shrug it off because on one hand I am a plain, unattractive nobody, and on the other hand, none of these people know me personal y. They al base their verdicts on the same thing: what I look like in relation to him. Their assessments are superficial and excessive. Pretty similar to their appraisals of him, actual y</p><p>\u2014based on little more than circumstantial evidence. (In his case, circumstantial y appealing.) I ignore further editorials and fan comments and go straight for the images link, because image is what Reid Alexander is al about. His beautiful face. His lean, muscular body. The blatant sex appeal that wel s up from that inner confidence and projects itself to the camera. I click on a cache of photos from a year-old GQ spread. He graces the cover shot and several outtakes in a dark pinstripe suit which was, I\u2019m sure, precisely tailored for him and insanely expensive. He wears nothing but jeans in several shots, low enough to show off his chiseled abs. His chest and arms are defined and flawless without aid of computer graphics, as I know from multiple close-range shirtless encounters.</p><p>I click the arrow and the next photo appears\u2014a mesmerizing close-up. My stomach drops and I exhale a dazed, \u201cOh.\u201d Wearing a black tank, he grasps a tree branch angled just overhead. In the other shots, his expression is expertly arrogant\u2014identical to his standard, now familiar veneer. But this one is the opposite. Open. Affectionate.</p><p>Sensitive.</p><p>I snap my laptop closed.</p><p>Googling him was a very bad idea.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>REID</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to start filming in less than two months. Since I locked up the lead role by convincing the production team and the director that I could beef up and do the stunts, I can\u2019t just be in decent shape. I have to be in prime form.

We meet for dinner and end up at the bar in his hotel after.</p><p>\u201cSeen anyone since May?\u201d he asks once the waitress, who\u2019s trying her damnedest to act like she doesn\u2019t know who the two of us are, leaves our drinks.</p><p>\u201cPartied with Quinton once, and ran into Jenna at an awards show last month. She\u2019s looking pretty hot.\u201d Tadd pauses, his dirty martini halfway to his lips. \u201cDude, Jenna\u2019s like sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, what the hel is it with everyone and the underage girl alert? I\u2019m aware, okay?\u201d I sigh, running a hand through my hair and reining in my temper. In light of the whole Gabriel e-Dori issue, I may be overreacting a bit.</p> <p>\u201cChil , dude\u2014I\u2019m not accusing you of anything.\u201d Tadd leans up, elbows on the table. \u201cI know you\u2019re smarter than that.\u201d He smirks. \u201cAs much of an asstard as you are in other matters.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and shake my head. \u201cEmma, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was referring to the fact that you wrecked your car and almost kil ed yourself... but yeah, man, you screwed up your love life, too.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re silent for a minute, and I know he\u2019s waiting for me to ask what he knows I\u2019m going to ask. \u201cHave you seen her?\u201d</p><p>He leans back, gives me a once-over like he\u2019s gauging how much I can take. \u201cWe got together a couple of weeks ago in New York. She\u2019s starting NYU in a few weeks, but she moved there last month. She and Graham, uh, didn\u2019t want to be apart al summer.\u201d</p> <p>I imagine the two of them together, waiting to feel wounded, but it\u2019s not real y there. \u201cSo that whole thing is working out, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, yeah.\u201d Tadd takes a sip of the martini, checking my reaction through the pale fringe of a hair hanging perpetual y over his right eye. \u201cI met up with both of them, actual y. They seem comfortable\u2014like, they fit, you know? I can shut up now.\u201d</p><p>I shrug and shake my head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s happy.\u201d Surprisingly, I realize I mean it. \u201cSo what about you, lover boy? Getting any from a regular source, or stil breaking hearts and bal s al over the country?\u201d</p><p>Tadd leans up again, his face earnest. \u201cDude, I met someone a month ago, and I\u2019m so in love it\u2019s not even funny. I\u2019m like head over heels, first time ever. It\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAl right, Thaddeus.\u201d I put up my fist and he bumps it with his, beaming. \u201cSo who is he?\u201d I lean up. \u201cAre you about to out somebody? Cause if so, you know you can trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, he\u2019s an architect. So damned smart it blows my mind. Creative, gorgeous, funny, sexy...\u201d He\u2019s lost in his own thoughts for a couple of seconds.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay, stop or I\u2019m gonna have to consider going gay, man,\u201d I say, and he laughs.</p><p>\u201cDude\u2014it\u2019s al we can do to keep our hands off of each other in public. It\u2019s always felt a little daring\u2014al the covert stuff.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt like this before. I want to hold his hand when we\u2019re walking, or brush the hair out of his eyes when he\u2019s got coffee in one hand and the dog\u2019s leash in the other.\u201d His mouth quirks up on one side again as he stares into his drink. \u201cIt\u2019s different when you\u2019re in love.\u201d</p><p>I think of al of the things I take for granted. I could grab a stranger, kiss her in public, and the worst anyone wil think or say is get a room. Tadd\u2019s in love, but they can\u2019t hold hands in most public places without worrying what someone might do or say.</p><p>\u201cSucks to be you, man,\u201d I say, and he makes like he\u2019s gonna punch me in the arm. I flinch and spil part of my drink on the table. \u201cDude!\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both laughing when he says, \u201cSo what about you?</p><p>We\u2019re both laughing when he says, \u201cSo what about you?</p><p>Anybody new?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t even want to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d Both eyebrows angle up as he leans closer. \u201cOh, yes I do. I so do. Lay it on me, man. Is it that girl from the Habitat place?\u201d</p><p>Damned paparazzi. \u201cThat was just a clumsy girl fal ing off of a patio.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere I remember the fruit fal ing from the sky, so surreal. The feel of her in my arms as I caught her. Her face flaming as she struggled to move off of me. I almost made a smartass comment about her lack of grace, but she was already so humiliated that I couldn\u2019t do it. I fol owed her inside instead.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I expected. I sure didn\u2019t expect to try to kiss her\u2014that was completely spontaneous. When she ran her fingers across my scalp to search for stray bits of fruit, I had a sharp, three-second vision of her lying under me in my bed, her hands thrusting into my hair as I lean down to kiss her...</p><p>\u201cEarth to Reid.\u201d Tadd\u2019s voice is pure cynicism. I blink and look up and he shakes his head slowly. \u201cOh, yeah.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing going on there. Not at al .\u201d Busted. \u201cYeah, wel , she\u2019s not the slightest bit into me. I tried to kiss her and she objected in a resounding no-means-no sort of way. And then disappeared for the rest of the week.\u201d</p><p>Tadd smiles and holds his drink aloft towards me.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to chal enges, dude.\u201d</p><p>My friend may have a point. Maybe Dori\u2019s just playing hard-to-get better than any girl I\u2019ve ever met, and I\u2019ve just gotten lazy.</p><p>Dori, one. Reid, zero.</p><p>But not for long.</p><p>Dori</p><p>Nick and I were planning to hang out tonight, but he\u2019d forgotten his promise to watch his foster brothers while his parents take his foster sister to San Diego for a supervised visit with her birth mother. I assured him several times that I understood completely and was fine with the late cancel ation.</p><p>Mom and Dad are out with friends. \u201cWel , Esther, it\u2019s just you and me tonight,\u201d I tel her, scratching gently behind her floppy spaniel ears, which are the only spaniel component on her. The rest of her is a curious mix of\u2014as far as we can tel \u2014golden retriever, shepherd, and possibly dachshund.</p><p>She\u2019s a true mutt. \u201cLet\u2019s make sandwiches.\u201d I pul ingredients out of the fridge and pantry, and rol slices of deli turkey for her. Her tail tick-tocks gently side to side as I set the plate in front of her. \u201cNeed a pickle with that? No?\u201d I ask as she gingerly lifts each rol and gobbles it down.</p><p>She lies next to me on the sofa (an Esther no-no she gets away with when we\u2019re alone) while I eat my pita sandwich and scrol through network TV options. Nothing looks interesting, so I browse the pay-per-view selections.</p><p>I\u2019m in the mood for something cute. No slashers, no thril ers, no buddy flicks. No historical drama or redemption-through-pain-and-or-suffering films. Especial y nothing that says profoundly moving or grab a hankie! in the description.</p><p>\u201cHere we go, Esther: \u2018Trey begins his senior year at a new school with girls swooning for him, and jocks as friends. Things get complicated when he fal s for quiet, bookish Amanda, who becomes a social pariah after she rats out the footbal players\u2019 cheating ring, half the first string fails English, and the team loses the big championship game.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Esther turns on her side and lays her head on my leg. \u201cI think we have a winner.\u201d I click buy, press the play button and grab a handful of popcorn, thinking that I should be sad that Nick had to bail on me. That I didn\u2019t have time to make plans with anyone else. That I\u2019m spending my Saturday night alone. But I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m more than fine.</p><p>The movie is everything I hoped for. Until about ten minutes in... when one of the random jocks turns out to be Reid. I gasp, and Esther raises her head sharply and looks at me, and then swivels around, looking for the unknown menace.</p><p>I should have looked up his filmography on IMDb last night. Al I real y know of him are his last two, more major roles. This movie is almost three years old.</p><p>His role is minor, and he spends most of his onscreen time in the background, but once I recognize him, I\u2019m either watching him or waiting for him to show up again. The movie is an hour and fifty-seven minutes long, but it takes me nearly twice that to get al the way through it because I\u2019m rewinding and replaying every moment he\u2019s onscreen.</p><p>In one party scene, several couples are in various states of making out. I spot Reid on the left side of the screen, sitting in a chair, kissing one of the cheerleader characters, who\u2019s straddling him. Their mouths are fused, but I watch his hands\u2014gripping her arms, sliding down to the smal of her back, holding her like he held me when I fel on him. I rewind the scene and watch it a third time.</p><p>\u201cOh, fudge,\u201d I whisper, and Esther looks at me and sighs.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>REID</p><p>Olaf is a beast.</p><p>I don\u2019t think my trainer expected me to stil be in decent shape, though I told him I\u2019d been working construction for Habitat. Not a fan of bodybuilding through natural means, he employs weights, pul eys, rubber bands and medicine bal s to shape his clients. As far as Olaf is concerned, exercise is not painting, digging fence posts or swinging a sledgehammer to break up a 200 pound boulder. Exercise is done indoors, while a guy who could break you in two over his rock-hard quadriceps provides motivation like,</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up? A girl?\u201d I think I pissed him off, flaunting my organical y maintained muscle tone. I should have feigned weakness.</p><p>Once he saw that I was primed for what he had planned, he stepped up the pain factor by several notches in what I can only assume was an attempt to kil me, so he could resuscitate me and kil me again.</p><p>I went out with John last night\u2014 not the best idea after a session with Olaf\u2014and crashed on his sofa around two a.m. I hear him snoring from the bedroom, the sound on exhale a cross between the horn on a semi and a walrus\u2019s mating cal . I have no idea what time it is, but judging by the light, it\u2019s not quite noon. Every muscle in my body is aching, my head is throbbing, and I have no one to blame but myself. And possibly John, because I can.</p><p>I shuffle into his kitchen to make coffee... but there isn\u2019t any. Awesome. There\u2019s also nothing in the fridge but beer, a mostly empty tub of margarine, and questionable takeout boxes of sweet and sour chicken and beef with cashews.</p><p>No milk. No juice. The pantry boasts a box of stale cereal and an equal y stale bag of corn chips. The kitchen in this place is state-of-the-art, and this is al the food it has to offer? Sad.</p><p>Starving, I have no choice but to shower and go out in search of food. John and I are close enough to the same size that I can borrow a t-shirt and shorts, though ten to one there\u2019s something of mine in his closet that I can just reclaim.</p><p>There\u2019s a bagel place a few doors down from John\u2019s building. I want bagels and cream cheese, but Olaf is determined to pump up the muscle I\u2019ve got and reduce me to near-zero percent body fat. A compromise is in order\u2014</p><p>bagels and lox. Lox has protein, right?</p><p>Going out without a bodyguard or a car is always tricky.</p><p>Fans in LA or NYC are much less likely to mob celebrities, but it\u2019s far from unheard of, and the paparazzi are always on the lookout.

The coffee isn\u2019t very good\u2014but Mrs. K gets it in bulk from a discount warehouse, along with powdered creamer, one-ply napkins and flimsy paper plates. High expectations would be unrealistic.</p><p>\u201cNo chocolate with chocolate sprinkles?\u201d Mr. Goody, the most ancient parishioner in the church, frowns at me over the bar where I stand, completely zoned out. His gaze swings over the several open boxes of various donuts.</p> <p>\u201cUm, no\u2014what\u2019s out is what we\u2019ve got. There are a couple of chocolate with nuts\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuts!

In first grade, I was a huge Hel o Kitty fan. One day Annabel e Hayes came to school with a tiny package of HK colored pencils.</p> <p>During recess, I swiped it from her desk.

Turned out I was a six-year-old with an easily assessed guilt complex.</p><p>Dad\u2019s sermon this morning\u2014 temptation. When his eyes meet mine, I imagine he knows every errant thought in my head concerning Reid. There\u2019s no way Dad could know, but there he stands, detailing how to identify temptation and how to resist it. Meaning to pay strict attention and take notes, I click my pen and open the smal notebook I keep in my bag.</p><p>And then I can\u2019t stop thinking about Reid\u2019s hands in my hair and splayed at my waist, propel ing me to the wal , his lips brushing over my cheek as I turned my face away.</p><p>There is no logical reason for my inability to stop thinking about that almost-kiss. No reason at al . Especially in the middle of church.</p><p>The page in my notebook is stil blank at the end of the sermon.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>REID</p> <p>Dori seemed surprised but appreciative the day I brought her a soy latte (after having heard her tel someone on the phone the previous afternoon that she was craving one), so I add it to my morning coffee run. Just to throw her off balance, I bring Gabriel e the same thing.</p><p>When I get there, the two of them are in Gabriel e\u2019s future bedroom, which we\u2019ve painted a stomach-turning shade of pink. Ceiling fan parts are spread in an organized manner on the floor\u2014nuts, bolts and fan blades in neat piles. Dori reads over the instructions while Gabriel e stands with her arms crossed, looking annoyed\u2014until she sees me. \u201cReid!\u201d she beams.</p><p>For a split second, I wish Dori was that enthusiastic about my presence... but no, her unwavering pretense of indifference is a major aspect of the chal enge of her. She doesn\u2019t look up, but she\u2019s so aware of me\u2014hands gripping the instruction packet tightly enough to crumple the edges, ears almost matching the wal s.</p><p>Taking my caramel macchiato from the tray, I choke back a laugh at Dori\u2019s apprehensive expression and focus on Gabriel e, who makes a face when I mention the soy. \u201cIs there syrup in it?\u201d she asks hopeful y.</p><p>\u201cIn the latte? Uh, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Roberta has some sugar packets,\u201d Dori interjects. Her eyes flick to mine and skitter away. Gabriel e gives me an enthusiastic hug (Dori purses her lips but makes no comment) and goes in search of sugar.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Dori\u2014the first hit is always free.\u201d She reluctantly accepts the cup I hand her and says,</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d like it takes a herculean effort to speak the word to me.</p><p>She studies the instructions and sips the latte while I regard her silently. She\u2019s sporting the faded red M.A.D.D.</p><p>shirt again, but today her hair band matches her shirt, and she\u2019s wearing thin silver hoop earrings. And is that lip gloss on her mouth? Interesting and atypical Dori behavior.</p><p>On the day I started work here, I stupidly assumed that getting into Dori\u2019s pants would be effortless, and in the same thought I concluded that I couldn\u2019t be bothered to hook up with her. Had she sensed that vain mental verdict and decided to make me pay for it?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first... hit... for me, you know.\u201d She\u2019s obviously hesitant to use addict jargon, even in jest.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I guess you\u2019l owe me, then.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond, just sets her cup on a windowsil and takes one last glance at the instructions. Armed with a screwdriver, she picks up the bulky mechanical component and climbs the ladder directly beneath the hole cut into the center of the ceiling. I gather from watching her that she has to get the wiring hooked up before she can attach the motor to the electrical box in the ceiling. She balances the bulky thing in her right hand while she twists the wires together with her left, pul ing safety caps out of her pocket and affixing them to the connected wires.</p><p>Halfway through, she fumbles the motor, almost dropping it and exclaiming, \u201cPopsicles!\u201d</p><p>I climb up behind her and take the weight of the motor in my hand, but there is no goddamned way I can keep from laughing. What does popsicles even correspond to? I\u2019ve heard her say fudge\u2014a way more obvious substitute. I\u2019m beginning to think she just tosses out whatever food item she thinks of first.</p><p>Without a word, she hooks up the wiring.</p><p>If I wasn\u2019t aware of her proximity before, I am now. The light press of her body against mine and the unanticipated sweet scent of her make me abruptly, ful y conscious of it.</p><p>Standing on the rung below her places my mouth level with her ear. \u201cYou smel good. What are you wearing?\u201d Her breathing goes shal ow, from either threat or desire.</p><p>\u201cDeodorant.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly, inhaling careful y. \u201cMmm, no, something more than that, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know. Lotion? Some store brand, I think.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know? My mother and every girl I\u2019ve ever dated, Emma included, coordinated lotions, powders, and colognes. If asked, any of them could have said what scent they were wearing without thinking.</p><p>\u201cNo... it\u2019s more like... cake, or something else...</p><p>edible.\u201d I\u2019m staring at the fine hairs on the nape of her neck, her smal left earlobe, the silver hoop threaded through it, her dark lashes in profile. She\u2019s shut her eyes, as though she\u2019s lightheaded.</p><p>\u201cUm... okay...\u201d She opens her eyes, turns slightly towards me. \u201cReid, I... I want to get down now.\u201d I hop from the rung to the floor, reach up and swing her lightly to the ground, my hands lingering at her waist. She grips my upper arms, not letting go once her feet are on the ground. We look as though we were dancing and someone hit the pause button. Common sense tel s me not to try to kiss her again. She\u2019s not ready yet. So we stand there, staring at each other, silent and unmoving.</p><p>She\u2019s conceding ground already; it\u2019s in her eyes. I suppress a smile at the conflict I sense in her, because she\u2019s scrutinizing every nuance of emotion on my face, looking for anything that might betray my intentions.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Gabriel e\u2019s voice startles both of us\u2014perfect timing.</p><p>I drop my hands as she jumps away. Turning to snatch my cup from where I set it on the stack of fan blades, I say,</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d giving Dori a surreptitious wink and bumping fists with a confused Gabriel e on the way out the door.</p><p>Dori</p><p>If I can just get through one more week, I\u2019l never have to see him again.</p><p>The fan motor was heavy and unwieldy, and I should have waited for Gabriel e\u2019s help to hook it up. But I could feel his eyes on me from the moment he walked into the room, and I couldn\u2019t pretend to look at those instructions another minute.</p><p>Then my heart was slamming from nearly dropping the stupid motor, and in the next moment he was behind me, laughing at me for my choice of swearword-that-isn\u2019t while taking the motor and holding it aloft like it weighed nothing. I would have chastised him for breaking the one-person-on-the-ladder rule, but I couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>His chest pressed against my back while his arm reached around, his bicep hard against my ribcage, just grazing my breast. I stretched up, my arms burning, and worked to get the wiring hooked up as quickly as possible.</p><p>Once the part was snug against the ceiling, I thought he\u2019d step back down. Instead, he remained where he was, our bodies connected, however slightly, in several key spots.</p><p>Then he told me I smel ed good.</p><p>Trapped on that ladder, al I could do was close my eyes and concentrate. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Until his hands were at my waist, lifting me down like I weigh nothing.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been so pleased to see Gabriel e.</p><p>Once Reid disappears, I tel her to take the fan boxes to her brothers\u2019 and parents\u2019 rooms and get them unpacked so we can instal them before lunch. That should give me enough time to attach the fan blades... and recover from what he just did to me.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>REID</p><p>Javier, one of the new volunteers, is a member of a frat group that\u2019l be here for the week\u2014Pi Kappa something. I think he\u2019s decided we\u2019re BFFs for the duration. We\u2019re the same age, but for the most part, I feel like I\u2019m talking to a kid.</p><p>During lunch break, I entertain him with celebrity anecdotes\u2014the websites, the starlets, the parties, the fan mail\u2014while he\u2019s rubbernecking at al the photographers hovering in neighboring yards. \u201cSo there might be pictures of me on celebrity gossip sites? Like, tomorrow?\u201d I can\u2019t help laughing\u2014celebrities go miles way out of their way to dodge being harassed by the paparazzi, but Javier is ecstatic over the prospect. \u201cThey\u2019l probably be up by this afternoon, if not in half an hour,\u201d I tel him.</p><p>He pul s his phone from his pocket, starts typing a text.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Awesome.\u201d Ten to one he\u2019s texting a friend to check websites to see if he\u2019s made it into any shots yet.</p><p>Ultimate photobombing. \u201cSo, like, what do you do with al those pictures girls send you? Do you ever, you know, cal up one of the hot ones and hook up?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo way. The more, er, stimulating photos don\u2019t make it to me\u2014my mail and email is prescreened. I get the ful y-clothed shots. And the you\u2019re a god and I think you should have won an Oscar mail, not the You suck and I wish you\u2019d curl up and die shit. My manager shreds or deletes anything inappropriate.\u201d We each take a paper plate and head for the food. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEven hot naked girls? Why? \u201d Javier is aghast.</p><p>\u201cBecause photos of naked fifteen-year-olds are not something you want to keep, even if they say they\u2019re eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess not.\u201d He grimaces, but doesn\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>\u201cHi, Reid.\u201d Speak of the underage devil.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Gabriel e. This is Javier.\u201d</p><p>Javier\u2019s eyes widen slightly, taking her in. She smiles and chirps, \u201cHi.\u201d While he checks her out, she turns back to me. \u201cSo, Dori\u2019s boyfriend showed up again. God, he\u2019s so boring.\u201d</p><p>Boyfriend? \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She blinks innocently. \u201cHer boyfriend, Nick\u2014he was here like a week or so ago? I\u2019m going to kil myself if I have to work with the two of them all freaking afternoon.\u201d She glances towards the back door. \u201cGod, there they are.\u201d I\u2019m staring when Dori locks eyes with me. Nick is the guy Dori sat next to at lunch during the first week. The one with the poor conversation skil s. She breaks eye contact with me and turns to direct him to the line, her hand on his arm as he drones on about something. This guy is her boyfriend? You\u2019ve got to be shitting me. He looks like he just stepped out of a nerd sitcom, where he plays the character who constantly manages to destroy his chances to hook up with anyone.</p><p>And then I wonder if nerds are what floats Dori\u2019s boat, because I\u2019ve heard that some girls are like that.</p> <p>Javier invites another frat guy to join us. We al sit on the edge of the patio to eat, and Gabriel e is flushed and talkative, relishing the male-to-female ratio. Javier and his friend Kyle are more than happy to accommodate her, and while I appear to do the same, I\u2019m watching Dori and Nick.</p><p>Her smiles seem real and her body language is relaxed; when their knees brush or he leans forward to say something, she doesn\u2019t pul back or shy away. He\u2019s not hot, but not repulsive. But there\u2019s no observable chemistry between them, not even guarded touches... and she\u2019s sneaking looks in my direction every few minutes while I appear to be engrossed in whatever Gabriel e is babbling about.</p><p>Lunch is almost over when Dori glances over once more, and this time I stare back. Her eyes widen almost imperceptibly, and while she returns my gaze, I count five long seconds. As a slow smile steals across my face, she snaps her attention back to her boyfriend\u2014if that\u2019s what he is\u2014and doesn\u2019t look my way again.</p><p>Dori</p><p>Minutes after Reid left the room this morning, Nick showed up, determined to make up for canceling our plans Saturday and spoiling my night. When I assured him again that he did no such thing, he ducked his head shyly and admitted that he just wanted an excuse to see me, and if a little manual labor was al it took, he was up for it. He\u2019s so sincere and sweet that I wish for the hundredth time that I felt more for him than an intense admiration of his character and a mild attraction to his person.</p><p>Gabriel e was her usual crabby self al morning, but with Nick helping out I found her tormented sighs humorous. I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing out loud during the first interaction between the two of them.</p> <p>While I attached outlet covers, Nick was on the ladder, connecting the heating and A/C vent. \u201cHey, Gabby\u2014can you hand me that set of driver bits please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe. Name. Is. Gabrielle.\u201d She glared at him, her hands clenched into fists at her sides.</p><p>Nick blinked at her vehement tone, then smiled. \u201cOh, sorry. Gabrielle, please hand me that set of driver bits?\u201d She spun around, grabbing the package from the floor and slapping it into his open hand. \u201cGod,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gabriel e.\u201d He smiled again, which seemed to infuriate her further.</p><p>Nick\u2019s presence helps keep me focused on work, but doesn\u2019t inhibit the scenes from Reid\u2019s movie that have been on a constant loop in my head since yesterday been on a constant loop in my head since yesterday afternoon. I didn\u2019t know anything about School Pride before we went, while Aimee and Kayla had parts of it memorized.</p><p>The premise was a bit sil y\u2014a present day adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, set in a high school\u2014but casting Reid as an arrogant Wil Darcy was genius. His natural self-assurance was easy to see in the heated scenes between Reid and his costar, Emma Pierce. And when he kissed her, I swear I felt it. Ugh.</p><p>When we went outside for lunch, my attention was drawn to him repeatedly, sitting with Gabriel e and two of our fraternity volunteers from UCLA.</p><p>Nick was talking about a mission trip he did earlier this summer to Honduras. \u201c...because fifty percent of the population is under the poverty line\u2014can you imagine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, wow, that\u2019s appal ing.\u201d My eyes drifted to the other side of the patio. The first half dozen times I looked, Reid didn\u2019t notice. That last time, though, his dark blue eyes locked with mine. My pulse gal oped. And then his mouth kicked up on one side and I had no choice but to rip my gaze from his.</p><p>I stared into Nick\u2019s eyes, thankful for his comforting voice, his gentle smile. And I fought the magnetic pul of the boy sitting across the yard who is everything I do not need and should not want.</p><p>I\u2019m up late, compiling a list of stuff to pack for my mission trip when Deb cal s. As soon as I say hel o, she says, \u201cDori, he kissed me,\u201d sounding like the giddy girl she never was, rather than the capable, independent woman who earned the title of doctor two months ago.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2014old doc Bradford?\u201d I can\u2019t help teasing her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s thirty-one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, thirty-one is reasonable, I suppose.\u201d I know she can hear the smile in my voice. \u201cSo when did this romantic encounter occur? I thought you were working twenty-four seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe picked me up last night for my dinner break, around ten-thirty. We only had about twenty minutes, so he brought burgers and we parked at the back of the hospital lot and talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalked, eh?\u201d I leave the list on my desk and lie back on my bed. My ceiling fish are al stationary, waiting for the A/C</p><p>to cycle on.</p><p>\u201cHe told me he wants to make sure I know how he feels about me, since we can\u2019t show it in front of anyone in the hospital. Any gossip could get ugly, even though he\u2019s not directly supervising me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how does doc Bradford feel about you?\u201d My logical, analytical sister giggles, and I cover my mouth and wait for her answer. It\u2019s been so long since she\u2019s been this interested in anyone. \u201cHe likes me. A lot, he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if someone finds out? Or if it gets serious? I mean you can\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t know each other for your whole residency...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him about someone finding out. He said it\u2019s happened before. As long as there\u2019s no supervisory relationship, the worst that could happen is we\u2019d get a stern talking to.\u201d She doesn\u2019t answer the second question.</p><p>\u201cMy big sister, skulking around kissing boys in parking lots. I\u2019m shocked! Details, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to get back inside, so I said I could just walk back up, and he said no way, he didn\u2019t want to waste his last two minutes with me. And then he reached over and touched the side of my face, and we moved towards each other like magnets, and, wel ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me hanging! How was it? Hasn\u2019t it been like ten years since you\u2019ve kissed a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Ha. Very funny. I guess it has been a while, but kissing Brad was just... perfect.\u201d</p><p>The air comes on overhead and my fish begin to sway.</p><p>\u201cPlease tel me you were a little late getting back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d She sighs, and I know she\u2019s reliving the whole thing. \u201cI have to get back on the floor. I just had to tel you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that you did. And I\u2019l say a prayer that you don\u2019t get caught.\u201d We laugh and say goodnight, and I lie there, smiling, for another few minutes. Until my thoughts cycle back to Reid, and the blocked kiss. Maybe I should have let him do it, before pushing him away.</p><p>But if I\u2019d have let him kiss me, I might not have been able to push him away at al .</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>REID</p><p>Just before I left yesterday, Darlene told me that I\u2019ve been assigned to Dori for the next couple of days to help finish out the closets and pantry.</p><p>\u201cI assume that means Gabriel e is off Tuesday and Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>Her answer was her best squinty stare, while Frank, sauntering up behind us to wash his hands, wasn\u2019t as restrained. \u201cSon, you should take some lessons in when to keep your thoughts to yourself. See, women are always saying that they want honesty and communication, but that\u2019s just because they don\u2019t know al the jackass stuff we guys think about on a regular basis. A more intel igent fel a, like myself, knows to keep the mystery alive by knowing when to shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d Darlene said, smirking.</p><p>Dori is removing six-foot-long boards from the supply storage unit when I arrive with her latte. Though less surprised than she was yesterday, she\u2019s stil guarded. I drag the tips of my fingers over hers as I hand it to her. She glances at me as I feign interest in the trel is Frank is instal ing on the opposite side of the yard.</p><p>\u201cSo...these boards need to be painted before we put in the shelving, right?\u201d When I look at her, she sets her cup on a stack of jagged shale stones and turns back to unloading the boards.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d</p><p>This morning, she\u2019s wearing a white t-shirt that would fit a linebacker, the back of which is emblazoned with what I assume is the name of her church and the VBS theme: In His Hands. On the front is a child\u2019s drawing of the globe covered in blue and green splotches. On the il ogical y green Arctic Circle are stick-figure kids of every color (including purple). The earth levitates just above two huge hands.</p><p>I hand her my coffee. \u201cHold this, and let me do that.\u201d I grab a stack of boards. \u201cWhere are we going with these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, we have to trim them down to size. I already did the measurements.\u201d She pul s a slip of paper from her back pocket, grabs her latte and leads me to the circular saw.</p><p>As I carry the remainder of the boards over, she measures and marks them, flips the switch on the saw and begins cutting. The process looks simple enough, and after a few minutes, I\u2019m not content to stand and watch, so I ask her to show me how to do it.</p><p>We cut the first two boards together. The sensation of her palms on the back of my hands, guiding them firmly, is like a pulsing current. I feel almost high, standing close enough to inhale her subtle, familiar scent, coupled with running boards through a whirring saw that could lop off my hand in a split second of inattention. The adrenaline junkie in me is fired up.</p><p>While I cut the last few boards alone, my ears adjusting to the shril whine as the blade chews through the wood, she sands the rough edges on the finished products. A portion of the ground and the fence has been tarped where we\u2019re doing the painting. She takes several of the smal er boards and I fol ow with the larger ones. \u201cLean them there; we\u2019re spray-painting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fun.\u201d She glances at me, unsure if I\u2019m being sarcastic. I turn back to get the rest, letting her guess. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keeping the mystery alive, as Frank would say.</p><p>Dori takes up the paint sprayer and quickly coats the first board with even strokes, leaving a smooth white surface. She hands me the sprayer. \u201cStart towards the top and go slowly, side to side.\u201d I aim it at the board and press the trigger just as she\u2019s saying, \u201cBack up first!\u201d I basical y blast it with paint al in one spot, so it looks like shit\u2014and bonus, since I\u2019m holding it too near the flat surface\u2014Dori and I end up with a rebound scatter of paint everywhere except where the goggles and particle masks cover our eyes and mouths. She blinks at me behind paint-misted goggles. There\u2019s paint in her hair, on her shirt, and misted over every inch of visible skin.</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d My voice is muffled by the mask. I\u2019m expecting anger or at least irritation, but she looks at my face and bursts out laughing and then so do I and soon we\u2019ve caught the attention of everyone, including the photogs in the surrounding yards.</p><p>Shaking her head, she pul s her particle mask down and it hangs around her neck. \u201cYou have to learn everything the hard way, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>I shrug. \u201cI prefer to cal it learning by experience.\u201d She laughs again and rol s her eyes, \u201cOoooh, wel in that case, far be it from me to interrupt your learning processes.</p><p>Next time, please warn me to wear head-to-toe plastic sheeting while you\u2019re learning.\u201d She uses air quotes around learning.</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\u201d I take a giant step back and so does she as I raise the sprayer. And then she takes another, pul ing on her mask while I mumble, \u201cFunny girl,\u201d through mine.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, we stand surveying the boards, sipping our coffee drinks, masks around our necks, goggles pushed to our foreheads. She looks at me and smirks at my hair, which is sticking straight up behind the goggles. I push them back so they sit more like sunglasses on top of my head and point at her shirt. \u201cSo what\u2019s the story with this VBS gig? Roberta said you were in charge of some musical program, and that\u2019s why you disappeared last week.\u201d</p><p>She watches me over the lid of her cup. \u201cIt\u2019s just a few songs for the kindergarten class. For Parents\u2019 Night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re directing them?\u201d At her nod, I say, \u201cI know nothing about kids that age, except that I was one. Or so I hear.\u201d She smiles, and I become aware of the freckles that were protected from paint mist by her mask and goggles.</p><p>Scattered across the bridge of her nose, they\u2019re actual y kind of cute. \u201cYou go to this church regularly? I\u2019ve never real y been; my parents aren\u2019t big on religion.\u201d Her smile weakens and her gaze skitters away and back. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d She swal ows another sip. \u201cMy dad\u2019s the pastor.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. I didn\u2019t expect that. \u201cAh. So how much of that VBS job is you volunteering and how much is you being volunteered?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cOh, I love teaching the kids to sing. It\u2019s the most rewarding thing I do.\u201d Her eyes slide away again.</p><p>\u201cI thought attempting to rehabilitate me was your favorite thing.\u201d I hadn\u2019t expected to make her blush, but her ears color under the paint.</p><p>Dori</p> <p>I can\u2019t respond to that comment, of course\u2014a comment made more awkward by our previous argument about whether or not he needed or wanted rehabilitating, and whether or not I\u2019d consider him worthy of the task. He\u2019s either forgiven me for those heated words, or he\u2019s forgotten them.</p><p>I think he seldom forgets anything.</p><p>We finish painting the first coat on the boards, and at lunch Reid\u2019s frat boy groupies join us. There are four of them clustered around him today. I consider sitting with Roberta, Darlene and Frank, but they\u2019re huddled together discussing grandchildren and real estate taxes and for discussing grandchildren and real estate taxes and for some reason, I just want to feel eighteen today.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s it like, being you at some party? I bet you score al the chicks,\u201d a guy named Javier is asking Reid, who makes room for me on the edge of the patio.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t complain,\u201d he answers, his eyes hitting mine for a split second.</p><p>Javier leans closer. \u201cDo any of them ever put up any fight? Turn you down?\u201d</p><p>Reid laughs. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not like, often,\u201d another guy, Kyle, says.</p> <p>Reid shrugs. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m rethinking my desire to be an eighteen-year-old girl and my decision to sit with this particular group of boys when the one on my opposite side offers his hand, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Trevor.\u201d</p><p>I shake his hand. \u201cDori.\u201d</p><p>He leans forward, speaking in a low voice. \u201cIgnore them</p><p>\u2014they\u2019re a bunch of morons with no manners.\u201d I take a bite of my sandwich rather than reply, curious about whatever inappropriate thing Kyle is asking Reid. (I swear I just heard the word boobs.) Trevor clears his throat, blocking out whatever Kyle is saying. \u201cSo are you a celebrity, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. I just noticed you seem... acquainted...\u201d he inclines his head towards Reid.</p><p>\u201cOh. No.\u201d I wave a dismissive hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been working together since he\u2019s been here. So, what are you studying? UCLA, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Applied mathematics.\u201d He removes his glasses and rubs a smear from a lens with his shirttail. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be starting at Berkeley in the fal . Social work.\u201d His eyebrows rise. \u201cBerkeley? Cool.\u201d He chuckles a little. \u201cSocial work, eh?\u201d I bristle, having endured appal ed reactions about my chosen major from everyone from my maternal grandparents to classmates. He puts the glasses on and says, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that how it sounded. I was just thinking how everyone is always horrified at my major, like it\u2019s so difficult and al , but I hear \u2018social work\u2019 and think that sounds hard.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cMy sister just finished her medical degree, so pretty much everything pales in comparison to that.\u201d He puffs his cheeks and blows air out. \u201cOh, man, yeah.</p><p>My roommate\u2019s pre-dental, and he studies nonstop\u2014some nights I go to bed and he\u2019s studying and I get up and he\u2019s studying. So does your sister practice nearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just started her residency. In Indiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>Javier and another groupie high-five each other, and Javier says, \u201cDude, yes,\u201d to Reid. \u201cI want to be you so bad.\u201d I glance at Reid, who\u2019s smiling and shaking his head.</p><p>Whatever he\u2019s just admitted to, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cSo why social work?\u201d Trevor gestures to the house. \u201cI take it you\u2019re one of the regulars here, so you must know what a chal enging field you\u2019re going into.\u201d I nod. \u201cI\u2019m not starry-eyed about it. My dad\u2019s a pastor and my mom is an obstetrical nurse working with mostly low-income women, so I guess I have some built-in feelings of obligation to do what I can for my community. Lots of people who plan to go into social work talk about al the people they\u2019re going to help... but more often you save one person while losing nine. It could be a real y discouraging field if you\u2019re not realistic about the odds.\u201d He nods. \u201cSounds like you\u2019ve considered every angle. I think the world needs more people like you.\u201d I turn to grab my drink and hide my self-conscious smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks. So, why applied mathematics?\u201d</p><p>He smiles, a smal dimple appearing on the right side.</p><p>\u201cWel , I\u2019m really good at math.\u201d</p><p>The remainder of lunch ticks away while we discuss col ege courses, dorm life and going Greek, which I\u2019m certain is not for me, though he insists I\u2019d be perfect for a sorority leadership spot. \u201cScholarly types are needed, too.</p><p>Trust me\u2014I am one of those.\u201d</p><p>As we get up to throw our trash away and get back to work, he says, \u201cIt was nice to meet you, Dori. Good luck at Berkeley, and, you know, saving ten percent of the world.\u201d He winks at me before signaling to his frat brothers to fol ow him inside.</p><p>I\u2019m seldom so blatantly flirted with. Except for Reid, when he\u2019s entertaining himself by torturing me. Which doesn\u2019t count.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>REID</p><p>I learned more about Dori in fifteen minutes of eavesdropping on her conversation with the math geek than I\u2019ve found out about her the whole time we\u2019ve been working together. Not only is her father is a pastor, but her sister is a doctor, her mother is a nurse working with low-income pregnant women, and Dori intends to become a social worker. She must have been bred to this service-to-society mentality from birth. She\u2019s like the reverse of me.</p><p>For about two seconds I want to go home and hug my parents.</p><p>Then Dori\u2019s ears did their pink transformation. Up to that point, I\u2019d just been observing that Trevor guy flirting with her.</p><p>It was humorous until her ears started glowing. Shit. Now I\u2019m territorial over making her ears change color? What the hel .</p><p>After tossing my trash, I scan the yard for Dori and spot her walking in a tight circle, talking on her cel . I grab a couple of water bottles and head over to the shelving boards, which need a second coat of paint.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, of course I stil want to see you.\u201d Her voice carries the few feet between us. \u201cCan we not do this now?\u201d She stops her circular pacing. \u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing you\u2019re doing wrong.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s silent for another couple of minutes, restarting her pacing after glancing at me. I busy myself setting up the paint sprayer, pretending I can\u2019t hear her.</p><p>\u201cNick, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m even capable...\u201d Eyes tightly closed, she makes a fist and bumps herself in the forehead three times. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. There\u2019s obviously something wrong with me. Something missing.\u201d Opening her eyes, she swipes the back of her hand across her cheek. She\u2019s breaking up with the guy? It\u2019s like a gruesome col ision. I can\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to different col eges, and you\u2019l find someone who\u2019l be everything you want and deserve. I\u2019m just... not that girl. I never have been.\u201d She searches her empty pockets, looking for a tissue, I think. She turns to go into the house, and I can\u2019t fol ow without being really damned obvious.</p><p>When she comes back out, I\u2019m painting the boards. Her eyes are red, but not repulsively so. \u201cOh,\u201d she says, smiling, though barely. \u201cYou got started already. Thanks.\u201d I shrug one shoulder. \u201cNo problem.\u201d I turn the motor off on the sprayer and examine her for a couple of seconds.</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d I ask. She shakes her head, and I nod, hand her the water bottle. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, boss?\u201d She swal ows half the bottle of water, and then says,</p><p>\u201cDid you know that \u2018boss\u2019 is what guys in jail cal the guards and deputies?\u201d</p><p>As a matter of fact I do know that, but I raise my eyebrows in mock surprise. \u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d She rol s her eyes, sighing, her smile growing wider.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you finish painting, you reprobate, and I\u2019l go inside and start getting the closets ready to be shelved.\u201d I turn the sprayer back on. \u201cI\u2019ve been cal ed worse, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughs, which is incongruous with her tear-stained face but somehow attractive at the same time. \u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d she mocks, and I have to laugh.</p><p>Dori</p><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d he says, just before we leave for the day.</p><p>We\u2019re moving the painted boards inside so we can start instal ing the shelves in the morning. I know him wel enough by now to know he\u2019l insist on using the dril tomorrow\u2014</p> <p>something I understand. The first time Dad agreed to let me wield a power tool, I jumped up and down. Reid\u2019s not as enthusiastic as that... but he\u2019s close.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy social work and not music?\u201d</p><p>This is far afield from the subject of power tools, so my brain has to redirect. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Trevor you\u2019re going to Berkeley, right?\u201d he asks, and I nod. \u201cSo, why, with your voice, are you studying social work instead of music?\u201d</p> <p>While I thought he was doing nothing more than regaling the others with corrupt Hol ywood tales, he was listening to my conversation with Trevor. Before I can compose an answer, he adds, \u201cSeems like a waste of time.\u201d What? \u201cIs that how you feel about this project, after three weeks of working here? Can\u2019t you see that these families need what we do for them?\u201d</p><p>He holds his hands up. \u201cYeah, sure. But you seem to feel some guilt complex for being born smarter, or having a better life. And you\u2019re planning to spend your life beating your head against a wal trying to help people who don\u2019t bother to help themselves.\u201d</p><p>I do feel accountable for my blessings\u2014but he seems to feel nothing but entitlement. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t do anything to deserve being born into poverty, any more than I deserved to be born into a family that can afford to give me food, decent health care, or an education.\u201d He stacks the final board against the others. \u201cWhy does it have to be about deserving something? So it\u2019s luck of the draw, and granted, their hand sucks. I mean sure, there are things you can do\u2014and here you are, doing them. But there\u2019s only so much. Why live your life feeling guilty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t guilt\u2014it\u2019s a social conscience.\u201d I try to suppress my defensiveness. \u201cI can\u2019t just stand by and do nothing.</p><p>Because my life is easy in comparison, and that isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, you know, fly off the handle or anything\u2014but doesn\u2019t the fact that you think it isn\u2019t fair make you distrustful of the idea of a \u2018higher power\u2019 orchestrating everything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d His eyebrows rise at my quick reply, and I can\u2019t let him know how close to my doubts he\u2019s come. \u201cBecause people like my Dad exist. Because faith is part of who I am, and a measure of faith is being wil ing to do what\u2019s needed.</p><p>I just want to make a difference. I have to believe I have a purpose. Maybe you don\u2019t understand that, but that\u2019s how I feel.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a minute, and I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve wasted my breath and gotten worked up for nothing. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d he says. He tilts his head like Esther does when I talk to her and I use words outside of her canine experience. \u201cYour principles seem real, though.</p><p>Usual y there\u2019s something deceptive about people who throw words like faith around. Like they\u2019re using it to mask ulterior motives or baser desires...\u201d He smiles a wicked little smile and my heart flips over. \u201cThe sorts of values I do understand.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>REID</p><p>The camaraderie lasted al morning. We ate lunch separately\u2014 she sat with Roberta, and I sat with Frank, Darlene and Gabriel e \u2014but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what changed her mood. She was on the phone again after lunch, and though she was standing too far away for me to hear anything specific, her tone was on edge. She\u2019s been bitchy since she hung up.</p><p>She\u2019s instal ing brackets in the closets, and I\u2019m adding the shelves and bolting them in. Since we\u2019re working on the same closets at the same time, we\u2019re almost on top of each other. The third time she criticizes something I\u2019m not doing perfectly and then takes over and does it herself, I can\u2019t take any more of this shit.</p> <p>\u201cLook, just because you had a grisly breakup yesterday doesn\u2019t mean you can take it out on me today. I wasn\u2019t responsible for it.\u201d</p><p>She glares at me. \u201cWhat. Are. You. Talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone cal yesterday? The crying?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth drops open and snaps closed. \u201cWere you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re standing inside a closet having this conversation, and the harsh resonance of our voices ricochets around and through us, unable to ful y escape the confines of the space. \u201cYou were outside, in public, talking on your phone.</p><p>It\u2019s not like I fucking wiretapped you.\u201d Her jaw sets. \u201cFirst, you shouldn\u2019t have been listening to what was clearly a private conversation. And second, there was nothing to break up. We just agreed to never actual y start... whatever we might... flippin\u2019 flapjacks. It\u2019s none of your darned business.\u201d</p><p>Once I start laughing I can\u2019t stop. \u201cFlipping what?\u201d Where the hel does she get these things?</p><p>\u201cIf you were capable of doing any of this without assistance, it would be a joy to leave you to it,\u201d she says, glaring.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. This isn\u2019t rocket science. It\u2019s screwing a bunch of boards to a wal . Big fucking deal.\u201d Side note: I love how much it bothers her when I say fuck. She winces every time, like she\u2019s being jabbed with a needle.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know how to use the studfinder to find the studs first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d</p><p>She sighs exaggeratedly and fixes me with a stare. \u201cYou have to locate the studs first\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStudfinder? \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou use it to find the framework? Inside the wal ?\u201d Her sarcastic pitch is hitting a boiling point inside me, because frankly it\u2019s a little too reminiscent of Dad, which I can\u2019t handle from more than one person in my life. \u201cThe skeleton to which we attach stuff that needs to be anchored\u2014like, I don\u2019t know, shelves?\u201d</p><p>I stopped listening before she resumed talking. \u201cYou finish in here,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019l do Gabriel e\u2019s closet.\u201d In answer, she hands me a smal gadget containing a miniature leveler and a red arrow-looking thing. This must be the wondrous studfinder. I have zero idea what to do with it, so I slip it into my pocket as I leave the room.</p><p>Dori</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo argument,\u201d I say.</p><p>He\u2019s instal ed the hanging rod and an entire row of shelves without finding the anchoring studs first. The weight of the brackets alone probably seemed fine, but when the shelves were added, the weight began pul ing the brackets out from the wal , screws and al . If Gabriel e adds so much as a pair of boots to a shelf or a couple of hangers to the rod, the whole mess is coming down.</p><p>Without speaking, we begin to angle the shelves to remove them from their unstable brackets. The boards scrape the wal s on both sides, wringing simultaneous exclamations\u2014 fucking hell from him and gosh almighty from me\u2014which makes him laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>And then I glance at him and he grins and for no reason it is funny and we\u2019re both laughing.</p><p>Once the boards are removed, we survey the damage.</p><p>Once the boards are removed, we survey the damage.</p><p>He sighs deeply, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cMan. That looks like shit.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t dispute his opinion, but something about his defensive pose and his dejected inflection reminds me of five-year-old Jonathan from my VBS class. Slumping against one of the ruined wal s, I calculate that the repair and repainting wil add a couple of hours to finishing out the closets. I was hoping to leave at three, which is not going to happen.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>I straighten from the wal . \u201cNow, we repair the damage...</p><p>and reinstal the shelving.\u201d</p><p>He pul s his phone from his pocket, checks the time. \u201cI assume you have a painstakingly calculated timetable...</p><p>and the closets have to be done today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I grab a couple of the boards and haul them from the closet, and he fol ows with the brackets and the dril .</p><p>\u201cWhich means you\u2019l have to stay later.\u201d</p><p>I answer with a smal shrug and a nod.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019l stay later too, then.\u201d</p><p>This is unprecedented. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , it\u2019s my fault we have to redo the whole closet, so yeah.\u201d Hitting a speed dial number, he watches me carry the remaining boards from inside the closet and lean them careful y against the pink wal . \u201cHey George, can you reschedule that interview? And also let the driver know to be here at five instead of three today.\u201d</p><p>Avoiding his eyes, I listen as he and his manager rearrange his after-hours agenda. Before now, I hadn\u2019t rearrange his after-hours agenda. Before now, I hadn\u2019t considered that Reid had anything else to do between filming movies, aside from goofing off.</p><p>The typical schedule everyone keeps is 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., and I\u2019m used to him leaving with the rest of the transient volunteers. Those of us making up the regular crew come in earlier sometimes, and hang around a bit later sometimes, finishing up projects or readying things for the next day while the house grows gradual y quieter, the sounds of an entire crew of workers fading to nothing.</p><p>Since we have to repaint the closet in Gabriel e\u2019s room, her shelves are the last thing to be done. When Reid volunteers to instal them alone (again) while I finish up the linen closet shelving, I take a breath and ignore the threatening sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Instead, I simply hand him the dril and the studfinder (his lips twist, and I know he\u2019s repressing a wise crack) after showing him how to use it.</p><p>While finishing out the linen closet, I stifle the desire to check on him at least a dozen times. Final y, I head back to Gabriel e\u2019s room, bracing myself for whatever catastrophe awaits.</p><p>Reid\u2019s back is to me as he attaches the last shelf, the hard muscles of his shoulders and arms flexed and defined through his white t-shirt as he presses the dril , driving the screw through the bracket and into the wal . When finished, he leaves the dril on the shelf and steps back, every line of his body radiating pride, unaware that I\u2019m watching. He\u2019s not wearing the safety goggles (he never does unless I make him put them on), but I won\u2019t chide him for it.</p><p>\u201cIt looks good,\u201d I say, and he moves to the side as I step</p><p>\u201cIt looks good,\u201d I say, and he moves to the side as I step in next to him. I tug on the shelves, testing them. They don\u2019t budge. I could probably climb on them if I had to. They\u2019re more than secure enough to hold Gabriel e\u2019s shoes and storage boxes.</p><p>Relaxing against the doorjamb of the closet, folding his arms loosely over his chest, he glances towards the bedroom door. \u201cIt\u2019s real y quiet in the house now. So weird.\u201d I nod. \u201cEveryone\u2019s gone except Roberta and Gene, and they\u2019re doing paperwork in the office.\u201d His body fil s the closet doorway, and he\u2019l have to move for me to exit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which is an odd thought to have, and makes me very aware of the enclosed space. \u201cBeing in here is sort of like burrowing into a piece of bubblegum,\u201d I say nervously, glancing at the closet\u2019s pink wal s.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer, staring at me like he\u2019s analyzing a complex riddle. Uncrossing his arms, he hooks one hand in his front pocket while the other lifts, his fingers catching a strand of hair too short to stretch to the elastic pul ing the rest of my hair back. He slides it behind my ear, grazing the tip with his finger, and suddenly there\u2019s no sound but the pounding of my heart. This is where I should put my hands up between us like I did before. This is where I should say excuse me and get out of here.</p><p>His hand drops to his side and he stares down at me, making no movement towards me or away. I suck my lower lip into my mouth, a nervous habit leftover from childhood, and his gaze drops there, sticks. A minute passes before he braces a hand on the wal just over my shoulder and leans closer, his eyes flashing to mine. \u201cTel me what to do next, because I\u2019m not sure what you want.\u201d His voice has gone rusty and low, like he hasn\u2019t used it in weeks.</p><p>I know what he\u2019s asking, despite the words threading across this scene: this is not happening. I shake my head, barely moving. Thoughts tumble through my mind, blurred, flashing in and out, opposites: kiss me, don\u2019t touch me, come closer, move away.</p> <p>\u201cAl I\u2019m asking,\u201d his knuckles brush along my jaw, \u201cis that you tel me, Dori, what... you... want.\u201d</p><p>When he straightens and begins to back away, I almost protest, biting my lip to keep from doing so. This movement betrays me, though, because again, he stares at my mouth a long moment before his gaze shifts to my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe, just tel me if I do something you don\u2019t want,\u201d he says quietly. And then his palms are skimming down my arms, and his mouth is on mine and he\u2019s kissing me, sliding his arms around me and pul ing me up against his chest, hands pressing my lower back. Gently, his lips play over mine, teasing and testing and it feels so incredible, but somewhere in my mind is the tiniest nagging disappointment that he\u2019s kissing me like Nick did, the few times he\u2019d kissed me\u2014 safely\u2014the last thing I expect from Reid.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>REID</p> <p>The last thing I expect is for her to open her mouth, almost imperceptibly, so subtly that if I wasn\u2019t paying attention I might miss it. I\u2019m al about paying attention. Even stil , her response is such a shock that I almost pause, but instinctively I know that if I give her a fraction of a second to think, this is over.</p><p>Careful y, I run the tip of my tongue across her lower lip and she gasps, opening wider, receptive. Permission to enter granted, and God knows she doesn\u2019t have to indicate that twice. Sweeping my tongue across hers, I pul her in tight and hard when she responds perfectly and in kind. I suck her lower lip into my mouth and she mimics this the moment I release it, adding the slightest graze of her teeth.</p><p>Her hands are on my back, kneading and stroking while I\u2019m doing the same to her. And then she makes this sound\u2014a cross between a sigh and a moan, like a soft, subtle, wordless yes, and it\u2019s al I can do not to come undone.</p><p>I can\u2019t say if this is the best kiss ever. I\u2019ve kissed a lot of girls. But I can say that I don\u2019t remember another girl or another kiss in this moment. I can\u2019t remember my own name in this moment. And I don\u2019t want to stop kissing her.</p><p>Ever. And then my hands shift under her shirt at her waist, fingers brushing over the soft, warm skin of her lower back, and she tears her mouth from mine. Shit. Too far, too fast.</p><p>The warning hits my brain too late.</p> <p>\u201cStop, stop,\u201d she says, gasping. Her eyes are glazed over and I can\u2019t hear anything beyond our mingled, panting breaths and her muted words. \u201cOh my gosh.\u201d I\u2019m waiting for her to shove me away but her eyes are closed now and she\u2019s stil holding onto me so I\u2019m not moving. I want to kiss her again and I\u2019m exerting every ounce of self-control to stand here, unmoving, and watch her come back to earth. Shit, she is going to be so pissed in about three seconds.</p><p>Make that one second.</p><p>Her hands fal from my sides abruptly, like she\u2019s just realized where they were. I loosen my hold on her gradual y, as though I can keep her from remembering where my hands were and what they were doing if I move slowly enough. I shouldn\u2019t have put my hands under her shirt. I had no intention of going anywhere with that, I just wanted my hands on her skin, a tactile connection, like grounding wires, while our mouths fed the current between us.</p><p>Now her eyes are wide open and she\u2019s staring at me, but I can\u2019t read her expression. This is something new, something more than alarm or anger or exasperation. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking, and I don\u2019t dare ask. She\u2019s shutting down, like shades lowering, and then she\u2019s ducking under my arm and I can\u2019t do anything but lean against the wal , pound it once, hard, with my fist. \u201cFuck.\u201d She whirls around. \u201cWhy do you have to use that word?\u201d Ah, the almighty F-word. \u201cIt\u2019s just a word, Dori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>I turn to face her, the judgment in her tone, which I can\u2019t even begin to reconcile with the girl who was just kissing me like she was drowning in me. Like she wanted to. \u201cSo when I say fuck, it real y bothers you.\u201d I\u2019m not even saying it at her, but I swear to God, she flinches before she nods.</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s just a word.\u201d</p><p>Refusing to meet my eyes, she bites her lower lip (which only makes me want to kiss her again) while I stand here watching her, equal y silent. When she speaks, her voice is barely audible. \u201cBecause it takes something sacred and makes it into something ugly and insignificant. That\u2019s what bothers me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you consider fu\u2014sex as something sacred?\u201d I can\u2019t wrap my head around this. \u201cSex isn\u2019t sacred\u2014not under usual circumstances and probably not ever, between mental y balanced people. It\u2019s just a physical need, like eating or breathing.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me, her eyes bright, though she\u2019s not crying, thank God. \u201cI understand that it\u2019s physical, something we\u2019re biological y driven to.\u201d (Now there\u2019s an unanticipated and annoyingly hot viewpoint for her to have.)</p><p>\u201cBut when people love each other, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s like\u2014</p><p>like eating for pleasure, not just gorging yourself on whatever c-crap comes along.\u201d</p><p>She can\u2019t even say \u2018crap\u2019 without stumbling over it, and her argument is absurd. Eating for pleasure\u2014Jesus, I could make al kinds of comebacks to that. She turns and runs from the room, the front door opening and closing quietly behind her a moment later. Because of course she isn\u2019t going to make a scene leaving the house.</p><p>Dori</p><p>I\u2019m driving home shaking. I\u2019m angry, yes. At myself. But I\u2019m not shaking from anger. I\u2019m shaking from something else altogether.</p><p>Something</p><p>that</p><p>somehow,</p><p>inexplicably,</p><p>generates a similar physical response. And yet not.</p><p>Reid thinks he knows who I am, because he\u2019s made the same assumptions everyone else makes about me. That I\u2019m a proper, straitlaced good girl. That I always have been.</p><p>But you know what they say about assumptions.</p><p>I met Colin Dyer during my first week of high school.</p><p>His family attended our sister church\u2014the one with the architectural y impressive sanctuary located in a better neighborhood, with parishioners to whom giving back only ever means opening a wal et. Our church is their charity project, their contributions providing enough additional funds to pay for building repairs and help support our neighborhood programs.</p><p>Colin\u2019s mother was my school counselor, and I was her office aide during fourth period. Getting an aide job as a freshman was unheard of, unless you had connections, and freshman was unheard of, unless you had connections, and thanks to Dad, I did. Being selected as Dr. Dyer\u2019s aide was a highly coveted privilege. She was easygoing, and her office was quiet and comfortable. Her aides had firsthand knowledge of which students were troubled or in trouble, so not just anyone could work the front desk. She needed someone trustworthy and caring. I was both.</p><p>I worked the class period after lunch. By the end of that first week, I\u2019d covertly inspected the family photos in her office while making copies or clearing her fax machine of junk faxes, so when Colin stopped by, I recognized him immediately. A senior and on the swim team, he was tal and slim, but muscular. His dark hair was cut very short, making his hazel, almond-shaped eyes even more striking in his olive-toned face. He walked and swam with equal grace, and possessed a confidence I craved and admired.</p><p>\u201cWel , hel o,\u201d he said, his brows raised slightly, his gaze warm and focused. \u201cYou\u2019re new.\u201d</p><p>I frowned slightly, confused. It was only the first week of school, so anyone in my position would technical y be new.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you around at school before, so you\u2019re either a new transfer... or a freshman. Or, in upperclass-speak, fresh meat.\u201d He smiled, his teeth perfect and white, smal dimples denting adorably at the sides of his mouth. I felt my face heat. I had no idea how to respond, and though I knew I should be offended, I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d his mother said, coming in with a stack of folders and a bag from Wendy\u2019s, the aroma of French fries fil ing the office. \u201cYou\u2019l need to pick up those goggles yourself. I couldn\u2019t make it by today. I had to stop by the orthodontist to get Tara\u2019s new retainer.\u201d Tara was Colin\u2019s seventh grade sister.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just get her a new retainer?\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cYes. That one lasted a month before she</p><p>\u2018misplaced\u2019 it.\u201d She walked into her office to prepare for the afternoon\u2019s onslaught of distressed teenagers and/or their parents, her voice trailing off. \u201cIf only they put little strings on those things like they have for bifocals and children\u2019s mittens...\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and I tingled, head to toe. I\u2019d never felt so attracted to a boy before. As he turned back to me, I turned away to switch on the oscil ating fan behind my desk.</p><p>\u201cSo, fresh meat, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>My face warmed again. \u201cDori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be seeing you, then, Dori.\u201d He quirked an eyebrow and was out the door.</p><p>I watched him in the hal ways between classes\u2014senior and junior girls constantly orbiting him like planets caught in his gravitational pul , freshman and sophomore girls sighing as he walked by, other guys high-fiving him or throwing out plans for the weekend as they passed. He was extroverted, popular. I was al but invisible.</p><p>Whenever he noticed me, he\u2019d smile broadly. \u201cHey, fresh meat,\u201d he\u2019d say, anyone within earshot tittering. I was embarrassed and thril ed. Once or twice a week, he\u2019d show up in the counseling office to talk to his mother, but he always stayed after, leaning a hip on my desk and talking to me in teasing tones.</p><p>One day, he walked in carrying a dark pink rose. Dr.</p><p>Dyer was in a staff meeting, and I was alone. \u201cHey, Dori.\u201d His eyes roamed over me. \u201cYou look hot today.\u201d I stared at the desk, never sure how serious his compliments were. He smiled, moved closer, held the rose to my ear. \u201cYep, I was right. The exact same shade.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He squatted down next to my chair, which he\u2019d never done. \u201cI have something to ask you.\u201d Viewing him from this new perspective, I stared at his long, dark eyelashes and his ful lips. He drew the rose down the side of my face, the petals soft against my cheek, and I felt a stirring to my core.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a date for homecoming?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slowly, disbelieving. It made no sense for someone as popular as Colin to notice me, let alone ask me out.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go with me?\u201d His gaze locked on mine as he slowly dragged the rose across my lips, the fragrance of it sweet and overpowering. I nodded, and he smiled. He pul ed his phone from his pocket, pushed a few buttons, handed it to me. \u201cPut your number in. I\u2019l cal you tonight and we\u2019l talk logistics.\u201d As I tapped my number, he glanced towards the door and back to me. \u201cCan I have a kiss, to seal the deal?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded again, and then his lips were on mine, briefly.</p><p>He took his phone, laid the rose on my desk, and walked into the hal , whistling. I\u2019d been asked to homecoming, had accepted the invitation, and his kiss, never speaking a word.</p><p>That was my first kiss with Colin. My first kiss with anyone.</p><p>Four months later, it was Valentine\u2019s Day. His parents had driven to San Francisco for an extended romantic weekend, and his little sister was staying overnight at a friend\u2019s house. He took me to dinner, and then we rented a movie. We had the house to ourselves. As we made out on the sofa, he whispered that he loved me. When he took my hand and pul ed me to his room and into his bed, I fol owed.</p><p>We snuck home to his empty house during lunch breaks and got a hotel room on my fifteenth birthday, where we made love in the shower, on the worn loveseat, and on the floor, laughing at the rug burns we sustained on our knees and backsides from the coarse carpet. I woke up in his arms, hoping Mom hadn\u2019t cal ed the friend with whom I was supposedly spending the night, but certain I\u2019d not trade that waking moment for anything, no matter the consequences.</p> <p>When spring break came around and he took off for San Diego with friends, I didn\u2019t protest; I wasn\u2019t one of those clingy girlfriends. When he came back home Sunday night</p><p>\u2014his eighteenth birthday\u2014and didn\u2019t cal or return my texts, I was concerned. When he didn\u2019t show at lunch or stop by the office on Monday, I didn\u2019t understand. Not until I saw him in the hal way just before last period, his arm slung around the waist of a senior girl. Not until his eyes passed over and then returned to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, fresh meat,\u201d he said, and kept walking.</p><p>That was when I knew it was over.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>REID</p> <p>On one hand, that could have gone better... and on the other, it couldn\u2019t have. Once again, I gave in to the impulse to kiss her, though truth be told I\u2019ve wanted to kiss her since the moment she fel into my arms and the sky rained fruit onto our heads.</p><p>She didn\u2019t shove me away this time. At least not until after I kissed her, and she kissed me back. God damn, did she kiss me back. And then the conversation about sex\u2014</p><p>something thing I never thought I\u2019d be discussing with Dorcas Cantrel \u2014and my foul language. I\u2019m not a Neanderthal; I\u2019m capable of curbing it when necessary. I just general y don\u2019t see the point. It\u2019s who I am. Deal. Dori makes it sound like saying the f-word is on par with burning flags or drowning bunnies.</p><p>My phone buzzes while I\u2019m staring into the bubblegum closet, ignoring, for now, the part of the story where Dori ran away. Again. My driver is out front, and I forgot to get her signature before she took off. She said Roberta and Gene were stil here; hopeful y one of them wil sign.</p><p>Seven more working days of my sentence to go.</p><p>\u201cReid?\u201d Roberta\u2019s eyebrows fly up when I come around the corner and her eyes blink behind glasses that lend her face an owlish appearance. She glances at the watch on her wrist and then blinks at me again. \u201cYou\u2019re stil here?\u201d I pul the sheet out of my back pocket as I walk into her makeshift office\u2014a rickety table, a folding chair and a laptop set up in the middle of the master bedroom. Baskets labeled in and out teeter on the edge of the table, stacked with assorted forms and files. \u201cDori needed some help fixing something that I, uh, screwed up. So I stayed a little late.\u201d</p><p>She takes the form, gives it a cursory glance and scrawls her signature at the bottom, smiling. \u201cHow lovely of you. I\u2019m sure Dori appreciated that.\u201d</p><p>Right. I\u2019m sure appreciation was way up there on her list of feelings as she raced out of here. \u201cWhen\u2019s her last day, anyway?\u201d I ask, as offhandedly as possible.</p> <p>\u201cTuesday, I believe.\u201d</p><p>By the end of the day Tuesday, I\u2019l only have three more days remaining of this sentence. I should be looking forward to this ending. Instead, I\u2019m craving some way to slow down time so I can figure out what the hel I want, and get it. \u201cHow long is her trip?\u201d</p><p>Roberta\u2019s eyes narrow, suspicious of my sudden interest in Dori\u2019s plans. \u201cThree weeks, I think,\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and turn to leave. \u201cJust curious.\u201d I have to be on location in Vancouver for my next film in less than a month. Little to no time in between her return and my departure. I don\u2019t know what I want from this girl.</p><p>Tadd labeled her a chal enge, and God yes, she\u2019s that. But today. That kiss. And now I have a matter of days to figure out how far she\u2019s wil ing to take this. Assuming she plays fair and shows up instead of skipping out like she did before.</p><p>Ignoring the paparazzi, bodyguards and fans, I leave the house and walk towards the driver, who stands stoical y next to the open back door of the car. A flash of insight nearly stops me in the middle of the newly paved sidewalk.</p><p>The last time I tried to kiss her, she ducked away and then disappeared for several days. This time, she surrendered</p><p>\u2014and the way she kissed me wasn\u2019t the feel of a girl submitting to something unwanted. She wasn\u2019t giving in to me, she was giving in to herself. She\u2019d contemplated kissing me, at least subconsciously.</p><p>She didn\u2019t disappear last time and run away this time because I did something she didn\u2019t want. She disappeared and ran away because she wanted me to kiss her.</p><p>The chal enge is reading her. She doesn\u2019t let her guard down often. To get her to let it slip, only two things have worked\u2014getting her real y pissed off or real y turned on, neither of which is sustained for long. She protects herself, like a turtle yanking its head back into its shel .</p><p>Why does the fact that plain-faced philanthropist and future social worker Dorcas Cantrel wants me make me feel high?</p><p>Dori</p><p>I shoved Reid away and took a five-day breather when he tried to kiss me the first time, right after the Fruit Bowl Incident.</p><p>A normal boy would have dismissed me with a shrug of his shoulders and a rude nickname, at least in his own head. But Reid is no normal boy, and my attempts to hide my attraction to him are clearly a big fail. Then again, maybe he just thinks every girl on the planet wants him, so a refusal seems like my quirky way of asking him to try again.</p><p>As infuriating as that thought is, that line of reasoning absolutely worked. Barnacles.</p><p>\u201cHel o?\u201d Deb\u2019s voice is groggy when she answers, and I\u2019m immediately sorry for waking her, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from needing her. \u201cDori? What\u2019s up, baby?\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI kissed him.\u201d</p><p>The swoosh of sliding fabric in the background increases my guilt. She was probably power-napping before another overnight-through-afternoon shift, and here I am bothering her with this sil iness. \u201cYou kissed who?\u201d She yawns lightly, affirming my concern.</p><p>\u201cReid.\u201d There\u2019s a moment of silence. \u201cDeb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kissed Reid Alexander?\u201d Her tone is incredulous, which is understandable, given the circumstances. \u201cThe superficial and\u2014I believe this was stated emphatical y</p><p>\u2014 unprofound Reid Alexander?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m staring at my closed bedroom door. Scarves, a couple of hats and an umbrel a hang from the over-the-door couple of hats and an umbrel a hang from the over-the-door hooks, neat and color-coordinated one side to the other.</p><p>On my blue wal is a large magnetic white board with a list of everything I need to do before Quito on one side and everything for Berkeley on the other. Most of each list is checked off. My life is so utterly structured and planned out.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, may I ask how this took place?\u201d</p><p>Recal ing the hungry look he wore as he leaned closer triggers unwelcome tremors of longing. \u201cWel , he was feeling real y proud of himself after fixing some shelves he\u2019d messed up earlier in the day...\u201d If that isn\u2019t the strangest excuse ever given for kissing someone, I don\u2019t know what is.</p><p>\u201cOkay, wait. Has Habitat instituted some new sort of rewards program? Because kissing seems excessive, even for truly outstanding shelf construction.\u201d My laugh dwindles and fades to a moan. \u201cWhat should I do? I told Roberta I\u2019d be there through Tuesday. That\u2019s four more days of him, smug and arrogant every time he looks at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this differs from his usual demeanor how, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d The chirp of an alarm sounds on her end.</p><p>\u201cOh, Deb\u2014I\u2019m sorry for waking you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeh.\u201d She yawns again. \u201cIt was almost time to get up anyway.\u201d</p><p>I picture her cramped but comfortable efficiency apartment and its tiny, south-facing balcony, planters of al sorts and sizes lining the railing and hanging from the roofline. The eight by ten foot space is overrun with greenery and flowers, and from the parking lot her patio looks like a miniature rainforest on the top floor, contrasting with neighboring porches of bicycles, plastic furniture, and bored dogs. \u201cWhen do you have to be at the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , I\u2019m already here, actual y. The hospital has a lovely, windowless room of foul-smel ing lockers and uncomfortable bunks for the doctors to crash, especial y the interns, since we basical y live here.\u201d Great, now I feel even worse. \u201cSo,\u201d she says in her ful y alert, logical, down-to-business voice. \u201cWork separately if you can. If you have to work together, make sure the two of you are never alone.</p><p>And pretend that kiss never happened. Do that for four days, and that wil be the end of the unprofound Reid Alexander.\u201d</p><p>I fight the urge to defend Reid\u2019s unprofoundness in at least one realm: kissing. If anyone ever kisses me better than that, it could alter the time/space continuum. Yet here I am, getting advice on how to make sure it never happens again.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Deb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, baby girl. Any time.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>REID</p><p>Mom is passed out on my bed and drooling onto the silk duvet when I get home. She seldom comes into my side of the house anymore. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I came home and found her in my room.</p><p>Courtesy of our live-in domestic help, there aren\u2019t any remnants of today\u2019s bender\u2014no bottles or glasses to tel me what she ingested to find oblivion this time. Not that her poison of choice matters. The house stays clean thanks to our housekeeper, Maya. She and Immaculada have disappeared into staff quarters, but there are always meals in the fridge if I\u2019m hungry. I imagine for a moment what it might be like to have an alcoholic mother at less than our level of opulence. I\u2019d come home to a filthy house, bottles strewn end to end, nothing to eat. She\u2019d be passed out on the sofa, on the floor, in the yard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finding the positive in this situation feels pointless, but I do it.</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t come home early tonight, I might not have caught her here at al . It\u2019s only eleven. Dad must not be home yet, or she\u2019d be in their room or one of the guest rooms. She\u2019s not dressed for bed, either, though her mismatched outfit, unkempt hair and makeup-less face tel me she hasn\u2019t left the house today. This is an unspoken agreement between my parents\u2014Mom doesn\u2019t go out in public when she\u2019s been drinking. A quiet, depressive drunk, she\u2019s always al owed herself to be coaxed into compliance with this edict. She never drives, either\u2014the car service is on permanent cal , so no chance for a DUI. Each member of the staff has Dad on speed-dial. My family has enabling down to an art.</p><p>An hour ago I was at a party with John, staring at the familiar crowd of fashionably-clad undulating bodies and the smoke curling towards the ceiling, trying and failing to ignore my boredom as the typical laughter rose occasional y over the typical music. While the socialite sitting next to me droned on about her last trip to Amsterdam and the mind-altering experiences she had there, I found myself thinking about shelves.</p><p>\u201c...and then I felt so, you know, at peace with everything and everybody, like I was part of the universe, you know?\u201d she said, and I nodded, contemplating the studfinder, which is a clever-as-hel device. I\u2019d attached those brackets with three-inch screws, driving them into the frame, daring them to ever come loose. If the house was demolished by an act of God, those damned brackets would probably remain affixed to the planks of wood inside the wal . When Dori pul ed on the shelves to test them, they hadn\u2019t moved a mil imeter.</p> <p>My thoughts shifted ful y to Dori. Was her kiss a reward for doing something right? And if so, what was I wil ing to do to earn it again? Not be hungover tomorrow?</p><p>The girl next to me paused in the middle of relaying her substance-triggered existential experiences. \u201cWanna find a room?\u201d she asked, mistaking my silence for interest, I guess.</p><p>I focused on her for the first time since she\u2019d begun talking. She was exceptional y hot, despite her buzzed, slow-blinking expression. Smiling, she took my hand. Her fingers were dainty, linked with mine\u2014even her hand was pretty, her nails perfectly manicured, French tips folding over the top of my hand. She stood and headed towards a hal way. I stood and started to fol ow. And then I pul ed her to a stop and she turned back, confused.</p><p>I leaned closer to be heard over the music. \u201cNot tonight.</p><p>Maybe some other time.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked, nonplussed. I untangled my hand from hers and scanned the room for John. As usual, he was relatively easy to find. I just looked for real y tal girls.</p><p>I told him I thought I had food poisoning and was ditching for tonight, and he fol owed me to the door, looking worried.</p><p>\u201cHey man, you need me to drive you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good,\u201d I told him. \u201cCal ed a taxi already.\u201d I waited outside in the heat, the effects of the party slowly fal ing away. I\u2019d only had one drink, hadn\u2019t smoked anything or swal owed any pil s. It felt good to be in the open air. A little warm, but nothing like digging holes for trees or tamping down sod in ful summer sun. I had to laugh. Reid Alexander, landscaping a yard. Man. No wonder the paparazzi were having seizures over it.</p><p>Unsure what to do with Mom now, I leave her on my bed and go shower. When I come back, she hasn\u2019t moved. I scoop her up, wishing I\u2019d done so before showering, because her breath is sour, and even her perspiration exudes a noxious odor. As I carry her to her room, I\u2019m sucked into a memory\u2014a day prior to her earliest round of rehab.</p><p>I was ten or so, and must have just come home from school because I was wearing the uniform of the most elite private elementary school in the state. Mom was in her sitting room with her wedding album on her lap. \u201cReid!\u201d she said when I peeked around the corner. \u201cCome look with me.\u201d</p> <p>My parents\u2019 wedding had been a social event, organized with a precision usual y reserved for royalty, the whole wedding party arrayed like beings from a fairytale hosted by exclusive designers, courtesy of old money. I don\u2019t remember the photos themselves, just my impression of them, except for one snapshot of the two of them emerging from the church, thick wooden doors braced open behind them. My mother\u2014petite, blonde and beautiful in her ivory gown, stood with her arm tucked through Dad\u2019s, his opposite hand covering hers. My father, in his early thirties, was tal and good-looking. Impressive. No different from his present day look and demeanor\u2014except in these photos, he was beaming. And he had more hair, not as closely shorn as the present salt-and-pepper version.</p><p>My mother\u2019s fingers hovered over the photograph, one frosted pink nail tracing her own torso in the stunning ivory gown. \u201cMy gown had seed pearls sewn into the bodice,\u201d she told me. \u201cI felt like a princess. And your father was so handsome.\u201d They made a striking pair.</p><p>\u201cReid,\u201d she said then, her fingers shaking, suspended over the princess in the photo, \u201cMommy\u2019s going to be gone for a little while.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at her. \u201cGone where?\u201d</p><p>She swal owed, and it seemed like she was trying to breathe normal y. Maybe she was trying not to cry. I stared at her, concerned, and she smiled through watery eyes.</p><p>\u201cWel , it seems that you are going to have a little brother or sister, and I need to go away for a little bit, to make sure I don\u2019t... make sure I don\u2019t...\u201d She stared at her shaking hand and the photograph underneath it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d I asked, reeling with the news of a sibling. I remember feeling happy initial y, but something was upsetting my mother, so I pushed the joy aside until I had time to understand what I should feel.</p><p>\u201cTo make sure I don\u2019t hurt the baby.\u201d</p> <p>I had no idea what she meant. I was sure my mother could never hurt anything or anyone. She couldn\u2019t even stand to punish me when I was bad\u2014and I was bad pretty often. There was no way she\u2019d hurt a baby. I said as much to her, and she started to cry in earnest, the opposite of the effect I was going for. \u201cThis wil al work out; everything wil be wonderful,\u201d she said, taking my face in her hands. \u201cAnd I hope he or she is just like you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d gone to rehab, lost the baby anyway, came home and started drinking again.</p><p>I lay her on her bed now, turning the lamp on low and folding the comforter over her. There\u2019s probably more I should do, but I have no idea what. She\u2019s getting worse. I know the pattern, know what comes next. We\u2019re almost to her rock bottom, a slow drifting downward until we al slam into the ground. Sometimes, she jerks up momentarily only to crash again. I realize I haven\u2019t seen her sober in days.</p><p>I\u2019ve told myself this is only because I\u2019m not around much, but that\u2019s a lie. Every time she stops drinking, I forget how bad it can be until we get here again.</p><p>She flops onto her back, starts to snore damned heavily for such a smal person. I rol her less than gently back onto her side, not that she notices, and prop pil ows behind her. I don\u2019t want her to puke while she\u2019s on her back. She\u2019d most likely wake up rather than breathe it into her lungs... but I can\u2019t take that chance.</p><p>I sit on the settee facing her bed, my fingers tracing the patterns in the carved teak frame. This is my mother. I would do anything to help her, but there\u2019s nothing. She must hate her life to need this escape so badly. I understand that desire, at least. Just make it numb. Make the failures vanish, from the loss of the baby to her mother\u2019s disappointment to her husband\u2019s withdrawal. And my own disappearing act, from the moment I could pul it off. I don\u2019t know if the misery begets the drinking or the drinking begets the misery. I don\u2019t have a clue where it al started. Al I know is there is no end.</p><p>I wake to my father shaking me. \u201cReid,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can go now.\u201d His mouth is a tight line as he glances at her and back at me. He\u2019s failed her. I\u2019ve failed her. She\u2019s failed herself.</p><p>No end.</p><p>Dori</p><p>When Deb told me to pretend that kiss didn\u2019t happen, it sounded so simple.</p><p>Sometimes I forget my own aversion to lying, and how lying involves pretending not to feel things that I actual y feel.</p><p>Thinking about Colin reminded me of the sensation of having my heart smashed to smithereens, and then trying to pretend that I wasn\u2019t a walking ghost. When he dumped me, it was such an unanticipated end that I moved through my life in a state of shock for days afterward, waiting to wake up. When I final y realized that it wasn\u2019t a nightmare, that it was real, it hurt so much I didn\u2019t think I could survive.</p><p>But I did. And to do so, I had to pretend not to feel it, at least in front of him. In front of my friends and classmates. In front of my parents. And in front of his mother, who for al of her genuine concern and her experience in counseling troubled teens, was clueless to what her own son had done to one of the students right under her nose.</p><p>The key to lying skil ful y is never lie to yourself. And the best way to keep yourself honest internal y is to have one person, someone you trust above everyone else, who holds and protects that secret true thing for you. The thing you have to hide from everyone else. Deb has always been that person for me.</p><p>When I told her about Colin, she nearly came unglued.</p><p>Submerged in her studies as a first-year med student, she\u2019d known I was dating someone, but hadn\u2019t been as available during the time of my brief sexual relationship with him. The entire story, from the magical beginning to the devastating end, was relayed in one conversation.</p><p>My sister has always known how to hold my heart, and her anger at Colin quickly yielded to my need for the empathy only she could provide. \u201cOh, baby girl,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cYou need a pint of java chip and a funny movie. I\u2019l come home the weekend after mid-terms, and we\u2019l do an official exorcism. Gather a stack of photos and anything else you\u2019d like to set fire to, because we\u2019re going to burn that worthless boy right out of your memory. It won\u2019t hurt like this forever. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She was right, of course. Three years later, I can\u2019t remember how it felt to love Colin. I recal the loss of him as though it had happened to someone else\u2014some na\u00efve, reckless girl I\u2019l never be again.</p><p>I hear Reid\u2019s voice just before he comes around the corner, upbeat and friendly as he replies to hel os. He\u2019s here uncharacteristical y early, too, so I haven\u2019t had time to go over the steps in my head that Deb and I discussed, like a last-minute cramming session before an exam.</p><p>One\u2014act like the kiss didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Two\u2014if he al udes to the kiss, shrug it off.</p><p>Three\u2014arrange to work in a separate area.</p><p>Four\u2014don\u2019t get caught alone with him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, this greeting proceeded by the usual coffee aroma that announces his arrival. My addicted caffeine sensors perk up immediately in expectation of the soy latte I know he\u2019s holding, along with a bounce in my heart rate at the sound of his voice.</p><p>My own body is a traitor.</p><p>I turn, smile, take the latte, thank him. Ignore his fingertips brushing over mine. Ignore his beautiful eyes, the dark blue of them intensified by the snug navy t-shirt he\u2019s wearing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are we doing today, boss?\u201d</p><p>Ignore his now-familiar husky morning voice.</p><p>We\u2019re in the master bathroom, in blatant noncompliance of Rule Four. I hear other people in the hal way, but we\u2019re definitely alone. \u201cUm, I think you\u2019re working with Frank today.\u201d My eyes slide away from his.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Okay. See you at lunch, then?\u201d He leaves the room, sipping his coffee, not waiting for an answer.</p> <p>If I didn\u2019t know him, I\u2019d think he\u2019s fol owing Rule One.</p><p>What if he is fol owing Rule One? That makes everything easier for me, right?</p><p>In theory, if Reid pretends we never kissed, it\u2019s easier for me to pretend we never kissed.</p><p>This is what people mean when they use the term in theory.</p><p>Chapter 26</p> <p>REID</p><p>I\u2019m not surprised that Dori\u2019s strategy is to act like nothing happened between us yesterday. Avoidance is a clever method for getting past any type of emotional eruption.</p><p>John and I would never have sustained a friendship this long without turning the occasional blind eye to each other\u2019s assholian outbursts. Dori responded to that kiss with uninhibited abandon, after which the logical part of her brain began screaming for a do-over back to the moment she could have kept it from occurring at al .</p><p>That is not going to happen.</p><p>She wants to pretend I never kissed her. I want a repeat performance. Those goals stand on starkly opposite ends of the spectrum. The first step to pul ing her to my way of thinking is to meet in the middle. I just have to figure out where the hel the middle is.</p><p>The Habitat project is winding to a close. The house is almost finished, and no one is immune to the building anticipation of that completion, which won\u2019t occur until after Dori has departed for Ecuador and I\u2019ve served out my sentence. I have to admit, I sort of want to see it done, see sentence. I have to admit, I sort of want to see it done, see them get the keys. Gabriel e\u2019s parents have been working some hours here and there, so I\u2019ve seen them around, though we haven\u2019t crossed paths while working\u2014I\u2019m sure Roberta made sure of that. So I\u2019m kind of stunned when Mrs. Diego appears next to me before lunch, as I\u2019m emptying a bag of mulch into the shrub and flower borders across the backyard.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Alexander,\u201d she says, her accent thick, meester alisander.</p><p>Since no one was injured when my car plowed through the front of their house, and since the house was a rental and therefore not their property, it wasn\u2019t necessary for the Diegos to be present at court. Regardless, I recognize her immediately from the news reports that surrounded my accident. She\u2019s petite, more so than she looked on TV, standing next to her husband as they were interviewed by multiple news stations, gesturing to the gaping hole in the house behind them and praising God and a shitload of saints that none of their children were injured.</p><p>Her rounded face is weathered, lined more heavily than Mom\u2019s, though I suspect she\u2019s years younger than my mother. This is a woman who\u2019s worked hard al of her adult life, and probably long before that. Her caramel eyes are warm and spirited, though.</p><p>I nod, tossing the empty mulch bag with the others. \u201cMrs.</p><p>Diego.\u201d</p><p>She glances over the flower beds, the pile of mulch I\u2019ve yet to spread around the new plants. \u201cYou are doing a good job. Thank you for helping to build our new home.\u201d For a split second, I\u2019m struck with a sense of self-satisfaction I have no right to feel. But I\u2019m legal y obligated to be here, which of course she knows, so I\u2019m not certain how to respond. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d is al I can think to say.</p><p>She inclines her head, accepting this trivial reply, al owing the two of us to pretend that I\u2019m another philanthropic, Dori-like person, volunteering my hands and muscles to assist in providing a house for a deserving family.</p><p>Lowering myself to the concrete ledge where Dori balances her lunch on her lap and unscrews the lid on a bottle of water, I say quietly, \u201cSo about that kiss...\u201d Inhaling sharply, she turns to me, eyes wide, hands frozen midair with the bottle in one hand and the cap in the other.</p> <p>So much for meeting in the middle.</p><p>I wait while she glances around the yard to make sure we can\u2019t be overheard. \u201cThat was a momentary lapse of...</p><p>o f reason,\u201d she hisses. I smile and she glances around again. If anyone is paying attention, the look on her face would convince them we were plotting a break-in at Fort Knox. Luckily, Dori and I sitting next to each other talking isn\u2019t news, and the back of my head is blocking any head-on paparazzi shots of her expression before she pul s it under control.</p><p>\u201cLast time I checked, kissing wasn\u2019t found on the reason scale,\u201d I say.</p><p>Her lips compress into a hard line, which is a damned shame. I try not to stare at them. Or think about how they felt when I kissed her, which makes me want to stare at them. I concentrate on the faint dusting of freckles across her cheekbones and nose instead, but strangely this only magnifies my craving to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Her jaw clenches. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have happened. We need to pretend that never happened.\u201d I can\u2019t help grinning. \u201cYou mean you need to pretend it never happened.\u201d My gaze slips to her lips, back to her eyes. \u201cI, however, want to try it again.\"</p><p>\u201cWel , I don\u2019t.\u201d The words are snapped off like she\u2019s flicking them at me. She\u2019s got the aloof demeanor down pat</p><p>\u2014eyes narrowed and chin elevated, but the quick pulse beating visibly at the base of her throat gives her away.</p><p>\u201cI think you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDori?\u201d Our heads snap up simultaneously, guiltily, as though we\u2019ve been discovered making out in the middle of lunch. Roberta stands over us, her gaze shifting back and forth between us.</p><p>Dori scrambles up. \u201cYes?\u201d I want to grab her hand, tel her to take a breath and chil , but that would probably have the opposite effect. I can\u2019t hear what Roberta asks, and Dori doesn\u2019t look back as they move towards the back door. I\u2019m nonexistent, or forgotten.</p><p>But no. I know where to look to see if she\u2019s affected. Her ears don\u2019t lie, even if the rest of her is trying its damnedest to.</p><p>Dori</p><p>\u201cAre you al right?\u201d Roberta peers at me through her owl glasses once we\u2019re inside, but her question doesn\u2019t make me uneasy because I\u2019m so relieved to escape Reid\u2019s assertion. I wish I could say it was utterly false, but it isn\u2019t: I think you do. My chest goes tight with the accuracy of it.</p><p>\u201cSure. What do you mean?\u201d My objective is to sound casual, which works right up until mean comes out as more of a squeak than a word. I clear my throat and repeat, \u201cUh, what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>A mosquito buzzes in front of her face and she swats at it while I try to compose myself. \u201cNothing\u2014\u201d she swats again. \u201cIt just seemed\u2014\u201d swatting with both hands \u201c\u2014like the two of you were having a disagreement.\u201d The mosquito buzzes towards me and I clap my hands together, catching it dead center and then running my palms down my denim shorts. Eww, eww, eww. \u201cIs that why you cal ed me inside?\u201d I hedge, turning to grab a disinfecting wipe and scrubbing my hands with it.</p><p>\u201cEr, no.\u201d She walks towards the bedroom serving as her office, tossing back, \u201cI just wanted to double check which day next week is your last. Someone asked me yesterday and I said Tuesday, but it occurred to me that I\u2019m not exactly sure.\u201d</p><p>Could Reid have posed that inquiry? \u201cTuesday is the plan. I leave early Thursday morning, and I thought I should have a day to pack and make sure I\u2019ve got everything in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel ,\u201d she smiles, \u201cEveryone wil certainly miss you.\u201d Everyone?</p><p>At 2:45, I volunteer to go with Gene, who has to make a run to the garden center where we get trees and shrubs.</p><p>Reid wil be gone by the time we return. Not that this fact has anything to do with my offer to tag along.</p><p>Coward, my body says.</p><p>One day down, three to go, my brain says.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re out of here after Tuesday, right?\u201d Dori straightens from rows of plantation blind parts spread across the recently carpeted floor of the living room</p><p>\u2014slats, cords, hardware and tools separated and organized. \u201cCorrect,\u201d she answers, hesitant. She takes her latte from my hand with both of hers, one over the top, one under the bottom, making sure we don\u2019t touch, heedless of what she\u2019s revealing. If she was unaffected when I touch her, she wouldn\u2019t need to avoid the physical contact. I stuff my free hand in my pocket, because that wayward little strand of hair hangs over one of her dark eyes, taunting me with what I did the last time it fel there.</p><p>I decided after her disappearing act yesterday afternoon that I might as wel pul out the big guns, because God knows I\u2019ve got nothing to lose. Four days from now wil be the last I see of her; I can\u2019t imagine our paths ever intersecting again. \u201cSince you\u2019l be busy then with packing and last-minute stuff, let me take you to dinner tonight instead. To thank you for being such a patient overseer.\u201d Dori is one of the smartest girls I\u2019ve ever met, so I know she\u2019l see through the fact that I\u2019m acting as if we\u2019ve already got a date for next week and I\u2019m just repositioning it to be more convenient. She\u2019s not going to fal for it, but I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019l cal me on it.</p><p>She hides behind her hand momentarily, closing her eyes to draw that too-short strand of hair off of her face and tuck it behind her ear. She takes a soft breath before speaking. \u201cI can\u2019t go to dinner with you.\u201d Ah\u2014the simple, no-explanation approach.</p><p>Nope. She\u2019s not getting off that easily.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy VBS kids have a rehearsal tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>She fidgets with her cup lid. \u201cThe program is tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>I take a sip of coffee, stal ing. These are legitimate excuses. Does she expect me to continue asking? I never ask twice, let alone three times.</p><p>\u201cSunday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChurch.\u201d</p><p>Strike three. I can\u2019t help it\u2014I start laughing and she purses her lips and frowns stonily. I tap my chin. \u201cLet me guess. Monday night your friends are seeing you off, and Tuesday, your family has something planned.\u201d She scrapes the cup lid, not meeting my amused gaze.</p><p>Which is just as wel , because I\u2019m feeling as frustrated as I am amused, and I\u2019m not sure how wel my blas\u00e9 guise is holding up. \u201cWednesday,\u201d she says, glancing up. \u201cThe family thing is on Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>Some teasing comment is at the tip of my tongue, but that\u2019s not what emerges. \u201cSo you\u2019re free Tuesday.\u201d She sucks a little air through parted lips. Probably expecting the teasing comment. \u201cTheoretical y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>Her chest is rising and fal ing shal owly, because she\u2019s al owed me to work her right into a corner and we both know it. She\u2019s going to bolt anyway. I see it in her eyes as her brain casts around for a way out of it.</p><p>\u201cDori,\u201d my voice is low, calming, \u201cit\u2019s just dinner, and then you\u2019re off to your life and I\u2019m soon off to mine. Unless you want me to believe that teaching me to paint wal s and instal shelves was oh-so-easy on you.\u201d I smile my most disarming, innocuous smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been a splinter in your pinky for three weeks. C\u2019mon. Make me pay for it.\u201d I want to touch her, my fingers curling inside the pocket of my jeans, but I don\u2019t dare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she nods, it takes every ounce of self-control I have not to pump a fist in the air and say hell yeah. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says, eyeing me. \u201cJust dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner. Tuesday. Good.\u201d I pul my phone from my pocket and get her number and address before she changes her mind, and then I tap the lid of my cup against hers before I go outside. \u201cLater, boss.\u201d</p><p>Dori</p><p>What. Have. I. Done.</p> <p>Chapter 28</p><p>REID</p><p>In the interest of giving Dori less opportunity to back out on tonight, I\u2019ve kept my distance for the past few days. I ate lunch with Frank on Friday and Gabriel e yesterday, while continuing the morning latte delivery, timed for when Dori was occupied with something or someone that distracted her from speaking to me alone.</p><p>Now it\u2019s Tuesday morning, and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s confused.</p><p>This is a perfect execution of my usual game plan: a shifting pattern of advance and retreat, sidestepping any resistance until I get what I want. That\u2019s the problem, though</p> <p>\u2014I stil don\u2019t know what I want beyond a repeat of that kiss, and I seriously doubt any more than that would be possible.</p><p>Maybe Tadd was right, and the mere chal enge of her is the thing that\u2019s messing with my head. There\u2019s something uncontaminated about her, and I don\u2019t even mean sexual y or whatever. I mean the way she is, at her core. Like when you wake up and the world has been blanketed by snow overnight, and not a single footstep or tire track has spoiled the untouched perfection of it.</p><p>Do I want to be that bastard kid who clomps al over the Do I want to be that bastard kid who clomps al over the yard, just because?</p><p>When I arrive, I find Dori easily by her familiar very-patient voice as she demonstrates to Gabriel e how to apply stenciled patterns to her pink wal . \u201cOnce you have the stencil secure, dab this domed brush into the paint, and then onto the wal . But make sure you don\u2019t get too much, or it\u2019l drip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d Gabriel e asks, and Dori nods, watching her.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p> <p>I haven\u2019t spoken or made a sound, but Dori turns slowly, as though I whispered her name. A smal crease appears between her brows as she watches me cross the room.</p><p>Gabriel e turns then, too, skipping up to meet me halfway and bouncing as she pul s up in front of me, hands clasped.</p><p>\u201cOooh, is the one with whipped cream for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Maybe al that sugar wil make you sweeter.\u201d She rol s her eyes and giggles, forever unoffended by anything I say to her.</p><p>Dori seems so reserved in contrast, and I smile down at her as she murmurs her thanks and takes her cup. She forgets to avoid the slide of my fingers against hers... or she chooses not to avoid it. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I say in return.</p><p>I\u2019m halfway down the hal when I hear Dori say my name.</p><p>As I turn, I\u2019m scrambling for a rational argument for why she can\u2019t cancel on me.</p><p>\u201cAre we stil \u2014?\u201d she begins, stopping mid-sentence when I face her.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Of course.\u201d The tone of my voice says I\u2019d maybe</p><p>\u201cYeah. Of course.\u201d The tone of my voice says I\u2019d maybe forgotten the whole thing, when in actuality I\u2019m relieved and switching gears. \u201cSeven okay?\u201d I step closer, look down into her upturned face. The day outside is overcast, darkening the hal way, so I can barely distinguish her pupils from the deep brown of her irises. She glances at the cup in her hand, and I note the thickness of her lashes, long and straight as they feather across the tops of her cheeks, framing her eyes as she looks back up at me.</p><p>\u201cSeven\u2019s good. How... should I dress?\u201d</p><p>I consider her experience with church and school functions, the strict views of proper and inappropriate, dressing up or dressing down. With the exceptions of filming and my recent court appearance, I wear whatever I want, because I just don\u2019t give a shit. Respect should be reserved for the person, not the outfit.</p><p>For my last photo shoot, they put me on a float in a chlorinated pool wearing a Gucci suit, reclining, one pant leg dangling into the water. The suit, worth thousands, was thoroughly ruined by the half-an-hour soak in pool chemicals. Contrast this with the fact that I regularly walk into jacket-and-tie-only restaurants wearing jeans and a tshirt. No one ever says anything other than Right this way, Mr. Alexander. I suspect this is one aspect of celebrity Dori would appreciate.</p><p>\u201cDress however you want,\u201d I tel her. \u201cJust be comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Dori</p><p>Dress however I want? What does that mean?</p><p>I\u2019ve never been too caught up in fashion beyond fol owing whatever social constraints were in place\u2014a modest dress or skirt at church, modest jeans and t-shirts for school. Modest is the adjective most likely to describe any piece of clothing I own, unless blah can be used as an adjective. Not that I want to wear anything provocative to go to dinner with Reid. But I don\u2019t particularly want to look like a street person, either. Photographers fol ow him everywhere. I shouldn\u2019t care, but I do, a little. So on Sunday night, when I surveyed the garments hanging in my closet and stuffed into the armoire I inherited from my grandmother, I felt genuine fear. If I knew his phone number, I\u2019d have texted him right then and canceled.</p><p>Now he\u2019s tel ing me to dress comfortably\u2014however I want. And I seriously have no idea what he means by that.</p><p>What was I thinking, agreeing to this? When I told Deb, she sighed heavily. \u201cBe careful, baby girl. Forget comfortable\u2014</p><p>wear something with a padlock. And leave the key at home.\u201d</p><p>I laughed half-heartedly. No one could see through me like Deb, even from hundreds of miles away. \u201cYeah. I know.\u201d I could cal Aimee and Kayla, but they would hyperventilate at the thought of Reid Alexander taking me to dinner. They would also insist on performing an emergency head-to-toe makeover, and that is not happening. This is not a date. This is just dinner.</p><p>Just. Dinner.</p><p>I\u2019m staring into my closet again, and predictably, nothing has magical y appeared since I looked two nights ago. I\u2019m obsessing and I know it. I tel myself to choose something already and put it on. He doesn\u2019t care what I wear.</p><p>I yank a dress off of a hanger and pul it over my head, and then search through unlabeled shoe boxes for the heeled sandals I wore to graduation. I usual y wear flats with dresses, because if I\u2019m wearing a dress, there\u2019s a 99%</p><p>chance I\u2019m at church, and if I\u2019m at church, I\u2019m helping with anything from nursery duty to passing out Sunday service bul etins. Plus heels aren\u2019t the most comfortable footwear ever invented. After my interminable graduation ceremony, I whined to Mom that enduring a few hours in those things gave me newfound sympathy for those unfortunate Chinese girls with the bound feet. She laughed, said, \u201cWelcome to womanhood,\u201d and gave me a foot massage. I haven\u2019t worn them since, which means they\u2019re stil new and are going to pinch the fudge out of my toes.</p><p>I move to the mirror and check my reflection.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the plain black sleeveless sheath hasn\u2019t turned me into a hottie, even with the strappy black heels.</p><p>The most praise I could give myself is that this is an improvement over my usual grungy construction worker look. I hope.</p><p>I stuff my cel , lip gloss, and my license into the tiny designer knockoff wal et-on-a-strap that Aimee and Kayla brought me from their trip to New York last summer. I usual y carry an enormous canvas bag that holds everything from ibuprofen to a smal pack of crayons, and if necessary, a change of clothes. Dad cal s it my Mary Poppins satchel and amuses himself by asking me if I happen to have a hat rack handy. A guy at school once told people I kept a sleeping bag in there, which is idiotic and I can\u2019t fathom why anyone believed him, but a few people actual y did.</p><p>I haven\u2019t told Mom and Dad what I\u2019m doing tonight yet.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure why I haven\u2019t told them. I\u2019m not afraid they\u2019l forbid me from going\u2014as far as they know, there are no irresponsible deeds in my past, so why would there be any in my future? Not that going to dinner with Reid is irresponsible. Odd, maybe. I look in the mirror one last time before I go downstairs. This is far from the partying outfit some starlet or society girl would wear out, but it\u2019s equal y far from anything I\u2019d typical y wear.</p><p>When my heels strike the worn wood floor at the foot of the stairs, Esther trots around the corner and stops feet from me, ears pricked up, head tilted. Great. My outfit confuses my dog. This doesn\u2019t bode wel for my parents\u2019</p><p>reaction.</p><p>I walk into the kitchen where they\u2019re making dinner, and Dad pauses in his account of a parishioner whose eleven-year-old son was caught sel ing amphetamines at school.</p><p>\u201cNot having dinner with us tonight, pumpkin?\u201d he asks, probably noticing no more about my attire than the fact that I\u2019m wearing shoes.</p><p>Mom isn\u2019t as clueless. Her eyes go a little wide when she turns around. \u201cDori in a dress? And heels? What\u2019s happened? Doug, quick, check the window. Are pigs flying by?\u201d She laughs at her own joke and I rol my eyes at her.</p><p>\u201cSeeing Nick tonight?\u201d she asks slyly.</p><p>I purse my lips. I should have expected that assumption.</p><p>\u201cEr, no, actual y. I\u2019m just, uh, going to dinner with Reid.\u201d They both blink, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cReid? As in Reid Alexander, the movie star?\u201d Mom recovers first.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d My voice is overly bright. I shrug. \u201cHe sort of wanted to apologize\u2014wel , you know, as much as he ever apologizes\u2014for being such a pain the past few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Her left eyebrow crooks up. \u201cReid Alexander, the spoiled movie star, is taking you to dinner to apologize for acting like a spoiled movie star,\u201d she reiterates.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s no other reason he wants to take you on a date...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a date,\u201d I say, too quickly, and her right eyebrow rises to the level of the left one, her eyes scanning me head to toe. \u201cMom, honestly, this outfit is so... so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo unlike something my daughter, Dori, normal y wears?\u201d</p><p>My cheeks warm, and I hope the light is low enough to mask it. Dad\u2019s eyes dart between us. He\u2019s trying to determine whether or not he should be alarmed.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to embarrass myself in front of the spoiled movie star, that\u2019s al .\u201d</p><p>Mom looks at Dad pointedly and he clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think your mother is questioning your motives, pumpkin, just his.\u201d</p><p>Oh my gosh. \u201cWe aren\u2019t exactly celebrity watchers, but you guys must know the type of girl Reid would be interested in that way\u2014and I\u2019m so not like that. It would be humiliating if I even wanted him to feel that way. Trust me, I don\u2019t and he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s just being...nice.\u201d I struggle not to think of that kiss, certain it wil show on my face.</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Dori,\u201d Dad says.</p><p>Their belief that I could be some sort of celebrity-tempting siren is almost humorous. But since I just twisted the truth claiming I\u2019ve never wanted Reid to want me\u2014even if that desire only existed for a few seconds\u2014this line of questioning is anything but funny. \u201cTrust me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe do!\u201d they chorus, just as the doorbel rings, Esther barks, and I jump, one-two-three.</p><p>\u201cOkay, wel , I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t be very late.\u201d As I head for the front door, Mom shoves Dad in my direction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l , er, get the door and meet the young man before you go.

The hel ? I don\u2019t want to marry Dori. I don\u2019t want to marry anyone. Ever. I can\u2019t imagine why I\u2019m bothered to be eliminated from the running for something I don\u2019t want.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>Her hand stil s on the edge of the seat. \u201cOh?\u201d I can\u2019t seem to stop myself. I\u2019ve switched to autopilot. \u201cI think you\u2019d be bored to death with someone too agreeable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think agreeableness is boring?\u201d She arches a</p><p>\u201cSo you think agreeableness is boring?\u201d She arches a brow, as though I\u2019ve just cal ed her boring.</p> <p>I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, in moderation. But in a relationship, a little fire is a good thing.\u201d What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cLike you would know,\u201d she says, and then slaps her hand over her mouth, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d I laugh.</p><p>Through her hands, she says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was a hateful thing to say.\u201d But she\u2019s trying not to laugh at the same time.</p><p>Insulting my capacity to maintain a relationship, hateful?</p><p>Please. That\u2019s probably the least insulting slur she\u2019s thrown at me. \u201cNot unwarranted, though,\u201d I say, stil smiling.</p><p>Her hair is down, drifting over her shoulders\u2014no practical ponytail tonight. The highlights and lowlights I noticed when she walked up behind her dad must be natural, because I can\u2019t imagine her bothering to add them.</p><p>Speaking of practical\u2014her little black dress and the classic-not-trendy heels.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never actual y seen her upper arms before, since the sleeves of her t-shirts hang to her elbows. Her delts and biceps are curved and defined, strong but stil feminine.</p><p>The classic square neckline exposes the lines of her col arbone and the flutter of a pulse at the base of her throat, but isn\u2019t low enough to show any cleavage. The waist nips in just under her ribcage, somewhat fitted. I\u2019m familiar with her legs, of course, though her work shorts actual y show more of them. Not that this says much.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best I could do.\u201d She breaks into my reverie, gesturing to her dress. \u201cI hope we aren\u2019t going anywhere too fancy.\u201d Her hands twist in her lap, and I realize I\u2019ve been staring at her. No one in the history of my dating life has dressed so sensibly and riveted my attention so entirely while doing so.</p><p>\u201cFirst, we look pretty damned coordinated.\u201d I indicate my gray slacks and black shirt. \u201cSecond, I\u2019m used to seeing you in construction boots and a noble t-shirt de jour, most of which are pointedly anti-everything-I-stand-for. Your little black dress is a charming substitute.\u201d She sucks her lip into her mouth and I strive to ignore that token of her uncharacteristic anxiety and the memory it evokes. \u201cI think you\u2019l like where we\u2019re going. No worries, okay?\u201d She nods, the corners of her mouth turning up, just barely, in a tiny indication of trust.</p><p>The restaurant is hole-in-the-wal and below street level, situated just off of a standard strip mal . It\u2019s mom-and-pop Italian, unfrequented by celebrities, so no one is ever expecting to see one. Even if I\u2019m recognized, I can almost hear the No, that can\u2019t be him thought that fol ows. I\u2019ve never brought a date here, because it\u2019s my secret and I don\u2019t want it spoiled.</p><p>The driver drops us at the door, and two minutes later we\u2019re shown to a booth in the corner. This is the best part\u2014</p><p>the booths around the perimeter are enclosed in their own wooden cubicles. The paneled wal s separating each booth extend to the low ceiling and have hinged doors that can be pul ed shut, concealing the interior from other patrons.</p><p>Inside, the ancient paneling is coated in graffiti, sharpied or carved into the wood: M+L always &amp; forever, Katie loves Antonio, Stephanie &amp; Lauren BFFs 4ever!</p><p>Dori sits across from me, her gaze drifting over every detail. A trio of flickering low-wattage \u201ccandle\u201d bulbs inside a beveled-glass hanging lamp casts a soft glow over us both. The waiter steps up to the table with a basket of bread and two glasses of water. He extends the wine list and I take it, asking Dori, \u201cDo you have a preference?\u201d I\u2019m not surprised when she answers, \u201cOh, I\u2019m fine with water,\u201d but it does make me wonder if she ever drinks at al .</p><p>The very proper eighteen-year-old daughter of a pastor. I\u2019m guessing no.</p><p>I hand the list back to the waiter. \u201cNothing tonight.\u201d I can go without for one evening.</p><p>\u201cVery good, sir,\u201d he replies, offering menus and rattling off the specials before asking if we\u2019d like the doors shut while we decide.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd no rush.\u201d He swings the doors shut and we\u2019re treated to additional graffiti\u2014more declarations of love forever, plus a few artistic doodles and an Oscar Wilde quote. \u201cWhat do you think? You look apprehensive.</p><p>Do you want the doors left open?\u201d</p><p>She smiles, and relief washes over me. \u201cNo, leave them closed. It\u2019s cozy. I had no idea this place was here. How did you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents and I used to come often, when I was young.\u201d The owners remember my parents by name, and ask me about them whenever they\u2019re here. Their son runs the place now, so luckily that coincidence is rare.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t ever go out with them now? Do they stil live in LA?\u201d Dori asks, as though she\u2019s reading my mind. Damn.</p><p>\u201cThey do. But my father is a workaholic and my mother\u2019s an alcoholic, so we don\u2019t real y do the family outings anymore.\u201d I take a deep breath after this disclosure, incredulous to have just divulged that level of familial defect.</p><p>Her eyes don\u2019t leave mine, her brow creased, compassion al over her face. This is the sort of expression that usual y infuriates me\u2014and yes, I know who I\u2019m actual y furious with, but that fact doesn\u2019t stop me from lashing out at whatever unfortunate person sits there, daring to think they know how I feel. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she says. For some reason, I believe her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it sucks.\u201d I have to redirect this conversation, now.</p><p>\u201cI take it you and your very nice parents stil do family dinners, etcetera.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty nerdy.\u201d Leaning up, she gets a mischievous look in her eyes and stage-whispers, \u201cWe even have Scrabble night. You almost nailed that one, when you listed the stuff I do with my evenings. Except it\u2019s on Fridays, not Tuesdays.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. \u201cWow. I\u2019m such an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she says noncommittal y. \u201cI have a confession.\u201d Her expression is unwavering, and I instinctively brace myself. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to work so hard over the past month. Or to be so unpretentious and respectful. With, you know, everyone but me.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI was respectful to you! Sort of.\u201d The memory of coaxing her mouth open with my tongue almost knocks the amused expression from my face, and I fight to keep it there. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t, at first. I was a complete dick, and I\u2019m sorry about that. I pegged you as sanctimonious and self-righteous, and I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s stil smirking\u2014a good sign. \u201cWel . I am a little sanctimonious.\u201d</p><p>I smirk back. \u201cNo. You assumed that I\u2019m self-centered.</p><p>Used to getting my way. Dismissive of personal responsibility. And you were right\u2014I am al of those things.\u201d Her expression transforms from humor to something pensive and serious. \u201cIf that\u2019s not who you want to be, al you have to do is choose not to be those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat simple, huh? Al \u2018 Be the change you want to see in the world\u2019?\u201d I feel an undeserved sense of pride when she seems pleased.</p><p>\u201cI think people assume Gandhi wanted everyone to adopt his quest for world peace, and they use that quote with that assumption in mind, rather than the doable urging it was.\u201d Her dark eyes are animated. \u201cFew of us can actual y change the world. We can only change ourselves.</p><p>But if enough people took that to heart, the world would change.\u201d</p><p>A tap sounds on one of the doors, and the waiter leans in, asking, \u201cAre we ready to order?\u201d</p><p>Dori opens her menu, contrite. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I haven\u2019t even looked yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us a few more minutes,\u201d I say, and he disappears with a nod.</p><p>As Dori reads over the menu I memorized years ago, I pretend to do the same, my mind humming. She believes I have the potential to be someone I\u2019ve never been.</p><p>Someone I\u2019ve never wanted to be, or thought possible to be.</p><p>That\u2019s not exactly true. I have wanted it. Last spring, I thought I could be a different guy if I was with Emma. And then she told me she didn\u2019t want someone who needed her in order to be a better guy. She wanted someone who was better by himself, with or without her.</p><p>For the first time, I see her point.</p><p>I\u2019ve known for a very long time that I can\u2019t change anyone else. But I\u2019ve always looked at self-transformation as means-to-an-end, so any change I made was temporary.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid of becoming my workaholic father, but the only thing I\u2019m ever serious about is work. I\u2019m afraid of becoming my alcoholic mother, but the type of drinking I did the night I crashed into the Diego house wasn\u2019t an isolated incident.</p><p>Only hitting a damned house was isolated. Al the other times, when I managed to get myself home without destroying property or kil ing anyone on the way\u2014that was luck.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the ziti here?\u201d Dori asks, glancing up from her menu.</p><p>\u201cHmm? The ziti? It\u2019s good.\u201d I resolve to contemplate this shit later. I only have a couple of hours with this girl, and I don\u2019t want to waste them soul-searching or self-flagel ating. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Plenty of time for that after she leaves town.</p><p>Plenty of time for that after she leaves town.</p><p>We pul up to the curb and she glances at her house, then back at me. The porch lamp is on, shedding a spotlight over the front door, pooling on the concrete space in front of it and spil ing over the cracked steps, the il umination tapering off once it hits the edge of faded lawn.</p><p>This is the sort of pivotal scene I\u2019ve filmed a dozen times</p> <p>\u2014a typical boy delivering a typical girl home just under the curfew wire. It general y plays out in one of two ways. Either the boy lets the girl out of the car with an okay, see ya, or he fol ows her to the door and tries to kiss her goodnight\u2014</p><p>the success or failure of which depends on the script.</p><p>Dori\u2019s dark eyes are impossible to read in the dim interior of the car, but her hands, clasped in her lap, are not.</p><p>As this thought crosses my mind, she loosens them, offering one to me. \u201cThank you for dinner. It was fun and...</p><p>enlightening?\u201d She laughs amiably and I take her smal hand in mine. The moment we touch, her laugh evaporates.</p> <p>\u201cEverything around you is enlightening,\u201d I say cryptical y, not even sure what the hel I mean beyond the fact that knowing her has revealed parts of myself to me that I didn\u2019t know existed. If that isn\u2019t enlightening, I don\u2019t know what is.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she squeezes my hand once before slipping hers from my grasp. She turns toward the door, fingers on the handle. \u201cWel .\u201d She looks over her shoulder with a wry smile and I\u2019m frozen in place. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed tonight, and it feels like it\u2019s lasted half an hour.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Reid. Be good.\u201d Before she can open her door, the driver is there, opening it for her. \u201cOh!\u201d she says, laughing again. \u201cI think it would take me a long time to get used to this.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh snaps me out of my stupor, and while she\u2019s exiting her side, I\u2019m exiting mine, coming around to meet her on the sidewalk. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take as long as you might think,\u201d I say, extending the crook of my elbow. She swal ows visibly, looping her hand through my arm, her fingers cool against my forearm.</p><p>We walk towards the door, and I pul her to a slow stop just outside the edge of il umination. She al ows me to tug her closer, regarding me silently. Even in her heels, she\u2019s a head shorter than me. \u201cWhen you tel me to be good, it makes me want to be good,\u201d I say, hearing the undisguised desire in my voice. I run my fingers through the hair at her temples, taking her face between my palms, and she doesn\u2019t move. \u201cIt also makes me want to be very, very bad.\u201d And then I kiss her.</p><p>Dori</p> <p>When he kisses me, I forget everything\u2014where I am, where we\u2019ve been, and what we\u2019ve said. I forget the fact that I\u2019l never see him again unless I buy a ticket or rent a movie to do so. As I climb the stairs moments later, that truth spil s out from my subconscious in a rush\u2014 I will never see him again. It\u2019s al I can do to remove the key from my bag with shaking fingers, unlock the door and drift through, turning to watch from the darkened entryway as the car pul s away and is gone.</p><p>My head is stil swimming, my face burning at the edges where he touched me with his warm hands as his mouth moved over mine. This time, there was no negotiation, and he wasted no effort with restraint or testing my boundaries.</p><p>Pul ing my body up against his, one arm encircled me as he leaned down. He kissed me gently but deeply, drawing a response that was al hunger and instinct. My hands clutched his shirt, holding on for dear life until he stopped and opened his eyes, his forehead against mine, his breaths echoing mine\u2014ragged and wanting more.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Dori,\u201d he whispered, and my own farewel hung in my throat as his lips grazed my cheek, and then he was walking to the car, never looking back.</p><p>I fear that I\u2019l compare this kiss with every other kiss I wil receive for the rest of my life, an unattainable standard by which to measure future faceless men. Maybe I\u2019m being melodramatic, and the memory of this kiss wil begin to fade tomorrow, or next week, or someday. But tonight, I\u2019m on fire, walking quietly up the staircase to my room, as though my lips are the conductors of every possible significant feeling, and every neurological receptor in my body is flooded with heat.</p><p>Mom and Dad are asleep, the slit of space beneath their bedroom door dark. My bedside lamp is on. The curtains are drawn. Clothes I left in the dryer are now folded and stacked on my dresser; various toiletries cover the top of my desk. Esther waits on my bed, her tail thumping the mattress slowly, like a drum. I run my hand over her silky head and she nuzzles into it, her tongue lol ing out one side head and she nuzzles into it, her tongue lol ing out one side of her mouth. She looks like she\u2019s smiling, this beloved expression of hers one that usual y brings an answering smile to my face.</p><p>Tonight, my lips feel numb. No, not numb. Bereft.</p><p>When he asked me to dinner, he said You\u2019ll be off to your life and I\u2019ll soon be off to mine. No false promises, no option or threat of postponing the oh-so-inevitable end. The dinner, the conversation, the kiss\u2014these were al part of a pleasant but no less certain goodbye. Since the moment I met him, I\u2019ve looked forward to the end of our frustrating association.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s over, he\u2019s gone, and I feel a hol ow place inside, like he\u2019s taken a slice of me with him as a souvenir.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cSo, think you\u2019l do more volunteering after this?\u201d Frank asks as we lay out a recent donation of decorative pavers from the patio to the back gate.</p><p>\u201cAfter my court-ordered penalty is complete, you mean?\u201d The flagstone slabs vary in size. Making a pathway of them consists of what Frank terms puzzle-piecing and I cal guesswork. Frank is usual y easygoing, but when it comes to stone placement, he\u2019d give Dori a run for her perfectionism money. Dammit, I don\u2019t want to think about her. I glare at the cloudless blue sky, removing one glove and using the bottom of my t-shirt to wipe the sweat from my face. LA is enjoying another summer heat wave, and since the saplings we\u2019ve planted amount to tal sticks with very little foliage, there\u2019s zero shade in this yard.</p><p>\u201cDori\u2019s not here, you know,\u201d Frank says.</p><p>My eyes snap to his. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He takes a generous few gulps from his water bottle.</p><p>\u201cYou may be here under court order, but you could have been a bastard about it, could\u2019ve given a lot less effort than you have. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re volunteer enough to go by the title. I\u2019d be happy to have you back.\u201d This echoes what Dori said the night before last. And clearly, I can\u2019t stop thinking of her. \u201cThanks, Frank. That means a lot coming from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Frank dislikes compliments, no matter how vague. Last week, Dori whispered, \u201cWatch this,\u201d after making me promise not to react, and then she told Frank that he looked very handsome in teal. He glanced down at his teal linen shirt and blushed, mumbling something resembling,</p><p>\u201cMmmph,\u201d before bul eting to the other side of the patio.</p><p>Dori turned back to me with the naughtiest look ever on her face. With effort, we suppressed our laughter as I fought to disregard the desire to pul her onto my lap and kiss her.</p><p>Shit. Stop thinking about her already. I\u2019m almost out of here. This day and one more.</p><p>\u201cVolunteering for real\u2014I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s possible,\u201d I tel him, recal ing my conversation with Larry a few weeks ago about doing manual labor charity work, when I retorted something along the lines of no way in hell. Wow. I\u2019m a grade-A dick.</p><p>Tomorrow is my last day at the Diego house, and George cal ed last night to let me know that production has moved the dates up on my Vancouver project. I\u2019l be on location in three weeks\u2014the day before Dori returns from Ecuador. I have less than a month to beef up and pack on the last five pounds of the twenty I promised to add in order to land the role. George warned me that the director and some of the production team were against hiring me because they wanted the character to be older and bigger, but the guys financing the film wanted my name in the credits. Money talks, but if I screw this up, I could depreciate my future value and seriously lessen the chances of anyone giving me another shot at a film like this one.</p><p>To that end, Olaf has promised to kil me starting this weekend. Awesome. If nothing else, maybe I\u2019l be able to get some sleep after he shreds me every day. I tossed and turned so much last night that I found myself up at 4 a.m.</p><p>Googling Vancouver\u2019s weather, popular attractions and hot night spots... and then Quito\u2019s weather, topography, possible safety issues and time zone (two hours ahead of LA and Vancouver, which are the same).</p><p>I\u2019ve got to get this girl out of my head. I need time and distance, and I\u2019m about to get both. Despite how she responded to me physical y, despite this insistent pul towards her that I\u2019m trying (and failing) to brush aside, she knows and I know that we would never work. Everything about us is different\u2014every damned thing. I\u2019ve never given a shit about that before. I\u2019ve never thought about that before. When you\u2019re hooking up with a girl, al that matters is what she looks like and how fast and hard she\u2019l put out.</p><p>Who cares about her past, her beliefs, her aspirations.</p><p>Who cares if she has kind eyes or endless patience or the ability to put the needs of everyone on the goddamned planet ahead of her own.</p><p>We\u2019re not a mile away from the house when we pass Gabriel e on the side of the road, standing in front of her piece of crap Cutlass\u2014smoke pouring from under the hood and hazards flashing. Some guy in a truck has pul ed over in front of her car. He looks about twenty-five and I don\u2019t recognize him. \u201cHey Luis, pul a U-turn, man. I know that girl back there.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel e\u2019s eyes widen when she sees the Mercedes pul up behind her car. As I exit, the guy standing next to her glares at me with undisguised loathing. He\u2019s dressed and tattooed like a gangbanger, which doesn\u2019t preclude him from knowing her, but I suspect he\u2019s a complete stranger who only stopped to help a hot girl into his car. \u201cCar trouble?\u201d I say, ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It does this every month or so, no biggie.\u201d She shrugs, noticeably embarrassed. This car isn\u2019t just a late model, it\u2019s ancient. Unlike one of my dad\u2019s cars\u2014a pristine 1968 Mercedes 280S\u2014this Olds Cutlass, at least a decade younger, hasn\u2019t been wel -cared for. There are rust spots in the doors and sidewal s, the headliner is hanging down like curtain swags, and the tires are too bald to be remotely safe. The fact that it\u2019s not running isn\u2019t much of a shock.</p><p>\u201cSo... is your mom or dad coming to get you? Or a friend?\u201d I ask. Her would-be rescuer stands there regarding me icily, and I\u2019m al kinds of glad Luis is in the car behind us.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t answering their phones. They don\u2019t always</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t answering their phones. They don\u2019t always get reception at work...\u201d She shrugs.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon then. I\u2019l give you a ride home.\u201d</p><p>She grins ear-to-ear, but then her smile falters. \u201cUm, I promised my little brothers I\u2019d pick them up early from daycare and take them for ice cream. I guess... they can just stay \u2019til Mama or Papa picks them up...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIce cream sounds good after today. If you guys don\u2019t mind being stuck in the car with me. I\u2019m sweaty as hel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this pendejo?\u201d Ah, so her roadside companion speaks\u2014if only to cal me an asshole.</p><p>One hand on her hip, Gabriel e answers him in Spanish, which I understand just wel enough to know I\u2019d better steer her to the car before she gets bitch-slapped. \u201cThanks for stopping, man,\u201d I tel him while taking Gabriel e by the arm and quickly directing her into the back seat.</p><p>An hour later, her car\u2019s been towed and we\u2019ve got the twins in the car. Since they\u2019re nine, they\u2019re way more impressed that they can make faces through the dark-tinted windows that other drivers can\u2019t see than the fact that I\u2019m a movie star. They\u2019re also awed by the fact that I\u2019ve got a guy to drive me around wherever I want to go; their sister better comprehends the way I miss my own wheels.</p> <p>Gabriel e directs Luis to an ice cream shop in her old neighborhood and the boys go into raptures when I tel them to get whatever they want. I don\u2019t think the words get whatever you want have ever been uttered to them before. It takes them a ful ten minutes of discussion to decide what to get, and since we\u2019re the only customers, the woman behind the counter takes the break to watch entertainment news on a tiny television by the register. One of the commentators says my name and I feign inattentiveness as the clerk glances between me and my image on the tiny screen. Final y she stares at me, mouth slightly ajar and eyebrows elevated to the level of her pink visor, and I smile at her. When we leave, she\u2019s grabbing up her cel and taking photos of our retreating backsides.</p><p>Luis raises an eyebrow when we exit, the boys with what looks like quart-sized cartons each, and Gabriel e and I each holding an overloaded cone. \u201cDinner is official y spoiled,\u201d I tel her as one of her brothers cal s shotgun and the other squeezes between us in the back seat. \u201cYour mother is going to kil me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel e smiles prettily. \u201cNo, she won\u2019t. Mama likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I\u2019m taken by surprise, even though Mrs. Diego thanked me for working on the house just a couple of days ago. I mean Jesus, I ran into her house with my car. \u201cMust be my infamous charm and good looks.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and shakes her head. \u201cShe says you\u2019re a hard worker. That\u2019s the only thing that ever impresses Mama.\u201d</p> <p>Dori</p><p>I was in line for airport security at 7:00 a.m. for the flight to Miami, and from there, I caught my connection to Quito. I\u2019ve made this trip twice before\u2014each of the past two summers</p><p>\u2014but having experience in LA-to-Quito travel doesn\u2019t make the thirteen-hour trip feel any shorter. It\u2019s almost midnight by the time I get settled into the women\u2019s dormitory, and I\u2019l probably be lucky to get five hours of sleep before it\u2019s time to get up.</p><p>There\u2019s always a lot to be done. Children in Quito are sent into the city in droves to beg or shine shoes to help support their families. My first year here, we refurbished a school and organized learning activities with children whose parents spared them from a few days of work. I asked one group of little boys whether they attended school during the regular school year. Al of them said no, but some had siblings who did. When I asked why some of their siblings were al owed to go and they weren\u2019t, one replied, \u201cMy sister is smart, so she goes to school and we work.\u201d It broke my heart. These kids were exceedingly bright, but they were al resigned to the impression that they weren\u2019t.</p><p>In some ways, returning last year was even more depressing. We\u2019d made an impact that first year I volunteered, and returning a year later to find nothing improved made me want to scream with frustration. I\u2019d never ful y understood my parents and Deb when they talked about social progress in terms of two steps up, one step back\u2014sometimes two. Deflated, I cal ed Deb in San Diego, where she was doing a summer research internship before her last year of med school.</p><p>\u201cDori, smal gains are stil gains. Sweeping changes occur over time. They\u2019re hardly noticeable while they\u2019re occurring. Think about the difference thirty, forty, or a hundred years have made in things like race relations, animal testing, or recognition of addiction as a disease.\u201d Her rational words calmed me, but couldn\u2019t stop the whine that seeped into my voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d She chuckled softly. \u201cI know, sweetie. But the world doesn\u2019t operate on fairness. You know that as wel as I do.\u201d Talking to Deb can be like having your hand held while you swal ow nasty-tasting medicine or get a shot. She can\u2019t make the bad stuff go away, but she makes it easier to take. \u201cIf you want to make a difference eventual y, you just keep on.\u201d</p> <p>I heeded her advice then and over the past year, and here I am in Ecuador for a third time, more prepared for the conditions I\u2019l find and ready to tackle them.</p><p>Using this time to overcome the reckless feelings I\u2019ve developed for Reid is something else I have to do. I vow to return to LA in a more rational frame of mind, because over the past 48 hours I\u2019ve done little but recal abstracts of him like a series of film clips: His disdain the morning I met him.</p><p>His sarcasm and charm, and the unsettling way they combined to make him impossible to ignore. The pride on his face when he finished the shelves. The surprise in his eyes when he blurted out the truth about his parents over dinner. The gentleness of his kiss.</p><p>Once I get through customs, I\u2019m met by Ana Diaz, a missionary who resides here year-round, trying to reach and educate as many Ecuadorian kids as possible.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, Dori,\u201d she says, hugging me.</p><p>By 1:00 a.m., I\u2019m staring at the bottom of the bunk above By 1:00 a.m., I\u2019m staring at the bottom of the bunk above me, restless and awake, surrounded by the soft, slumbering breaths of the women I\u2019l meet tomorrow. I could blame my sleeplessness on the cold\u2014the nighttime temps in Quito are around fifty degrees year-round\u2014but I\u2019m not dense enough to think a bit of a chil would keep me from sleeping after this exhausting day.</p><p>The truth is, I\u2019m sufficiently warm, recal ing Reid\u2019s fingers playing through my hair, holding my face and trailing down my bare arms, his mouth on mine. The sensations that warm me are the same delicious sensations responsible for my insomnia, but my mind refuses to meditate on something else, anything else. For tonight, I surrender, my hands restless under blankets softened and worn from use.</p><p>Tomorrow wil be soon enough to begin erasing him.</p> <p>Chapter 31</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain about this?\u201d I can\u2019t recal Dad ever looking at me with such an incredulous expression, and believe me, I\u2019ve witnessed incredulity on his face a mil ion times.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Saturday mornings, my father is in his home office, catching up on whatever work he didn\u2019t vanquish in his sixty-hour work week. The idea that Mom or I would disturb him before noon is inconceivable, since we\u2019re usual y asleep. So when I knocked on his door at 9:00 a.m., he seemed disconcerted by my appearance. Then I told him I had a financial matter to discuss, apart from our monthly consultations over my expenditures and investments. He regained his composure quickly, obviously expecting me to request additional cash because I\u2019d run through my al otted spending money ahead of schedule.</p><p>Instead, I told him I wanted three cars purchased and delivered to the Diegos, anonymously, on the day they get the keys to their house.</p><p>\u201cBut the anonymity...\u201d he says, brows drawn together.</p><p>\u201cNo PR? No tax break? It\u2019s a significant financial output for no personal advantage.\u201d</p><p>His tone says he\u2019l do what I want, even if he\u2019s baffled by the uncharacteristic request. It\u2019s my money, after al ; he just manages it for me, since I\u2019ve never taken much interest in anything beyond spending it. \u201cIt has to be anonymous. And you just described most of my expenditures, when it comes down to it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles in spite of himself. \u201cPoint taken.\u201d He frowns one final time. \u201cAnd this has nothing to do with the girl.\u201d I smirk. \u201cDad, what exactly are you suggesting?\u201d He huffs a breath through his nose and scowls, his gaze never leaving my face, ever the legal eagle. \u201cI think you know damned wel what I\u2019m suggesting, Reid. I usual y overlook your... indiscretions... but the Diego girl is underage.\u201d</p><p>Deep breath, in and out, through my teeth. \u201cYes, I got the idea after seeing firsthand the unreliable piece of crap she\u2019s driving around LA.\u201d I hold up a hand to silence him.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want any of them to know about my connection to this, so it can hardly be used as bait. As out of character as this may seem to you, it\u2019s something I want to do.</p><p>Reparation for the harm I caused. Humor me.\u201d He\u2019s silent for a moment, after which he shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into you, but al right. These are the vehicles you want?\u201d He points to his monitor, where he\u2019s pul ed up the links I sent last night.</p><p>\u201cYeah. John and I built them online to confirm which features were available, so those are the exact specs.</p><p>They\u2019re al reliable, but not flashy.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re al reliable, but not flashy.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cFlashy wouldn\u2019t do them any favors in their part of town. I\u2019l request al available security components as wel , to discourage theft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d I stand up to leave, but turn back.</p><p>\u201cNeedless to say, don\u2019t tel Larry. Don\u2019t even tel George, just in case. I think he\u2019d play along, but... better to keep this between you and me, I think.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me with that same incredulous expression. \u201cAl right.\u201d</p><p>I turn and leave his office, wondering why it took me so long to discover this sort of high. The month with Habitat affected me more than I thought.</p><p>Dori</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as difficult to get hold of as I am these days.\u201d Deb laughs. Hers is the first phone cal I\u2019ve had since Mom and Dad cal ed me last weekend. We\u2019ve been playing phone tag for the past 24 hours, and I\u2019d almost given up having an actual conversation with her. Quito and Indianapolis are only an hour off, but she works al night and I work al day, our times overlapping at both ends. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Perfect timing. I\u2019m sitting on my bunk, sifting through sheet music for this afternoon. \u201cReal y wel . I\u2019ve got an enthusiastic group this year\u2014I\u2019m teaching them songs that help them learn math concepts. They\u2019re al so smart! But here\u2019s the coolest thing\u2014I\u2019ve been tutoring a couple of girls close to my age in English and math.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to keep the excitement out of my voice. \u201cWhen I met them two weeks ago, they both assumed they\u2019d drop out of school weeks ago, they both assumed they\u2019d drop out of school soon to get married or start working ful -time. Now, one is determined to at least finish high school, and the other is talking about going to college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome, Dori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m making a tangible difference this time.\u201d My bunkmate comes in then, climbs the ladder to the top bunk, and col apses with a moan. She\u2019s Mom\u2019s age and arrived in Ecuador the night before last with a group of women from her church in Oklahoma. \u201cEverything okay, Gina?\u201d I cal up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAaaaugh... this altitude is killing me.\u201d She leans over, peering at me from her upside-down position. \u201cAre you talking to your sister? Did you ask if she has any recommendations for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would tel you the same thing I told you yesterday.</p><p>No over-exertion and lots of fluids.\u201d Deb chuckles in my ear.</p><p>People\u2014from friends and family to complete strangers\u2014</p> <p>have been asking her for medical advice since she began med school. \u201cYou\u2019l feel fine in a day or so.\u201d Gina flops back onto her bed. \u201cGod, I hope so. This is not cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to study medicine?\u201d Deb asks, stil chuckling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive,\u201d I whisper, hoping Gina wil go to sleep instead of butting in on what wil probably be my only conversation with my sister while I\u2019m in Ecuador. \u201cNow, let\u2019s talk about you. Have you and Bradford progressed from making out in parking lots yet?\u201d</p><p>The smile in her voice remains when she answers. \u201cOh, maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeborah Cantrel ,\u201d I say, struggling to keep my voice low. \u201cWhat are you hinting at? You sound absolutely guilt-ridden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tel ing you first, and then Mom and Dad, and then Sylvie...\u201d Sylvie is Deb\u2019s best friend from col ege. She married her col ege boyfriend, has a two-year-old and another on the way, and has been setting Deb up with every eligible friend of her husband\u2019s for years. None of them have worked out, and a couple of them are only summoned to be witty anecdotes when she and her female med school friends discuss relationship-hunting fails.</p><p>\u201cWel this sounds promising... wait. Deb. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe proposed last night.\u201d</p><p>I forget to whisper. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Gina hangs down. \u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe proposed? But you\u2019ve only known him a few weeks!\u201d I say, and Gina\u2019s eyes go round as she makes an excited eeeeeeeeee sound. I want to knock her on the forehead so I can share this moment with my sister, alone, but of course I don\u2019t.</p> <p>Deb\u2019s reply is calm, unperturbed after my outburst.</p><p>Expecting it, probably. \u201cDori, I know what you\u2019re worried about\u2014whether or not I\u2019m sure. I am. I\u2019ve never been so sure of anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh.\u201d My eyes tear up, but I\u2019m smiling, and Gina is grinning ecstatical y, stil upside-down. A tear snakes down my cheek and I wipe it away. Gina disappears momentarily and reappears with a tissue. \u201cHave you worked it out with hospital administration? When do I get to meet him?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure how to reveal it or what it might mean once we do. No one at the hospital knows yet except a close friend of his and one of the nurses\u2014who caught us kissing in an empty room.\u201d She giggles, and I\u2019m struck again by how sixteen she\u2019s sounded since this man came into her life. \u201cThat was the first time he said he loved me. When she came in, I tried to pul away, but he held tight, smiled and said, \u2018Marta, have you met the woman I\u2019ve fal en in love with?\u2019 She stared at us a minute and then said,</p><p>\u2018Wel , I knew something was going on, doctor. You\u2019ve been so pleasant for the past few weeks that we figured you were either in love or dying. Glad to know it\u2019s the former.\u2019</p><p>We swore her to secrecy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m laughing and crying at the same time, and strangely, so is Gina, who hands me another tissue while she mops her eyes with her own. \u201cWow,\u201d I say, stunned.</p><p>\u201cI have a couple of days in a row off in September, so we\u2019re planning to make a quick trip home then. I assume you can make it home from Berkeley for an evening?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHeck, yes. I wouldn\u2019t miss it. When are you tel ing Mom and Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we hang up, I\u2019m cal ing them. But first, how are you doing with the Reid Alexander situation? Is the distance helping?\u201d Hearing his name is a jolt.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine. Haven\u2019t thought of him much at al .\u201d I\u2019m crossing my fingers under my leg.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard from him, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Like he predicted\u2014he\u2019s gone back to his life, and I\u2019ve gone on with mine. \u201cOut of sight, out of mind.\u201d My voice rings falsely impassive in my ears.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine any boy being stupid enough to put you out of his mind so easily, baby girl. Even him.\u201d I\u2019m real y glad that Gina, who\u2019s stil eavesdropping shamelessly, can\u2019t hear Deb\u2019s portion of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWel , thanks. But I think they\u2019re al kind of the same.\u201d Deb knows I\u2019m referring to Colin.</p><p>\u201cNo, they aren\u2019t, but guys like Brad are rare. It took me twenty-six years to find him, and look how far from home I had to go. What if I\u2019d done my internship elsewhere? We\u2019d have never met. Brad and I were meant to be.\u201d I turn onto my side, repressing words I\u2019ve said to Deb before, words I wil not repeat now because I\u2019m determined not to take anything away from her happiness. I know Deb believes that God brought Brad to her. That they were fated to be. But if this is so, then were Colin and I fated? Was what he did to me meant to be? Or perhaps he was a test that I failed, foolishly trusting a boy who exploited some inadequacy that made me blind to reality.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe either of these. What happened with Colin was simply a failure to heed my own common sense. I made a mistake in judgment, and I paid for it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you found each other, Deb,\u201d I tel her, turning onto my back. \u201cI hope you\u2019l be real y happy.\u201d She sighs blissful y. \u201cWe already are. It\u2019s almost too much joy.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and smile. \u201cNo such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right. You can probably expect a giddy cal from Mom soon. I think she thought I was al ergic to boys\u2014</p><p>or they were al ergic to me. I love you, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, and I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d When we hang up, it seems that Gina has forgotten her altitude sickness for the time being. She tel s me she\u2019s a hopeless romantic who drives her husband crazy buying every romantic movie ever made. \u201cI think I\u2019ve watched The Notebook about a thousand times,\u201d she confesses, without even a hint of embarrassment. \u201cI want to hear al about your sister and her new fianc\u00e9, but first\u2014who is this boy you left behind? Was it a breakup? Not because of your volunteer efforts here, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. We only went out once. It was nothing.\u201d I\u2019m crossing my fingers under my leg again, though I\u2019ve spoken nothing but truth.</p><p>\u201cNot meant to be, then,\u201d Gina says, and it takes al the control I can manage not to rol my eyes. Holy cow, you\u2019d think people never made their own decisions about anything, weren\u2019t in control of any direction their lives took.</p><p>\u201cYep. Not meant to be.\u201d I force myself to uncross my fingers. Nothing I\u2019m saying is a lie or a fib or even a disputed truth. Whether or not my life is orchestrated by God or some form of fate or nothing but the choices Reid and I make individual y or together, we\u2019re not meant to be.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>REID</p><p>In three days, I\u2019m leaving for Vancouver, a two-hour flight away. I could jump back to LA often during the next three months if I wanted to, but barring any emergencies, there\u2019s no reason to bother. I need a break from everything here. I definitely need a break from my best friend, who\u2019s walking the ragged edge of shit-for-brains-annoying at the moment.</p><p>\u201cLook, I can\u2019t maintain the kind of muscle I\u2019ve been adding while drinking and getting high every night. I thought you got that.\u201d I\u2019ve tried to explain this to John multiple times in the past several days, but he\u2019s smashed and missing al of my drop-it cues. We just got back to his place from a party, the first one we\u2019ve left together this week.</p><p>\u201cI know, I hear you. It\u2019s just... you\u2019re just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not only cutting back on alcohol or whatever.</p><p>You\u2019ve been crashing here for the past week, and not only are you almost always stone-cold sober, which is kind of a damned drag, you haven\u2019t brought a girl back with you at al . Not once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cNothing, man. But you aren\u2019t yourself.\u201d Sometimes my best friend seems perceptive, though I\u2019m never sure how much of his insight is actual comprehension and how much is guesstimated bul shit. We don\u2019t have what you\u2019d cal a dig-deep sort of relationship. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m trying to develop some self-control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, man\u2014 no alcohol, no weed, no girls? What the hel is this? It\u2019s like you\u2019re someone else. I usual y work just to keep up with you, and now I\u2019m drinking alone ninety percent of the time,\u201d he gestures to my Perrier with his beer, \u201cand I\u2019m stoned by myself, and the only thing you\u2019re screwing with is my head.\u201d</p><p>I give him half a smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, John? You wanna break up with me?\u201d</p><p>He laughs and shakes his hair out of his eyes. \u201cNo man, the bromance is stil hot as ever.\u201d He eyes me for a moment. \u201cOh, no way. It\u2019s that Dori chick, isn\u2019t it? You never screwed her, did you?\u201d</p><p>My gaze narrows, fingers digging into my leg. \u201cDon\u2019t go there, man.\u201d</p><p>He sits up and points at me, grinning. \u201cThat\u2019s it! The last time we talked about her, you were just gonna do her and get over it. Don\u2019t tel me you grew a conscience because of her little do-gooding act.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe we ever had that conversation, that I ever said something like that to John about Dori, but I know I probably did. I\u2019m sure I was drunk and talking shit\u2014a lifetime ago. Before I kissed her. Before I stopped being a complete prick long enough to know her at al . \u201cI\u2019m serious, John. Shut up.\u201d</p><p>He takes a drag from his cigarette and I think he\u2019s going to comply. No such luck. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, dude\u2014you\u2019ve got a couple more days in LA. Look her up, throw a bag over her head or whatever, and screw her respectable brains out so you can get back to normal.\u201d</p><p>The combination of John being hammered and me being the farthest thing from it curbs my temper just enough not to beat the ever-loving shit out of him, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from yanking him up by his shirtfront and slamming him back into his chair so hard his head snaps back. \u201cDon\u2019t ever fucking talk about her like that again. I mean it, John.</p><p>Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, man, okay. Shit. Chil . I\u2019m s-sorry,\u201d he stutters, eyes wide and startled, hands up in surrender. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Shit, Reid. I get it.\u201d</p><p>I straighten, shaking, run a hand through my hair as I turn away from him. He\u2019s right about one thing. I\u2019m not myself.</p><p>Dori</p><p>My flight was delayed half an hour because of a freakishly torrential but fast-moving rainstorm, but I\u2019m not worried about missing my connection because the layover wil stil be over two hours. Plenty of time to get through customs in Miami and make the flight to LA\u2014I hope. By 9:00 tonight I\u2019l be home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The past three weeks have been chal enging, but not in the usual way. I final y hit my stride this time, from speaking understandable Spanish to the locals to making concrete changes in the lives of the kids there. We persuaded a few parents to let their children attend school this fal instead of wasting their days soliciting change from tourists for shoe shines that blacken their hands with polish and offer them no hope for a future. And then there are the girls I tutored, who swore they\u2019d email and keep me updated on their progress.</p><p>The biggest chal enge has been banishing Reid from my thoughts. There were times during that last week when I was so busy and focused that I didn\u2019t think of him al day, but that changed the moment I fel into my bunk and burrowed under the blankets at night. There was nothing I could do to keep him out of my head when I shut my eyes. I know I\u2019l get past missing him. His teasing and our tongue-in-cheek debates became a habit, that\u2019s al \u2014an exasperating, stimulating, and infuriatingly enjoyable habit. I don\u2019t know what his motivation was for kissing me, beyond the fact that he seems to do the same with a lot of girls. I don\u2019t think he meant to be cruel, though kissing him revived a long-buried hunger in me.</p><p>When we land, there\u2019s an announcement, and I think I hear my name inside a flurry of instructions, but the words are inaudible because everyone is talking and unbuckling and there\u2019s a baby crying in the row ahead of me. She\u2019s teething, so she cried most of the trip. I\u2019ve never been so ready to get off of a flight. I\u2019l be home in\u2014ugh\u2014seven hours.</p><p>From my place in the next-to-last row, it takes forever to deplane. Before I exit, I stop to ask a flight attendant,</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me, I think I heard my name during the announcement? I\u2019m not sure. I was near the baby.\u201d She gives me a rueful smile. \u201cI understand.\u201d She asks another flight attendant about the announcement, and he turns to me.</p><p>\u201cMs. Cantrel ?\u201d</p><p>I get a creeping sensation when it occurs to me that having a message delivered at the end of a flight probably isn\u2019t a good thing. \u201cYes...?\u201d</p><p>He smiles reassuringly. \u201cAs you exit the jet bridge, there wil be an agent waiting for you, wearing a plaid jacket.</p><p>Please speak with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, okay. Should I be worried?\u201d</p><p>The helpful expression on his face never changes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we aren\u2019t privy to that information\u2014you\u2019l need to ask her.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m the last passenger off of the plane. The agent is waiting for me as promised, her expression identical to the flight attendant\u2019s. I don\u2019t feel reassured. The creeping sensation has become a slow, stomach-churning fear.</p><p>\u201cDorcas Cantrel ?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d My breath\u2019s gone shal ow.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Ms. Cantrel , I\u2019m Lucia. Your family contacted the airline this morning while you were en route.</p> <p>There\u2019s been an emergency of some kind, and we need to reroute you to Indianapolis, instead of Los Angeles. I assume this is acceptable to you?\u201d</p><p>I nod. The bottom has dropped out of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat emergency?\u201d Indianapolis. Deb.</p><p>The agent takes the handle of my wheeled bag and motions for me to fol ow. \u201cLet\u2019s walk while we talk, because we need to get you through customs as quickly as possible.</p><p>First things first\u2014there are no direct flights to Indianapolis from Miami this evening, but we can connect you through Dal as and get you there by 10:30. Is this acceptable, or would you prefer to wait until tomorrow morning, and fly direct?\u201d</p><p>My feet are moving, fol owing the agent\u2019s clip-clopping steps as she pul s my bag to the line at customs, but I can\u2019t feel anything. My whole body has gone numb. What kind of emergency would require me to go to Indianapolis? \u201cI... I can do the connection,\u201d I answer, my mouth dry.</p><p>\u201cVery good. Wait here, I\u2019m going to see if I can get you moved up so we can get you through this line sooner. Your flight is boarding in five minutes.\u201d She hurries away, and I stand where she left me, shuffling forward in the line no more than three feet while she\u2019s gone. I pul my cel phone out and turn it on. I cal Dad\u2019s number. It goes straight to voicemail and I hang up. Mom\u2019s does as wel , and Deb\u2019s.</p><p>My heart is pounding and I\u2019m just concentrating on breathing and standing and not freaking out.</p> <p>The agent returns, taking my bag, moving me from the back of one line to the front of another. I\u2019m only vaguely aware of the other passengers\u2019 stares and speculations.</p><p>I\u2019m asked if I have anything to declare and I say no. My bags are examined, and I\u2019m through customs in record time. \u201cThe emergency? What is it?\u201d I ask as we board a motorized cart and she gives the gate number to the driver.</p><p>\u201cI have very little information, but here\u2019s what I was told: your sister has had an accident. She\u2019s in the hospital, in critical condition. Your parents are en route to Indianapolis now, and someone wil meet you when you land at IND.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn accident? Like, a car accident? What kind of accident?\u201d</p><p>She places her hand on my shoulder and looks in my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, honey. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s al the information I got at this end. I wasn\u2019t even given the name of the hospital. Your job right now is to stay calm. I\u2019m going to give you your new flight numbers and such, but don\u2019t worry, we\u2019l give you a printout with everything on it...\u201d She\u2019s tel ing me gates and flights and times and I can\u2019t absorb any of it. Deb wil be fine. She\u2019s young and strong and healthy. She always wears her seatbelt and her car has airbags al over the place and that thing that cal s in an accident for you if you\u2019re unconscious. Critical condition means she\u2019s alive, and I\u2019m focusing on that.</p><p>The agent and flight attendants essential y put me on the plane to Dal as and al but buckle me in. I have a boarding pass for my flight from Dal as to Indianapolis, with only an hour between flights. I feel like a zombie, and I\u2019m sure I look like one to everyone around me, but it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>My sister is alive, and she\u2019s going to be fine. This wil be my mantra for the next six hours.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>REID</p><p>Vancouver is exactly the change I need. Given the different atmosphere for this film, the older starring group (I\u2019m the youngest cast member), the physical demands of the stunts I\u2019m doing and the muscle I have to maintain, I\u2019ve decided to do something I haven\u2019t done since I was fourteen. Not that it was a choice then, just the typical restrictions of childhood.</p><p>While I\u2019m on location, I\u2019m going to abstain. From everything.</p><p>Alcohol, weed, pil s, sex.</p><p>While Olaf and I were adding that last five pounds, I only got high once, and I cut back on drinking solely to survive his torture sessions. (If he suspected me of drinking the night before a workout, he practical y kil ed me in the weight room.) As for sex, I haven\u2019t been with a girl since I kissed Dori. In some twisted way, this fact is like purposeful y leaving a sweet taste in my mouth. Instead of my usual hookups, which are at best quick and dirty and done just sober enough to recal them, I have a graphical y clear memory of her soft lips opening under mine. That thought in mind, I may set a record over this time period for whacking off, from which I wil not be abstaining, for obvious reasons.</p><p>The film we\u2019re doing is an action thril er plus love story, the script reading like a Guy Ritchie/Nicholas Sparks mash-up. My character\u2019s romantic interest is being played by Chelsea Radin, who\u2019s drop-dead hot and twenty-seven.</p><p>Both characters are \u201capproximately twenty-three,\u201d so while I\u2019m playing up, she\u2019s playing down. Hol ywood, yeah? We\u2019re on our third day of filming, and the cast is grabbing lunch from craft services when she turns to me and says, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re nothing like what I expected, from al the rumors.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m picking through sandwiches, trying to avoid the tuna because we have our first kissing scene coming up after lunch. Turning to her, holding a turkey on whole wheat that would make Olaf proud, I say, \u201cOh? What were you expecting?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cNot that I presumed you\u2019d hit on me or anything, but you\u2019re portrayed as this sort of evil, virtue-slaying playboy, and I haven\u2019t seen any evidence of that.</p><p>Yet.\u201d</p><p>I choke a little on the wedge of sandwich I\u2019ve just bitten into, and she slams her palm on my back until I can breathe again. I give her a half-grin. \u201cChelsea, don\u2019t you know you can\u2019t trust everything you read on the Internet?\u201d She shakes her head, her short dark hair flipping back and forth. \u201cPhotos, baby. Lots of photos. Lots of girls. My husband was actual y a little concerned when they gave you the role.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cUm, no offense, but you\u2019re safe.\u201d Damn, she\u2019s I laugh. \u201cUm, no offense, but you\u2019re safe.\u201d Damn, she\u2019s pretty up close.</p><p>She frowns. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so relieved and so insulted al at one time.\u201d Tilting her head, she peers at me like I\u2019m a map and she\u2019s looking for directions. \u201cSo who\u2019s the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>She takes a sip of her diet cola and begins picking through the sandwiches. \u201cThe girl responsible for this transformation from virgin-eradicator to choir boy.\u201d This train of thought conjures Dori, images of her flashing through my mind rapidly like a slideshow on speed.</p><p>She should be back in LA tonight, and in a couple of weeks, she\u2019l be at Berkeley, studying to advance from amateur to professional do-gooder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no choir boy, and there\u2019s no girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Chelsea smiles. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d She bites into a sandwich\u2014unbelievably, a tuna sandwich\u2014and saunters over to another costar to ask about his new baby.</p><p>Virgin eradicator? Harsh.</p><p>The afternoon scenes went wel enough, though I\u2019ve got a hel acious bruise forming on one shoulder from a choreography error. I\u2019m not doing all of my own stunts because I\u2019m not suicidal. (In one, my double wil be jumping from the roof of a semi to the roof of a BMW, while both are moving at 60 mph.) But the fight scenes, the climbing scenes\u2014those I\u2019m doing. The casualty today happened during a bar fight that should have\u2014and would have\u2014gone off without a hitch, except the guy who was supposed to smash a chair onto the bar top as I rol ed to the left screwed up and cracked the chair down right on top of me. The director cut the scene and cal ed a medic, but luckily nothing was broken. Muscle or no muscle, though, that shit hurts.</p><p>In comparison, the kiss went much better and was decidedly less painful. Chelsea and I have good chemistry, though not, perhaps, what I had with Emma last year. Stil , we nailed it in one take. I concentrated the entire time on not thinking of Dori. My level of success was questionable, at best. No matter what I\u2019m doing to forget her, she pushes into my consciousness like a walking daydream.</p><p>John\u2019s Words of Wisdom when I was trying to come to grips with Emma\u2019s rejection: \u201cThe best way to get over a girl is to get under another one.\u201d I listened to him then. For the record? That shit doesn\u2019t work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dori</p><p>Not until I see Dad\u2019s face does my anesthetized shield begin to recede, leaving in its place pins and needles of feeling, sharp and stabbing, fear piercing through me at his distressed look. I find myself pleading in my head Deb, please don\u2019t be dead. Please, please don\u2019t be dead.</p><p>Just like that, for the first time I let myself consider the possibility. And then I shove it away violently.</p><p>I rush into his arms and he enfolds me tightly. \u201cDad, what happened? How is she?\u201d I can\u2019t breathe, demanding and fearful of the words I\u2019ve been waiting hours to hear.</p> <p>\u201cThere was an accident.\u201d His voice is hoarse, tight. He swal ows and I want to say I know that already! I want him to skip to the end and assure me that she\u2019s alive, but I bite my tongue and let him gather his thoughts and his courage and speak. \u201cAt the hospital, during her rounds. She... she slipped. There was a wet spot on the floor, and she slipped.</p><p>She fel and hit her head.\u201d</p><p>Wet spot. Floor. Fel . Hit her head. This is terrible, horrible, but oh so much better than the accident of my imagination\u2014mangled metal, blackened and twisted in the middle of a busy intersection. Infinitely better than the massive loss of blood, the scarring, the internal injuries, the potential paralysis, the possible fatality. I nearly giggle with relief, but it evaporates in my throat because my father hasn\u2019t loosened his hold. \u201cDad?\u201d My voice is muffled against his chest.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had a closed head injury, Dori. Before your mother and I arrived, she was unconscious, and then lucid and talking for an hour or so, but then her brain started swel ing, and they haven\u2019t been able to get it to stop. She\u2019s been unresponsive since we\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>I pul away and look into his eyes. \u201cUnresponsive? You mean like a coma? But why\u2014? You said she slipped and hit her head, but I mean how hard could she have hit it\u2014</p> <p>she\u2019s as short as me\u2014we\u2019re close to the ground, remember?\u201d My pitch is somewhere between eager and hysterical, my mouth stil turning up into a smile because no part of me is accepting that word. Unresponsive.</p><p>He squeezes me tight and releases me. \u201cLet\u2019s get your luggage. I need to get back to your mother. We can talk on the way.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re silent except for hol ow exchanges like I can carry this bag, you take that one. With the push of a button, he releases the locks on an unfamiliar vehicle, a compact SUV</p><p>in a jaunty red. The rental, more wel -appointed than either of our cars, smel s faintly of pine and strangers. We stow my luggage in the back, stil mute until our seatbelts are fastened and the engine has turned over, cool air blowing too briskly from the vents. I reach to the one aimed at my face and point it towards the window as Dad grabs my hand. I open my mouth to say Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, but his head is bowed and the plea hangs in my throat.</p><p>\u201cLord,\u201d he begins, eyes closed, voice breaking, \u201cwe believe in your healing power. We believe in your promises.</p><p>You watch over the sparrow when he fal s. You were watching over my little girl when she\u2014\u201d his voice breaks again and I clasp his hand firmly, tears streaming down my face.</p> <p>In that moment, I experience a blinding explosion of self-realization: I am two people. The Dori everyone knows is trusting, hopeful and light\u2014like a spark, like a feather. I am ful of faith, and nothing is impossible.</p><p>The anti-Dori has been hidden away since her formation. She\u2019s skeptical and riddled with doubt, doggedly probing dark theories of disbelief. In the wake of my father\u2019s fragmented prayer, his gut-wrenching pain that echoes mine, it\u2019s her words I hear. No fate, no destiny, no meant-to-be.</p><p>I want to believe that God is everywhere\u2014in the miracle of life, in the love we have for one another, flying in the face of death. I want to believe there\u2019s a reason and a purpose for what happened to Deb.</p><p>But there is no reason.</p><p>My two selves are old adversaries, forever circling, persistently employing the same inadequate arguments.</p><p>Each is close-minded, deaf to the other, and I cannot reconcile them.</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>REID</p> <p>Funny thing about not waking up hungover on days off\u2014</p><p>there\u2019s more day off to the day. I can\u2019t believe I actual y dreaded this. I was certain I\u2019d be bored as hel inside 48</p><p>hours\u2014evenings without the usual entertainment fol owed by entire days to fil . But what\u2019s to miss about headaches, nausea and acute sensitivity to light and sound? My enthusiasm may have as much to do with Vancouver itself as it does the lack of hangovers. I wouldn\u2019t know; before this project, I\u2019ve had little experience with either.</p><p>It\u2019s our first Sunday off, and Chelsea and her husband, Chad, invited me along to explore Gastown, an area of the city with cobblestone streets and smal shops, gal eries and restaurants. A bodyguard trails us, but hasn\u2019t been necessary. Vancouver is known as Hol ywood North, and the locals are semi-inured to celebrity sightings. No one\u2019s bothered us, though cel phones are frequently aimed in our direction and I\u2019ve heard my name and Chelsea\u2019s hissed emphatical y a dozen times.</p><p>I lace my fingers behind my neck and stretch my sore shoulder careful y. The screenwriter is working the bruise into the storyline for the shirtless scenes because hiding it is impractical. It\u2019s huge and ugly, and I wonder at my sanity over the fact that I\u2019m more amused than annoyed by it. I frequently left the Diego house lightly bruised and battered, as did Dori. Once, I pointed out a purple welt on the back of her thigh, and she twisted to look at it. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d I wanted to slap myself for how hot that was.</p><p>\u201cThis city is marvelous,\u201d Chelsea says now, opening a menu. Chelsea is fond of words like marvelous and fabulous and splendid, lengthening the first syl able as though she\u2019s trying to remember the rest of the word. She smiles at her husband. \u201cI think we should move here.\u201d We\u2019ve found a corner bistro across the way from an idyl ic green space that\u2019s commonplace in Vancouver, mixed in with the modernized buildings and concrete. This one boasts a fountain. As kids are tossing coins and making wishes, one smal boy pockets a handful of change and throws his baby sister\u2019s shoe into the water instead.</p><p>Out of nowhere, I\u2019m fighting the urge to cal Dori and tel her about it. I want her to tel me I\u2019m mean and try not to laugh as I mimic my costar\u2019s unnatural love for multi-syl abic adjectives. I wonder if she\u2019d be more sympathetic or amused that I got slammed with a chair during a simulated bar fight.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re suggesting that I become a kept man,\u201d Chad says, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think my license from the California bar extends this far north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no. You\u2019re the sugar daddy and I\u2019m the bril iant artistic type in this marriage.\u201d Chelsea purses her lips endearingly, while I battle a desire to punch one or both of them in the face.</p><p>My cel buzzes with a text from Tadd, and I\u2019m elated at the distraction from both the Chelsea and Chad lovefest, and futile thoughts of Dori.</p><p>Tadd: Hey dude, are you in vancouver now? Rob and i are flying up later this week. Would like to meet for dinner if you can. Let me know.</p><p>Me: I think i can squeeze you in, haha. Text me when you get here.</p><p>Dori</p><p>By the time Dad and I reached the hospital, it was close to midnight. \u201cOh, Dori,\u201d Mom said, throwing her arms around me as though I was a life preserver and she would sink and drown without me. She was a wreck\u2014her face blotchy, eyes red, a smudge of mascara dissolved under each eye, giving her delicate skin a gray cast under the greenish fluorescent lighting of the critical care waiting area. We held each other as Dad looked on helplessly.</p><p>Deb\u2019s medical team gives us periodic updates, much of it too complex to understand. I\u2019ve tried to take notes, but mostly end up with scraps of paper covered in scribbles l i k e increased intracranial pressure and epidural</p><p>hematoma and Glasgow coma scale\u20145. I don\u2019t know what hematoma and Glasgow coma scale\u20145. I don\u2019t know what any of it means, but the words are menacing and my mother is shaken by them, so I know the prognosis isn\u2019t favorable. Deb had a seizure shortly after the accident, one of the many reasons for her sedation.</p><p>\u201cThe increased pressure inside her skul from the brain swel ing is common in this sort of injury,\u201d one of the doctors intoned, but it was clear this wasn\u2019t meant as reassurance.</p><p>If the swel ing doesn\u2019t stop, my sister could die.</p><p>These aren\u2019t the circumstances under which any of us wanted to meet Bradford. Deb told me once that he\u2019s seldom overcome with emotion because he deals in the realities of death and dying every day. Sitting next to me in the hospital cafeteria, though, he\u2019s visibly anguished, hands clasped and rigid on the tabletop, next to his tepid coffee.</p><p>\u201cHardly anyone at the hospital knows about our relationship.\u201d His voice is hoarse, his handsome face pal id and drawn. \u201cAs far as most people know, we were distant acquaintances. I\u2019m not expected to be... not expected to feel...\u201d I put my hand on his arm as he struggles to stay composed.</p><p>When my parents are given Deb\u2019s belongings\u2014the clothes and jewelry she was wearing when the accident occurred, a beautiful, unfamiliar solitaire threaded onto a long gold chain is included with her things. Bradford\u2019s swift intake of breath and compressed jaw is al the answer we need to confirm that this is Deb\u2019s engagement ring\u2014</p><p>hidden from her coworkers, worn next to her heart.</p><p>Dad and I travel back and forth between LA and Dad and I travel back and forth between LA and Indianapolis while Mom remains steadfastly by Deb\u2019s side.</p><p>When she can be coaxed to leave the hospital for a few hours, she spends them at Deb\u2019s apartment, where she tends my sister\u2019s balcony ful of plants but doesn\u2019t get enough sleep to remove the circles from under her eyes.</p><p>My mother and sister have both always been slim. Now, they\u2019re both more emaciated every time I return from LA.</p><p>Once I apprise him of the fact, Dad and I begin to press food on Mom\u2014jars of cashews, buttered blueberry muffins, turkey sandwiches topped with avocado.</p><p>I postpone my admission to Berkeley for a semester. I don\u2019t tel my parents that at the moment, I can\u2019t imagine myself there at al . Thanks to donated air miles, Dad and I get into a rhythm of swapping off\u2014hospital, home, hospital, home\u2014so we don\u2019t impose further on anyone to watch the house or feed and walk Esther. I hardly see my father, our flights passing each other like that saying about ships in the night. My strongest feelings are reserved for anything relating to a change in Deb\u2019s condition.</p><p>Her doctors used innovative, controversial approaches to lessen the swel ing in her brain, and the terror that we could lose her diminished, too. There\u2019s been little change since she was successful y removed from life support. The monitors prove a low level of brain activity, and when she\u2019s awake, her eyes are open. But if I move directly into her line of vision, it\u2019s like I\u2019m made of glass. She just stares right through. She doesn\u2019t speak or react to voices unless they\u2019re very loud\u2014and then her only responses appear to be irritation or pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>be irritation or pain.</p><p>The doctors yel at her in attempts to provoke a response, and Mom sits stoical y, while I can barely stand to watch my sister flinch over and over. They ask me to try, hoping she might respond to my voice.</p><p>\u201cDeb, can you hear me?\u201d I say, and they insist louder, louder. \u201cDeb, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Deb?\u201d I\u2019m screaming, but the volume only makes her recoil, and I run from the room, weak and ineffective, gasping for breath and slumping against the hal way wal , sinking lower and swal owing tears. I bury my face against my knees, wishing this was al a nightmare, and I could just wake up.</p><p>My mother joins me as I huddle on the floor, opening her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dori. They won\u2019t ask you to do it again.\u201d I let myself cry, because I don\u2019t want her to let go. This embrace is for me, and I want it desperately even while I berate myself for leaning on Mom for comfort. She doesn\u2019t need me to break down and add to her burden.</p> <p>Bradford remains close by, but I wonder how long that wil last. He and Deb weren\u2019t married; their relationship wasn\u2019t even public knowledge. Excluded from decisions concerning her care except where his opinion is quietly sought by my parents, he has no official place in her life\u2014</p><p>this woman he wanted to marry, the person with whom he intended to link his future. As Mom and the chaplain prayed over her stil form yesterday, requesting miracles on her behalf, my eyes met Bradford\u2019s. I saw my grief mirrored there, as wel as my recognition of her prognosis. The girl we love is not coming back.</p><p>There\u2019s no discussing reality with Mom when she constantly addresses Deb as though she\u2019s capable of making a coherent reply at any moment. \u201cHow are you feeling today, sweetie? Looks like your hair is growing back in\u2014time for a trim, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Her fingers run lovingly over the sparse spots on Deb\u2019s head as my sister stares straight ahead at nothing. Mom chatters on about the weather and I fade from the room, because it\u2019s almost as unbearable as watching people yel at my sister to get a response.</p><p>When I\u2019m home in LA, I see my friends, fel ow church members, or Nick\u2014who brings me food and stays to sit and talk when he\u2019s home from col ege, though we skirt sensitive subjects like my newly aimless life or Deb\u2019s increasingly unlikely recovery. Two months ago, I confided in my sister and counted on my parents. They each encouraged my independence, but they were always there.</p><p>Now there is no hand to steady me and no net beneath me, and I\u2019m more isolated than I thought it was possible to be.</p> <p>\u201cDori is such a little rock for Doug and Jocelyn,\u201d I overhear Mrs. Perez tel Mrs. K one Sunday. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to worry about her fal ing apart.\u201d</p><p>Too late, I realize what my show of strength costs me.</p><p>I\u2019ve become disconnected, and the people in my life have become mirages. When I reach for them, my fingers go right through.</p><p>There is only one exception\u2014Reid.</p><p>I can\u2019t explain it, but whenever I catch sight of him on television or a magazine cover, I\u2019m connected to my former life, my former self, even if it\u2019s just for a moment. I\u2019ve memorized times and channels for entertainment news programs that I\u2019ve never watched, flipping rapidly between channels in the first two minutes. My pulse quickens when he appears in the teasers, like a monkey who\u2019s learned to press a lever and get a treat. He\u2019s a drug, and I need him. I tel myself that this is a safe obsession, because he has no knowledge of it.</p><p>Sometimes I wake from dreams of him, shuddering with longing. In these waking moments I come back to reality unwil ingly, grounded by Esther, who sleeps pressed to my chest like an extension of me. She is proof that I\u2019m alive\u2014</p> <p>my ear snuggled against her chest, attuned to the faint gurgles of her soft stomach and the steady drum of her heart, my nose breathing in her familiar doggy scent, my face and fingers buried in her fur, stroking her beloved warm body.</p><p>\u201cStay, stay, stay,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She does, and I do.</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true, is it?\u201d Chelsea says, plopping down next to me at lunch as I go over the sides for afternoon shooting.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about.</p><p>She crunches through a salad of mostly raw veggies while I eat as many rol ed up slices of meat as I can stomach. The filming has become more cardiovascular, and my body is burning off muscle as fast as Olaf and I can put it back on. Chelsea doesn\u2019t enlighten me about the true or untrue topic of her question, but she\u2019s aware I\u2019m curious as hel . She shoves another bite in her mouth and chomps away, grinning like mischief incarnate.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, fine, is what true?\u201d</p><p>She finishes the bite and cocks an eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t checked the Internet lately, huh?\u201d I steal a couple of carrots from her bowl. \u201cI never check it, where I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019d have been convinced I was the devil by now if I did.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cOr gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the newest rumor in Reid Alexanderland. Ostensibly, since arriving in Vancouver, you\u2019ve been seen with no one interesting outside of Chad and me\u2014unreservedly in love and married to each other, your friend Tadd, who\u2019s gay, and his hot, unknown, probably gay friend. Also one of our bodyguards\u2014who\u2019s male and therefore fodder for the gay buzz.\u201d</p><p>I almost choke on the swiped carrot and she slams my back with her palm while I fight to breathe. Final y, I manage, \u201cWel , that\u2019s a first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, true or not true? For the record, I don\u2019t care either way. Although I do have a brother who would drop everything and bounce up here on a pogo stick to be your love slave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold it right there, Cupid. Not true.\u201d My phone rings and of course, it\u2019s Tadd. I would bet a new Porsche he has seen the Internet and is laughing his ass off. \u201cAwesome,\u201d I grumble, heaving a sigh and pressing talk. \u201cThaddeus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHel o, lover,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for me to know, and you to never quite be sure of.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, covering my face with one hand. \u201cWhat does Rob think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh he\u2019s for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what, exactly? Never mind. Don\u2019t answer that.\u201d I know better than to word-spar with Tadd.</p><p>\u201cAw, come on,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat good is the press if not for dishing up a serving of innuendo sprinkled with a few unsubstantiated lies?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cWel , as long as Rob isn\u2019t upset about getting roped into the Hol ywood rumor mil .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, this was something we discussed before taking our relationship public. I\u2019m just not as wel -known as you, plus I\u2019m brazenly out of the closet, so it doesn\u2019t stir up much interest. You on the other hand\u2014if the rumor was true, there\u2019d be suicide watches and black arm bands in one camp, and rejoicing in the street in the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStooooop,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSo. Have you been practicing?\u201d he asks, switching subjects. Tadd plays the guitar, and when I brought up the crazy notion of trying to learn, he insisted I buy the instrument while he was here.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Learning to play the guitar is just one of the new things I\u2019m trying out while I search for ways to fil my free time with activities that don\u2019t include my usual pursuits. At first, this was both more and less daunting than I\u2019d assumed. I could dream up plenty of things to try, as it turns out. Motivating myself to actual y do them was another matter. There are hours ful of nothing but video games and eating crap Olaf would kil me for eating.</p><p>When Tadd and Rob were in town, we spent one night checking out local clubs. I didn\u2019t want to impose my no-drinking constraint on anyone else. Having never exactly practiced resisting peer pressure (hel , I\u2019m usual y conducting the peer pressure), I joined the two of them in a few too many shots of Canadian whiskey and a round of karaoke (Tadd and I killed doing a medley of Ke$ha and the Stones).</p><p>The entire next day I was renewing my vows of sobriety, especial y when Olaf caught sight of my impaired gaze. I knew I was in for it when he narrowed his eyes and al of the sizeable muscles in his upper body seemed to expand with displeasure at once. \u201cOne hundred push-ups,\u201d he barked, pointing to the floor. That was only the beginning.</p><p>When it comes to morning-after consequences, spending the evening with the guitar is exponential y less dangerous. I\u2019ve also tried meditation\u2014an unqualified fail because I can\u2019t clear my mind worth shit, and reading\u2014</p><p>slightly better, same reason. One of the bodyguards hikes, so we\u2019ve been exploring trails through New Brighton Park.</p><p>The leaves are turning every possible shade of gold and red, and the weather is cooler but stil amazing.</p><p>No matter what I do, though, I can\u2019t break the habit of talking to Dori in my head. I think about cal ing her, asking how her classes are going and coaxing satirical observations out of her\u2014the type she\u2019s reluctant to voice for fear of sounding il -mannered. I imagine sitting with her at one of the hole-in-the-wal caf\u00e9s I\u2019ve discovered here, tel ing her about al the on-set insanity.</p><p>I remember kissing her. The kiss in the closet that made her run. The kiss in front of her house that didn\u2019t. I could have gone on kissing her for much longer that last time, because nothing in her response showed wariness. The trouble was my response. If our mouths had been joined for another minute, I\u2019d have dragged her right back into that car.</p><p>Clearing Dorcas Cantrel from my mind is not proving to be a simple task.</p><p>\u201cReid, I\u2019ve listened to your voicemail three times. Am I fol owing this correctly\u2014you want to donate money to some missionary organization in South America?\u201d I\u2019m confusing the hel out of my father\u2014an unexpected bonus. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be worried about a cult, brainwashing, Hari Krishnas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dad, there are tons of Hari Krishnas in Ecuador.\u201d Before he retorts and we end up in a battle of wits (where the loser is pretty much always me), I add, \u201cI heard about it from a girl at Habitat. If she\u2019s involved, it\u2019s legit. I thought it would be a good use of my charity budget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-kay.\u201d He draws the word out, derisive as usual. I turn the receiver up and away from my mouth for a moment and force myself to breathe and not react. \u201cI\u2019m not used to you guiding your charitable contributions, not to mention those recently purchased cars\u2014which, I remind you, are not tax-deductible since they went directly to the recipients and you insisted on anonymity.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019ve already discussed my reasons for that decision, Dad, so I\u2019m waiting for your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much do you want to donate to this... mission organization?\u201d</p><p>I tel him, and there\u2019s no reply. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>The sound of air hissing through his teeth is unmistakable. \u201cI think I need to meet the girl who\u2019s inspired al of this uncharacteristic\u2014 giving.\u201d Jesus Christ. I wouldn\u2019t introduce Dori to my father if he begged. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since she went to Quito, actual y. She should be at Berkeley now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a student at Berkeley?\u201d He sounds impressed. I tamp down the jealousy. \u201cWhat\u2019s she studying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSocial work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? She\u2019s wasting an education at Berkeley to study social work?\u201d</p><p>I bristle, but recognize that it\u2019s more than just my father and his typical disdain for any career path that doesn\u2019t make a shit-ton of money. Not that mine seems to impress him. \u201cDori is exactly the sort of person who should do that kind of thing,\u201d I say. I\u2019m annoyed with myself for having had the same opinion of her chosen career path that he does.</p> <p>Honestly, it stil shocks me that someone with a voice like she has could purposeful y pursue anything but using it.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he says, with an extra helping of disdain. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she wholeheartedly gives a shit, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Dori</p><p>Once the specialists were in agreement that there was nothing further they could do, I knew my parents would accept the truth. Equal y inspiring and disconcerting to witness, my parents had maintained their faith in my sister\u2019s eventual recovery against al evidence to the contrary. I prepared myself to catch the emotional fal out from my mother, who for al of her medical competence and practicality had staunchly refused to concede defeat.</p> <p>After our final consultation with Deb\u2019s medical team, the three of us are silent on the way to her tiny apartment. The damage my sister suffered in her fal appears irrefutably permanent. Damaged areas of her brain aren\u2019t expected to recover, though it\u2019s possible that at some point she might begin reacting to a stimulus like a familiar voice. \u201cBy react,\u201d one of the doctors clarified, \u201cwe mean minute physical responses like a change in breathing pattern, or some smal movement of say, eyelids or digits. We don\u2019t foresee her ever regaining the ability to communicate through speech, however.\u201d</p><p>Once back at the apartment, my parents slide into adjacent chairs at the tiny kitchen table, shel -shocked. I reheat a pan of lasagna provided by one of the nurses who\u2019d worked with Deb. Final y, Mom clears her throat. \u201cI\u2019l start cal ing people tomorrow to get recommendations for a suitable long-term care facility close to home.\u201d I\u2019m relieved to hear the return of her natural pragmatism. She glances around the cozy living room. \u201cWe\u2019l need to rent a truck to move her things, and a storage facility in LA. Hopeful y, someday soon, she\u2019l need her things again.\u201d I pause in slicing the Italian loaf on the cutting board, turning my face away. I want to scream in frustration. Deb wil never live independently again. Nothing said by any of the doctors could have encouraged this belief, or even a hope of it. Years ago, I might have been wil ing to join the delusion, but I don\u2019t believe in miracles\u2014not for Deb, not for anyone. Maybe I haven\u2019t in a long time, and I\u2019m just now aware of it.</p><p>Deb\u2019s apartment has to be sublet, utilities turned off, creditors notified. These details fal to Dad while I distribute her patio ful of plants to neighbors and hospital staff after convincing Mom that they would bring comfort to the people Deb cared for, that it would be impractical to take them with us. As I deliver containers of geraniums and fuchsias and hanging baskets of bougainvil ea, I\u2019m greeted with hugs and tears. I meet with Bradford last, in his smal private office. I bring him an English ivy, the least demanding plant of Deb\u2019s col ection, and a box of belongings he left in her apartment. I\u2019d discovered his razor and toothbrush in her medicine cabinet, and a drawer containing a pair of his jeans along with socks, boxers and t-shirts.</p><p>\u201cI packed up these things our first night at Deb\u2019s,\u201d I say, placing the box on his desk. He stares at it, unmoving. \u201cI\u2019d hoped that when we went back home to LA, I\u2019d just be whispering to my sister where she could find your toothbrush and extra boxers.\u201d My voice breaks, but I keep talking. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything missing, let me know and I\u2019l find it and send it to you. Mom plans to put her stuff in storage...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dori.\u201d He lays his hands atop the box lid but makes no move to open it. \u201cI always wanted a little sister, did she tel you that?\u201d His eyes are ful of tears. \u201cI don\u2019t have any siblings, so I was jealous when she\u2019d talk about you.\u201d He takes a shuddering breath as tears stream down my face. \u201cYour sister changed my life. She changed how I look at the world, how I practice medicine. She changed who I am. And I know I can\u2019t... can\u2019t begin to compare how I feel, losing her like this, with how you feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>I walk around the desk and put my arms around the man who would have been my brother. \u201cYes, you can. She loved you, and you loved her. That\u2019s no different than how she felt about me, or how I felt about her.\u201d</p> <p>A tremor goes through his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t bring her back to herself, heal her.\u201d His grief and anger can\u2019t be separated. \u201cThis happened in a hospital. We\u2019re doctors. This is why I went into medicine\u2014</p><p>to cure and rebuild people, to make them better. And I can\u2019t even fix the woman I...\u201d He stops, unable to speak, and I hold him tighter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you, and Deb wouldn\u2019t blame you. If you knew her, then you know she wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d want you to go be that bril iant doctor she knew you were, to help people and live your life and be happy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? \u201d</p><p>I swal ow, glad he can\u2019t see my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The tabloid shows and websites have been going insane trying to figure out who Reid\u2019s latest hookup is. Whoever it is, he's being more undercover about it than he\u2019s ever been. Which is probably the reason for one of the theories that was floating around\u2014that he\u2019s gay.</p><p>I may not know much, but I know enough to know that\u2019s not true.</p><p>There\u2019s also a day of speculation that he\u2019s reuniting with the girl from his last movie, Emma Pierce, when a photo surfaces of the two of them at the Vancouver Film Festival.</p> <p>The photo is dark, but clear enough that they\u2019re both identifiable. She leans towards him with a smile as he speaks into her ear. Media speculation goes crazy, and dozens of photos from a year ago resurface\u2014the two of them holding hands, kissing, stil s from the movie where the two of them look al kinds of beautiful together.</p><p>The next day, an opposing tabloid publishes the same film festival photo\u2014except this one isn\u2019t cropped. In the new photo, Graham Douglas, Emma\u2019s boyfriend, is sitting on the opposite side of her, his left arm across the back of her chair, his right hand holding her right hand on his thigh.</p><p>He\u2019s listening to whatever Reid is saying as wel , and smiling. So obviously, the Emma theory is out.</p><p>The guy who sold the cropped photo is blacklisted, the tabloid site that original y ran the cropped photo is discredited, and I just spent 24 hours hating Emma Pierce for no reason.</p><p>Throughout al of this, Aimee and Kayla are cal ing and texting, trying to find out if I have the scoop on Reid: Kayla: Is reid gay???!?</p><p>Me: Not that I know of. Are they back to that again?</p><p>Me: Not that I know of. Are they back to that again?</p><p>Kayla: Photos posted of him with that guy tadd who played charlie in school pride and some other hot guy singing karaoke in vancouver...</p><p>Me: Old news i think. Not something i am worried about right now.</p><p>Kayla: Aww. :( I know everything is crappy right now with what happened to your sister. Aimee and me are going out saturday, wanna come?</p><p>Me: Yes</p><p>Kayla: REALLY?!??!?! OMG, stay over in our dorm??</p><p>Me: Ok. Sure.</p><p>I\u2019m wil ing to do anything to become someone else for a few hours. Someone who isn\u2019t invisible to everyone who used to love her. Someone who isn\u2019t the girl who\u2019s misplaced her faith.</p><p>They pick me up Saturday, chattering like they\u2019re one person, per usual.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring the ID?\u201d Kayla asks before taking off.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t think I look anything like her, though...\u201d</p><p>Aimee inspects Deb\u2019s Indiana driver\u2019s license. \u201cOh, this is doable. We can total y do this. I already have some stuff picked out for you to wear. We wear the same shoe size, right? When we get done with you, you wil look so much like her. Just wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I stuff the ID in my bag and lean my head back, trying to subdue the butterflies that are mosh-pitting in my stomach. I\u2019m so tired of feeling everything. Since we al came back to LA, I\u2019ve been overwhelmed. I\u2019m furious with my parents who continue to act as though my sister wil wake up. Their own sleeping beauty, with the canned fairy tale ending.</p><p>I\u2019ve become so good at repressing the desire to scream that I can\u2019t even cry. When I think about Deb, I\u2019m dry-eyed and staring, just like her. I am the opposite of thick-skinned.</p><p>I am no-skinned. I am raw, as though there is nothing between me and everything insisting that I feel. I don\u2019t want to feel anymore. I want to be numb.</p><p>Deb was so careful, always. When I began high school, she took me aside and made me promise to never drink and drive, and never get in the car with a friend who\u2019d been drinking. She told me about alcohol poisoning and dehydration, already the doctor-to-be. \u201cMom and Dad aren\u2019t always realistic about this kind of stuff. I know you\u2019re a good kid, but good kids are exactly the ones who end up making the dumbest decisions because they don\u2019t plan. If you\u2019re going to drink\u2014or have sex, you have to plan.</p><p>Capiche?\u201d</p><p>I promised to come back for a recap if I ever needed it.</p><p>Here I was, needing it, but now, Aimee and Kayla are the closest thing I have to advisors, but they\u2019re more like high-strung tour guides.</p><p>My sister slipped on an invisible spot on a slick hospital floor. The doctors explained that she\u2019d hit her head in the exact location with the exact amount of force that could cause the sort of damage she\u2019d sustained. Caution and cause the sort of damage she\u2019d sustained. Caution and risk aversion had done nothing for Deb. No such thing as fate. No such thing as miracles, either, or my sister would have earned one and fal en on her butt\u2014embarrassed, but stil herself.</p><p>Tonight I want to stand on the side of a cliff and look down, dare the wind to gust and knock me off. Everyone thinks that fal ing to your death is the worst thing that can happen. But that\u2019s a lie. The worst thing is to be alive for no reason.</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>REID</p><p>Earlier this week, the film wrapped up and I said goodbye to Vancouver and goodbye to Olaf for at least a week, because John began insisting that I say goodbye to my moral high ground.</p><p>\u201cI get the whole abstinence makes the heart fonder thing,\u201d he said last night, and I thought What? \u201cBut come on</p><p>\u2014you\u2019re home now.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if John was attempting a play on words, but maybe he was right. Maybe abstinence does make the heart grow fonder. Other than leaping from the wagon that one night with Tadd and Rob, I\u2019d been clean the whole time I was in Vancouver, and I stil couldn\u2019t forget her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this party\u2014\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cReal y?

Jorge and Daniel are coming, too. We\u2019l hit a couple of the clubs near UCLA, grab a few col ege girls who wil be swayed by my buttload of charm and your passable looks and il ustrious celebrity status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, buttload of charm,\u201d I laughed.

I\u2019m getting a few shots in before I decide to ditch this whole night.\u201d</p><p>He narrows his eyes. \u201cNo ditching al owed. It\u2019s like riding a bike, Reid. Jump on and pedal like hel , man.\u201d I shrug. \u201cWhatever. I\u2019l be at the bar. And, uh, don\u2019t mention my name to any of them, okay? I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot in the mood for sex?\u201d He looks appal ed.</p><p>\u201cNot in the mood for some chick who just wants to have sex with Reid Alexander.

Or you.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cGive me enough time to get a little numb first, wil ya?\u201d</p><p>Dori</p> <p>I\u2019ve avoided the LA club scene for years, while most of my friends were doing anything to get in. The music is so loud that I almost can\u2019t hear it. I feel it, though. Kayla did my makeup and styled my hair in long waves, and Aimee dressed me in a black miniskirt and fuchsia tank so tight that I feel claustrophobic. I\u2019m teetering on heels that could give me a nosebleed.</p><p>Holding Deb\u2019s driver\u2019s license, I try to appear like a confident 26-year-old. Kayla and Aimee swear that despite the age difference, Deb and I look (looked) similar enough</p><p>\u2014same coloring, height, bone structure\u2014and that using her ID is better than trying to sneak a fake past a bouncer. I hope the intimidating guy at the door doesn\u2019t examine it too closely. Any direct interrogation and I\u2019l col apse into a heap and start confessing.</p><p>He inspects the license itself more closely than he examines me. Three cover charges later, we\u2019re through the door, Aimee with her cousin\u2019s license and Kayla with a fake from Arizona that cost a fortune.</p><p>Step One\u2014get in\u2014was easier than I thought it would be.</p><p>Step Two: drink until I stop thinking about Deb. Stop thinking about Reid. Stop thinking about the future I can no longer clearly see, and the faith I no longer feel.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you here before, beautiful girl.\u201d I\u2019ve danced with at least a dozen guys, and here\u2019s lucky number thirteen.</p><p>I\u2019m not used to strangers standing so close. Or cal ing me beautiful. Leaning one elbow on the table in interested nonchalance, I sip the drink in my hand, which looks like a coke and tastes like a coke with a side of ingestible flames. I think it\u2019s my third, maybe fourth. Over the rim of the glass I see blondish hair and bluish eyes. The eyes regard me in the lazy manner of a predator sizing up dinner, and al of my instincts say run. Which is exactly why I do the opposite. Because my instincts are overly protective and useless.</p><p>A tilt of my head and a little smile back, and he\u2019s moved even closer.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dance,\u201d he says. Here we go again.</p><p>I put the drink down, glance at Kayla (who gives me an eyebrow waggle and a thumbs up) and Aimee (whose eyes are wandering over tonight\u2019s selection of hot guys), and slip from the barstool into this stranger\u2019s arms. He slides an arm around my waist as I balance myself. As we move towards the dance floor, I could swear I hear Aimee say,</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Kayla, look\u2014have I had too many shots of tequila or is that Reid\u2014\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t catch the end of her sentence before I\u2019m out of earshot. She can\u2019t mean who I think she means, even if she did say his name, which is debatable, as difficult as it is to hear anything over the music. I glance around, but everything is a whirl of color and noise and then this guy\u2019s hands are on my hips, and we\u2019re grinding into each other, fol owing the beat. Closing my eyes, I hook my arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks, leaning in close.</p> <p>My eyes open and his face is close enough to see his eyes. Ice blue, not like Reid\u2019s stormy blue at al . I don\u2019t want to think about Reid. \u201cDori,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cDori. Cute, just like you. I\u2019m Reece.\u201d</p><p>Rats. Too close to Reid. I don\u2019t want to think about him.</p><p>I dance with Reece-who-is-not-Reid until I\u2019m hot and thirsty, breaking off mid-song and heading for the table. I resist the urge to look back and see if he\u2019s fol owing. I don\u2019t real y care. If he doesn\u2019t, someone else wil .</p><p>I\u2019m downing the rest of the rum and coke and Reece settles a hip on Aimee\u2019s barstool as she leads another guy to the dance floor. Always another guy. Did I notice this before, how many there are? I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, trying to make a difference, never doing anything reckless or pleasurable, not since Colin. Wel . That\u2019s not quite true. Reid was reckless and pleasurable. But I\u2019m not thinking about him.</p><p>In the end I just wasted my time trying to better the world, and so did Deb.</p><p>I force my thoughts away from my sister, too, who sits in her chair and stares at nothing, with everything she\u2019d learned, everything she\u2019d become, everything she wanted to be\u2014doctor, girlfriend, wife\u2014 gone. Reece signals a waitress for two more drinks when I begin to spin the ice in my otherwise empty glass. His fingers trail along my arm, back and forth, like a magician with a hypnotic watch. \u201cTel me more about you, Dori with the big innocent eyes.\u201d I arch a brow at this. \u201cSo I look innocent, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Another lazy smile. His repertoire of facial expressions appears to be limited.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flare slightly, and his lazy smile has turned into the other one. The hungry one. Truth is, I\u2019m a little afraid of him, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing matters.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d The drinks arrive, and he throws his back, finishing half of it in one long swal ow.</p><p>\u201cOn?\u201d I ask, slamming half of mine as wel , shuddering after. It\u2019s amazing how easy it is to drink fire once you get accustomed to it.</p><p>He leans closer, and I feel his warm breath on my cheek.</p><p>\u201cOn whether you want to stay that way.\u201d He doesn\u2019t pul back, and neither do I, even as he begins to nuzzle my ear, his tongue swirling over the tip of it.</p><p>Too fast too fast my brain says, but my new powers of repression shut it up quick. I turn my face towards his and he\u2019s kissing me, and within seconds, his hands are wandering, caressing too roughly. It doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter. The music deafens me and his arm encircles me, pressing me to his side though I\u2019m stil sitting on the high stool and he\u2019s standing. He\u2019s wearing too much cologne, and it\u2019s not the right smel . Too sweet, almost. Not earthy.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here\u2014the place a couple of doors down is way better.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t recal another club on this block, but it feels like days ago that we came in. I glance across the dance floor, spotting Aimee, and gesture that I\u2019m leaving. She goes to mime call me with the wrong hand and almost spil s her drink in her ear.</p><p>Reece finishes his drink and points to my glass. \u201cYou\u2019ve stil got half of yours.\u201d I gulp the rest, tipping it back until the ice cubes bounce off of my upper lip. \u201cNice,\u201d he says, leaning closer. \u201cTime for innocent little Dori to learn some of leaning closer. \u201cTime for innocent little Dori to learn some of the sweet facts of life.\u201d My body is moving off of the barstool, and I look down and his hands are at my waist, large hands, holding me, keeping me from fal ing. Or from running away.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Gripping the table, I close my eyes and wish the room would quit spinning. Closing my eyes helps, but I worry that won\u2019t be the case once this last drink finds its way into my bloodstream. I want to be numb, but al I am is dizzy and everything is loud and flashing and this isn\u2019t how I thought it would be and I just want to sit back down and cry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l feel better when we\u2019re outside,\u201d he says, supporting my weight and guiding me towards the exit.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>REID</p><p>I\u2019ve been sitting at the bar, sipping shots of Armadale vodka while the guys round up girls to take to the party. The mirror across the back wal is angled slightly, reflecting the whole place, so I can face away from the crowd and contemplate the accumulated line of empty shot glasses, but stil watch everything going on. While deciding whether I want to go for al -out hammered or just buzzed enough to note everything going on but not give a crap about any of it, I caught sight of a girl on the dance floor.</p><p>Last summer, I conducted an unsuccessful search for a Dorcas Cantrel look-alike. The closest I came were a few girls with similar coloring. This girl resembles her in some obscure mannerisms I must have become aware of during the weeks we worked together, in addition to a striking physical similarity. But Dori would never dress or behave to be so blatantly seductive, though I imagined her that way more than once. By the end of my stint with Habitat, I found her appealing no matter what she was wearing\u2014even her unreasonably shapeless t-shirts.</p><p>For the past hour, my attention has been riveted by this club girl. I lost interest in vodka shots, watching as she glided from her table to the dance floor and back with different guys. Final y, one of them decided to hang around more permanently, leaning on the table as she finished the drink she foolishly left there while they were dancing, which could have easily been roofied by one of his friends. It hadn\u2019t\u2014I would have noticed, but stil . He leaned in and kissed her, and when they started making out, I went from eighty percent sure this girl wasn\u2019t Dori to one hundred percent sure. Even stil , I couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>When she turned to signal to another girl on the dance floor, I got a better view of her face. The resemblance to Dori was so strong, I felt like someone had just punched me in the gut. She downed the rest of her drink before the two of them headed for the door, his arm around her as she staggered in those stripper heels.</p><p>That stagger decides it. I slap a C-note on the bar and push it towards the bartender, pul ing out my phone and texting John to meet me up front. My eyes never leave the girl as I trail them towards the door. \u201cHey, Reid Alexander?\u201d someone says, and I shake my head. I don\u2019t have time for that shit now.</p><p>We al reach the exit at the same time and I grab the guy\u2019s shoulder in the way you\u2019d stop a friend to say hi.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>He turns, annoyed, holding the girl upright. She\u2019s crashing fast, her head propped against his chest, her hair obscuring her face. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I focus on him. \u201cYeah, man, you\u2019re gonna have to find someone else.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrow. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Do I know you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, but I know her.\u201d I nod towards the girl. I have no idea what I plan to do with her. Bring her to the party?

Mistake. \u201cWho the hel are you? Nevermind, I don\u2019t give a shit. Just back off before I kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think you\u2019l be doing that, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019l be leaving here with her, either.\u201d</p><p>I spot the left hook before it\u2019s ful y thrown, dodge it, grab his wrist and twist his arm behind his back like a pretzel while catching the girl around her waist and pul ing her to my opposite side. The big guys never see it coming.</p><p>They\u2019re too conditioned to their size and muscle obliterating any offensive launched.</p><p>In the same instant, John shows up with the bouncer, and suddenly we\u2019re getting al kinds of attention. For al of his invariable stupor, my best friend is an expert in some things</p> <p>\u2014like inducing authority figures to see things his way. He\u2019s already slipped a couple of fifties into the bouncer\u2019s hand and they disappear into a pocket as I explain that this girl is obviously in no state to leave the club with a stranger. I\u2019m obviously in no state to leave the club with a stranger. I\u2019m only guessing they don\u2019t know each other, of course, based purely on observation. But no one gives the douche a chance to refute it before he\u2019s passed off to another huge tattooed guy and escorted out. His missed punch was enough to get him ejected.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know she knows you?\u201d The bouncer peers at me, smarter than most guys who stand around at the front door flexing muscle, gathering phone numbers for closing time booty cal s.</p><p>I look down at the girl, hoping she\u2019l play along, and in that moment I realize that the girl in that hot outfit and under al that makeup is Dori.</p><p>She frowns and blinks slowly, leaning into me. \u201cReid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Reid. You aren\u2019t real y here, are you?\u201d Her eyes tear up. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so good.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s enough for bouncer man. \u201cAl right, off you go. Be safe.\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Dori</p><p>My eyes are so dry that cracking them open is agonizing.</p><p>I\u2019m in an unfamiliar bed, in an unfamiliar gray-blue room.</p><p>The furniture is smooth and dark-grained. The scent of the pil ow under my head, though\u2014the scent is vaguely familiar.</p><p>Not floral or citrus, but something heavier\u2014clean and concentrated. Male. Dark blinds are pul ed shut, but light filters in through the crevices between the slats. It\u2019s morning... or later.</p><p>Someone is tapping on a keyboard behind me. I rol over warily and Reid Alexander\u2019s gaze shifts from the laptop to me at the sound. Pul ing his hands from the keyboard, he leans back in the desk chair and stares at me. A satisfied smile works its way across his face. I must be dreaming. Should I feel this horrible if I\u2019m dreaming?</p> <p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d His voice is low, and somehow I feel the reverberations of it beneath my sternum. My fingers flutter there, as though I can brush the panic away. I\u2019m not dreaming. I\u2019m in Reid\u2019s bed. Not some random stranger\u2019s.</p><p>Reid\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI thought I dreamed you.\u201d The words whisper from my parched throat.</p><p>His head tilts to one side, his mouth shifting to something less sarcastic, more amused. \u201cThat may be the most enchanting thing I\u2019ve ever been told after spending the night with a girl.\u201d</p><p>I swal ow the little saliva I can generate. My mouth is as dry as cotton, my lips chapped. \u201cWhat. Happened?\u201d My voice cracks, barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes, trying to recal anything past the last guy I fol owed to the dance floor\u2014the one with the too-sweet smel . \u201cI... don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d</p><p>I force my eyes to open when he stands, moving to look down at me. Mouth set in a grim line, he peels the cool gray sheet back and I pul taut, expecting air on bare skin, but I\u2019m stil clothed in the tank and skirt I wore last night. We did it dressed? Or... he redressed me?</p><p>Taking my elbow, he gently pul s me from the bed, but my head is heavy and throbbing, and my equilibrium is shot. When I sway, he scoops me into his arms and the room tilts crazily. I hold on, groaning. The smel of his bed was just an echo of the spicy maleness of him, stronger now, my face against his chest. I want to curl up into him and sleep, but he\u2019s walking away from the bed. I briefly assume that he means to take me outside and deposit me on his doorstep, where I can be picked up for transport like a FedEx package.</p><p>He carries me through a doorway leading to a large bathroom, rather than the hal way I\u2019d expected. There\u2019s a cushioned bench along one wal , and he deposits me there, his hands gripping my shoulders lightly until he\u2019s certain I can hold myself upright. My eyelids slit open just enough to track his movements and position in the room. Dressed in jeans and a faded black t-shirt, he pads across the carpet and marble floor, barefoot. He leans into the shower and a spray of water sounds, and then he\u2019s walking back to me as steam bil ows above the frosted glass.</p><p>I never thought I\u2019d see Reid again. Not in the flesh. My face grows hot at that thought and I close my eyes, reopening them when he says, \u201cHmm.\u201d He\u2019s standing in front of me, fists on his hips, staring down. I\u2019m listing starboard but otherwise stil sitting up. And then he\u2019s pul ing the fuchsia tank up and off, and taking my hands to stand me up.</p><p>\u201cNooooo,\u201d I say, and it sounds more like a whine and less like a refusal. He begins to unzip the skirt and I grab his hands. He can\u2019t mean to undress me now.</p><p>He picks up a huge bath towel from a fluffy stack on the opposite end of the bench, flaps it open and holds it up, a makeshift partition between us. \u201cEverything off,\u201d he orders.</p><p>\u201cAnd then get in the shower.\u201d</p><p>I try to glare at him over the towel, but even drawing down my brows hurts my head. I settle for a blank look. He looks back, one eyebrow raised like a chal enge. \u201cYou have to go home at some point.\u201d he says, gesturing to the mirrored wal . \u201cIs this how you want to look when you get there?\u201d</p><p>I glance at my reflection, noting the smeared makeup, the sleep-creased skirt and the tangled hair, stiff with the half a bottle of whatever Kayla used to style it last night.</p><p>With al of the community service work I\u2019ve done, I know this veneer al too wel . I look like a cheap prostitute. I can\u2019t show up at Aimee and Kayla\u2019s dorm like this.</p><p>\u201cDori. Shower.\u201d It\u2019s not a command or a plea, just a statement of common sense. I pul the top edge of the towel towards my chin with both hands and nod once. He returns the nod and leaves the room, pul ing the door shut behind him.</p><p>I hang the towel on a hook and unzip the skirt, dropping it to the floor. The lacy pink thong and bra that seemed so sexy last night feels incredibly sil y now. I strip off the lingerie and step into the warm cascade of water raining from a shower nozzle the size of a Frisbee.</p><p>As pulsing rivulets course over my face and body, I\u2019m as relaxed as a person standing in a strange shower with almost no memory of the previous night could be. In the warmth and close quarters, every breath I take as I wash and shampoo catalogues the trace of almonds and exotic fruit and answers Reid. I had no idea I could recal his scent so acutely. Feeling as though I\u2019m drowning in him, I don\u2019t turn the water off until my skin is flushed and wrinkly.</p><p>My clothes reek of sweat, cigarettes and alcohol, and the last thing I want to do it put them back on. On the bench next to my tiny purse sits a bundle of folded clothing. Black linen shorts, soft white tank and a blue top with tiny snaps down the front. I\u2019m reluctant to check the labels, but I do and then wish I hadn\u2019t. The cost of this outfit would make a mortgage payment for most people.</p><p>After a soft knock, Reid gives me three seconds and opens the door. His eyes drift over me, wrapped in the towel, my hair hanging wet down my back. \u201cI think those should fit.\u201d He nods at the clothes, walking into the bathroom. \u201cYou and my mom are about the same size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are your mother\u2019s clothes?\u201d I shake my head and immediately regret doing so. \u201cI can\u2019t... take your mother\u2019s clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can. Or else you\u2019l be wearing that towel home.\u201d His eyes run quickly down my frame and more slowly back up. \u201cYou can give them back later, if you want.\u201d His indifference concerning the return of his mom\u2019s things is obvious, but he shrugs, placating me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l have them cleaned first,\u201d I say. \u201cThank you.\u201d Self-conscious, I run my fingers through my hair, trying to remove the bigger tangles and avoid his eyes.</p><p>He steps closer and hands me a bottle of water, which I gulp appreciatively. \u201cThere\u2019s a blow dryer, hair products, al kinds of crap in this cabinet.\u201d He leans down, rummaging, and pul s out a bottle of something, pours a little into his hands. \u201cDetangler,\u201d he says, running it through my hair, his fingers careful y separating strands while I recal him picking bits of fruit from my hair, in a different bathroom, a mil ion years ago.</p><p>Eyes closed, I drink as he detangles. As he moves around front, I force myself to look at him. \u201cReid... did we...?\u201d</p><p>His fingers continue their careful paths through my hair, his expression al angel-faced innocence. \u201cDid we... what?\u201d I want to shut my eyes again but I need to see if he\u2019s tel ing me the truth. I have to look in his eyes when he answers. \u201cDid we... s-s-sleep together?\u201d</p><p>He regards me with that bemused expression I know so wel . \u201cYou woke up in my bed, Dori. And yeah, I was in it with you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d My gaze fal s to the floor. I slept with Reid... and I have no memory of it.</p><p>\u201cDori.\u201d He waits until I look up at him. \u201cDon\u2019t look so mortified. We slept. I don\u2019t do passed out virgins.\u201d I swal ow. Of course he\u2019s made the same assumption everyone who knows me makes: Dori Cantrel is nothing if not pure and innocent.</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>REID</p><p>What I don\u2019t tel her: she did just about everything imaginable to break that personal policy. Not that I\u2019ve instituted much of a code of conduct for hookups; I\u2019ve been with virgins, and I\u2019ve been with girls who were so stoned or hammered they could hardly recal their own names. I\u2019ve just made it a policy to draw the line at combining the two, if possible.</p><p>Which brings me to the other thing I don\u2019t tel her. If I didn\u2019t know Dori, her actions in the club would have persuaded me to believe that she might not be as innocent as I assumed. What happened between the club and my bed left little doubt.</p><p>There was no way I could deliver her home fal ing-down-drunk to her pastor father, and I had no idea where to take her besides home with me. In the car, she revived somewhat, her head nestled against my shoulder. Her hands began wandering over my chest, grazing over and under my shirt, caressing lazy orbits around every susceptible part of me she could reach. I thought she would drive me insane by the time we arrived home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I carried her up the back staircase to my room, she never stopped torturing me. When I set her down, she looped her arms around my neck and started kissing me, open-mouthed and unrestrained, arching her body into mine. I couldn\u2019t help responding, pul ing her up hard against me, exploring her mouth with my tongue, rediscovering the feel of her with palms and fingertips. We fel onto the bed, kicking off shoes, and I roughly dragged her on top of me.</p><p>Her skirt was bunched around her hips and my hands gripped her thighs, and she was practical y spil ing out of her deep V-neck top as she hovered over me, kissing me.</p><p>When her hand found the button fly of my jeans and tugged it open, I grabbed her wrists and choked out her name. \u201cDori.\u201d She froze and looked at me, her dark, dark eyes glazed over and her lips swol en and wet. I\u2019m getting hard now just thinking about how she looked in that moment. How I did what I did next, I have no idea. \u201cDori, sleep.\u201d</p><p>She looked bewildered. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me?\u201d Her voice broke mid-sentence.</p> <p>I groaned. \u201cYes, I absolutely do. But you don\u2019t want this.\u201d She blinked. \u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A smal frown creased her brow. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she lay down, curved against me and fel sleep. Her acquiescence was so quick I was almost insulted. I don\u2019t know how long I lay there, wondering what kind of strung-out loser I\u2019d turned into to refuse what she\u2019d offered, even if she was unquestionably under the influence.</p><p>It felt irrational to let her sleep\u2014to order her to sleep\u2014</p> <p>rather than turn her onto her back and run my hands and mouth over her until she was so hot for me she was begging me to finish what we\u2019d started.</p><p>Once I\u2019d suppressed the desire to coax her awake and to hel with my moral dilemma, I draped an arm over her abdomen and thought about what she\u2019d done to me before she dozed off. Nothing we\u2019d done was new for her... and I sensed that we hadn\u2019t reached the limit of her experience.</p><p>I don\u2019t know this Dori. Something happened between last night and the night I kissed her for what I thought was the last time and left her\u2014sweet, respectable and tough as nails\u2014standing in the middle of her parents\u2019 sidewalk. I don\u2019t know why she was at that club, dressed like a girl hunting for a hookup and drinking like her goal was oblivion, and I sure as shit don\u2019t know what she was doing leaving with that guy.</p><p>Al I know is\u2014I have to find out.</p><p>I left her alone in the bathroom, wearing a towel and an unintel igible expression. She isn\u2019t angry and she isn\u2019t happy. Beyond that, I can\u2019t say. I hear her moving around, the faucet turning on and off. I think of that silky pink bra, imagine how she would have looked five minutes ago in my shower, hear the blow dryer switch on, think of her in that towel. Imagine it fal ing to the ground.</p><p>Shit.</p> <p>My agent sent a new batch of partial scripts a couple of days ago. Sitting on the unmade bed reminds me of last night, so I move to the club chair by the corner window and read through the scripts until I realize I\u2019m not actual y absorbing anything I\u2019m reading. Closing the laptop, I set it on the floor, hook my legs over one cushioned chair arm and lean back against the other. Arms folded behind my head, eyes on the bathroom door, I wait for her to emerge.</p><p>Dori</p><p>I feel strange dressing without any underwear, but at least I\u2019m clean, and the clothes are soft and loose enough to be comfortable going without.</p><p>The cabinet Reid indicated is like a luxury beauty supply store, crammed with salon hair products, lotions, packaged toothbrushes and razors. Reid\u2019s careful detangling left my hair in damp waves, so I blow-dry it a bit and then leave it to air-dry. I fasten and unfasten the tiny snaps on the blue over-shirt, final y settling on leaving a little of the soft white tank exposed at the top. One last look in the mirror, and then another, and then I\u2019m doing little more than stal ing.</p><p>When I emerge from the bathroom, he speaks from across the room, calm and low, like he\u2019s trying not to startle me. \u201cMy mom basical y has toddler feet, so her shoes won\u2019t fit you. I sent Maya out to get you something. She\u2019l be back soon.\u201d He unfolds himself from the chair and moves towards me so sensual y a runway model would be jealous.</p><p>I frown. \u201cGet me\u2014shoes, you mean? As in b u y me shoes?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cDo you feel hungry? I think you should eat something, even if you can\u2019t stomach much yet.\u201d He takes something, even if you can\u2019t stomach much yet.\u201d He takes my hand as he reaches me, as though I\u2019m a blind girl in an unknown place, and I need to be conducted through rooms, doorways and hal s. \u201cLet\u2019s see if anything in the kitchen tempts you.\u201d</p><p>As we move through the main part of the house, I\u2019m in awe of the luxury he can\u2019t help but take for granted.</p> <p>Everything is refined and lovely, from the art on the wal s to the lighting to the cool marble floors between islands of plush rugs. There are no cracks in these wal s to camouflage with paint or plants, no worn flooring, no yard-sale furniture. The electronics are big and intimidating, speakers and components inset into wal s. He keeps my hand in his, which is good because otherwise I would probably walk into a wal or a post while gawking.</p><p>I do not belong here.</p><p>\u201cImmaculada, just the woman I wanted to see.\u201d We\u2019ve entered the kitchen through paneled doors with beveled glass inserts. Stainless steel, granite and dark wood combine to make this room as stunning as the rest of the house. I snap my mouth closed and turn when I realize Reid has introduced me to someone.</p><p>\u201cSenorita,\u201d the woman says, her accent familiar from my side of LA. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d She\u2019s got that middle-aged heaviness around the midsection and her hair is pul ed into a coiled braid. She\u2019s wearing a uniform. Though she\u2019s polite, there\u2019s something unreceptive in her manner, and my ears grow hot because of course she must know I was here overnight.</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am, it\u2019s nice to meet you, too.\u201d I\u2019ve never felt so out of place. Wel , no\u2014I felt equal y out of place at the nightclub. I didn\u2019t just step out of my comfort zone, I\u2019ve catapulted myself from it. I want nothing more in this moment than to find it and scramble safely back in.</p><p>Immaculada leaves the room, and Reid tugs my hand and seats me at a smal table near a window. At the high back wal of the property, a man trims a flowering shrub to picture-perfect roundness\u2014not one blossom, stem or leaf outside of the visual sphere. Another man whisks the pruned bits from the lawn and into bags, which are loaded onto a motorized cart. This is what people mean when they speak in terms of \u201cgrounds\u201d rather than a \u201cback yard.\u201d Holy cow.</p><p>Toast and a smal , plain omelet are arranged on the embossed white plate in front of me, and orange juice in a heavy tumbler sits just behind the folded napkin and silverware. As Reid seats himself next to me, I swal ow nervously, unsure I can get anything down. But the juice tastes fresh-squeezed from actual oranges, the toast has been lightly buttered, and I even manage a bit of the omelet.</p><p>We eat in silence, except for the sounds of silverware on china and chewing, and I feel a little better after. Reid is clearly not the slightest bit hungover\u2014he\u2019s ingested three times the amount of food I had on my barely-touched plate, plus coffee, the thought of which makes my stomach turn.</p><p>The moment I wipe the soft napkin across my mouth, he pushes his plate away and folds his arms in front of it. \u201cAre you going to tel me what happened?\u201d he asks without preamble.</p><p>I look at him directly for the first time since I left his bathroom, and in the sunlit cheeriness of this room, his face stil takes my breath away. There are so many ways to answer his question that I don\u2019t know where to begin. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked my ass off next to a girl for a month, almost daily, and though that girl looked like the spitting image of you, she and the girl I rescued last night are poles apart. I can\u2019t help but wonder\u2014what occurred to cause that sort of change?\u201d</p><p>I start to speak and have to clear my throat. \u201cRescued?\u201d His expression doesn\u2019t change, except for an almost unnoticeable tic in his jaw. \u201cYou were sloppy drunk and about to go home with some douchebag\u2014and I\u2019m pretty sure he was a complete stranger. I can\u2019t say for sure what would have happened, but I have an idea none of it would have been in your best interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d My heart is hammering. I\u2019m not a girl who wants to be saved by a boy. I have never been that girl. Even when I fel for Colin, I fel for the myth of thinking we were in love.</p><p>That we were on equal terms within that relationship. Yes, I was oh-so-aware that he was older and popular, and I was dazzled by these facts at the outset, but that wasn\u2019t what mattered to me. The loss of that status when we ended didn\u2019t faze me. The loss of what I thought was love, the realization that it was al a lie, was what ground my heart to a slow stop.</p><p>If what Reid says is true... but I have no reason to believe it isn\u2019t, from the snatches of last night that I remember. I know it\u2019s the truth. And I know that he did rescue me, simply because I\u2019d neglected, or refused, to save myself. I feel like a child who carelessly ran across a busy street without looking\u2014a child who\u2019s been shaken and asked What were you thinking? I have no good answer. I wasn\u2019t thinking last night, beyond the desire to numb myself.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d His gaze is steady on mine, his voice stil low, but firm. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I force myself to think about the thing from which I spent last night trying to escape, and tears wel up for the first time in a while. He seems to stop breathing, fingers curling into his palm, but he doesn\u2019t make a move or look away. I take a deep breath. \u201cMy sister, Deb?\u201d He nods once, encouraging me to continue. I stare down at the cold egg and toast crumbs on my plate. \u201cShe had an accident\u2014she fel and hit her head, and is mostly unresponsive now. She can\u2019t walk, can\u2019t feed herself, blinks and makes some facial gestures but never looks anyone in the eye, never speaks.</p><p>Her doctors say that any vocalizations are al involuntary, not reactive.\u201d</p><p>A tear blinks out of my eye and lands in a splat on the plate, gets soaked up by an adjacent scrap of toast. I press the napkin to my eyes, glad the makeup from last night is gone.</p><p>\u201cWere you\u2014very close? I\u2019ve never had a sibling,\u201d he stumbles over the last word, \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t know what a normal degree of intimacy would be. She\u2019s several years older, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight years. But we\u2019re very close.\u201d The effort of keeping the tears dammed inside is excruciating\u2014my throat feels bruised, my entire neck hurts as though someone has pummeled my windpipe just under my jaw. \u201cShe\u2019s my best friend.\u201d</p><p>He places a hand on top of one of mine, runs the other through his hair. \u201cMan. That sucks.\u201d He looks at me, exhales heavily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not very good at this.\u201d My mouth turns up on one side, because somehow Reid has said the one weird, true thing no one else would think to say. \u201cNo. I think that sums it up pretty wel . Thanks.\u201d Another uniformed housekeeper zooms into the room then, this one short and thin, so energetic that my head aches just trying to fol ow her with my eyes. \u201cI have the sneakers and the thongs,\u201d she says, and my face goes hot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reid clears his throat and leans closer to whisper, \u201cUm, she means flip-flops. That\u2019s, uh, what she cal s them. Can\u2019t get her to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI buy two or three sizes of each, just in case.\u201d Oblivious to my red eyes, and without making me feel the slightest bit mortified wearing borrowed clothes, she pul s shoe boxes from two bags. Opening the lids, she reveals shoes wel out of my price range. For pete\u2019s sake, there are Coach flip-flops in two of the boxes. I didn\u2019t even know they made Coach flip-flops, but here they are. There are also running shoes, and these brands are even scarier.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Maya,\u201d Reid says, and she smiles and zips out of the kitchen.</p><p>I lean closer to him even though we\u2019re alone, thinking I could hyperventilate any moment, and wondering if he knows CPR. \u201cI can\u2019t accept these.\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring me, he pul s a pair of flip-flops from their box.</p><p>\u201cTry these.\u201d When I don\u2019t take them, he leans over and puts them on my feet, his hand on my calf. Oh fudge. Fudge, fudge, fudge as his hand slides down my leg.</p><p>They fit perfectly. I am Cinderel a with no evil stepmother, no fairy godmother, and no royal destiny. Just a beautiful prince who places impractical footwear on my feet. \u201cOkay, but I\u2019m returning them with the clothes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? They aren\u2019t my size. And they\u2019re so not my style.\u201d He smirks. \u201cPlease. Keep them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHel o, Luis.\u201d I\u2019m blushing as I greet Reid\u2019s driver, recognizing him from the only other time I was in this car, the night Reid and I went to dinner. Some people endure a walk of shame; I get a whole day of it. Luis smiles warmly and tips his chauffer hat.</p><p>Reid slides in next to me, his eyes invisible behind his mirrored sunglasses. Our fingers are inches apart on the seat, but he doesn\u2019t close the distance. Other than carrying me to the shower, holding my hand while walking to the kitchen and comforting me when I talked about Deb, he\u2019s kitchen and comforting me when I talked about Deb, he\u2019s not touched me today.</p><p>On the way to UCLA, bits and pieces of last night come back. I don\u2019t remember the guy Reid said I was about to leave with last night, but I remember Reid\u2019s arm around me as he said, \u201cJohn\u2014you guys can take the Hummer.\u201d That same guy\u2014John?\u2014supported me to a taxi and placed me into it. \u201cSo you\u2019re Dori, huh?\u201d he asked, scooting in but leaving the door ajar. Turning to the taxi driver, he said, \u201cHey dude, the guy leaving with her wil be here in a sec. We\u2019re keeping her out of paparazzi pics, yeah?\u201d I closed my eyes as the last drink I\u2019d had hit me ful force, adding to the previous four. Or five. My hands gripped the seat. I was on a tilt-a-whirl and there was nothing I could do to ground myself. Flashes shone through my eyelids, like lightning in the distance, and then I heard Reid say,</p> <p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d The seat shifted and sloped as he took his friend\u2019s place in the back seat of the cab and pul ed the door shut. He reached for me as he gave the cabbie an address. I curled against his solid chest and held on, my eyes shut tight, the world stil twirling.</p><p>That\u2019s al I remember until I woke up this morning.</p><p>I text Kayla to let her know I need to be let into her dorm.</p><p>She and Aimee left a dozen texts and voicemail messages on my phone between last night and this morning, horrified that something had happened to me because I\u2019d disappeared. It turns out that when I gestured to Aimee that I was leaving, she thought I was complimenting her dancing.</p><p>I guess we need to establish better drunk hand signals, not that I want a repeat of last night ever again.</p><p>that I want a repeat of last night ever again.</p><p>They\u2019re sitting on the steps of their building when the car pul s up. They can\u2019t see the interior of the car and obviously don\u2019t suspect that I\u2019m the passenger, because they continue talking while casting surreptitious looks our way, waiting to see who\u2019s being dropped off. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say as Reid removes his sunglasses. \u201cWhere should I send the clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk you into keeping them?\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head.</p><p>He smirks, one corner of his mouth turning up. \u201cI put my number in your phone. Cal or text me and we\u2019l work something out.\u201d</p><p>Before Luis opens my door, Reid takes my hand, his thumb caressing the sensitive skin between my thumb and forefinger. \u201cBe more careful?\u201d he says, sliding his sunglasses back on, and I nod, feeling like a na\u00efve idiot.</p><p>And then, stil a bit hungover, I slip out of the car and walk up to my stunned friends, wearing a designer outfit and no underwear and carrying my clothes in a shoe store bag.</p><p>\u201cDid you just get dropped off by a celebrity?\u201d Kayla asks, ogling the car as it pul s away.</p><p>\u201cAre those Coach flip-flops?\u201d Aimee gasps, and then, pul ing the back of the shirt out and looking for the label,</p><p>\u201cOhmigod, is this top Versace?\u201d Chapter 39</p><p>REID</p><p>The bal \u2019s in her court; I\u2019m better when it\u2019s in mine. I\u2019m used to being in complete control of any relationship with a girl\u2014</p><p>whether it\u2019s for an hour or a few weeks. Keeping control is effortless when the outcome is clear or inconsequential.</p><p>Neither of these applies to Dori.</p><p>It\u2019s been four days. Under normal circumstances, I\u2019d be pissed that I\u2019m counting, more pissed that I care. Where Dori is concerned, there\u2019s no such thing as normal circumstances.</p><p>Returning the clothes was her idea, so I should wait for her to contact me. I could contact her first... I have her phone number. And I know where she lives.</p><p>I sound like a damned stalker.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d Through careful voice inflection, Dad manages to take statements that should be positive and twist the words to sound accusatory and suspicious. It\u2019s a gift.</p><p>It\u2019s also bait, and I\u2019m not rising to it. Without turning, I continue peeling the orange in my hand, separating the continue peeling the orange in my hand, separating the smooth rind from the fruit below by tearing pieces away and dropping them into the sink. \u201cI\u2019m meeting with George in an hour, discussing new project proposals.\u201d I detach a wedge and pop it into my mouth, resisting the impulse to lick the juice from my fingers. I fight the urge to enjoy anything too much in front of him, actual y, and now that I\u2019m aware of that fact, my brain gets hung up on why that is.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he says, as unconcerned as possible. In my peripheral vision, his brows are almost knit at the center as he stares at the empty mug in his left hand and the coffee pot in his right, as though he\u2019s forgotten how to pour. He doesn\u2019t look at me, and I debate whether to turn and head back to my room or wait until he says actual words. I elect to silently count to five first. I\u2019m up to three when he adds,</p><p>\u201cAnything of note?\u201d</p><p>Sweeping the bits of orange peel into the disposal and flipping it on, I savor the tangy whiff of citrus almost as much as the motorized droning that purposeful y stal s my reply.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a couple. One has possible critical appeal\u2014</p><p>maybe even Oscar-worthiness. The other\u2019s an action flick.</p><p>More money, probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he says again. Strange. Seldom without a blunt opinion of my career, particularly when it comes to financials, this man seems like someone else\u2019s father. A minute later he\u2019s snatched a sheaf of papers from his attach\u00e9. My upcoming film choices forgotten, he removes a giant clip and thumbs through the one-inch stack, flagging something in the center of a page.</p><p>Dad is a contracts expert. No fraudulent detail can be Dad is a contracts expert. No fraudulent detail can be buried deeply enough that his expertise can\u2019t root it out, for which his clients pay a buttload, as John would say. Too bad the emotional details of life flow by without his notice, which is why everything Mom and I do strikes him as out of the blue. Suddenly that question I typical y dodge pops up: how much am I my father\u2019s son? I\u2019ve become proficient at avoiding emotional entanglement. Funny how my earliest self-protective behavior turned me into the very thing I was protecting myself from.</p><p>I leave him to his standard obsession\u2014work\u2014and head to my room, deciding halfway there that if I don\u2019t hear from Dori by the end of the day, I\u2019m cal ing her.</p><p>Her text arrives in the middle of the scheduled meeting with George.</p><p>Dori: The clothes are back from the dry cleaner. Where should i send them?</p><p>Me: I can get them when i pick you up for lunch tomorrow.</p><p>Dori: Visiting my sister tomorrow.</p><p>Me: Al day?</p><p>Me: Nevermind. Tonight, then.</p><p>Several minutes go by during which my long-suffering manager repeats the name of the director of one of the proposed films two, three times, and I stil don\u2019t hear him.</p><p>\u201cReid. Let me know when you\u2019re actual y listening rather than setting up booty cal s.\u201d His dry tone belies his annoyance with me, only because I know him so wel .</p><p>Dori: Lunch tonight?</p><p>Me: Haha, yeah. Lunch tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I tel George, seconds ticking by while I wait for her to reply, clicking the phone to make sure it\u2019s stil powered up. Final y, she answers.</p><p>Dori: Ok</p><p>Me: Pick you up at 7</p><p>\u201cColor me unconvinced,\u201d George says, his tone dry as toast, and I give him my almost undivided attention. I\u2019m already planning tonight.</p><p>Dori</p><p>Here I am, staring into my closet again, chewing my thumbnail and wondering what one wears to return a borrowed outfit to a celebrity.</p><p>I arrive downstairs in jeans and a white button-up shirt with three-quarter length sleeves. The last time I wore this shirt to school, Aimee said, \u201cJeez, Dori, you look like my mom.\u201d Her pity smirk said this wasn\u2019t a compliment. But what she hates about it is what I like. This shirt says I\u2019m not trying to be enticing\u2014not 18-year-old girl enticing, anyway.</p><p>Mom\u2019s on second shift at the hospital and Dad\u2019s been in his study most of the afternoon. I dread looking in on him.</p><p>Too often, he\u2019s staring out the window, or worse, at some invisible thing in his mind\u2019s eye, and when I interrupt his reverie he looks\u2014for a beat or two\u2014as though he\u2019s never seen me before in his life.</p><p>I stop in the doorway. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m relieved when he peers over the top of his glasses at me, his hands never leaving the keyboard. This is good.</p><p>He\u2019s working. Writing sermons has been grueling for him the past few weeks. He\u2019s always grumbled good-naturedly about striving to hear God speak; when I was little he\u2019d step into the hal way and tel me semi-sternly that he couldn\u2019t hear God while I practiced cartwheels in the living room, or when Esther and I roughhoused on my bed, her playful barks mingling with my laughter. Now, I suspect that the impediment to hearing God comes from a different source.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out. I won\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>He nods, looks back to the screen. \u201cTel Kayla and Aimee hel o.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I don\u2019t correct him, and then I shake myself internal y. There\u2019s no reason to omit the truth of what I\u2019m doing. \u201cActual y, I\u2019m seeing Reid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes snap up and he frowns\u2014not angry, but baffled.</p><p>\u201cReid Alexander?\u201d</p><p>I rarely mention Reid to anyone, but when I do, his surname is always tacked on in return, as though he can\u2019t ever just be Reid. He\u2019s something bigger and more sensational than that, not to be described on a first name basis like some guy from school. \u201cHe\u2019s the only Reid I know, Dad.\u201d</p><p>His head tilts to the side. \u201cWhy are you seeing him?\u201d He doesn\u2019t know I saw Reid last weekend, of course. (I let Kayla and Aimee believe I left the club with a stranger, for which they lectured me severely... and then pumped me for details due to the Versace top, Coach flip-flops and opaque-windowed, chauffeur-driven Mercedes.) I scramble for a sensible answer. \u201cI think he\u2019s, uh, investigating charity organizations for possible contributions and wanted my input.\u201d This could be true. \u201cYou know how people with money are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot real y,\u201d he says.</p><p>The doorbel rings and Esther takes up her post at the door, barking. \u201cMe neither, I guess.\u201d I laugh nervously as I turn to go, my guilt-ridden brain summoning the stunning house and the uniformed maids and the overpriced flip-flops in my closet and the neatly folded designer clothes stowing away in my Mary Poppins bag.</p><p>The last time I saw Reid on my front porch, I hadn\u2019t yet made my third trip to Quito. Deb was about to get engaged.</p><p>I was on the cusp of starting col ege. And I thought I\u2019d never see him again after that night.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing jeans and a button-down shirt the color of dark plums, the kind I eat with salt\u2014a habit Deb instil ed in me when I was young and mirrored anything she did. His sleeves are rol ed to his elbows, the shirt is pressed but untucked. His dark blue eyes sweep over me once, quickly, moving to Esther, who growls. \u201cEsther,\u201d I admonish her, but not harshly, and not without stroking a hand over the back of her head. We\u2019ve been too close for too long for me to reprimand her protective behavior.</p> <p>Reid squats down eye-to-eye with Esther and offers the back of his hand. She looks to me for reassurance that he\u2019s not dangerous and I place a hand on his shoulder to prove it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Esther. He won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d She sniffs his hand lightly and then raises her nose with a sort of haughty air, eyeing him with lingering suspicion as a hazy memory emerges from my subconscious\u2014Reid carrying me up the staircase in his house, whispering something my brain refuses to translate now.</p><p>When he glances up, I\u2019m staring at him. I\u2019m sure my puzzled expression is odd; he\u2019s accustomed to wistful expressions directed his way from most women, and irked expressions from me. I turn and grab the Mary Poppins from the coatrack, severing the connection.</p><p>\u201cThat is one ginormous bag,\u201d he says. \u201cAre we shoplifting? Heading to the Hamptons? Hiding a body?\u201d I elbow him lightly in the side (holy Moses, I forgot he\u2019s solid everywhere) and precede him out the front door after scratching Esther behind the ears and tel ing her I\u2019l be back.</p><p>Our lunch-dinner consists of sandwiches from a tiny hole-in-the-wal place where they slice the roast beef thick, toast the hard rol , add whatever you\u2019d like, wrap it in butcher paper, and send you on your way, because there\u2019s no space for tables or standing around. Across the street, we find a semi-secluded park bench and talk about filming in Vancouver and my col ege deferral until we finish eating, and then we strol around an upscale row of shops where a pair of socks would be at the upper limit of my budget.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Reid murmurs. I fol ow his line of sight to a guy hiding not-so-discreetly behind a mailbox, an unmistakable camera lens trained on the two of us. \u201cJust ignore him. They usual y don\u2019t approach if they\u2019re alone.\u201d Taking my elbow, he turns to pretend interest in a store window, pul ing out his phone and cal ing Luis, who picks us up on the next corner two minutes later.</p><p>It\u2019s Sunday before the photos are posted and speculations begin. There\u2019d been no PDA, nothing that could be misconstrued by a sane person. But I\u2019m learning how tabloids work. Scandal sel s. The hand on my elbow is taken out of context, along with the way I seem to lean close while laughing at something he said while we were eating.</p> <p>That photographer had been watching us long before we saw him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for someone to match the girl spending a Thursday evening with Reid Alexander to the girl from Habitat who fel on top of him in the back yard last summer.</p><p>I suppose it was a simple task to get my name at that point and even easier to begin the conjecture about the length and intensity of our hidden romance and/or friends-with-benefits relationship, because of course it must be one of these.</p><p>I get cal s and texts from Kayla and Aimee, as wel as various other people I barely know or don\u2019t know at al .</p><p>Reporters and photographers are camping out in front of our house and fol owing me anywhere I go.</p><p>Reid cal s to apologize, but I wave it off. \u201cI\u2019l live. At least Reid cal s to apologize, but I wave it off. \u201cI\u2019l live. At least there aren\u2019t any photos of me tackling you this time.\u201d He laughs. \u201cIn that case, what about doing something this weekend? We could see what\u2019s playing at the revival theatre, if you\u2019re interested. I think they\u2019re showing The Dead. Have you seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Huston? I love it.\u201d I don\u2019t tel him that this film adaptation of an amazing James Joyce story is one of Nick\u2019s and my favorites.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Me, too.\u201d He sounds like he\u2019s smiling.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want you spending any more time with him.\u201d I stare at my parents, Mom across from me, Dad adjacent at our smal kitchen table. They sit watching my reaction, each of us exhausted from propel ing ourselves into work and volunteer efforts until there are no moments to spare in which we might have to think about Deb or ponder why God left her alive but al owed her identity, her personality, to be stripped from her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I say final y. \u201cNothing happened.</p><p>Nothing wil . We just hung out and talked. We\u2019re friends, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Dad stares at his hands, clenched on the table like he\u2019s praying. Or begging. \u201cWe\u2019re only saying we don\u2019t trust him.</p><p>This is not an appropriate connection for you, Dori. You must know it can\u2019t go anywhere that\u2019s... suitable. And as long as you\u2019re living here\u2014\u201d</p><p>I gasp. \u201cDad, really? \u2018As long as you\u2019re under my roof\u2019?</p><p>Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDori, there\u2019s no reason to be difficult over this if he\u2019s as unimportant to you as you say.\u201d Her voice is logical, which I\u2019m used to, and clipped, which is whol y unfamiliar and sounds wrong coming from the woman who\u2019s loved and cared for me my whole life.</p><p>My face runs hot and I feel and hear the blood pounding in my ears. My parents have been unreasonable so few times in my life that I can almost recal them al . Making me to floss nightly seemed unreasonable when I was nine. SPF</p><p>45 sunscreen seemed unreasonable at eleven. Not al owing me to see movies with even hypothetical sex or cursing seemed unreasonable at thirteen. I wonder if there wil be some future point when I\u2019l look back at this discussion and realize that what they were asking was sensible. That it was me who was being irrational.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recal saying he was unimportant,\u201d I say, quietly.</p><p>\u201cDori,\u201d Dad begins, and I open my mouth to argue my point but Mom cuts both of us off.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not discussing this further.\u201d She scoots her chair back and stands, the decisive scrape across the floor jarring. \u201cYou wil stop seeing him, Dori. He\u2019s not part of our world.\u201d</p><p>I look up at her, incredulous. \u201cWhat world is that?\u201d She turns and leaves the room without answering, motioning for Dad to fol ow. Just when I didn\u2019t think my life could get any more bizarre, I\u2019m wrong again.</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>REID</p><p>I\u2019m at John\u2019s when I get a text from Dori: We need to talk.</p><p>I don\u2019t like the sound of that. I text her back that I\u2019l cal her in a few, grab a beer from the fridge and head onto the balcony. The lights of downtown look like a celebration in progress from this height. I wish Dori was standing next to me, because this view is amazing, and people are easier to read face to face, and I\u2019m way more persuasive in person.</p><p>I\u2019m constantly off-balance when it comes to this girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Her initial reply is a soft sigh, and I think Shit. And then I wonder if I\u2019m going to surrender that easily.</p><p>\u201cThis is embarrassing,\u201d she says, and sighs again, shoring up for whatever she\u2019s about to say. I\u2019m confused, but I wait like I\u2019m patient, which I definitely am not. Even stil , I didn\u2019t push her when we went out. I didn\u2019t even kiss her when I dropped her off. Maybe the paparazzi stuff freaked her out. \u201cMy parents have forbidden me to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like, tomorrow?\u201d We\u2019d planned to see The Dead at the historical y renovated theatre Mom and I frequented before she started drinking. The classic movies we watched there during my childhood were responsible for lighting the acting fire in me.</p><p>\u201cNo. More like ever.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been doing what I damn wel please since I was fourteen. I ignore any barrier that doesn\u2019t make personal sense, and shove past anyone who stands in my way. I understand the notion of lines I shouldn\u2019t cross, etcetera, but I\u2019m nineteen and holding a beer right now for chrissake.</p><p>The idea that my parents would have told me who I could be friends with five or even ten years ago is unfathomable. A year ago? No way.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you eighteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sighs again and I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s exasperated with me, or the situation, or what.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d I sound like a petulant kid.</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her voice breaks just the slightest bit at the end, and my hand clenches the railing.</p><p>We\u2019re both silent, but my brain is going ful -throttle, determined to find a way through this maze. \u201cSo. Question.</p><p>How do you feel about tel ing them you\u2019re out with someone else?\u201d This is a no-brainer to me, but I know how she feels about lying. \u201cI can\u2019t tel you how many teen movie plots revolve around just this scenario.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a moment. Considering, I hope. \u201cDon\u2019t some of those end disastrously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But I\u2019ve been in a dozen of them. I know all the common pitfal s.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and my whole body hums. \u201cI... I don\u2019t know.</p><p>What about the photographers?\u201d</p><p>Damned paparazzi. \u201cThey\u2019re stil fol owing you around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re starting to lose interest. Especial y after five hours of trailing me al over Los Angeles a couple of days ago during my Meals-on-Wheels deliveries, with nary a celebrity in sight.\u201d I laugh again at the mental picture that generates. \u201cBut even if they stop fol owing me,\u201d she says,</p><p>\u201cthey\u2019l stil keep tabs on you.\u201d</p><p>An idea pops into my head. I throw it out there, and imagine her chewing her lower lip while she deliberates. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just when I\u2019m sure she\u2019s bound to say no, Dori Cantrel surprises the hel out of me again.</p><p>I answer on the first ring and she says, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d her earlier conviction al but gone.</p><p>I don\u2019t give her the chance to slip from doubt to regret.</p><p>\u201cCool. I just hit the gate remote.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. It\u2019s opening now.\u201d She\u2019s definitely panicking.</p><p>\u201cReid, maybe I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh no you don\u2019t. \u201cPul in and park al the way to the right, I\u2019l be right out.\u201d</p><p>My bright idea: If we don\u2019t actual y go out, the paparazzi wil have no way to photograph us together. Sadly, that\u2019s as far as I got with the devious plotting, and this wil only last as long as we can occupy ourselves inside my house. I\u2019m trying not to think about the activities with which I\u2019d most like to occupy her time.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say. Her Honda is at least ten years old. The door squeaks when she opens it, and her mouth twists almost imperceptibly. Glancing behind me at the multi-bay garage that could possibly contain her entire house, she\u2019s speechless. Her eyes range over the rest of the place and I imagine it from her perspective. I want to impress her, sure, but there\u2019s a difference between impressing and intimidating. I take her hand and push the car door closed.</p> <p>\u201cStick-shift, huh? Sick.\u201d I\u2019ve never met a girl who can drive a stick. That is unbelievably hot. Down, boy.</p><p>Pul ing her hand from mine, she swings her bag onto her shoulder and tucks her hair behind her ear on one side.</p><p>\u201cYeah, my dad loves manual transmissions for some reason, and we share the car, so I kind of had no choice.\u201d She\u2019s stil staring at the back of my parents\u2019 house.</p><p>Hands in my pockets, I ask her to fol ow and turn to walk inside. It\u2019s like a reverse of our very first interaction, right after I convinced her of what a complete dick I was by scanning her from top to bottom. I wonder if she walked into the Diego house that day wishing I\u2019d just go away, or worried that I might not fol ow, like I\u2019m worrying now that she\u2019l abandon the whole idea of spending the evening here, get back in her car and peel down the long driveway.</p><p>Immaculada left dinner in the warmer as I requested, and I admit that no, I didn\u2019t cook any of it, though I\u2019m surprisingly skil ed at table-setting. We eat in the kitchen, and I tel her about the two projects I\u2019m comparing, both filming next fal . I can\u2019t do both, but I can\u2019t decide which one to reject.</p><p>\u201cIgnore the critical regard thing for a minute,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cBecause honestly, I\u2019m not convinced you care so much about that.\u201d We\u2019ve pushed our empty plates to the center of the table, and her legs are folded into her chair, one knee poking up. She fixes me with an earnest, direct look, one elbow on the table as she leans forward. \u201cWhen you talk about the first one, your eyes light up. Like they could almost not pay you to do it, and you\u2019d stil want to.\u201d God, she reads me easily sometimes. \u201cThey will pay me, though. A lot.\u201d I get up to make coffee.</p><p>\u201cDoes that make you feel guilty about wanting to do it?</p><p>Not tortured artist enough for you?\u201d Her voice is teasing, and right next to me. She\u2019s brought the dishes to the sink. If I don\u2019t stop her, I bet she\u2019l wash them, too.</p><p>I take the plates from her, set them on the counter.</p><p>\u201cPeople in my business crave recognition. It\u2019s in our natures</p><p>\u2014it\u2019s why we step on stage, get in front of cameras. We want admiration, approval. We want to be the best at what we do. And Oscars say \u2018You\u2019re the best\u2019 like nothing else in the film industry does.\u201d</p><p>I push the button and the coffee maker grinds the beans, empties them into the coned filter and starts to brew. I lean against the counter and she leans next to me. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says. \u201cImagine you have one of those golden guys. He\u2019s sitting on your mantel. Your talents have been recognized by your peers, and al manner of critical acclaim is yours.</p><p>From now on, you\u2019l be solicited to do more of the same type of work, al the time. How do you feel about that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBored,\u201d I answer, surprising myself. She smiles at me like my dad did the first time I tied my shoes by myself.</p><p>Mom tried, but Dad had the bunny-running-round-the-hole trick in his arsenal. He taught me to use chopsticks and floss and do long division, too. Somewhere after that, we lost each other. The first time Mom failed out of rehab, maybe.</p><p>\u201cReid?\u201d Dori\u2019s head is cocked to the side, a smal crease in her forehead.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I blink the memories away, turn to pour the coffee. \u201cLet\u2019s go watch a movie. I\u2019l let you pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about something of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. I hate to watch myself onscreen.\u201d I own copies of everything I\u2019ve ever done, but I only watch them alone, the way an athlete might use game footage as a training tool.</p><p>Like an athlete, I think some of the footage is genius... and some is so atrocious that if I could destroy every known copy, I would.</p><p>\u201cReal y? I always thought that was something you actors just say. That secretly you watch yourselves and think Oh, man, look at me. I\u2019m so brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou caught me,\u201d I chuckle at how close she comes to the sometimes-truth. Narrowing my gaze, I smirk and lift one eyebrow like a classic vil ain. \u201cAlthough, I am so bloody bril iant,\u201d I say in my best pseudo-English-aristocrat, and am rewarded with a laugh and the ear I can see darkening to an unanticipated shade of rose. Hmm.</p><p>Dori</p><p>Gosh almighty, when he uses that English Boy accent and skewers me with that look simultaneously, he\u2019s sin-on-a-stick, as Aimee would say.</p><p>The \u201cmedia room\u201d is across from his bedroom, and these are the only two rooms in this section of the house.</p><p>Unable to stop myself, my mouth drops open. \u201cHoly cow, you have your own theater.\u201d The room features four rows of theater seating and an angled floor. He steps down to the front row\u2014which is actual y a long sofa\u2014and picks up a remote. At the push of a button a screen descends from the ceiling against the far wal . I\u2019m stil gaping when he glances back.</p><p>\u201cYou know, making movies is what I do for a living.</p><p>Watching them is sort of like homework.\u201d He plops onto the sofa and I snap my mouth closed and join him. From the digital menu, we choose a recent Oscar-nominated film that neither of us has seen.</p><p>\u201cWel , this is depressing,\u201d Reid says an hour later, during a lul between stretches of dialogue.</p><p>\u201cCritics say it\u2019s gritty, realistic and ultimately uplifting.\u201d He\u2019s right, though, it is depressing. I should have pushed for the chick flick or the animated film.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, something uplifting better happen soon or this glass wil be flying at the screen,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cBit of an over-reaction, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Just after I utter this, the cancer-ridden child of the main character dies.</p><p>Reid turns his head and points at the screen, brows raised. \u201cMmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , yeah,\u201d I concede, rol ing my eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s only so</p><p>\u201cWel , yeah,\u201d I concede, rol ing my eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s only so far you can uplift from kil ing off a seven-year-old.\u201d Our faces are inches apart, both of us slouched into the comfortable sofa, feet propped on a huge leather ottoman.</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition,\u201d he says, and my breath goes thin. I wait for him to continue, relishing the excuse to stare at him unguardedly from such a close range, wary but mesmerized. \u201cI think you went to that club because you were in the mood to be a little... reckless. And when I took you away from that douchebag, you didn\u2019t have the chance to meet your, ah, objective.\u201d</p><p>Whatever I might have expected, this isn\u2019t it. My objective? The people onscreen erupt into a ful -scale screaming match, but neither of us is paying attention now. I stare at my hand, resting an inch or two from his, and murmur, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m upset with you for that.\u201d His fingers stroke over the top of my hand, and my breath hitches tight like my lungs are frozen. \u201cThe thing is...</p><p>if you\u2019re determined to be reckless, you might as wel be reckless with someone relatively safe.\u201d He turns back to the movie, his hand resting over mine. During the next hour, he makes a few more remarks on the film and invites me to join in, but he makes no further move beyond the pressure of his hand on mine.</p><p>When I get into my car, he stands with his hands shoved into the front pockets of his jeans, hunching his shoulders in his white t-shirt. The air is crisp and smel s like rain, too chil y out for his short sleeves and bare feet. He raises a hand as I put the Civic in reverse and do a three point turn my dad would admire. In the rearview mirror, I watch Reid jog back to the house. He didn\u2019t ask for a kiss or try for one, and now kissing him is al I can think about.</p><p>I\u2019m back to the impression I had months ago: Reid Alexander is the Devil. Except now it\u2019s easier to understand the angels who chose to fal from heaven with him.</p><p>\u201cHel o sweetheart!\u201d Mom says to Deb, and I bite my lip, turning to swap the faded, drooping roses on Deb\u2019s dresser for the fresh tulips in my arms. I don\u2019t think I\u2019l ever get used to Mom\u2019s fake-cheerful voice. Maybe it\u2019s always been in her repertoire\u2014something she uses on patients at the hospital, perhaps\u2014and I just never noticed it.</p><p>I could visit Deb alone, but then no one would be talking.</p><p>I take my time folding the dying flowers into the trash and rinsing the vase. In my bag are Deb\u2019s floral shears, which cannot be left in a place like this\u2014where people of various abnormal mental states are housed together. I trim an inch from each stem, careful y removing the limp lower leaves.</p><p>Placing them in the vase one at a time, I arrange and rearrange until they fan out evenly, sunny and happy. By the time I\u2019m satisfied with how they look, Mom is almost finished feeding my sister strawberry yogurt, spooning it between her lips in miniscule bites like she did in old videos of Deb as an infant, long before I was born.</p><p>This undertaking brings me to my knees to watch, so I don\u2019t.</p><p>We wash Deb\u2019s hair, grown in where it was shaved for surgery. It\u2019s been kept short al over for ease of care, and fal s in wisps and curls around her stil -pretty face. I dig my lip balm from my bag and run it over her chapped lips just as her roommate shuffles in and eyes us, wearing the bathrobe Mom bought for Deb last month, the one we\u2019ve been unable to find since we left it here in her closet. Also missing are every pair of socks with a pink Nike swoosh and her smooth wood-based hairbrush. Mom\u2019s jaw clenches, and she complains to the front desk when we leave. We\u2019re told they\u2019l \u201clook into it.\u201d Neither of us believes they wil .</p><p>We\u2019ve driven almost al the way home in silence when Mom says, \u201cI wish she had her own room.\u201d Her voice startles me even though she speaks softly. She\u2019s taken on extra shifts to afford Deb\u2019s shared room; we can\u2019t afford an upgrade to private. There\u2019s no need to remind her of this fact. She knows it as wel as I do. I find her hand and squeeze it once between shifting from fourth to fifth. At least this is something on which we can agree. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 41</p><p>REID</p><p>It\u2019s Thanksgiving, and I\u2019m sitting in the formal dining room with my parents and our catered meal, counting the minutes until Dad and I can pretend fixation on a footbal game that neither of us cares about. China, crystal, white linens, and we\u2019re barely speaking. Mom is drinking wine, abstaining from the hard stuff at the table, but the hand attached to the stem of her wineglass is trembling faintly. I suppress the urge to mix her something stronger, and myself, too.</p><p>There was a time when Mom cooked. Not every meal, but whenever the staff had a day off. Before my grandmother died, the two of them would get up before dawn on Thanksgiving Day to start everything. By the time I\u2019d wake up, the whole house was suffused with the aroma of roasted turkey and a conglomeration of spices from the stuffing and pies\u2014rosemary, thyme, nutmeg, cinnamon.</p> <p>Mom would wrap me in an apron that fel past my knees and I\u2019d mash the boiled cranberries and sugar through a mesh strainer until only the pulp remained, and later I would tel Dad I\u2019d made the cranberry sauce by myself.</p><p>Dad\u2019s foot is tapping; he\u2019s already anticipating the horror of an entire day with no escape to work, wondering how long he has to perform this farce of family togetherness. There couldn\u2019t be a more uncomfortable silence over a holiday meal.</p><p>Dori and her parents are dishing out donated portions of turkey and dressing to LA\u2019s homeless population now, but she\u2019s coming over later tonight. She\u2019l be tired after being on her feet al day, but I don\u2019t want to let her go early. A pang of guilt hits me with that thought, and I think about what might make her want to stay longer.</p><p>When she arrives, she confesses that she had very little to eat today. I offer to reheat some of our leftovers and she nods grateful y, which tel s me she must be ravenous. \u201cBe right back. Make yourself at home.\u201d I press her down to sit on the end of my bed. From the half-lidded look on her face, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to come back and find her curled up asleep in the center of it.</p><p>Instead, she\u2019s nestled into the pil ows at the head of the bed, reading. I wonder which book of mine she found interesting and then I get closer. Oh, hel . She smiles up at me, bookmarking her spot with a finger and turning the cover towards me. Her smile is more of a smirk. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were a fan,\u201d she says, reveling in her discovery.</p> <p>Nearly every girl in our age group owns this recently popular novel while younger girls snatch up dol s and graphic novel adaptations with stylized manga artwork. What the book doesn\u2019t have are many male fans.</p><p>I shrug, setting the plate on my desk and turning towards the bed. \u201cMy agent sent me the screenplay, and I thought I the bed. \u201cMy agent sent me the screenplay, and I thought I should check out the novel before I decide if I want to represent it.\u201d</p><p>Her smirk disappears. \u201cThey\u2019re making this into a movie? And you\u2019re being considered for\u2014\u201d</p><p>I nod, climbing onto the bed. \u201cWhat do you think? Am I a viable contender for the role? Could I bring him to life on the big screen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d she says, her wide eyes on mine.</p><p>I shake my head slowly and chuckle. \u201cI knew it. You were one of those brainy girls who only got in trouble when caught after bedtime with a flashlight and a book under the covers.\u201d I push her hair behind her ear on one side and can\u2019t help the widening of my evil grin; as usual, her ears cannot be trusted to keep her secrets. \u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d She pins her lips together and doesn\u2019t answer. She has no idea what she does to me. I\u2019m used to calculating girls\u2014</p> <p>aware of their sexual power and not afraid to use it. I\u2019d swear on the hood of a new Porsche that Dori is aware of every other power she possesses, but when it comes to this sway over me, she\u2019s oblivious.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember a few nights ago, when I offered you a proposition?\u201d</p><p>Her lips fal open and she blinks. \u201cYou said something about objectives. And recklessness. But you didn\u2019t propose anything... specific.\u201d She swal ows, staring down at the book in her hands.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Then I\u2019l clarify.\u201d I take the book, turn it face down on my bedside table. When I turn back, she\u2019s wary. I remain on the edge of the bed, facing her. \u201cIf you want to experiment... use me, rather than some stranger at a bar who could chop you into manageable portions and bury you in a shal ow grave.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows elevate. Final y she says, \u201cManageable portions?\u201d</p><p>Our laughter mixes together, dying away when I take her hand. \u201cOkay, though?\u201d</p><p>She nods, her eyes sliding away. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s get you fed while I kil demons.\u201d I slide off of the bed, handing her the book and picking up the plate on the way to the media room.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to kiss her before she leaves tonight, that\u2019s a goddamned certainty. Enough of this playing around crap.</p><p>I\u2019l send her home with visions of me as a widely lusted-after literary character, but instead of remaining safely ensconced in the pages of a book, I\u2019l be solid and real and right here.</p><p>Dori</p><p>The plate Reid hands me is loaded with odd gourmet versions of typical Thanksgiving fare, but it smel s good and I\u2019m starving. Tel ing myself this is no time to be finicky, I sample a bite of something that looks vaguely potato-y.</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d</p><p>I realize I\u2019ve said this out loud when Reid grins and says,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad someone can enjoy that meal.\u201d I finish that bite and decide to try the green beans and\u2014</p><p>whatever that is\u2014on top of them. \u201cYou didn\u2019t enjoy it?\u201d I ask, fol owed by another Mmmm.</p><p>Shaking his head, he perches on the edge of the sofa, elbows balanced on his knees as he points the control er and pushes buttons, click-click, click-click. Eyes never leaving the screen, he smiles again. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying listening to you eat more than I enjoyed eating.\u201d</p><p>Uncertain how to take that, I attempt to muffle the appreciative sounds.</p><p>The gore-level on his game is high, but thankful y the volume is down low. Without the soggy-sounding death blows, the carnage is somehow less revolting. Or maybe, considering that I\u2019m watching him play while I eat, I\u2019m becoming inured to the violence. Weird. Even weirder, I sort of want to play, too, though I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be inept. Maybe I\u2019l ask him to teach me next time.</p><p>Having been here half a dozen times over the last couple of weeks, I assume there\u2019l be a next time. I refuse to think about the point where that wil no longer be true.</p><p>When I finish eating, I lean back into the sofa cushions and thumb through the novel. I read it multiple times just before I started high school. Like many of my friends, I had a crush on the male lead\u2014sensitive and strong and yes, a bit brooding. I remember lunchroom disputes over which current star would be perfect for the role if it was a movie, laughing with fel ow bibliomaniacs when we ultimately concluded that any of them would put the boys in our school to shame. Now I\u2019m friends with a guy who may star in the movie adaptation. Friends with Reid Alexander. Surreal.</p><p>movie adaptation. Friends with Reid Alexander. Surreal.</p><p>He pauses the game and tosses the control er aside. \u201cI think there\u2019s pie. Want some?\u201d</p><p>I nod and start to get up, but he tel s me to stay. Soon after he leaves the room, I hear a noise at the doorway.</p><p>\u201cForget something?\u201d I ask, turning to look over the back of the sofa, and standing in the doorway is a woman who must be Reid\u2019s mother. She\u2019s petite and beautiful and holding a drink in her hand. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I stand up and smile, hesitant. \u201cMrs. Alexander? I\u2019m Dori.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t move from the doorway, so I walk towards her. Her blue silk blouse swishes as she straightens. She\u2019s wearing black dress pants and heels. \u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d she says, and her words are slurred. \u201cWhere did you say Reid is?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d hoped he was exaggerating about the alcoholic mother. As I get closer I see that her eyes\u2014the same dark blue as Reid\u2019s\u2014are bloodshot, so disguised by intoxication I almost can\u2019t see the resemblance. Her skin appears sal ow, even with the indirect lighting. I\u2019m too familiar with the indicators of chronic drinking to discount the symptoms. He wasn\u2019t overstating.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting pie.\u201d</p><p>She frowns. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to join us? I think we\u2019re deciding between Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s and, um, Goldfinger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Sean Connery. One of Reid\u2019s favorites. Favorite Bond, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. I\u2019l just leave you two alone.\u201d She tilts her head and a trace of a smile hovers around her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a friend of Reid\u2019s, you said? A girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m a friend.\u201d</p><p>She nods, lays a hand on my arm. Her breath is sour\u2014</p><p>whiskey, I\u2019d bet\u2014and again, I\u2019m more familiar than I\u2019d like to be. \u201cYou seem very sweet.\u201d She leans closer, and I concentrate on breathing through my mouth as she says,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him fool you. He\u2019s very sweet, too.\u201d She turns and walks a meandering path down the hal way just as Reid tops the stairs with a plate of pie smothered in whipped cream, and two forks.</p><p>He scowls. \u201cWas that my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stopped in to say hel o. I invited her to stay, but I think she was afraid of intruding. Either that or Sean Connery is not her favorite Bond guy. My mother prefers Roger Moore.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me a long moment, then hands me the forks and uses his free hand to tug me close. \u201cFeeling reckless yet?\u201d</p><p>I nod once and he doesn\u2019t wait for further affirmation, lowering his lips to mine. I forget the pie in his hand and the forks in mine as he opens my mouth with his. He kisses me once, twice, three times, pul ing back a hair\u2019s breadth each time while reeling me closer and closer until I\u2019m completely off-balance and curving into him. \u201cI real y have to know,\u201d he says, holding me securely, our mouths an inch apart, breath mingling, \u201chow delicious you\u2019l taste after you have a few bites of this pie.\u201d</p><p>I giggle and he smirks, taking my hand and pul ing me down to the front where we sink onto the sofa. He feeds me a bite of pie before setting the plate and utensils aside on the ottoman. \u201cI think you stabbed me,\u201d he breathes against my neck before brushing my hair aside and kissing the base of my throat. The feel of his mouth on my skin triggers waves of need in my bel y that coil and spring like stretchy filaments of connection to every nerve ending I have.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014sorry?\u201d I gasp, because his fingers are stroking the skin under my shirt, fanning out over my sides. He pul s me onto his lap as his lips move up my jawline, lighting an explosive pathway to my ear.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t hurt. I barely noticed.\u201d His voice is soft and near, a murmured caress. \u201cMy brain was occupied with more important things than minor flesh wounds.\u201d And then his mouth is on mine, his tongue sweeping through my mouth.</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d he growls softly. \u201cMy God, Dori.\u201d He doesn\u2019t speak again, does nothing but kiss me\u2014with occasional pie breaks, like marathoners downing cups of Gatorade for endurance\u2014until it\u2019s time for me to leave. I\u2019ve never been so kiss-drunk; if he hadn\u2019t pointed out the time, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pul s on a hooded jacket and a pair of Vans before walking me to my car. My lips are swol en and my skin is flushed head to toe. Like gravitational attraction, I can\u2019t resist his pul when he\u2019s within my reach. My teeth chatter as he presses me against my car, unzipping his jacket and folding it around us both, the hood up and shading the edges of our faces from the unobstructed moonlight overhead. \u201cCold?\u201d he asks, and I shake my head. The shudders racing along my core have nothing to do with temperature. If anything, I\u2019m burning. His mouth returns to mine and it\u2019s no longer strange, no longer new. The feel of his heartbeat and the sinewy muscle layered over it is familiar under my hands, as is the manner in which he coaxes my responses forward, every nuanced turn and dip anticipated.</p><p>I drive home thinking this is me in manageable portions.</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>REID</p> <p>\u201cMan, you suck.\u201d This is John\u2019s professed assessment of me when I sink the last solid bal on our second round of pool. Translation: I don\u2019t suck and he wishes I did, because I\u2019ve already beat him once and am about to make it twice.</p><p>\u201cSo, since there\u2019s a pool table between us,\u201d he says,</p><p>\u201cand I\u2019m sorta sober\u2014enough to dodge if I have to\u2014I have a question.\u201d Considering that the only time I\u2019ve ever been physical y violent with John was over Dori, I assume he\u2019s letting me know that she\u2019s the subject of this proposed interrogation. He\u2019s either a lot braver or a lot stupider than I thought.</p><p>\u201cRight corner pocket.\u201d As I lean to take the shot, he clears his throat and I scratch. At my glare, he throws both hands up as if he had nothing to do with it. Standing the butt of the cue stick on the floor and holding it like a staff, I say,</p><p>\u201cSo talk.\u201d</p> <p>After taking al day to line up, he pockets his last two bal s with one shot, and then sinks the eight bal . Bastard.</p><p>I rack the bal s for another round as he gulps down the last of his beer, which makes me more curious about what he\u2019s got to say. \u201cYour turn to break,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNot until you start talking. And please tel me this has nothing to do with my love life.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, chalking his stick, not looking particularly guarded but not getting any closer, either. \u201cWel I don\u2019t know, you tel me\u2014 is it about your love life?\u201d He air-quotes love life.</p><p>John real y is oblivious to how many times during our relationship I\u2019ve wanted to punch him. This is one of them.</p><p>\u201cCryptic, John. What is this, a very special episode of 90210?\u201d I slam the cue bal into the rest and scatter them across the table.</p> <p>\u201cFine. Just... don\u2019t get al hands-on. It\u2019s about that Dori chick.\u201d He\u2019s directly opposite of me stil , the wide expanse of table between us. Smart.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her.\u201d</p><p>Palms up, he says, \u201cSee, you\u2019re doing it already, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking like you\u2019re gonna beat the shit out of me, that\u2019s what. How am I supposed to be a bro and ask the hard shit if I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re gonna kil me for it?\u201d He takes his shot and sinks the thirteen.</p><p>While he\u2019s lining up another shot\u2014remaining, conspicuously, on the other side of the table\u2014I say, \u201cKeep from talking about what I should do to her and you can ask whatever.\u201d He sinks another stripe and quirks an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWithin reason,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019ve skipped out on a few parties lately. For like, the last several weeks. You get a text, you leave.\u201d One shoulder lifts and fal s. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p> <p>He eyes me. \u201cOkay. The texts are from her?\u201d I nod, leery of where he\u2019s going with this, and he rol s his eyes. \u201cReid, I\u2019ve known you since we were sixteen. You\u2019re the best friend I\u2019ve ever had. I think I\u2019m pretty qualified to say\u2014 what the hell, man? You\u2019ve never\u2014I mean never\u2014gotten remotely pissed over anything I\u2019ve said about a girl you\u2019ve hooked up with. Not to mention going al caveman apeshit.\u201d He misses his third shot and I line mine up.</p><p>I wonder if John\u2019s jealous in some way. Not that I can ask him that\u2014I\u2019d never hear the end of it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d I sink my shot, move around the table to sink another. He\u2019s fixated on a couple of girls playing one table over, one of whom angles indecently over her table in the shortest shorts possible. Glancing over her shoulder, she\u2019s making certain we\u2019re watching.</p><p>I\u2019ve pocketed another two bal s by the time he answers.</p><p>\u201cUh, my point is, are you seeing that?\u201d He tips his head at the two girls, who are openly appraising us and by the looks of things, about to come over.</p><p>I stand straight. \u201cYeah, John, I am a guy. I noticed. I just don\u2019t care.\u201d Every guy in the place noticed them the moment they walked in. Heads swiveled, bodies turned, mouths hung open. Your standard male reaction to females in tight, short, cleavage-baring clothes.</p><p>\u201cSee, that right there\u2014what is that? You don\u2019t care?</p><p>What does that even mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Both girls saunter up right behind him.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourselves, ladies.\u201d John\u2019s standard hunter smile is in place. \u201cWhat can we do for you?\u201d</p><p>Short Shorts has an expression that matches John\u2019s, but she\u2019s aiming it at me. \u201cYou guys are pretty good. Thought we could get some pointers. We\u2019re wil ing to buy the next round for your trouble.\u201d They know who I am. Girls don\u2019t buy the drinks, guys do. And in a pool hal ful of guys more than wil ing to do just that, they come to our table and offer to buy? I couldn\u2019t be less interested.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a deal to me,\u201d John says, giving me the please-don\u2019t-screw-this-up-for-me face. Shit. He\u2019s going to be pissed by the end of this night.</p><p>Dori</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re dropping out of col ege? Before you even start?\u201d The shocked look on Nick\u2019s face elicits a new heaviness in the pit of my stomach. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet. But I get spacey sometimes lately. I just... zone out. I can\u2019t go to school at Berkeley and do that. I\u2019d fail.\u201d Nick reaches out before I know what he\u2019s doing and places his hand over mine where it rests on the smal bistro table. \u201cDori, Deb wouldn\u2019t want you giving up on your dreams because of what happened to her.\u201d His hand is warm, covering mine completely. I stare at his square fingertips, the flat, short nails clipped evenly. So different from Reid\u2019s tapered fingers\u2014long, like a pianist, his hand stil big enough to dwarf mine.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I withdraw my hand to pick at non-existent fuzz on my sweatshirt, hoping the rebuff isn\u2019t too conspicuous. As selfish as it is, I don\u2019t want to lose Nick\u2019s friendship\u2014even if I no longer want anything other than that from him. He knows this, though it took him a little while to accept it. Staring at his hand, stil on the table between us, I try to explain. \u201cI feel lost without her, and detached from those dreams. Maybe they weren\u2019t ever real y mine.\u201d He frowns, pul s his hand back to the steaming mug of green tea in front of him. \u201cWhat do you dream of doing now, then?\u201d</p><p>Reid\u2019s image flashes across my mind like one of those ads with a subliminal message inserted\u2014a single frame of a face inside a strip of film. What I dream of now is Reid; everything else is fil er. This realization should scare me to death, but it doesn\u2019t. \u201cNothing,\u201d I say. Before he can form another question, I ask him how he likes Madison, where he goes to school.</p><p>\u201cWel ,\u201d he gives me a stern look, \u201ceveryone isn\u2019t quite as fond of cheese as we\u2019ve been led to believe.\u201d One side of his mouth sneaks up.</p><p>\u201cFalse advertising?\u201d I ask, smiling back.</p><p>When he settled on Wisconsin as one of his top university choices last fal , he bewildered his parents\u2014who are innately incapable of detecting sarcasm\u2014by insisting that \u201can abundance of cheese\u201d was one of his motives for wanting to attend. Nick\u2019s parents don\u2019t get his sense of humor. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>I sip my latte and smile. \u201cCheese aside, how\u2019s col ege life?\u201d</p><p>He considers for a moment. \u201cChal enging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you must love it there,\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d Dunking the teabag like he\u2019s operating a marionette, he adds, \u201cSo what can I do to convince you to go to school, Dori?\u201d</p><p>I heave a sigh. \u201cEverything just feels pointless right now.\u201d His serious brown eyes regard me closely. \u201cBecause of Deb.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI guess so. But it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s her, or what happened to her, exactly. I feel more like... like I\u2019m final y seeing everything for what it is, and nothing is what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he says.</p><p>We sit in our typical companionable silence for a few minutes, watching bag-laden Christmas shoppers scurry in and out of nearby stores. A few nights ago, Reid pul ed me into his house, tel ing me we were going Christmas shopping. \u201cBut\u2014?\u201d I said, fol owing him upstairs and into the media room.</p><p>He\u2019d hooked his laptop to the screen, and while we ate dinner, I watched him give new meaning to the notion of online shopping. Armed with a list of people and addresses from his manager, he spent more money in a couple of hours than I could keep track of. When I wouldn\u2019t let him buy me anything, he peered at me for a moment before pul ing me into his arms and asking, \u201cSo you only want me for my body?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip and nodded, and he growled and kissed me senseless. Once it got dark, Immaculada handed us senseless. Once it got dark, Immaculada handed us thermoses of hot chocolate and Luis drove us around to look at Christmas lights.</p><p>As though the thoughts in my head are transparent, Nick says, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking\u2014what\u2019s the deal between you and Reid Alexander? I don\u2019t fol ow Hol ywood gossip even when I\u2019m in LA, but the whole country was speculating over the date\u2014or whatever it was\u2014you two had a couple of weeks ago. The one preserved for posterity on every website from TMZ to People. So I hear.\u201d Before I left his house last night, Reid asked me to sing something, threatening to tickle me if I refused. When I told him I couldn\u2019t sing without accompaniment\u2014which he knows is a lie, he produced a guitar from his closet.</p><p>\u201cDo you play?\u201d I asked, sitting on the edge of his bed.</p><p>His mouth pul ed up on one side. \u201cNot wel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could teach you.\u201d I tuned the instrument, which was top-of-the-line, expensive. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve taught me to massacre Nazi zombies. It\u2019s the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d he said, watching me.</p><p>He sat next to me while I strummed simple chords, singing \u201cFal en\u201d by Sarah McLachlan. After, we lay on our sides, staring at each other. He ran a finger over my lips, down my throat. \u201cYou do have a beautiful voice, Dori.\u201d I knew he was withholding something more, but I didn\u2019t ask him to say it.</p><p>I pul out of the Reid reverie, shrugging at Nick. \u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d How can I explain to him, or to anyone, that without Deb, Reid is the only person in my life who sees me for who I am? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When it\u2019s clear I\u2019m not going to offer any more, Nick inclines his head and shifts his eyes to his mug. \u201cJust, you know, proceed with caution.

My guy is already dead, so I\u2019m just watching her. For a former non-gamer girl, she\u2019s a remarkably quick learner. \u201cEww eww eww,\u201d she says.</p><p>Squeamish, but quick.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve kil ed him.\u201d She flashes me a sideways look and I grin, one palm up\u2014 what?\u2014and then she chops the thing one more time.</p><p>\u201cI just want to make sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to make sure you\u2019re on my team if demonic predators ever attack earth.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzes with a text from Dad: Come to my study when you have a minute.</p><p>He never puts in an appearance to my side of the house to speak with me\u2014I always get a text summons to his office. Once, I was away on location and he sent one requesting tax receipts. I took great satisfaction in replying that I wasn\u2019t in the house, or LA, or California for that matter. He prides himself on being a detail guy, but he didn\u2019t notice his only kid was out of town? Pretty sure he lost out on Father of the Year for that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta go talk to Dad about something. Back in a sec.\u201d Dori nods without looking at me, alternating between staring at the action onscreen and squeezing her eyes shut</p> <p>\u2014every single time she\u2019s kil ing something. It\u2019s so cute that I can\u2019t resist leaning forward, pul ing her hair away from her neck and running the tip of my tongue along the bumpy vertebrae, nibbling the smooth skin.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Her arms go a little slack and her eyes drift closed. Her avatar is going to get slaughtered thanks to me. \u201cYou\u2019re distracting me, Reid. You\u2019re going to get me kil ed.\u201d I chuckle and she shrieks, hunching her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo tickling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d I lean around, turn her face towards me and kiss her, and she forgets to hit pause before dropping the control er into her lap\u2014such a girl. Judging by the sounds roaring from the speakers, she\u2019s dying a quick bloody death, but she doesn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to tickle me, or you didn\u2019t mean to kil me?\u201d Her voice is a breathy whisper into my mouth.</p><p>I kiss her again before saying, \u201cNeither. I was trying to distract you, though. To see if I could break through your bloodlust.\u201d</p><p>Something flashes through her eyes, so quickly I almost miss it. \u201cMission accomplished,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>\u201cHmm. What was that look for?\u201d She shakes her head, her ears pink. My arms surround her and I fold over her like a tent. \u201cWas it because I said\u2014\u201d I lower my voice \u201c\u2014 lust?\u201d Her skin darkens under the dusting of freckles across her cheeks. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re feeling for me?\u201d I hold her face steady, kissing the corner of her mouth, preventing her from turning her head and fusing our lips together\u2014not yet. \u201cI feel so used.\u201d I run my tongue along her lower lip and she gasps. \u201cGood thing I\u2019m total y okay with that, huh?\u201d When I kiss her this time, her head fal s back against my thigh, her torso twisted as her hands reach for me. Winning her desire is like nothing I\u2019ve ever accomplished. The pathway to it was proving that I\u2019m worthy of her trust, and somehow, I\u2019ve done that. She was indifferent to everything that usual y matters to people in my experience. A bolt of panic shoots through me when I realize I don\u2019t even know what it was that earned her confidence.</p> <p>My phone rings, startling us both. While my jaw clenches, she jumps and pul s away as though someone has walked into the room and caught us kissing. As though we don\u2019t have every right to do so, the rest of the world be damned.</p><p>It\u2019s Dad. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you home? I thought I saw your friend\u2019s car outside...\u201d</p><p>I am not discussing Dori with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way down. It\u2019s a big house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need a signature on a court doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Be right there.\u201d I hang up, and Dori is saving and signing off of her failed demon-exterminating mission\u2014the one I wrecked. I can\u2019t be sorry for wrecking it. \u201cYou can restart the level, you know.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cMaybe next time. I\u2019ve sort of lost interest in, um, bloodlust.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m biting back the licentious replies pouring through my brain because I\u2019ve already exceeded my daily quota for inciting mad flushes to scurry across her skin. \u201cWe have time to watch a movie. I won\u2019t be long\u2014he just needs me to sign something.\u201d I hate giving up even ten minutes with her, a fact that should alarm me, but doesn\u2019t.</p><p>When I get to Dad\u2019s office, he presents a pen and a document with an X at the bottom, my ful named typed under the line that needs my signature. \u201cOnce this is recorded, you\u2019l have completed the initial probationary requirements of your sentence.\u201d I scrawl my name as his words sink in.</p><p>\u201cMy license suspension?\u201d I feel like it\u2019s been years since I drove a car, as opposed to six months.</p><p>He sighs, taking the pen, pushing the signed document into an envelope. \u201cThe suspension terminates on the twentieth, though this is a permanent strike against you that will be counted if you repeat the offense. Assuming you don\u2019t just get yourself kil ed next time.\u201d He eyes me. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know\u2014but I\u2019l say it regardless\u2014that I\u2019d prefer you not to drive at al .\u201d</p><p>I hear the implication that there wil be a next time, and I hear the implication that there wil be a next time, and that I, like my mother, should be safeguarded against the combination of alcohol and vehicles. I subdue the resentment threatening to strangle me. \u201cIf I choose to drink, I won\u2019t drive. I\u2019ve learned my lesson.\u201d</p><p>His expression is rigid, discontented with my admission that I don\u2019t intend to give up drinking, thankful that at least I\u2019m agreeing to sidestep driving if I do. Puffing out a sigh, he says, \u201cI guess if that\u2019s al the reassurance I\u2019l get, I have to accept it.\u201d He stares for a moment, and just when I\u2019m about to turn and leave, he asks, \u201cSo who\u2019s the girl?\u201d Answers skip unspoken across my tongue. The girl upstairs now? The girl I was just kissing like a boy who hasn\u2019t screwed so many hot girls in the past five years that there\u2019s no hope of remembering the vast majority of them?</p><p>\u201cWhat girl?\u201d</p><p>His sardonic expression is a replica of mine, or vice versa. \u201cThe girl who drives the ten year old Honda parked in the driveway several nights a week for the past month or so.\u201d Dad has never been good at playing along.</p><p>\u201cDori.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows jump. \u201cThe Habitat girl? The Berkeley girl?\u201d</p><p>How the hell does he remember these details? It\u2019s as remarkable as it is grating. \u201cYes, but she didn\u2019t\u2014hasn\u2019t started at Berkeley yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s that predictable disdain in his tone, and I can\u2019t resist quashing it. He assumes everyone associated with me is dissolute and aimless, his prime (and favorite) example being John. \u201cHer sister had an accident right before she was supposed to start. Closed head injury. Dori postponed col ege to be around for her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s... accommodating of her,\u201d he says. I\u2019m too familiar with his condescension to pretend I don\u2019t hear it.</p><p>His assumption of her possible motives for the deferral is infuriating.</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad, that\u2019s selfless and devoted. Traits the Alexander gene apparently lacks.\u201d</p><p>He looks like I\u2019ve just gut-punched him, which is less gratifying than I\u2019d thought it would be. Shuffling papers on his desk, he switches gears. \u201cI assume you\u2019l be purchasing another car shortly. If you\u2019l let me know an approximate price range, I\u2019l pul funds from your investments so they\u2019l be available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We done?\u201d</p><p>Straightening and stacking, he says, \u201cYes. I suppose so.\u201d</p><p>Running a hand through my hair, I wish I could reel back the implication that he\u2019s unsupportive. John is studying finance against his wil . Dori is being forced to lie to her parents just to see me. Celebs with exploitive parents are a dime a dozen. He could be so much worse. Maybe that isn\u2019t the best parental commendation, but maybe it is. Shit.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cSo, thanks for handling everything.\u201d</p><p>Visibly stunned, his hands stil as he looks at me. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>I nod, he nods, and I leave before I examine this new consciousness any more closely.</p><p>Dori</p><p>Reid\u2019s mother just left the room after a conversation that awakened, for a moment, my aspiration to study social work. I\u2019ve spent the past several months emotional y detached from the volunteer work I continue to do, as though an impenetrable wal stands between me and the joy I once felt when I believed that what I did mattered.</p><p>\u201cAm I intruding?\u201d she said from the doorway.</p><p>I stood, conscious of the banter regarding lust and the suspended make-out session I\u2019d just had with her son.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I felt myself blushing. \u201cThis is your home, after al .\u201d She smiled. \u201cI try not to encroach on Reid\u2019s part of it. In al honesty, though, I noticed him leaving and I wanted to talk to you, if that\u2019s al right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, annoyed with my monosyl abic vocabulary, apprehensive about what Reid\u2019s mother could possibly want with me.</p><p>When she perched on the sofa where Reid had been minutes prior, I sat back down, mul ing over my parents\u2019</p><p>judgment of him and wondering if I was about to be measured by his mother in the same prejudicial way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to make you uncomfortable\u2014Dori, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d I nodded, holding my breath. \u201cReid hasn\u2019t brought anyone home in so long.\u201d This couldn\u2019t be true, based on his wel -known exploits, but mentioning that would do neither of us any good, aside from the fact that I\u2019d rather not contemplate it at al . \u201cYou said you and he are\u2014friends?\u201d I nodded again, my gaze darting away and then back. I tried to keep the eye contact steady, knowing that avoiding her eyes would just make me look guiltier. \u201cYes.\u201d We\u2019d not declared ourselves to be anything else or anything more.</p><p>Reckless, my conscience muttered, that\u2019s what we are together. The blush returned with a vengeance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReid needs a friend who cares about him. When he had that accident last summer, it just seemed as though\u2014\u201d her hands twisted in her lap \u201c\u2014he didn\u2019t care about his own welfare. He\u2019s drinking less, going out less since you started coming around, and I just... wanted you to know you\u2019re welcome here. I\u2019d do anything to make sure he doesn\u2019t repeat my mistakes.\u201d Her voice fel to a whisper. \u201cThere\u2019s no hope for me, I know... but I can\u2019t bear the thought that there\u2019d come a point where there\u2019s no hope for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always hope.\u201d I heard myself say this, pushing aside thoughts of Deb and my parents and prayer and hope\u2014and my loss of it.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve tried rehab three times, and failed every time. I can\u2019t endure another three months away from home.\u201d Her eyes brimmed, so like Reid\u2019s eyes that I felt my stomach clench.</p><p>\u201cHave you... have you tried AA?\u201d Do women like her go to AA? Society women, who can afford to check themselves into luxury clinics for several month stints? I felt out of my element.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cOh, no. It would be horrible if someone found out. I won\u2019t embarrass my husband or Reid more than I\u2019ve already done.\u201d</p><p>She was trapped, not only by her addiction but by her privileged place in society and her son\u2019s very public career.</p><p>She cal ed herself hopeless, but hope was stil alive in her, because she\u2019s examined al the locked doors of her cage</p><p>\u2014and people don\u2019t examine locked doors unless they\u2019re looking for an escape.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a confidentiality clause with AA. While it\u2019s true that the press often reports on celebrities who check into rehab, I can\u2019t remember ever seeing them report people attending AA meetings.\u201d I leaned closer. \u201cMrs. Alexander, Reid wouldn\u2019t want you to feel unable to help yourself. One of the reasons AA works is that the individual makes the decision not to drink, one day at a time. One hour. One minute even. You can do that, right? One minute?\u201d Her eyes never left mine. Even with the consequences of years of alcoholism, I could see that she\u2019s where Reid got his beautiful face. I imagined what they must have looked like together when he was very young, walking through a shop or in the park, his hand in hers, her beauty reflected in the little boy at her side. We sat quietly, and into the silence of those sixty seconds came the staggering ache of missing Deb. I wanted to cry for her and myself and my parents and Brad. I wanted to cry for Reid\u2019s mother, and also for Reid. There are a mil ion ways to lose someone you love.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one minute,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re stronger than you know, Mrs. Alexander.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flicked to the clock on the wal and back to me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, cal me Lucy. I\u2019l think about AA. But... don\u2019t tel him yet.\u201d I nodded, and she left the room.</p><p>\u201cThis may sound odd, given what I do for a living, but I\u2019m not the slightest bit interested in seeing any of these movies.\u201d The screen goes blank as Reid tosses the remote aside.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he draws my legs over his lap, \u201cI can think of a lot of other things I\u2019d rather do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in, a lot of kissing?\u201d My words light a fire in his eyes and he stretches out on the wide sofa, pul ing me alongside him. Our bodies touch from knees to chest, and I\u2019m feeling more daring than I\u2019ve ever been with him. Trailing fingertips across the planes of his face, I brush his hair out of his eyes, touch the lips I want to touch me.</p><p>\u201cAmong other things,\u201d he says huskily.</p><p>\u201cWhat other things?\u201d I\u2019m making myself blush, but my usual y reticent mouth isn\u2019t cooperating. He closes his eyes and leans his face into my hand, kisses my palm, wraps his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cThat, as always, is up to you.\u201d His lashes feather up.</p><p>The lighting, perfect for a home theater, is too dim to see the blue of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAs always, huh? So it was me who attacked you in that pink closet?\u201d</p><p>He smiles wickedly. \u201cI was just reading your mind that day.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, wanting to be audacious and brash; my shaky whisper is anything but. \u201cCan you read it now?\u201d shaky whisper is anything but. \u201cCan you read it now?\u201d One eyebrow quirks up. \u201cFeeling reckless tonight, are you?\u201d I nod. \u201cMmm,\u201d he hums. \u201cLet\u2019s see what I can do about that.\u201d His devilish grin appears in the same moment his fingers stroke the skin of my lower back, and then he kisses me, moving from gentle pressure to hot and deep and back to gentle. He pul s away to sit up and it\u2019s al I can do to silence the protest that proves unnecessary when he hauls me up to straddle his hips, facing him.</p><p>I lean in to kiss him as his hands wander under my thin, loose sweater, unhooking my bra with a slip of fingertips that graze bare skin and leave a trail of goose bumps in their wake. He\u2019s unbuttoned buttons and loosening clothing for better access, but he\u2019s never removed anything. I don\u2019t have the guts to pul the sweater over my head. Instead, I reach under the sweater and pul the bra straps down my arms, one at a time, pushing each arm back into the sleeves that hang over my hands, before dropping the bra on the ottoman behind me.</p> <p>He smiles, probably having seen that trick a thousand times. Before I lose my nerve, I scoot forward until I\u2019m pressed to him, wind my fingers into his hair, and kiss him like he kisses me when I haven\u2019t seen him in three or four days\u2014hard and hungry, sweeping my tongue across his lower lip. He grips me tighter and moans into my mouth, spurring me to move my attention to his neck, just behind his ear, one hand moving painstakingly down his chest, lower across his firm stomach, lower stil until he grabs my wrist. This movement feels familiar, though I could swear he\u2019s never held me like this before.</p><p>he\u2019s never held me like this before.</p><p>\u201cDori,\u201d his breath is hot in my ear as he holds my wrist securely, and then he rests his forehead against mine, panting. \u201cI... need to take a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I pul back, confused. This is not a moment in which guys request a break.</p><p>\u201cI need a minute or two.\u201d Something in my expression must disclose my worry because his hands come up to surround my face. He closes his eyes and takes a deep, slow breath and then he looks at me more earnestly than he\u2019s even done. \u201cI want you too badly. I need time to cool down, because I want to be inside you.\u201d Relief floods through me, fil ing me with the courage I lacked moments ago\u2014short-lived, existing just long enough to force out four smal words, barely audible, that could change everything between us.</p><p>\u201cI want you to.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 44</p><p>REID</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I lean back, cup her chin in my hand. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>She closes her eyes because I won\u2019t let her hang her head, won\u2019t let her turn her face away. \u201cI said I want you to,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>Everything goes silent then. The echo of our breathing, so thunderous just a moment ago, fades. \u201cDori. I didn\u2019t mean to imply that I can\u2019t control myself. We don\u2019t have to have sex.\u201d</p><p>I brush her hair back on one side, checking her mood-displaying ears. Her rosy, tel tale ears. Her voice is just above a whisper, her eyes stil closed. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not a virgin, Reid. So... it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Yeaaaah... probably best if I don\u2019t tel her I figured that one out a while back. But\u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter? What the hel does that mean? \u201cIt matters to me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes pop open and her mouth works for a moment, and final y she says, \u201cOh. I understand.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to read this, attempting to avoid a misstep with her, and for a moment I think she\u2019s shifting\u2014her foot\u2019s gone her, and for a moment I think she\u2019s shifting\u2014her foot\u2019s gone to sleep or her knees are locking. Then I realize she\u2019s pul ing away, and she\u2019s almost ful y standing before I grab her wrists. \u201cYou do not understand.\u201d Pausing in her effort to escape, she inhales a shaky breath. \u201cI\u2019ve misrepresented what I am to you, to my parents, to everyone.\u201d Her eyes brim with tears. \u201cI\u2019m a total fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, because you\u2019re not a virgin? \u201d I sputter. \u201cDori, I of al people would never hold that against you. How hypocritical do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>Her brow puckers, a wave of tears cascading down her cheeks, and I don\u2019t want to talk anymore. I want to pul her back down onto my lap and kiss her until she can\u2019t think of anything but me, and us, and what she wants right now.</p><p>\u201cBut you said it matters\u2014\u201d she sucks in a smal sob.</p><p>\u201cYes, it matters, goddammit.\u201d I stand and take her face in my hands. \u201cIt matters that you never throw yourself away on someone you don\u2019t real y want just because of some archaic black and white concept of morality. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019ve slept with one guy, or dozens.\u201d She winces and I hold her steady. \u201cYou\u2019re a good person, Dori.\u201d She tries to move her head side to side in my hands and I won\u2019t let her so she closes her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, you are.\u201d</p><p>She sucks in a shaky breath. \u201cYou aren\u2019t...</p><p>disappointed?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWhat? No. At times like this, I\u2019m confused. And sometimes, when you leave, I\u2019m frustrated as hel . But disappointed? Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d She blinks up at me with her big Bambi eyes.</p><p>\u201cLike I said.\u201d</p><p>Pushing my hands through her hair, I pul her closer, and she leans into me. My thumbs sweep the remaining wetness from her cheeks. \u201cDo you want me, Dori\u2014or do you think having sex with me seems like the only honest decision to be made?\u201d My thumb grazes across her mouth as the tip of her tongue snakes out to wet her lips\u2014running over the sensitive pad of my thumb. It takes every scrap of self-restraint I\u2019ve got not to crush her to me and forget this entire conversation.</p><p>She stares at her hands, curled against my chest. \u201cIs it...</p><p>horrible... if it\u2019s both?\u201d</p><p>I exhale. \u201cNot horrible.\u201d But not okay, either. \u201cCome here.\u201d I sit back down, and she sits next to me, turned towards me, knees under her chin, feet hooked under my thigh. My fingers run lazy patterns over her hands, down her shins through her jeans, swirl around her bare ankles. She shivers once and waits, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cLook, we don\u2019t have to talk about\u2014\u201d Other guys? Your sexual history? \u201c\u2014the, uh, specifics of anyone who came before. I could tel you that everyone makes mistakes... but I can\u2019t say that guy, or those guys, were mistakes for you.\u201d Brows creased, she doesn\u2019t reply. \u201cDriving drunk and slamming into someone\u2019s house\u2014 that was a mistake. You were exploring your body. Learning about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was one guy,\u201d she says, her voice breaking, and I feel like a total shit that this disclosure makes me euphoric.</p><p>\u201cAnd then one day... it was just over. And I don\u2019t know why, or wh-what I did wrong. I was s-so stupid.\u201d God, guys are dicks. \u201cDori, you trusted him and he hurt you. He didn\u2019t stick around, he lied, he made you feel used because you cared more than he did... and that misplaced trust felt like one huge mistake. But believe me, it was his mistake. Not yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReid...\u201d She buries her head beneath my chin, her body folded up like she\u2019s trying to crawl inside of me. \u201cHe... he...</p><p>I...\u201d Her breathing is quick and shal ow and I\u2019m scared to death of what she\u2019s going to say, because so help me God, if she tel s me that guy forced himself on her, I\u2019l have no choice but to find him and kil him.</p><p>My arms surround her and I fight to keep my voice level, unwavering. \u201cTel me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I stroke her hair. \u201cYes, you can.

Even if she had been with another guy\u2014or guys, the relationship was her and me, as failed as it was. I left her with a wretched choice to make and no way out of making it. I checked out, because I could.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn.

So this Colin guy dumps her, then she finds out she\u2019s pregnant, and her sister helps her take care of it. She\u2019s probably been raised on abstinence, and pro-life to boot. And to top it off, her sister\u2014the only person in the world who helped shoulder this burden\u2014is now one step up from a coma, with no interaction, no emotional connection to be had.</p><p>Christ, no wonder she went off the deep end.</p><p>Speaking of which, I am in way over my head.</p><p>Dori</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve just dumped al of this on him. Minutes ago, we were making out, and he said what he said, and I told him about Colin, and there it was, this secret, beating on the wal s inside where I thought I\u2019d locked it away forever.</p><p>Deb and I didn\u2019t discuss it again, after the decision was made and carried out. She tried, once, but I promised her that I was fine and swore I\u2019d rather forget it and get on with that I was fine and swore I\u2019d rather forget it and get on with my life, because that was the reason for the decision in the first place. To get on with my barely fifteen-year-old life.</p><p>I faked the flu for a couple of days before going back to school. And then I survived the remaining weeks of my freshman year\u2014seeing Colin in the hal s with his entourage, or his new girl, always smiling, not a care in the world. I learned to cry soundlessly, locked in a bathroom stal , doubled over, the heartache so bad it made me physical y il . I skipped class when I could get away with it, had trouble concentrating when I was there.</p><p>Maybe he had no idea what he\u2019d done to me. Maybe he was just a careless boy, with no idea that I would be emotional y crippled by his offhand dismissal. At the time, it felt orchestrated to crush me.</p><p>Submerging myself in an endless loop of depressing music and isolation, I was hol ow and faded, a ghost haunting her own life. When summer began, I started spending most of the day in bed with the blinds closed. I contemplated suicide briefly, but couldn\u2019t wrap my head around carrying it out.</p><p>Deb had just finished her first year of medical school, and her plans hadn\u2019t included coming home for summer.</p><p>Suddenly, though, she was there in her old bedroom across the hal \u2014her tidy shower caddy stored under the sink, her off-key serenade of pop songs in the shower echoing down the hal way every morning. She also resumed volunteering for community service projects\u2014something I\u2019d always been too young to do.</p><p>On her third day home, she plopped onto my bed with On her third day home, she plopped onto my bed with her cup of coffee, brushing the hair from my face. \u201cC\u2019mon, lazy butt. Get up. I need your help. These benevolent deeds aren\u2019t gonna do themselves.\u201d I moaned into my pil ow, but didn\u2019t budge. I remember the feel of her fingers pul ing gently through my hair. Maybe not from that morning, exactly, but because I couldn\u2019t remember a time when that wasn\u2019t part of her wake-up-Dori protocol. \u201cDori, honey.</p> <p>Listen... maybe you can\u2019t keep this to yourself any longer.</p><p>Maybe you need to talk to Mom and Dad.\u201d</p><p>I turned over. \u201cYou\u2019d be in trouble if they knew.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m a grown woman of twenty-three, and I can take care of myself with our parents. I\u2019m worried about you. Staying in bed al day, not seeing your friends, barely eating anything. You sleep nonstop and stil look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Mom and Dad must have cal ed her. I was the reason she\u2019d come home. They knew about the breakup, because there was no hiding the fact that Colin stopped coming to pick me up on the weekends. When asking me what happened only resulted in tears, they stopped asking. They must have gotten worried when the depression got worse instead of tapering off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. I just want to go on with my life like he never happened.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cOkay. If you get up. If you keep getting up every day, eat normal meals, sleep normal hours.\u201d She sniffed lightly. \u201cAnd if you shower daily, because lord knows you smel like a puppy rol ed in poop right now.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help smiling. It had been so long since I\u2019d smiled that the movement felt unnatural. She leaned her forehead to mine, whispering our declaration of devotion, spoken countless times over many years: \u201cI love you, baby sister of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d I played along, whispering back as she swam, blurry through my tears.</p><p>\u201cAs many grains of sand as there are on al the beaches in al the world,\u201d she recited the words like a tender incantation.</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>With the edge of her soft pink robe, she wiped away the tear that escaped at the corner of my eye and murmured,</p><p>\u201cForever and forever and forever.\u201d</p><p>Reid is dressed like a doctor\u2014lab coat and stethoscope\u2014</p><p>and he\u2019s talking to God. Or someone wearing a shimmering white robe and looking an awful lot like God.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I understand. She wil . Bye.\u201d</p><p>At the snap of my cheap flip phone shutting, I open my eyes. I\u2019m lying on the sofa in Reid\u2019s media room.</p><p>Everything comes into focus slowly. \u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d</p><p>He slips my phone back into my bag. \u201cYour dad.\u201d I frown. \u201cMy dad? Why?\u201d</p><p>He crouches down next to me so we\u2019re at eye level. \u201cI guess we fel asleep. It\u2019s real y late. I heard your phone ringing, so I answered it\u2014I figured it was best for them to know you\u2019re safe. I told him you\u2019d be home in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of dad stuff. Don\u2019t worry about it now. C\u2019mon.\u201d He takes my hand and leads me across the hal and into his room while I\u2019m thinking about everything I told him earlier.</p><p>At the edge of the bed he stops and his eyes travel the length of me. \u201cI think you\u2019d be more comfortable in something of mine.\u201d From his dresser, he chooses oxford striped boxers and a blue t-shirt, frayed at the neckline and sleeves, soft and faded from hundreds of washes. Putting the clothes into my hands, he stops me, one hand on my arm. \u201cDori. Are you al right?\u201d</p><p>I nod, certain I\u2019m lying. I am so, so far from al right. I should feel weird that I\u2019m about to sleep in Reid Alexander\u2019s bed. For the second time. But I forget, sometimes, who he is to the rest of the world.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l , um, change in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>When I come back into his room minutes later, the lights are very low\u2014just bright enough to see my way to the bed.</p><p>The clock reads 3:11 a.m. I climb in and hesitate before moving into his arms. His hands stroke up and down my back, his lips at my hairline. I feel exactly what I felt earlier\u2014</p><p>I need him to hold me so badly that I don\u2019t care what comes with it. Maybe that sounds weak-wil ed, but it isn\u2019t, because I want al of it. I just know that at some point, my wanting wil exceed his ability to give, and that wil be that. Until then, I don\u2019t want to think or analyze anymore. I just want to feel. I tip my face up and nuzzle the underside of his jaw, and he shifts slightly and kisses me. So careful, deliberate.</p><p>My eyes are adjusting to the dim light when I move to brace above him, my hair streaming down like a screen around my face. His hands are at my waist, on top of my shirt\u2014his shirt\u2014fingers drifting back and forth across the smal of my back, as though they\u2019re stuck in a loop, waiting for me to release them to wander with some magic word.</p><p>I don\u2019t know, exactly, what he wants from me. But I know what I want from him, and I lean down to claim it, my mouth slanting over his. Not until my tongue reaches out to lick the soft, ful part of his lower lip\u2014once, twice\u2014does he trace the interior of my mouth, gently, with his own. I run my fingers through his hair, marveling at the baby softness of it at the nape, and he fol ows suit, winding strands of my hair around his fingers, tugging me closer. When my hands slip below his shirt, tracing the planes of his chest with my fingertips, he strokes the curves of my breasts, mimicking every move I make.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see your ears clearly enough,\u201d he murmurs, hooking my hair behind my ears. Heavy and uncooperative, it fal s right back into its previous position, bordering my face.</p><p>\u201cMy ears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re very perceptive. They blush when the rest of you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel much like blushing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he says, bemused. I sit up and back, straddling him, trembling and anxious. My apprehension isn\u2019t going to stop me. The sheet fal s away behind me. \u201cDori?\u201d He rises to his elbows as my hands find the hem of my borrowed tshirt, trace the edge back and forth.</p><p>\u201cReid,\u201d I whisper, \u201cdo you have condoms?\u201d</p><p>He stares at my face for just a moment. \u201cYes,\u201d he answers, low and sexy. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he finishes, before the fear sinks in, before I change my mind, I grasp the bottom of the t-shirt, duck my chin, and pul it off in one fluid movement, dropping it over the edge of the bed. Fighting the urge to cover myself, I force my arms to stil at my sides, my hands braced on my thighs.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Chapter 45</p><p>REID</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>I won\u2019t say I haven\u2019t imagined sex with Dori, because I have and I do imagine it, but I didn\u2019t expect it to go this far tonight. That night at the club, I\u2019d have given odds of thirty to one that she wasn\u2019t a virgin. But I didn\u2019t see the heartbreak connected to that fact, or how it would play out. Even stil , her restraint has always seemed like a part of her genetic makeup. I assumed if I let her set the pace, it wouldn\u2019t happen for a while.</p><p>We\u2019ve been hanging out here two or three times a week for the past five weeks\u2014watching movies, playing video games, talking... We\u2019re not reckless every time she\u2019s over, though it\u2019s happened more often the more she trusts me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now I\u2019m propped on my elbows, eye-level with naked breasts, when I\u2019ve been celibate for a longer spel \u2014by far\u2014than any other time since I became sexual y active. I want her so badly that I\u2019m dizzy with it, buzzing with the desire to rol her under me and take what she\u2019s offering.</p><p>No cold shower could rid me of this hunger. I\u2019d need a tub ful of ice.</p><p>I sit up and she rocks back a bit, her chest grazing mine, only the thin fabric of my t-shirt between us. Her breathing is shal ow, warm little puffs of air, cinnamon-tinted from the toothpaste. Licking her lips, she stares at mine. I pul her close and kiss her, deeply\u2014an echo of a promise my body intends to keep.</p><p>She slides her hands under my shirt, and I break from her long enough to let her pul it off. And then we\u2019re skin-to-skin and I\u2019m losing my mind from the craving pushing every other thought and feeling aside. We kiss for long, torturous minutes, until final y I trail slow kisses down her neck, over her breasts, and in one movement I turn her onto her back, my tongue swirling around her navel, grazing the tiny bel y ring I discovered there a couple of weeks ago, during one of our reckless episodes.</p> <p>\u201cThat... is so unexpected and hot,\u201d I told her then, and watched her ears go scarlet.</p><p>Her hands clench fistfuls of bedding, and when my fingers dip into the waistband of her shorts, she lifts her hips. I want her more than I\u2019ve ever wanted anything, and she sure as hel wants me.</p><p>Through the haze of longing, my brain switches back on, reminding me that for years, sex has been nothing more to me than a temporary remedy for isolation. I felt no actual connection, not once, since Brooke. There have been times when the solitude would return only moments after, pul ing me under. I don\u2019t trust myself now, because this wanting is familiar, and Dori deserves to be more than another momentary high.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she breathes, her hands kneading my shoulders insistently. My untimely scruples aside, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m not satisfying her. The boxers are loose and low on her hips, no barrier to my palm slipping beneath to stroke her soft skin as I return to kissing her until we\u2019re both breathless, before sliding open-mouthed to return attention to her breasts and bel y, traveling progressively lower to the places my fingers have already explored. Her shocked response tel s me that there were some things Colin left out of her sexual education, the self-centered bastard.</p><p>I\u2019m grateful for the remoteness of my room from the rest of the house, because she can\u2019t keep her lower lip clamped between her teeth, can\u2019t contain what I make her feel. I\u2019m transfixed by the sound of her crying my name, her fingers twisting in my hair, her body trembling against me. She\u2019s soon satiated and drowsy, while I anticipate hours of struggle before I find oblivion.</p> <p>\u201cReid?\u201d she says, so softly that I\u2019m not sure, at first, that she\u2019s awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d I gather her closer, stroking her hair over her shoulders, splaying it out over the pil ow. \u201cGo to sleep, Dori.\u201d</p><p>She inhales slowly and breathes out a sigh, her eyes stil closed as she cuddles against my chest, and then she mumbles faintly, \u201cNo. Your turn.\u201d Without further warning, her fingers move over me, cautious but unerring, and she strokes her tongue over my nipple.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take very much. Or very long, I\u2019m embarrassed to say.</p><p>Despite the crushing weight of the expectations placed on her, from the theological to the self-inflicted, what I needed was the last, selfless thought in her sleepy head.</p><p>Sated and awed, I fal asleep with her locked in my arms.</p> <p>Dori</p><p>This waking is only similar to the last night I spent in Reid\u2019s bed in one respect\u2014the hangover sensations: headache, dry eyes, exhaustion. The cause is far different, though; a thick outpouring of grief wil do that.</p><p>Unlike the last time, though, I\u2019m wearing his boxers and the t-shirt I wore to bed... and took off. Blurred memories surface of him reaching for me, pul ing it over my head, caressing me to sleep like Deb used to do when I had nightmares. He lies next to me, breathing metrical y, his lashes feathered closed, his lips barely parted. We\u2019re curled in on each other, al arms and legs intertwined. One of his hands holds one of mine, loosely, while the other rests on my hip. It takes several minutes to careful y untangle my limbs from his.</p><p>I can\u2019t think, and I need to get home. Last night, when Reid told me he\u2019d talked to Dad, I was too fuzzy to think about consequences, but this morning, the cost of this night is staring me in the face. I may be eighteen, but I\u2019m stil the daughter of concerned parents, stil financial y dependent on them, stil eager for their admiration. Even if I\u2019m unworthy of it.</p><p>I always knew my secrets were safe with Deb. That she\u2019d never tel , never judge. And while she was there for me to lean on\u2014somewhere in the world, loving me\u2014I could stand it. Perhaps I created a ticking time bomb, ignoring it al this time, and this pointless remorse would have come bubbling up even without the loss of my sister as a confidant. But I have lost her. She\u2019s not gone, but she\u2019s not here. My parents stil plead with God for a miracle, believing that Deb can be restored to her life, to her future, to us. I\u2019d give anything to walk into her room and have her eyes meet mine instead of staring through me as though I\u2019m invisible.</p><p>I know that\u2019s never going to happen.</p><p>Maybe my lack of faith prevents the miracle from occurring. This is what my conscience, if that\u2019s the name of the voice in my head, tel s me. I don\u2019t know if a conscience can be wrong, or misguided, simply ignorant of al of the facts. Whatever the voice is, wherever it comes from, it\u2019s subjective and unrelenting. Just not convincing.</p><p>Deb was the only person who knew who I real y was. Al of me. Now, Reid knows.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sorry for what we did. I didn\u2019t think I was capable of ever trusting like that again. Letting go. Touching and being touched without a trace of self-consciousness.</p><p>Instead of leaving me feeling dirty, I feel clean. I unloaded my soul. I burdened him with my ugly little secret. He doesn\u2019t have to carry it forever. Once I\u2019m gone, he can lay it down. Leave it there. Forget. I\u2019l never be able to do that, and I couldn\u2019t deal, alone. Not for a single day more.</p><p>I pul on my jeans, brush my hair back and fasten it at my nape with an elastic I dig out of my bag, wash my face, brush my teeth. I have a travel-sized Crest in the Mary Poppins bag, but I use Reid\u2019s organic whitening toothpaste instead. It tastes like him.</p><p>When I come out of the bathroom, he\u2019s stil sound asleep. He\u2019s rol ed onto his stomach into the warm place I left behind, sculpted arms around the pil ow, bare shoulders above the sheet. I swal ow the lump in my throat as I walk to his side and pul the covers higher. He sighs and burrows farther under, and I can\u2019t stop my fingers from sweeping the hair from his forehead. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve been playing at\u2014hiding from the paparazzi, from my parents, from everyone. I don\u2019t know what this is, or was.</p><p>And then I think: I could fight for it. For him.</p><p>Turning the thought over in my mind, I stare down at the shel curve of his ear, poking out between wisps of tousled dark blond hair. He\u2019s overdue for a haircut because I\u2019d whispered that I like it a little too long. My gaze moves to the relaxed lines of his mouth\u2014lips both yielding and demanding. I think of what he did to me last night with that mouth, and I can barely breathe.</p><p>I could go home and inform my parents that I love and respect them, but I\u2019m eighteen and I have my own life to live, my own choices to make. Adrenaline spikes through me as I imagine their possible reactions in light of Dad\u2019s statement: as long as you\u2019re living here. Would they yel ?</p><p>Lay down the law? Kick me out? I\u2019m terrified of their anger and disappointment, but the thought of severing my and disappointment, but the thought of severing my connection with Reid before I even know what it could be seems far more dismal.</p><p>I kiss Reid\u2019s forehead. He\u2019s such a sound sleeper that he barely stirs beyond another sigh. I pul on my jacket and leave a note under his phone: Going home to face the music. I\u2019ll call you later. I chew my lip, take a deep breath.</p><p>My optimism is trying to push through. At least I won\u2019t have to lie about seeing him anymore\u2014that cover is blown. Mom and Dad won\u2019t actual y throw me out, wil they? I\u2019ve never defied my parents before, not like this, not even close. I have no idea what they\u2019l do. But I feel strong. I can do this. I can do this.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry, I add to the note, and then sign D.</p><p>After I let myself in, I find them both in the kitchen, parked in their usual places at the table. I take a deep breath and try to assess where we stand. Mom is in her hospital scrubs, the baby blue ones with the tiny darker blue stork print. Dad is dressed, shoes and al , despite the early hour. Coffee mugs are clenched in their hands. Both of them glance in my direction and then at each other, silently communicating, a skil they\u2019ve perfected.</p><p>I pour myself a cup of coffee even though I\u2019m far too on edge to add caffeine to my system. I pul my chair out and lower myself into it, hoping they\u2019ve already told each other that it\u2019s time to let go, let me make my own decisions, come to my own moral conclusions. Heat floods my face as I realize that they believe Reid and I had sex. Of course, there was intense intimacy in what Reid and I did. The fact that we did sleep together, for the second time, was also intimate. Al of it, however, is not their business, and I prepare to say this to them for the first time ever while I wait for one of them to speak. My heart is pounding.</p><p>Dad clears his throat. \u201cDori, your mother and I have some things we\u2019d like to say before you... tel us your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Gripping the warm mug in my hands, I am perfectly stil , listening.</p><p>\u201cFirst, we want to apologize. We\u2019ve neglected you, ignored you even, since your sister\u2019s accident. Please understand, we never intended for you to think you weren\u2019t important to us, too. That you weren\u2019t as... as loved as Deborah.\u201d He falters and I feel tears burning. \u201cWe know you\u2019re not a child anymore, but you don\u2019t have the life experiences we do. We can\u2019t stop wanting to keep you safe just because you\u2019re a legal adult.\u201d This approach is unanticipated and I can\u2019t shift gears fast enough to catch up.</p><p>Their earnest expressions mirror each other. \u201cDori.\u201d Mom\u2019s voice is hoarse\u2014she must have cried al night. She takes my hand. \u201cHoney, what you\u2019re doing is dangerous and self-destructive. I understand why you\u2019d react this way, after what\u2019s happened to Deb. But please, don\u2019t do this.</p><p>This boy isn\u2019t safe. This relationship can\u2019t last\u2014you must know that. I remember how you were after your breakup with that Colin... we couldn\u2019t shake you out of your depression. Your dad and I were terrified at how you reacted to that loss. If not for Deb coming home...\u201d She breaks with a sob, tightening her grip. Deb wil never come home again. \u201cI can\u2019t lose another daughter now. Please, Dori.\u201d</p><p>Tears stream down my face and my brain races back over the past several weeks. I have behaved dangerously and acted in a self-destructive manner. I went to a club, got fal ing-down drunk, and almost left with a stranger. I could have been raped or beaten up. I could have been kil ed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My relationship with Reid is unspecified and tenuous.</p><p>I\u2019ve known, and even last night I knew, that it won\u2019t last.</p><p>Basking in him, I closed my eyes to the inevitable conclusion and how it wil affect me. For the first time, I compare my feelings for Reid to what I felt for Colin, and I realize I\u2019m in deep. I\u2019m in so deep. I\u2019m fal ing for him, and if I al ow it to grow any stronger, the end wil devastate me in a way that would make Colin\u2019s desertion seem trivial.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I start to sob, my face in my hands. Their chairs scrape like Mom\u2019s did the last time we discussed Reid, but they aren\u2019t storming out. They\u2019re putting their arms around me, tel ing me they\u2019re sorry, too. And I know I\u2019m going to cal Reid and thank him for everything he\u2019s done, because he\u2019s been better to me than I ever could have expected him to be. And then I\u2019m going to tel him goodbye.</p> <p>Half an hour later, alone in my room, that\u2019s exactly what I do. He doesn\u2019t speak for a ful minute, but I hear him breathing so I stay on the line and let him absorb what I\u2019ve said, and I close my eyes and hug Esther and pray I can take whatever he says, because he\u2019s bound to be angry, and he has every right to be.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he says, control ed and quiet. \u201cGoodbye, Dori.\u201d</p><p>The line goes dead and I cry until I fal asleep, curled into a tight bal in the middle of my bed and holding onto my dog, clinging to any comfort I can find.</p><p>Chapter 46</p><p>REID</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen your friend\u2019s car out back in a while.\u201d Mom is perched on my bed, skimming through the pages of that novel with the hot-but-sul en fictional boy who reminds me of my Wil Darcy role from School Pride\u2014if Wil Darcy had been created in the pages of a dystopian novel. (What the hel is it about brooding guys that\u2019s attractive to women, anyway? I\u2019ve become one since Dori\u2019s cal three weeks ago, and it\u2019s made me more of a chick magnet. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised\u2014being a dick never hurt my appeal before.)</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she hasn\u2019t been here.\u201d I would wonder that Mom noted her absence, but she has a way of noticing everything, even when she seems to be in too much of a stupor to notice anything but her own feet, shuffling through the house. Her eyes seem clearer now, however, staring at me like a reflection.</p><p>\u201cDid you two have an argument?\u201d She asked this same question when Brooke stopped coming over, after we broke up.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThere was no fight at al , actual y. Her parents didn\u2019t want her seeing me, so she just gave up.\u201d I don\u2019t know if this is true, but it feels true. I should have known she\u2019d submit to their wishes eventual y. Did they make her feel ashamed of spending the night with me, or just spending time with me at al ? Did they threaten to kick her out? I\u2019ve never understood the ultimatum-delivering parent.</p><p>Part of me rises to that\u2014I could have rented her a place if they\u2019d fol owed through. Or hel , I could have gotten u s a place.</p><p>Wow, shit. Gotten us a place? I am gone. Over Dorcas Cantrel , a girl who convinced me in a one-minute phone cal that I meant nothing to her: I\u2019m grateful for everything you\u2019ve done for me\u2014you probably saved my life. But I can\u2019t see you anymore. I\u2019ve got too much going on right now, and I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing anyway, you and I.</p> <p>It\u2019s just... my parents need me, and it\u2019s time I get back to my life and let you go back to yours. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>She\u2019d choked back a sob then as I lay in my bed with my phone to my ear, trying to wake up and waiting for her to say something else. To take it back. She hadn\u2019t.</p><p>After I hung up, I threw my phone across the room where it struck the wal with enough force to leave a dent in the sheetrock and crack the screen irreparably. And then I found her note next to the bed. The one with \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d preceding her scripted D. An hour later, after I calmed down enough to form coherent thoughts, I dug the crumpled note out of the trash, smoothed it out on the desk and read it through fifty times, trying to make sense of the combination of her spoken and written words\u2014 absolute antitheses of each other.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Mom says, going back to reading.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She angles one eyebrow, but doesn\u2019t lift her eyes from the book. \u201cMaybe you gave up too easily.\u201d I laugh. Right. If only it was that simple.</p><p>She checks her watch, slides off the bed, and walks over</p><p>\u2014steadily\u2014to ruffle my hair. \u201cI have a meeting to get to. We can talk later, if you want?\u201d Newly manicured fingers under my chin, she tilts my face up, and I notice her eyes are clearer. She\u2019s trying to stop drinking again. I don\u2019t want to ask. Don\u2019t want to jinx it.</p> <p>I stomp down the burst of hope in my chest, nod into her hand. \u201cSure, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWil there be anything else, Mr. Alexander?\u201d The rep delivering my new Ferrari FF is smokin\u2019 hot and practical y purrs this question. She\u2019s taken every opportunity to brush against me or lean in such a way that I can see right down her silky top, the top three pearled buttons unfastened.</p><p>We\u2019ve gone over every spec and completed a thorough inspection to ensure that not a single surface scratch mars the metal ic pewter gray paint or the pale gray leather interior. No further reason to keep her here unless I want to do her on the hood (total y possible\u2014this girl is not in the running for a subtlety award).</p><p>In my head is John\u2019s voice\u2014 Why the hell not?</p><p>My newly enlightened thought processes, that\u2019s why not.</p><p>Such as wondering what she sees in me, aside from a young, rich celebrity. None of that counted worth a shit to Dori. I don\u2019t know what did count to Dori. I don\u2019t know what changed between the day I met her\u2014when she couldn\u2019t wait to be rid of me, to the kiss in the closet, to the night out before Vancouver and Quito, to the moment she agreed to defy her parents and hang out with me several nights a week. What happened to make that last night together possible?</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019m good,\u201d I tel her, and she huffs a disappointed sigh. No doubt she\u2019l report to everyone she knows that I\u2019m definitely gay. I don\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l just, uh, cal for a car to pick me up then.\u201d She gives me a pouty glare while I\u2019m wondering why she didn\u2019t just ride back with the delivery truck.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, I\u2019l drop you off. We can test the zero to sixty in what was it\u20143.7 seconds? This baby needs a little breaking in before I park it in the garage.\u201d She perks up for a moment, until she figures out I\u2019m actual y interested in the car, and only the car.</p><p>My sunglasses are almost unnecessary with the darkest legal tint possible on the windows. Though I hit sixty before the end of my street, I\u2019l have to wait for a deserted highway to test the highest recorded speed of 200 plus. Within minutes, we\u2019re on Santa Monica and turning onto Wilshire.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure there\u2019s nothing else you need\u2014\u201d she begins, leaning towards me al surplus cleavage and lacy bra when I pul up in front of the showroom window. I\u2019m ready to shove her out the door because yeah sure, I can\u2019t help wanting some of that when it\u2019s tossed onto a platter and served hot. Why. The. Hell. Not? the John voice says.</p><p>\u201cNope, nothing.\u201d When you final y figure out what you real y want, everything else pales in comparison. I never got that before. I get it now. \u201cThanks, uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria.\u201d She bestows a tight smile and hands me her card.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d As I shove the card into my wal et, it sticks on a scrap of paper amongst the receipts and cash</p><p>\u2014Frank\u2019s cel number, scrawled on the back of an IN-N-OUT receipt. I haven\u2019t talked to Frank since August\u2014my last day at the Diego house. Maybe I should check in.</p><p>Dori</p><p>Three days until Christmas. Four weeks until school begins.</p><p>Talking to Nick helped me realize that part of my absentmindedness can be attributed to the fact that I have nothing mental on which to focus. I began regarding school as something to ground me, rather than something too chal enging to handle. I saw an advisor, registered for classes, and got very lucky on a vacated dorm room, al within the past two weeks.</p><p>I\u2019m dumping pasta into the colander when Mom comes home from visiting Deb. \u201cDinner on the table in ten minutes,\u201d I tel her, turning to stir the sauce.</p><p>When she doesn\u2019t reply, I glance back and she\u2019s dropped into a chair at the table with a bewildered look. My stomach drops at her expression. I should have gone with stomach drops at her expression. I should have gone with her this afternoon instead of evading her let\u2019s-pretend-Deb-responds display by spending hours in the kitchen making a from-scratch sauce that could have just as easily come from a jar.</p><p>\u201cMom? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She\u2019s stil frowning, but she looks perplexed, not distraught. \u201cThey needed my approval to move Deb to a different room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head slowly. \u201cSomeone set up a trust to pay for a private room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s great. Who?\u201d</p><p>Her head is stil moving placidly side-to-side. \u201cThey have no idea beyond the law firm that administers the trust. I could cal them tomorrow... but wouldn\u2019t that be looking a gift horse in the mouth? This is a miracle...\u201d And just like that, Mom\u2019s crying, Esther is resting her head on Mom\u2019s knee and whining, and Dad is bul eting out of his study in a panic.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s someone from church?\u201d I offer, while my brain suggests Reid?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s someone from church?\u201d Dad says, moving to Mom\u2019s side.</p><p>They discuss the likelihood of anyone putting that kind of money out for Deb while I turn back to the bubbling sauce, reducing the heat and stirring. If Reid had anything to do with it, his attorney father would set it up, right? Easy enough to check. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the law firm?\u201d Mom shrugs. \u201cI don't know. I was so shocked, I forgot to ask.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m ashamed to admit that this is the first time I\u2019ve visited Deb without Mom or Dad. At the same time, I was relieved when Nick agreed to come with me. He says hel o to my sister, sticks around long enough to make sure I\u2019m not going to freak out, and then tel s me he\u2019l be in the lobby chatting up the receptionist if I need him.</p><p>I grin at his shy smirk. \u201cHer name is Sophie, and she likes cats and historical memoirs.\u201d</p><p>He taps his lip with one finger. \u201cCats, huh? I think I could work with that.\u201d Squeezing my hand, he says, \u201cText if you need me.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Deb, tel ing Nick, \u201cGo talk to Sophie. We\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t been alone with my sister since we moved her to LA. Before we came in, the nurse told me, \u201cShe\u2019s just finished lunch fol owed by a couple hours in the sun room, so you two can just spend time talking in her room if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Talking. Right.</p><p>I strol around the room, straightening things, until there\u2019s nothing left to rearrange, and then I perch on the upholstered chair in the corner. Deb\u2019s new room is located on the second floor, and has a window shaded by tal oaks, overlooking the landscaped commons area\u2014 home to a native flower garden, slate pathways, and smooth, worn wooden benches. Several residents sit with guests or wander the trails admiring the winter blossoms, flanked by aides. Deb sits in her chair, staring out the window, her eyes fol owing nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In my pocket is a slip of paper the office manager just gave me citing the law firm administering the trust paying for Deb\u2019s new room. It\u2019s incredibly upgraded\u2014not just in privacy, but in understated touches like the chair and the south-facing window, the better-quality bedding and furniture, the patterned rug underfoot. When I get home, I\u2019l explore the law firm\u2019s website and look for clues to the anonymous benefactor. For now, I\u2019m here with Deb, alone in the mute space between us, missing her laughter and her listening ear.</p><p>\u201cHey Deb,\u201d I say, my voice just above a whisper but crashing like waves into the silence. She doesn\u2019t stir, of course. \u201cI like your new room.\u201d Out her window, clouds move in streams across the leaden sky, lazy and slow. It never gets frigid in LA, but winter is stil chil y. \u201cNext time I come, I\u2019l bring a heavier sweater and we\u2019l check out the garden.\u201d Staring at her, I wonder if it\u2019s possible that she can hear me, even if she can\u2019t respond.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to find out who your secret admirer is, too.\u201d I remember giving Bradford the box of clothes and the ivy plant, and I can\u2019t speak around what feels like a fist in my throat. I\u2019ve discarded the notion that the room is from him. He\u2019s too immersed in medical school debt to do anything so extravagant. He checks in with Mom now and then, but the frequency is fal ing off. Bradford is moving on with his life, because he can.</p><p>\u201cI decided to go ahead and start at Berkeley next month.\u201d I glance at my watch. \u201cBut I\u2019l be around for a few more weeks, and I\u2019l visit on long weekends and breaks.\u201d I\u2019ve only been here eleven minutes. How does my mother stay here, chattering to herself, basical y, for an hour or more at a time?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starting a new Habitat project in a couple of weeks.</p><p>Roberta\u2019s the crew leader on this one. I\u2019m cal ing her tonight, to get details. I\u2019l tel you about it next time.\u201d I adjust her chair so she can see out the window without catching any glare should the sun emerge. I don\u2019t know what she sees, or if she can perceive or mental y process what she sees. Kissing her forehead, I squeeze her limp hand. \u201cI\u2019l be back soon. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Using the cal button, I let the nursing staff know I\u2019m leaving and walk down the hal way. Not until I reach the stairwel do my eyes wel up with tears. I breathe in and out, concentrating on keeping control, and I congratulate myself for visiting my sister, alone, for twelve whole minutes.</p><p>Chapter 47</p><p>REID</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m returning your cal \u2014or should I say calls\u2014since apparently, blatantly ignoring you doesn\u2019t work like it does on normal people. What d\u2019you want, Reid?\u201d I knew this wasn\u2019t going to be painless, but good God, Brooke can stil wind me up as much as she did at fifteen.</p><p>When she\u2019s pissed, her Texas drawl shows up. So as much as she\u2019d like me to believe she\u2019s only bothered, the accent tel s me she\u2019s stil angry.</p><p>My therapist would say this is a good time to utilize those anger-management tricks I\u2019ve been practicing when dealing with my father. One deep breath, in and out, and then another. Counting to three or ten or fifty before replying. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything, Brooke. I just need to say something, and I\u2019d like you to let me say it. Please.\u201d Silence. Shock? Considering the things we said to each other during our last few conversations, shock would be about right. \u201cSo talk,\u201d she says, not as tough as she\u2019d like to sound.</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Is this some kind of twelve-step bul shit? We haven\u2019t spoken in months. You made what you think of me loud and clear. This, Reid, is what\u2019s known as too damned late.\u201d</p><p>I run a hand through my hair and over my face and I admit, my first instinct is to abandon this whole plan. After al , Brooke hating my guts matters nada in the general scheme of things. I\u2019m a bigger Hol ywood entity than she is, so I don\u2019t need to worry about her vetoing my ability to obtain roles. But this isn\u2019t about me.</p> <p>Sucking in another deep breath and pushing it out, slowly, I\u2019m determined to get this apology out or die trying.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, I was wrong to abandon you when you found out you were pregnant, no matter what had happened between us. You were my girlfriend, and I should have been there to support whatever decision you made.\u201d She\u2019s not butting in, so I plunge ahead. \u201cThe only excuse I have is that I was a child then. Stil , I screwed up, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d There\u2019s no answer, and I count seconds, wondering if she hung up somewhere during that speech. Almost two minutes tick by. And then, \u201cI was thinking about... trying to find him,\u201d she says. \u201cNot to interfere or anything. Just to make sure he\u2019s okay. Would you... would you want me to let you know what I find out?\u201d</p><p>My jaw clenches while I fight the deep-rooted soreness of her betrayal, like a toothache that\u2019s never been dealt with. Not for the first time, I wonder why she acts like she knows it was mine. I\u2019m not saying that to her, though. Not again. With time comes perspective. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2014</p><p>if he\u2014was or wasn\u2019t mine. \u201cSure. That\u2019d be fine.\u201d She sighs. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. At the risk of trashing this little interlude, I\u2019l repeat what I\u2019ve said before.</p><p>He\u2019s yours. He can\u2019t possibly be anyone else\u2019s because when I turned that stick blue, I\u2019d never slept with anyone but you. So unless it was an immaculate conception, he\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Okay, wait. \u201cBrooke, the story, the photos, that guy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplete tabloid lies. I never cheated on you. Yes, after we had that fight I dirty danced with that guy at that club. I wanted to make you crazy jealous. I wanted you to come running back to me and say I was yours and no one else could have me. I did not, would not have cheated on you. Not with him, not with anyone.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been pacing my room, and now I sit heavily on the edge of my bed, suddenly really glad I didn\u2019t cal her when I was out driving around because the surge of adrenaline is making my whole body quake.</p> <p>\u201cBrooke, why did you let me think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought you loved me and I didn\u2019t think I should have to convince you that I hadn\u2019t done something I hadn\u2019t done! And then I found out I was pregnant... and you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She stifles a cry. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about this anymore.</p><p>What\u2019s done is done. If I find him, I\u2019l send you the info. If you want.\u201d</p><p>My thoughts are spinning too quickly to take shape. \u201cI do.</p><p>I do want.\u201d</p><p>She sniffs, her voice smoothing out. \u201cOkay. I\u2019l let you know. Goodbye, Reid.\u201d</p><p>She hangs up before I reply.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I believe her now, but I do. I have a son.</p><p>Correction: I had a son, for a few minutes. Now he belongs to someone else\u2014and that\u2019s definitely just as wel . We were children. We would have had no business trying to raise one. That kid is, what, four? And this is the first time I\u2019ve ever real y thought about him. That\u2019s fucked up.</p><p>Dori</p><p>The wal above my desk is covered in cork squares.</p><p>Tacked to these are photos of those important to me\u2014my parents and Deb, Kayla and Aimee, Nick, and of course, Esther. In one corner are two group shots of my VBS kids from last summer\u2014one taken the night of their parent program, everyone standing straight and tal around me, al toothy smiles and Sunday best clothes, and the second with Mrs. K at the pool\u2014the kids clustered al around her like bees on a honeycomb, Jonathan clinging to one hip and Keisha to the other, grinning at each other. There are snapshots of people from Habitat, from church, from Quito, and people from school I may never see again. Everyone who matters to me is represented on this board.</p><p>Except Reid.</p><p>I checked the law firm administering Deb\u2019s trust. It isn\u2019t his father\u2019s firm, and I didn\u2019t recognize any of the attorneys on the site by name. I couldn\u2019t find a connection.</p><p>I\u2019l be helping out on a new Habitat project for the next couple of weeks, until I leave for Berkeley. When I talked to Roberta last night, she told me that an anonymous someone donated three new cars to the Diegos the day they got the keys to their house. I was in Quito then, and hadn\u2019t talked to her about anything but Deb since I got back.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea who did it?\u201d I pressed.</p><p>\u201cNone at al . I confess, I thought perhaps Mr.</p><p>Alexander... but he\u2019d have wanted the publicity, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d I heard the other question in her voice. Like everyone else, she\u2019d seen the reports of the two of us together and she suspected I knew more than I was letting on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It\u2019s been a month since that last phone cal . I\u2019m fine when I\u2019m busy, when I purposeful y throw myself into anything that wil block out the thought of him. Like when I was in Quito, though, the nights are the worst\u2014</p><p>staring into the darkness and recal ing everything I\u2019d begun to love about him, from the way he chal enged me to the way he touched me.</p><p>\u201cWe have a celebrity group helping out this time,\u201d Roberta said, switching gears. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be ideal for this project, with your celebrity experience.\u201d I wanted to interrupt her to ask exactly what experience she was referring to, but decided against it. \u201cThere may be paparazzi issues again.\u201d She actual y sounded a bit enthused by this idea, and I fought not to snicker. Roberta, starstruck. \u201cPeople filming from rooftops and leering over fences\u2014insanity!\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, glad she told me this over the phone so she couldn\u2019t see me fighting back laughter. \u201cWho are the celebrities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re from some movie that\u2019s coming out soon,\u201d she said, vaguely. \u201cThese publicity things are so helpful.</p><p>Remember when we had those people from that soap opera? Donations and volunteers were up for months afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I can\u2019t quite recal ...\u201d Too weird. Roberta is never unfamiliar with the people showing up on her worksite. She launched into project talk, and I forgot to ask again.</p><p>Now I\u2019m staring at an email from Ana Diaz, the mission director in Quito. We\u2019ve been emailing about what had happened to Deb, and how I plan to start at Berkeley a semester late, and whether or not she can use my help this coming summer.</p><p>Dori,</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I forgot to tel you\u2014several months ago, we received a large donation from an anonymous source. It was enough to balance our books for the first time in a decade. Then, just before Christmas, a law firm in Los Angeles contacted us about a trust someone set up. The disbursements are enough to run the entire program, leaving other donations to rebuild schools and fund medical programs. I only wish I knew who to thank!</p><p>Ana</p><p>I hit reply to ask the name of the law firm, and minutes later, I get her answer. It\u2019s the same firm administering Deb\u2019s trust. Ana included the name of the contact attorney</p><p>\u2014Chad Roberts. I have no idea who he is, but I\u2019m determined to find out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPopsicles,\u201d I mutter, staring at the search engine results. There are a lot of guys named Chad Roberts in the world, and none of them are directly connected to Reid Alexander. I don\u2019t have time to do a more thorough search now. I have to be at the new Habitat project in twenty minutes\u2014we\u2019re restoring two foreclosed homes in the same neighborhood this time, with the help of an entire group of celebrities, apparently.</p><p>Oh, joy.</p><p>Chapter 48</p><p>REID</p> <p>Dori is facing away, standing in the center of a room so similar to that first room we painted together that we could have been transported back in time. She\u2019s humming while examining the spec sheet and wearing the same familiar shorts and construction boots with her faded M.A.D.D. tshirt. Ponytailed, her hair hangs down the center of her back. Buckets of paint and painting implements are spread across the tarp in the center of the room.</p><p>Everything would be d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu except for this\u2014I know how soft her hair feels when I push my fingers through it, and how it looks loose around her shoulders or flowing over my pil ow while she sleeps. I know her scent, like something sweet and edible, an observation I whispered months ago when I wanted nothing more than to make her shiver from wanting me. I know her muscular shoulders and arms, her soft breasts. I know the feel of the tiny silver ring in her navel, its single heart-shaped charm brushing against the tip of my tongue. I know the firm curve of her waist, the smooth flare of her hip, the taste of her mouth. I know the feel of her losing control against me and trusting me to catch her when she comes apart.</p><p>Even stil , there\u2019s more to this complex girl, and the physical craving I feel for her is merely an index to the rest of it. I know her patience, her kindness, her inherent desire to leave the world a better place than she found it. I\u2019ve felt her forgiveness, her strength, and her ability to see something good in anyone. The whole of her is overwhelming, and the fact that I may have found her only to lose her scares the hel out of me.</p><p>Having sensed my presence in the room behind her, she raises her head from the paperwork in her hands. Turning slowly, her eyes connect with mine and widen, and she blinks in disbelief. My heart slams against my ribs, daring me to close the distance between us.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss,\u201d I say. We\u2019re standing ten feet apart and I want to know if she\u2019s experiencing the same gravitational pul towards me that I\u2019m feeling towards her. Her eyes are black from this distance, and I stare at her lips, her ears, her hands that stil hold the specs\u2014they\u2019re shaking. That tremor is for me, though I know better than to feel infal ible because of it.</p> <p>\u201cReid?\u201d Her voice almost undoes me, speaking my name. I have this injudicious urge to do whatever the present-day equivalent is of grabbing her up, tossing her over my shoulder and finding a cave to make her mine. My hands clench and she notices.</p><p>\u201cI heard you need an experienced painter in here.\u201d I lower my chin and stare into her eyes. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019m your man.\u201d Her breath catches as I move closer. \u201cJust so you know\u2014I don\u2019t believe in going halfway. I won\u2019t quit until the job\u2019s been performed to your complete satisfaction.\u201d Her lower lip trembles and she sucks it into her mouth just enough to catch it with her teeth. \u201cWhat then?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhen everything is done?\u201d</p><p>Careful y, I touch my fingers under her chin and her lips open, her breath hitching again as she looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cThen I start over, yeah? No such thing as \u2018done.\u2019\u201d Her eyes slide down and she steps back, and I drop my hand. \u201cY-you can paint this room, and I\u2019l do the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d I say, and she nods and leaves the room at an almost-run. When she\u2019s gone I release a pent-up breath.</p><p>Round One, tied? This is going to kil me.</p> <p>Two photographers and a reporter from People have been assigned to this goodwil story. The public loves to see celebs acting like regular, generous people (who remain natural y beautiful while performing charitable acts, of course). Fans don\u2019t see the schedule interruptions we impose on said charitable project due to our lighting prep and rearrangement, or the makeup crew, or the video camera getting a few short takes for the online mag. The positive side is less paparazzi outside, since sanctioned photographers al owed up close\u2014with an authorized story</p><p>\u2014trump any photo someone could nab from a distance, even with the finest in telephoto lenses at their disposal.</p><p>Just before lunch break, I\u2019m alone and wondering if Dori wil be the one to retrieve me when my costar appears in wil be the one to retrieve me when my costar appears in the doorway. \u201cHey, sexy,\u201d Chelsea says, slinking across the room in her white shorts and cherry red tank, her hair in a messy updo, cascading perfectly around her flawless face.</p><p>\u201cOoh, look at you!\u201d She turns a little pirouette mid-room, admiring my work. \u201cYou\u2019re harboring some wicked DIY</p><p>skil s behind that pretty face and those buff biceps. Who\u2019d have thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho indeed,\u201d I say, automatical y posing for the cameraman who fol owed her in\u2014ful awareness of which side I\u2019m presenting, al wide smiles and exaggerated laughter. I'm looking at Chelsea and not the camera, like we\u2019re alone in the room. We do a few shots with me recreating rol ing mint green paint on a wal , though I\u2019ve already finished the first coat, including the patching, priming and cutting in top and bottom. There\u2019s not so much as a swipe of green on the ceiling or the floorboards, either.</p><p>As though I invoked her, Dori stands in the doorway the next time I glance up, taking in the room, the cameraman, the fact that Chelsea is hamming it up, holding a brush tipped in green paint and pretending to dab it on my nose. I take Chelsea\u2019s wrist and move the paintbrush away as Dori whirls and disappears. I cal her name, but she\u2019s gone.</p><p>Chelsea takes al of this in with wide green eyes and I rol mine when she says, \u201cIs that the Dori?\u201d And then I squint at her. \u201cWait. How do you know</p> <p>\u2014 Chad. Dammit, Chelsea. What the hel happened to attorney-client privilege?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say a thing to me, I swear!\u201d She holds up one hand and pantomimes placing the other on a bible. \u201cI just, you know, see things on his desk occasional y...\u201d Her fingers wrap around my arm and she whispers frantical y.</p><p>\u201cReid, please don\u2019t tel him. Oh, God, I would be in so much trouble. I swear I haven\u2019t told anyone anything and he\u2019s not discussed a thing with me.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and examine her face. Chelsea is a girl who absorbs gossip. She loves it but doesn\u2019t spread it unless it\u2019s common knowledge. \u201cFine. But leave it alone.\u201d She locks her lips and tosses an invisible key behind her, nodding.</p><p>\u201cCome on, gossip girl, let\u2019s go find your husband and get something to eat.\u201d</p><p>Dori</p><p>Every time I convince myself I\u2019l never see Reid again, he turns up. Roberta straightens every item on her desk and avoids my gaze while pretending she\u2019d forgotten that Reid was one of the celeb volunteers. The two red spots on her cheeks beg to differ. \u201cAnd anyway,\u201d her brows crinkle, \u201cI was under the impression you two were friendly.\u201d Now it\u2019s my turn to be visibly flustered, and with my darned ears ful y exposed, too. What can I say? My parents don\u2019t want me dating a Hollywood heartthrob who\u2019ll just use and discard me, or how about I told him I couldn\u2019t see him anymore and he couldn\u2019t comply fast enough, and now I haven\u2019t seen him in a month and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever have to be this near him again.</p><p>When I continue to stand there, silent and disconcerted, she misinterprets my uneasiness as repulsion. \u201cWe\u2019l find you a different project to work on. They\u2019l only be here this week. You can come back next week. I\u2019l just cal \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019l be fine.\u201d She thinks I dislike Reid, when nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>When I saw him this morning, I wanted to run across the room and throw my arms around him and not let go. I wanted to tel him I would take whatever he could give me, however long it lasts. That\u2019s when I recal ed the Janis Joplin quote Deb taped to her bedroom mirror years ago: Don\u2019t compromise yourself. You are all you\u2019ve got.</p><p>And then he said, \u201cHey boss.\u201d So glib and casual and over whatever had been there between us. Whatever I\u2019d imagined was there. The other stuff, the flirting, that was just classic Reid\u2014sexy and effortlessly seductive. And replicated with his stunning costar ten minutes ago.</p><p>Maybe I should switch projects. Be smart and bolt while I can.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got enough experience to be given specific tasks, so you won\u2019t have to supervise him or even be near him,\u201d Roberta says.</p><p>Fighting the urge to tel her she\u2019s got it al backwards, I nod and slip out back to get something to eat. I don\u2019t look around the yard for him, and don\u2019t intend to remain outside any longer than it takes to gather lunch and go back inside.</p><p>As luck would have it, what I grab is a bowl of fruit and an iced tea, and my ears go hot remembering the first time Reid tried to kiss me, when I shoved him away. I\u2019m Reid tried to kiss me, when I shoved him away. I\u2019m conscious of someone speaking nearby, hearing the name before I\u2019m ful y paying attention. \u201c...Chad Roberts, and despite my good looks, I\u2019m not an actor. I\u2019m just Chelsea\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>Frank laughs in response. \u201cThat is not a position to be taken lightly, young man. That girl is a firecracker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t I know it!\u201d They both laugh.</p><p>My head is spinning.</p><p>Chad Roberts.</p><p>Chelsea Radin\u2019s husband.</p><p>The same name of the attorney in charge of Deb\u2019s trust.</p><p>\u201cMr. Roberts? Could I speak with you a moment, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d He seems genial, and he is good-looking.</p><p>I\u2019ve had a hard time catching him separated from Chelsea\u2019s side. He and his actress wife are obviously friends with Reid, and I\u2019ve concluded that what I thought was flirting between Reid and Chelsea earlier was just the two of them play-acting for the photo shoot People is doing that wil benefit both Habitat and the opening weekend of their movie.</p><p>Jealousy is an unpleasant, alien sensation.</p><p>We walk a few feet from the demolition site\u2014Chad has been helping Frank take down a dilapidated shed in the back yard. \u201cThis may be an odd question, but by any chance... are you an attorney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d He gives me a perplexed look. \u201cDo you need legal assistance?\u201d</p><p>This is too bizarre to be coincidence. \u201cNo. Maybe. Um.</p><p>Do you work for Barnes, Bancroft and Cole?\u201d He pul s the work gloves from his hands and takes the water bottle I hand him. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath as al the dots connect. This has to link to Reid. There\u2019s no other explanation.</p><p>After a long drink, he peers at me. \u201cWhat is this in relation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a trust that you administer, I think. It\u2019s for Deborah Cantrel ?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flick towards the house, where Reid is, then right back to me, like he realizes he\u2019s giving something away. \u201cUm, yes, that\u2019s true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to know who\u2019s funding it.\u201d</p><p>Swal owing, he frowns. \u201cLook, Ms...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCantrel . Dori Cantrel .\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen and understanding dawns. \u201cOh. You\u2019re her sister, I assume?\u201d</p> <p>I nod and he purses his lips, laying a hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cWhile I can certainly appreciate your wanting to know that information, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not at liberty to say.\u201d I glance towards the house. Reid is inside, assisting with the kitchen demolition. Has he told his attorney not to tel me anything? And if so, why? \u201cHow can that be? I\u2019m her family. I have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>His look is placating, which makes me want to scream. \u201cI understand your feelings, Ms. Cantrel , I assure you. And there are copious details of the trust that I can divulge, if you\u2019d like. In fact, I\u2019d encourage you to come by my office you\u2019d like. In fact, I\u2019d encourage you to come by my office sometime next week perhaps so we can discuss those details\u2014but the identity of the donor is restricted information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d I know I\u2019m not going to get anything from him, and my frustration mounts higher with every composed rebuff he offers.</p><p>\u201cOur client wishes to remain anonymous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut... why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t answer that.\u201d</p><p>Reid exits the back door, glances around and catches sight of us speaking. \u201cCan\u2019t, or won\u2019t?\u201d I ask while staring at Reid, who hasn\u2019t moved. Chad fol ows my gaze and sighs, compressing his lips again\u2014a perfect analogy for the fact that I won\u2019t get anything further out of him.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what game this is, including the questionable twist of fate that put Reid on my Habitat project again. His eyes shift from his attorney to me and he remains frozen at the door. Did he think I wouldn\u2019t research that trust, wonder where it came from and who was behind it? I\u2019m torn between intense gratitude for what he\u2019s done for Deb and crushing terror of how easily it could end. And then I do the only thing I can do with this jumble of information.</p><p>I turn and leave.</p><p>Chapter 49</p> <p>REID</p><p>Wearing the same bewildered expression she wore this morning when she turned and I was there, and with the same tone of voice, she says, \u201cReid?\u201d from the opposite side of the stil -closed screen door, making no move to open it. Her dog stands next to her, staring at me with\u2014I swear\u2014its eyebrows knit in aggravation. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I want to be exasperated with her, angry even, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>What comes out is the thing that built and ran through my head al day, but without the fire. Like al that\u2019s left of me are these smoky whispered words before I dissipate and blow away. \u201cI\u2019ve come to ask how you do it. How you feel what I know you\u2019re feeling and then walk away like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what I feel?\u201d she returns, but she can\u2019t be angry either. There\u2019s surrender in her tone, and I focus on nothing but the hum of it, threading through her armored words to find me.</p><p>\u201cOpen the door, Dori.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head slightly.</p><p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d I ask and she nods, and I tel her again,</p> <p>\u201cOpen the door.\u201d</p><p>She reaches towards the inner handle and pauses. \u201cDid you do it? The private room for Deb?\u201d I nod once. \u201cWhy?\u201d My hands bracket the doorframe and it\u2019s al I can do not to fal to my knees, standing here looking at her and knowing that this is it, this is my one shot and there may not be another. She\u2019s strong and she\u2019s stubborn, and if I can\u2019t get her to admit how she feels, she\u2019l be lost to me. \u201cDori, open the door. Please. And I\u2019l explain whatever you want me to.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers brush over the lock and it clicks, but she doesn\u2019t move to push the screen door open, so I do. I step inside and let it close behind me, and our eyes link as I reach back and blindly shut the solid door, too, and turn the bolt. \u201cCome here,\u201d I say, reaching for her, and she sways towards me, bracing her smal hands on my chest. Keeping me at arm\u2019s length, in the most literal sense.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why?\u201d she asks, and I\u2019m struggling to comprehend how this could threaten her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I do it? Because I love you. There\u2019s no other motive\u2014I real y am that simple.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. I just told her I love her. There\u2019s no going back.</p><p>Nothing to do but own it. But there\u2019s the crux of the matter\u2014</p><p>I want to own it.</p><p>Her eyes are ful and her mouth trembles. \u201cWhat do you mean, you love me? And what about when you stop? What then? What happens to my sister then?\u201d</p><p>My hands are at her shoulders, tracing her arms and cupping her elbows as they bend to my need for her. \u201cI think love is a fairly self-explanatory emotion. And I don\u2019t plan to stop. But there\u2019s no stipulation. The trust Chad set up for your sister is life-long and has nothing to do with what I feel, or what you do\u2014or don\u2019t do. It can\u2019t be annul ed, if that\u2019s what worries you.\u201d</p><p>She starts to cry, tears running slowly down her face.</p><p>\u201cEverything worries me. How can you love me? I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m nobody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I not love you?\u201d I insist. \u201cNo one has ever affected me like you do. When you told me goodbye last month, I tried to let you go. I told myself it was the best thing for you because you wanted it. But you\u2019re wrong, Dori. I\u2019m good for you even if you don\u2019t know it yet. I know because I\u2019ve never been good for anyone before.\u201d I fight to keep the pressure of my hands on her relaxed and control ed. \u201cYou al but lost your sister, and fought through a loss of faith that would destroy most people, and you didn\u2019t fal to pieces.</p><p>You manned up when your parents needed you. But just because you\u2019re strong and resilient doesn\u2019t mean you never need someone to be there for you, to take care of you.\u201d I grip her elbows. \u201cYou needed me that night at the club.\u201d</p><p>She swal ows. \u201cI did. I did need you. But I can\u2019t be that helpless somebody-save-me type of girl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helpless. In fact you\u2019re the most maddeningly self-reliant girl I\u2019ve ever known\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that maddening?\u201d she cries, pul ing her elbows from my grip and wrapping her arms around herself.</p><p>\u201cBecause you won\u2019t let yourself need me,\u201d I say, the words echoing in my ears like the battle-cry of the co-dependent. \u201cBoth of us are so good at resisting being control ed, or having any control over someone else, that we don\u2019t know how to need and be needed. Last summer, I let myself believe I could get past what I felt for you, not because what I felt was insignificant, but because I always have. I don\u2019t linger over relationships. Hel , I don\u2019t have relationships. I didn\u2019t realize until I saw you in that club that I was no closer to getting over you than I\u2019d been the last time I\u2019d seen you, three months before.\u201d</p><p>I lower my voice and step closer, narrowing the gap between us. \u201cI\u2019ve changed since I\u2019ve known you. Not because you made me into someone else\u2014but because you showed me a path I\u2019d never paid attention to, and I chose to fol ow it. And yes, I\u2019ve asked myself over and over can it be that easy to just choose to be a better man? Can it be that fucking easy? \u201d</p><p>She flinches and I take her hands from where they have her opposite elbows in a death grip, pry them loose gently until our fingers intertwine. \u201cI\u2019l be more careful with that word. I\u2019m not trivializing this.\u201d She raises her eyes, wide and dark and wet. \u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019l wait, if I have to wait. I\u2019l do whatever it takes. But I want you, and wil continue to want you, and I should warn you\u2014I don\u2019t see it ending. I\u2019m al in, Dori. And I won\u2019t be holding back this time.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve laid my heart in front of her like an offering. I\u2019ve made my case and rested it. There\u2019s nothing more to say. We stare at each other, both so silent that I hear her dog\u2019s nails tap arthritical y across the floor to a large oval cushion where it flops down and regards us both with a sigh. Our hands are locked between us, and hope is there between us, too, because she isn\u2019t pul ing away.</p><p>Pushing up onto her toes, she presses her lips to my chin and along my jaw. I release her hands to grab her up, wrapping my arms around her while her arms twist around my neck and her fingers shove into my hair. \u201cReid,\u201d she gasps, her dark eyes on mine. \u201cI do... want you.\u201d My hands slide over her hips and when I lift her, she wraps her legs around my waist and fuses her lips to mine. I moan into her mouth and she responds in kind.</p><p>I stride to the stairs and go up, releasing the bottled up need in one long, breathless kiss. I can\u2019t get enough of her.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I say when we get to the top. She points down the hal , and I obey, no sounds but the greedy hum from her throat and mine, our mouths working in perfect concert, and the thump of my decisive steps on the ancient floor.</p><p>I lurch into her room\u2014watery blue wal s and fish swimming in a school across the ceiling and nothing out of place. Kicking the door shut behind me, I move to her bed and press her down on it. There\u2019s no contemplation or circumspection because she\u2019s pul ing at my shirt and kissing me harder than she ever has and we\u2019re frantic, like it\u2019s been years since we touched each other. Yanking buttons through buttonholes and stretching fabrics and unzipping zippers is al done in the few seconds in between kisses when we come up for air, because al I want to do in this moment is worship her with my eyes, hands and mouth.</p><p>Trailing her nails down my back, she arches into me, stil ing the breath in my lungs. She protests when I pul back, but grows mesmerized as my fingers slip over and around and under and through, and I fol ow the path with my lips and tongue. I kiss her stomach, flick the bel y ring with the nail of my index finger, and she gasps.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispers, and because of what has just occurred to me I\u2019m thinking godfuckingdammit but have enough sense not to say this aloud.</p><p>\u201cDori... as much as I seemed like a man on a mission when I showed up here, I didn\u2019t plan for... I didn\u2019t think...\u201d I rest my forehead against her ribcage. \u201cI don\u2019t have a condom,\u201d I confess.</p><p>\u201cThere are some in my bag,\u201d she says, so quietly that I barely hear her. I glance up in surprise and her ears go pink. She\u2019s lying alongside me wearing nothing but her cotton panties and she\u2019s mortified that she has condoms in her purse?</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I say, reaching to unloop the strap of her huge, familiar bag from the headboard where it\u2019s hooked over the smooth post cap.</p><p>\u201cAimee and Kayla\u2014the quack shack on campus was handing them out last week. They grabbed like a year\u2019s supply and insisted I take some.\u201d</p><p>I thrust my hand into her bag and root around amongst al manner of odds and ends, hearing the crinkle of square cel ophane packets when my fingers brush them. I grin, arching a brow. \u201cThere\u2019ve got to be at least a dozen in here.\u201d I drop a handful onto her bedside table, watching as the blush spreads to her face and descends down her neck. Her heart hammering beneath my palm, I kiss her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019l be put to good use, I promise.\u201d My voice is heavy and predatory, and she shivers under my hand.</p><p>I remove the last bits of clothing from us both, stroking and kissing her slowly and deeply until I can\u2019t hold back any longer. Rol ing onto my back, I lift her on top and tel her that she\u2019s in charge\u2014this time.</p><p>Dori</p><p>\u201cI should probably ask when your parents are returning,\u201d he murmurs into my ear. I can\u2019t believe he can stil make me bury my face in his neck after what we\u2019ve done, but apparently my sense of propriety survived intact. \u201cBecause I will win them over eventual y, and I assume I\u2019d be starting at less than zero if the moment they realize I\u2019m back is the same moment they walk in on me satisfying the hel out of their daughter. For the third or fourth time.\u201d He\u2019s lying on his side, propped on one elbow and tracing patterns across my skin. The sunlight flooding my room when we began has filtered to the ruddy, muted light of sunset.</p> <p>My fingernails rasp across the light stubble on his chin and his eyes close. \u201cHave I satisfied you?\u201d I whisper, and he growls and kisses me.</p><p>\u201cNo. I think I\u2019l need consistent access to you for some interminable amount of time to even begin to get ful of you.\u201d His touch feathers across my bel y and climbs upward.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are on a couples\u2019 retreat. They won\u2019t be back until Sunday.\u201d</p><p>His fingers halt at the lower point of my sternum and he crooks an eyebrow. \u201cPlease say you aren\u2019t teasing me.\u201d I turn my head back and forth against the pil ow and he kisses me hard and deep. \u201cCan I stay the night? Is that al owed?\u201d</p><p>I trace the line of his nose and one eyebrow and he leans into my hand and closes his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They wouldn\u2019t approve, and it\u2019s their house. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t approve of this, either.\u201d</p> <p>He nods, opens his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m wil ing to do this however you need, with one exception.\u201d I frown, my mind a riot of possibilities until he rol s his eyes. \u201cThe exception is I\u2019m not going away. Don\u2019t ask me to do that ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I say, ever doubting him. It isn\u2019t fair, how I doubt him, and I wonder if he\u2019l gather that my loss of faith extends further than I\u2019d ever known it would, severing lines of trust and leveling my confidence like a city-flattening tornado. I\u2019l be rebuilding a belief system from scratch over the next few months, maybe years, and it won\u2019t be easy. Or pleasant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been this sure of anything.\u201d His serious demeanor is broken when my stomach rumbles as though I\u2019ve forgotten to eat for days. His smile turns up on one side. \u201cExcept possibly that I\u2019d better feed you. Let\u2019s go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut, where people can see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as wel get used to being Reid Alexander\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d He laughs at the look on my face. \u201cOh, come on.</p><p>It can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d He pul s the sheet over our heads, straddling me in the darkness. \u201cFine, we\u2019l order in. One more day\u2019s reprieve to keep me a secret. Any longer and I\u2019l think you\u2019re ashamed of me.\u201d</p> <p>Some rough, vulnerable edge to his voice tel s me this statement isn\u2019t as offhand as it sounds.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be Reid Alexander\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d I say, and his smile fades. I reach up and frame his face with my hands, the heartbreaking need there so exposed that my eyes sting with tears. \u201cI want to be your girlfriend. As long as you\u2019re who you are right now, with me, I wil never be ashamed of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He echoes my earlier question, his dark blue eyes locked on mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been this sure of anything,\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>"]
