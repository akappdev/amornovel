She glanced nervously at her bedroom door. Lindsey\u2019s biggest fear was that her mother would find her and Brenda scanning the Dateline section of the Wednesday paper and discover what they\u2019d done.</p> <p>Okay, so it was a bit ... dishonest to write an ad on Meg Remington\u2019s behalf, but it was clear to Lindsey that her mom needed help. She was convinced that Meg wanted to remarry, whether she knew it or not.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if Lindsey could pull a potential husband out of nowhere. So she wrote the ad, with her best friend advising her.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Brenda said excitedly, pointing to the middle of the page. \u201cIt\u2019s here. Oh, my goodness! It\u2019s really here, just the way we wrote it.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey found the ad. She read aloud:</p><p>\u201cWanted: Perfect partner. I\u2019m dating-shy, divorced and seeking a man with marriage in mind. I look like a beauty queen, cook like a mom, kiss like a woman in love. Box 1234.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds even better in print,\u201d Brenda said.</p><p>\u201cDo you think anyone will actually respond?\u201d Lindsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI bet we get lots of letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think we should\u2019ve said her kisses taste better than chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t fit. Remember?\u201d They\u2019d worked long and hard on the wording. Lindsey had wanted to describe her mother as \u201cstunning,\u201d and Brenda was afraid it might not meet the truth-in-advertising rules.</p><p>All right, so her mother wasn\u2019t fashion model material, but she was very pretty. Or she could be, with a little assistance from the magazines Lindsey had been reading lately. Luckily Meg had a daughter who knew the ropes.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Linds,\u201d Brenda said with a romantic sigh. \u201cThis is the best thing you could ever have done for your mother.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey hoped her mom appreciated her efforts. \u201cJust remember, this guy has to be perfect. We\u2019ll need to be careful who we pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. If we don\u2019t like the sound of one guy, we\u2019ll choose someone else,\u201d Brenda said, as if they were guaranteed to have tons of applicants. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of our plan. We\u2019ll screen all the applicants before your mother has a chance to date them. How many teenagers get to choose their own stepfathers? Not many, I bet.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey returned her attention to the ad, gnawing on the corner of her lip. She was experiencing a twinge of pride along with a mild case of guilt.</p><p>Her mother wasn\u2019t going to like this. When Meg learned what she and Brenda had done, she\u2019d probably get all bent out of shape.</p><p>As for the ad, Lindsey figured if she were a man inclined to read the Dateline section, the ad would intrigue her.</p><p>\u201cSome men will write just because your mom\u2019s pretty, but it\u2019s the part about her being a good cook that\u2019ll really work,\u201d Brenda assured her. \u201cMy grandma says Grandpa married her because her German potato salad was so good. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>Brenda brought up a good point. \u201cHow will we know if a man is marrying her for her looks or her meat loaf or \u2018cause he loves her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Brenda said, \u201cbut by then we\u2019ll be out of the picture. Your mother will be on her own.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey wished she knew more about men. Unfortunately her experience was limited. She\u2019d only gone on two real dates, both times to school dances. And her mother had been a chaperone.</p><p>\u201cThe day will come when Mom will appreciate what we\u2019ve done for her,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who\u2019s always saying how important it is to go after your dreams.</p><p>Well, this is my dream for her. She wants a man. She just doesn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll she needs is a little help from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s got it,\u201d Lindsey said, smiling broadly.</p><p>One</p><p>Those girls were up to something. Meg Remington peeked in her fifteen-year-old daughter\u2019s bedroom to see Lindsey and her best friend, Brenda, crouched on the floor beside the bed. They were speaking in heated whispers.</p><p>Meg cleared her throat and instantly both girls were silent.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d Lindsey said, her bright blue eyes flashing.</p><p>Meg knew the look, which generally spelled trouble. \u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Brenda echoed with angelic innocence.</p><p>Meg crossed her arms and leaned her shoulder against the doorjamb. She had all the time in the world, and she wanted them to know it. \u201cTell me why I don\u2019t believe that. You two have the look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d Lindsey repeated, turning to Brenda.</p><p>\u201cThe one every mother recognizes. You\u2019re up to something, and I want to know what.\u201d She crossed her ankles, indicating that she\u2019d make herself comfortable until they were ready to let her in on their little secret. She could outwait them if need be.</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you must know,\u201d Lindsey said with a shrug of defeat. She leapt to her feet and Brenda followed suit. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t finished planning everything yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must know.\u201d Meg was struck by how beautiful her daughter had become over the past few years. She\u2019d gone from the gangly, awkward, big-teeth stage to real beauty almost overnight. Meg\u2019s ex-husband, Dave, had commented on the changes in Lindsey when she\u2019d flown from Seattle to Los Angeles to visit over spring break. Their little girl was growing up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing some heavy-duty planning,\u201d Brenda explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd exactly what are the two of you working on? I haven\u2019t seen you all evening.\u201d Generally, when Brenda stayed over, which was at least one night of every weekend, the two of them were up until all hours playing music, watching television or DVDs. The house had been suspiciously quiet all evening. Come to think of it, they\u2019d been spending a lot of time in Lindsey\u2019s bedroom of late. Far too much time.</p><p>The girls glanced at each other before answering.</p><p>\u201cYou tell her,\u201d Brenda urged, \u201cshe\u2019s your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lindsey brushed back the long strands of hair. \u201cBut it might be a little easier coming from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey?\u201d Meg was more curious than ever now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better sit down, Mom.\u201d Lindsey took Meg by the hand and guided her to the bed.</p><p>Meg sat on the edge. Both girls stood in front of her and each seemed to be waiting for the other to speak first.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an attractive woman,\u201d Lindsey began.</p><p>Meg frowned. This sounded like a setup to her, and the best way to handle that was to get straight to the point. \u201cYou need money? How much, and for what?\u201d</p><p>With her usual flair for the dramatic, Lindsey rolled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t need any money. I meant what I said\u2014you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Brenda piped up. \u201cAnd you\u2019re only thirty-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d Meg had to think about that. \u201cYeah, I guess I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve still got it, Mrs. Remington,\u201d Brenda cut in, her voice intense. \u201cYou\u2019re young and pretty and single, and you\u2019ve got it.\u201d Her fist flew through the air and punctuated the comment.</p><p>\u201cGot what?\u201d Meg was beginning to feel a bit confused.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in bad shape, either,\u201d Lindsey commented, resting her chin on one hand.</p><p>Meg sucked in her stomach, feeling pleased with the girls\u2019 assessment.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019d look even better if you lost ten pounds,\u201d her daughter said thoughtfully.</p><p>Ten pounds. Meg breathed again and her stomach pouched out. Those ten pounds had first made their appearance when Meg was pregnant with Lindsey nearly sixteen years earlier. She was downright proud of having maintained her post-pregnancy weight for all these years.</p><p>\u201cTen pounds isn\u2019t too much to lose,\u201d Brenda said confidently.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be hard at all\u2014especially with the two of us helping you.\u201d</p><p>Meg stared into their eager, expectant faces. \u201cWhy is it so important for me to lose ten pounds? I happen to like the way I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>Meg glanced from one girl to the other. \u201cMore? What is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to be physically fit. Think about it, Mom. When\u2019s the last time you ran an eight-minute mile?\u201d</p><p>Meg didn\u2019t need to consider that at all\u2014she already knew the answer. \u201cNever.\u201d She\u2019d jogged around the track during high school, only because it was required of her. The lowest grade she\u2019d ever received was in phys ed.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Lindsey said to Brenda.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work with her,\u201d Brenda answered. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have to start soon.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey crossed her arms and carefully scrutinized Meg. \u201cAbout your clothes, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy clothes?\u201d Meg cried, still astonished that her daughter wanted her to run an eight-minute mile. She owned a bookstore, for heaven\u2019s sake. In the eight years since she\u2019d bought out Mr. Olsen, not once had she been required to run for anything.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what\u2019s going on here,\u201d Meg said. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise we\u2019ll answer all your questions in a minute,\u201d Brenda explained. \u201cPlease be patient, Mrs. Remington.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey sighed. \u201cMom, I don\u2019t mean to be rude or anything, but when it comes to your clothes, well ... you need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d And to think Meg had been dressing herself for the past thirty-some years. Until now, no one had bothered to tell her what a poor job she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see you don\u2019t ever wear high-waisted jeans again,\u201d Lindsey said, as though pledging her life to a crusade. \u201cThey\u2019re called mom jeans,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo you two are official members of the fashion police?\u201d Meg asked. Apparently they\u2019d issued an APB on her!</p><p>Lindsey and Brenda giggled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it sounds like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to help you,\u201d Brenda said in loving tones.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to keep you from committing those fashion sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sins?\u201d Meg should\u2019ve known. \u201cDo you mind telling me what this little heart-to-heart is all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Mom,\u201d Lindsey said, in a voice that suggested the answer should\u2019ve been obvious.</p><p>\u201cWhy now? Why me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lindsey responded.</p><p>Meg started to get up, but Lindsey directed her back onto the bed. \u201cWe aren\u2019t finished yet. We\u2019re just getting to the good part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I appreciate what you\u2019re doing, but ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cSit down, Mom,\u201d Lindsey said in stern tones. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you the most important thing yet.\u201d</p><p>Meg held up both hands. \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike we already said, you\u2019re still young,\u201d Brenda began. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lindsey smiled sweetly. \u201cYou could have more children if you wanted and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait a minute!\u201d Meg cried.</p><p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re really saying is that you\u2019re quite attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I could be,\u201d Meg amended, \u201cwith a little assistance from the two of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot all that much,\u201d Brenda added sympathetically. \u201cWe just want to get you started on the right track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Meg muttered.</p><p>\u201cTogether,\u201d Lindsey said, slipping her arm around Brenda\u2019s waist and beaming a proud smile, \u201cwe\u2019re going to find you a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA husband.\u201d Meg\u2019s feet went out from under her and she slipped off the bed and landed with a solid whack on the carpet.</p><p>Lindsey and Brenda each grabbed one arm and pulled her off the floor. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d Lindsey asked, sounding genuinely concerned.</p> <p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve been more subtle,\u201d Brenda said accusingly. \u201cThere was no need to blurt it out like that.\u201d</p><p>Meg rubbed her rear end and sat back down on the bed. \u201cWhat makes either of you think I want a husband?\u201d she demanded angrily. She\u2019d already been through one bad marriage and she wasn\u2019t eager to repeat the experience.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you went out on a date?\u201d Lindsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d Meg snapped. \u201cWhat does it matter, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, it\u2019s clear to me you aren\u2019t thinking about the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future? What are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you realize that in three years I\u2019ll be in college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years,\u201d Meg repeated. \u201cNo-o, I guess I hadn\u2019t given it much thought.\u201d Although at the moment sending her daughter away actually seemed appealing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone isn\u2019t such a bad thing,\u201d Meg told them.</p><p>\u201cAt forty it is,\u201d Lindsey said dramatically. \u201cI\u2019ll worry myself sick about you,\u201d she continued.</p><p>\u201cShe will,\u201d Brenda confirmed, nodding twice.</p><p>Meg figured it was a good thing she was sitting down.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Mother,\u201d Lindsey said, \u201cwhat would it hurt to start dating again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoney, has it ever occurred to you that I\u2019m happy just the way I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lindsey returned. \u201cYou aren\u2019t happy. You\u2019re letting life pass you by. It\u2019s time to take action. I don\u2019t know what went wrong between you and Dad, but whatever it was must\u2019ve been traumatic. You haven\u2019t had a relationship since\u2014have you?\u201d</p><p>Meg didn\u2019t answer that question, but wanted to reassure Lindsey about the break-up of her marriage. \u201cIt was a friendly divorce.\u201d In fact, Meg got along better with Dave now than she had when they were married.</p><p>Brenda shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a friendly divorce. My dad\u2019s an attorney and he should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the divorce,\u201d Meg said in her sternest voice. \u201cIt happened a long time ago and bringing it up now isn\u2019t going to help anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might help you,\u201d Lindsey said, her eyes intense, \u201cbut I can understand why you don\u2019t want to talk about it. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, and a bright smile transformed her face, \u201cbecause you\u2019re going to get all the help you need from Brenda and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was afraid of.\u201d Meg stood up and moved toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYour diet starts tomorrow,\u201d Lindsey called after her.</p><p>\u201cAnd your exercise regime,\u201d Brenda added. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a thing to worry about, Mrs. Remington. We\u2019re going to find you a man before you know it.\u201d</p><p>Meg closed her eyes. If thirty-seven was so young, why didn\u2019t she have the energy to stand up to these two? She wasn\u2019t going on any diet, nor did she have time for exercising.</p><p>As for having Lindsey as a wardrobe consultant ... That was ridiculous, and Meg intended to tell her daughter and Brenda exactly that.</p><p>First thing in the morning.</p><p>Meg soon learned exactly how serious Lindsey and Brenda were about finding her a husband. She woke Saturday morning to the sound of a workout DVD playing loudly on the television in her bedroom.</p><p>She lay facedown, awakened from a pleasant dream about a sunny beach. Her arm hung over the side of the bed, her fingertips dangling an inch or so above the carpet.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, Mrs. Remington?\u201d Brenda called from the doorway.</p><p>She tried to ignore the girl, but that didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Brenda called a second time. She seemed to be jogging in place. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll go nice and slow in the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything without speaking to my attorney first,\u201d Meg muttered. She stuck out her arm and searched blindly for the phone.</p><p>\u201cForget it, Mom. That isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d Lindsey walked into the bedroom and set a coffee mug on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cBless you, my child,\u201d Meg said. \u201cAh, coffee.\u201d She\u2019d struggled into a sitting position before she realized caffeine had nothing to do with whatever Lindsey had brought her. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she barked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a protein supplement. The lady at the health food store recommends it for toning skin in women over thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re supposed to drink it?\u201d Meg asked.</p><p>Lindsey and Brenda looked at each other blankly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better check the instructions again,\u201d Lindsey said and carried it away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Remington, we\u2019ll have you whipped into shape in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d she pleaded. She couldn\u2019t be expected to do anything, let alone exercise, without caffeine.</p><p>\u201cYou can have your coffee,\u201d Brenda promised her, \u201cbut first ... \u201c</p><p>Meg didn\u2019t bother to listen to the rest. She slithered back under the covers and pulled a pillow over her head. Although it did block out some of the noise, she had no trouble hearing the girls. They weren\u2019t accepting defeat lightly. They launched into a lively discussion about the pros and cons of allowing Meg to drink coffee. She had news for these two dictators. Let either one of them try to stand between her and her first cup of coffee.</p><p>The conversation moved to the topic of the divorce; Brenda apparently believed Meg had suffered psychological damage that had prevented her from pursuing another relationship.</p><p>It was all Meg could do not to shove the pillow aside and put in her two cents\u2019 worth. What she should\u2019ve done was order them out of the bedroom, but she was actually curious to hear what they had to say.</p><p>Her divorce hadn\u2019t been as bad as all that. She and Dave had made the mistake of marrying far too young. Meg had been twenty-two when she\u2019d had Lindsey, and Dave was fresh out of college. In the five years of their marriage there hadn\u2019t been any ugly fights or bitter disagreements. Maybe it would\u2019ve helped if there had been.</p><p>By the time Lindsey was four, Dave had decided he didn\u2019t love Meg anymore and wanted a divorce. It shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise, but it did\u2014and it hurt. Meg suspected he\u2019d found someone else.</p><p>She was right.</p><p>For a long time after the divorce was final, Meg tried to convince herself that her failed marriage didn\u2019t matter. She and her husband had parted on friendly terms. For Lindsey\u2019s sake, Meg had made sure they maintained an amicable relationship.</p><p>Dave had hurt her, though, and Meg had denied that pain for too long. Eventually she\u2019d recovered. It was over now, and she was perfectly content with her life.</p><p>She\u2019d started working at Book Ends, an independent bookstore, and then, with a loan from her parents she\u2019d managed to buy it.</p><p>Between the bookstore and a fifteen-year-old daughter, Meg had little time for seeking out new relationships. The first few years after the divorce she\u2019d had a number of opportunities to get involved with other men. She hadn\u2019t. At the time, Meg simply wasn\u2019t interested, and as the years went on, she\u2019d stopped thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cMother, would you please get out of this bed,\u201d Lindsey said, standing over her. Then in enticing tones, she murmured, \u201cI have coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tricked me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s real coffee. The other stuff, well, I apologize about that. I guess I misunderstood the lady at the health food store. You were right. According to the directions, you\u2019re supposed to use it in the bath, not drink it. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Meg could see it wasn\u2019t going to do the least bit of good to hide her face under a pillow. \u201cI can\u2019t buy my way out of this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel much better after you exercise,\u201d Brenda promised her. \u201cReally, you will.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Meg didn\u2019t feel any such thing. She couldn\u2019t move without some part of her anatomy protesting.</p><p>\u201cYou did great, Mrs. Remington,\u201d Brenda praised.</p><p>Meg limped into her kitchen and slowly lowered herself into a chair. Who would\u2019ve believed a workout DVD, followed by a short\u2014this was the term the girls used\u2014one-mile run, would reduce her to this. In the past hour she\u2019d been poked, prodded, pushed and punished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your meals all planned out for you,\u201d Lindsey informed her. She opened the refrigerator door and took out a sandwich bag. She held it up for Meg\u2019s inspection. \u201cThis is your lunch.\u201d</p><p>Meg would\u2019ve asked her about the meager contents if she\u2019d had the breath to do so. All she could see was one radish, a square of cheese\u2014low-fat, she presumed\u2014and a small bunch of seedless grapes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have any more than the nonfat yogurt for breakfast, okay?\u201d</p><p>Meg nodded, rather than dredge up the energy to argue.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell her about dinner?\u201d Brenda asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Listen, Mom, you\u2019ve been a real trooper about this and we thought we should reward you. Tonight for dinner you can have a baked potato.\u201d</p><p>She managed a weak smile. Visions of butter and sour cream waltzed through her head.</p><p>\u201cWith fresh grilled fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like fish don\u2019t you, Mrs. Remington?\u201d</p><p>Meg nodded. At this point she would\u2019ve agreed to anything just to get the girls out of her kitchen, so she could recover enough to cook herself a decent breakfast.</p><p>\u201cBrenda and I are going shopping,\u201d Lindsey announced. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pick out a whole new wardrobe for you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing,\u201d Meg told her best friend, Laura Harrison, that same afternoon. They were unpacking boxes of books in the back room. \u201cAll of a sudden, Lindsey said she wants me to remarry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Laura found this far too humorous to suit Meg. \u201cBut she wants me to lose ten pounds and run an eight-minute mile first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I get it now,\u201d Laura muttered, taking paperbacks from the shipping carton and placing them on a cart.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey was in the store a couple of weeks ago looking for a book that explained carbs and fat grams.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m allowed thirty fat grams a day,\u201d Meg informed her. \u201cAnd one hundred grams of carbohydrates.\u201d Not that her fifteen-year-old daughter was going to dictate what she did and didn\u2019t eat.</p><p>\u201cI hope Lindsey doesn\u2019t find out about that submarine sandwich you had for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d Meg said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been that hungry in years. I don\u2019t think anyone bothered to tell Lindsey and Brenda that one of the effects of a workout is a voracious appetite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that phone call about earlier?\u201d Laura asked.</p> <p>Meg frowned as she moved books onto the cart. \u201cLindsey wanted my credit card number for a slinky black dress with a scoop neckline.\u201d Lindsey had sounded rapturous over the dress, describing it in detail, especially the deep cuts up the sides that would reveal plenty of thigh. \u201cShe said she found it on sale\u2014and it was a deal too good to pass up.\u201d She paused. \u201cNeedless to say, I told her no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would Lindsey want with a slinky black dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted it for me,\u201d Meg said, under her breath.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently once I fit the proper image, they plan to dress me up and escort me around town.\u201d</p> <p>Laura laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you might not be such a good friend after all,\u201d Meg told her employee. \u201cI expected sympathy and advice, not laughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Meg. Really.\u201d</p><p>She sounded far more amused than she did sorry.</p><p>Meg cast her a disgruntled look. \u201cYou know what your problem is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Laura was quick to tell her. \u201cI\u2019m married, with college-age children. I don\u2019t have to put up with any of this nonsense and you do. Wait, my dear, until Lindsey gets her driver\u2019s license. Then you\u2019ll know what real fear is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne disaster at a time, thank you.\u201d Meg sat on a stool and reached for her coffee cup. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you I\u2019m worried about all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Laura straightened and picked up her own cup, refilling it from the freshly brewed pot. \u201cIt\u2019s a stage Lindsey\u2019s going through. Trust me, it\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey keeps insisting I\u2019ll be lonely when she leaves for college, which she reminded me is in three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be?\u201d</p><p>Meg had to think about that. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I suppose in some ways I will be. The house will feel empty without her.\u201d The two weeks Lindsey spent with her father every year seemed interminable. Meg wandered around the house like a lost puppy.</p><p>\u201cSo, why not get involved in another relationship?\u201d Laura asked.</p><p>\u201cWith whom?\u201d was Meg\u2019s first question. \u201cI don\u2019t know any single men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do,\u201d Laura countered. \u201cThere\u2019s Ed, who has the insurance office two doors down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEd\u2019s single?\u201d She rather liked Ed. He seemed like a decent guy, but she\u2019d never thought of him in terms of dating.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you didn\u2019t know Ed was single says a lot. You\u2019ve got to keep your eyes and ears open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck\u2019s divorced.\u201d</p><p>Buck was a regular customer, and although she couldn\u2019t quite understand why, Meg had never cared for him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go out with Buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you had to go out with him, I just said he was single.\u201d</p><p>Meg couldn\u2019t see herself kissing either man. \u201cAnyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are lots of men out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really, and I\u2019m blind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Laura said. \u201cIf you want the truth, I don\u2019t think Lindsey\u2019s idea is so bad. True, she may be going about it the wrong way, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt you to test the waters. You might be surprised at what you find.\u201d</p><p>Meg sighed. She\u2019d expected support from her best friend, and instead Laura had turned traitor.</p><p>By the time Meg had closed the bookstore and headed home, she was exhausted. So much for all those claims about exercise generating energy. In her experience, it did the reverse.</p><p>\u201cLindsey,\u201d she called out, \u201care you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in my room,\u201d came the muffled reply from the bedroom at the top of the stairs.</p><p>Something she couldn\u2019t put her finger on prompted Meg to hurry upstairs to her daughter\u2019s bedroom despite her aching muscles. She knocked once and opened the door to see Lindsey and Brenda sitting on the bed, leafing through a stack of letters.</p><p>Lindsey hid the one she was reading behind her back. \u201cMom?\u201d she said, her eyes wide. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Remington,\u201d Brenda said, looking decidedly guilty.</p><p>It was then that Meg saw the black dress hanging from the closet door. It was the most provocative thing she\u2019d seen in years.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get the dress?\u201d Meg demanded, angry that Lindsey had gone against her wishes and wondering how she\u2019d managed to do it.</p><p>The two girls stared at each other, neither one eager to give her an answer. \u201cBrenda phoned her mother and she put it on her credit card,\u201d Lindsey said at last.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Meg felt ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cIt was only a small lie,\u201d Brenda said quickly. \u201cI told my mom it was perfect and on sale and too cheap to resist. What I didn\u2019t tell her was that the dress wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going back right this minute, and then the three of us are paying Brenda\u2019s parents a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Lindsey flew off the bed. \u201cWait, please.\u201d She had a panicked look in her eyes. \u201cWhat we did was wrong, but when you wouldn\u2019t agree to buy the dress yourself, we didn\u2019t know what to do. You just don\u2019t have anything appropriate for Chez Michelle.\u201d</p><p>Chez Michelle was one of the most exclusive restaurants in Seattle, with a reputation for excellent French cuisine. Meg had never eaten there herself, but Laura and her husband had celebrated their silver wedding anniversary at Chez Michelle and raved about it for weeks afterward.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense,\u201d Meg told her daughter.</p><p>Lindsey bit her lip and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell her,\u201d Brenda insisted.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who wrote the last letter,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cThe least you could\u2019ve done was get the dates right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lindsey snapped.</p><p>\u201cWould someone tell me what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Meg asked, her patience at its end.</p><p>\u201cYou need that dress, Mom,\u201d Lindsey said in a voice so low Meg had to strain to hear her.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a dinner date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do? And just who am I going out with?\u201d She assumed this had something to do with Chez Michelle.</p><p>\u201cSteve Conlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve Conlan?\u201d Meg repeated. She said it again, looking for something remotely familiar about the name and finding nothing,</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know him,\u201d Lindsey told her. \u201cBut he\u2019s really nice. Brenda and I both like him.\u201d She glanced at her friend for confirmation and Brenda nodded eagerly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met him?\u201d Meg didn\u2019t like the sound of this.</p><p>\u201cNot really. We exchanged a couple of letters and then we e-mailed back and forth and he seems like a really great guy.\u201d The last part was said with forced enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been writing a strange man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not so strange, Mom, not really. He sounds just like one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to meet you,\u201d Brenda put in.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Meg brought her hand to her throat. \u201cWhy would he want to do that?\u201d</p><p>The girls shared a look, reminiscent of the one she\u2019d caught the night before.</p><p>\u201cLindsey?\u201d Meg asked. \u201cWhy would this man want to meet me?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter lowered her eyes, refusing to meet Meg\u2019s. \u201cBecause when we wrote Steve ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenda and I told him we were you.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>Steve Conlan glanced at his watch. The time hadn\u2019t changed since he\u2019d looked before. He could tell it was going to be one of those nights. He had the distinct feeling it would drag by, one interminable minute after another.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t figured how he\u2019d gotten himself into this mess. He was minding his own business and the next thing he knew ... He didn\u2019t want to think about it, because whenever he did his blood pressure rose.</p><p>Nancy was going to pay for this.</p><p>He was early, not because he was so eager for tonight. No, he was only eager to get it over with.</p><p>He tried not to check the time and failed. A minute had passed. Or was it a lifetime?</p><p>His necktie felt as if it would strangle him. A tie. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d let Nancy talk him into wearing a stupid tie.</p><p>Because he needed something to occupy his time, he took the snapshot out of his shirt pocket.</p><p>Meg Remington.</p><p>She had a nice face, he decided. Nothing spectacular. She certainly wasn\u2019t drop-dead gorgeous, but she wasn\u2019t plain, either. Her eyes were her best feature. Clear. Bright. Expressive. She had a cute mouth, too. Very kissable. Sensuous.</p><p>What was he supposed to say to the woman? The hell if he knew. He\u2019d read her letters and e-mails a dozen times. She sounded\u2014he hated to say it\u2014immature, as if she felt the need to impress him. She seemed to think that because she ran an eight-minute mile it qualified her for the Olympics. Frankly, he wondered what their dinner would be like, with her being so food conscious and all. She\u2019d actually bragged about how few fat grams and carbs she consumed. Clearly she wasn\u2019t familiar with the menu at Chez Michelle. He couldn\u2019t see a single low-fat or low-carb entr\u00e9e.</p><p>That was another thing. The woman had expensive tastes. Dinner at Chez Michelle would set him back three hundred bucks\u2014if he was lucky. So far he\u2019d been anything but ...</p><p>Involuntarily his gaze fell to his watch again, and he groaned inwardly. His sister owed him for this.</p><p>Big time.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to meet a strange man for dinner,\u201d Meg insisted coldly. There were some things even a mother wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>\u201cBut you have to,\u201d Brenda pleaded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Remington, I feel really bad springing this on you, but Steve didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You\u2019ve just got to show up. You have to ... otherwise he might lose faith in all women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s your date,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve worked out great if ...\u201d she paused and scowled at her best friend \u201c... if one of us hadn\u2019t gotten the days mixed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly when did you plan on telling me you\u2019ve been communicating with a strange man, using my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Lindsey said with conviction. \u201cWe had to ... He started asking about meeting you almost right away. We did everything we could to hold him off. Oh, by the way, if he asks about your appendix, you\u2019ve made a full recovery.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meg groaned. The time frame of their deception wasn\u2019t what interested her. She was stalling, looking for a way out of this. She could leave a message for Steve at the restaurant, explaining that she couldn\u2019t make it, but that seemed like such a cowardly thing to do.</p><p>Unfortunately no escape plan presented itself. Brenda was right; it wasn\u2019t Steve\u2019s fault that he\u2019d been duped by a pair of teenagers. It wasn\u2019t her fault, either, but then Lindsey was her daughter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very nice-looking,\u201d Brenda said. She reached behind her and pulled out a picture from one of the envelopes scattered across Lindsey\u2019s bed. \u201cHere, see what I mean?\u201d Meg swore she heard the girl sigh. \u201cHe\u2019s got blue eyes and check out his smile.\u201d</p><p>Meg took the photo from Brenda and studied it. Her daughter\u2019s friend was right. Steve Conlan was pleasant-looking. His hair was a little long, but that didn\u2019t bother her. He wore a cowboy hat and boots and had his thumbs tucked into his hip pockets as he stared into the camera.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s tall, dark and lonesome,\u201d Lindsey said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cHas he ever been married?\u201d Meg asked, curiosity getting the better of her.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d This time it was Brenda who supplied the information. \u201cHe\u2019s got his own business, same as you, Mrs. Remington. He owns a body shop and he\u2019s been sinking every penny into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made him place the ad?\u201d she asked the girls. A sudden thought came to her. \u201cHe is the one who advertised, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Both girls looked away and Meg\u2019s heart froze. \u201cYou mean to say you two advertised for a husband for me?\u201d She spoke slowly, each word distinct.</p> <p>\u201cWe got lots of letters, too,\u201d Brenda said proudly. \u201cWe went through them all and chose Steve Conlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know why?\u201d Lindsey prodded.</p><p>Meg gestured weakly, still too shocked to react.</p><p>\u201cSteve says he decided to answer your ad because one day he woke up and realized life was passing him by. All his friends were married, and he felt like something important was missing in his life. Then he knew it wasn\u2019t something but someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about female friends?\u201d Meg asked, thinking he didn\u2019t look like a man who\u2019d have to find companionship in the classifieds.</p><p>\u201cHe said in his letter that ...\u201d Lindsey paused and rustled through a sheaf of papers, searching for the right envelope. \u201cHere it is,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much opportunity to meet single women unless they\u2019ve been in an accident, and generally they\u2019re not in the mood for romance when they\u2019re dealing with a body shop and an insurance company.\u201d Lindsey grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of witty. I like that about him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said a lot of women his age have already been married and divorced and had a passel of kids.\u201d</p><p>This didn\u2019t sound too promising to Meg. \u201cYou did happen to mention that I\u2019m divorced, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lindsey insisted. \u201cWe\u2019d never lie.\u201d</p><p>Meg bit her tongue to keep from saying the obvious.</p><p>\u201cJust think,\u201d Brenda said, \u201cout of all the women who advertised, Steve chose you and we chose him. It\u2019s destiny.\u201d</p><p>The girls thought she\u2019d feel complimented, but Meg was suspicious. \u201cSurely there was someone younger and prettier, without children, who interested him.\u201d</p><p>The two girls exchanged a smile. \u201cHe liked the fact that you count carbs and fat grams,\u201d Brenda said proudly.</p><p>So much for their unwillingness to stretch the truth. \u201cYou actually told him that?\u201d She closed her eyes and groaned. \u201cWhat else did you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust that you\u2019re really wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeroic,\u201d Brenda added. \u201cAnd you are.\u201d</p><p>Oh, great. They\u2019d made her sound like a thin Joan of Arc.</p><p>\u201cYou will meet him, won\u2019t you?\u201d Lindsey\u2019s dark eyes pleaded with Meg.</p><p>\u201cWhat I should do is march the two of you down to that fancy restaurant and have you personally apologize to him. You both deserve to be grounded until you\u2019re forty.\u201d</p><p>The girls blinked in unison. \u201cBut, Mom ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cMrs. Remington ... \u201c</p><p>Meg raised her hand and stopped them. \u201cI won\u2019t take you to Chez Michelle, and as for the grounding part ... we\u2019ll discuss it later.\u201d</p><p>Two pairs of shoulders sagged with relief.</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t have dinner with Steve Conlan,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the restaurant, introduce myself and explain what happened. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll agree that the best thing to do is skip dinner altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wear the dress, won\u2019t you?\u201d Lindsey asked, eyeing the slinky black concoction hanging outside her closet door.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Meg said. She refused to even consider it.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have anything special enough for Chez Michelle. Just try it on, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mom. Brenda and I want to see how it looks.\u201d</p><p>An hour later Meg pulled up at Chez Michelle in the very dress she\u2019d sworn she\u2019d never wear. It fit as if it\u2019d been designed just for her, enhancing her figure and camouflaging those stubborn ten pounds. At least that was what Lindsey and Brenda told her.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d The hostess greeted her with a wide smile. \u201cTable for one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... meeting someone,\u201d Meg said, glancing around the waiting area looking for a man who resembled \u201ctall, dark and lonesome\u201d in the photo. No one did. Nor was there a single male wearing a cowboy hat.</p><p>The only man who looked vaguely like the one in the photograph stood in the corner of the room, leaning indolently against the wall as if he had all the time in the world.</p><p>He straightened and stared at her.</p><p>Meg stared back.</p><p>He reached inside his suit pocket and took out a picture.</p><p>Meg opened the clasp of her purse and removed the photo the girls had given her. She looked down at it and then up again.</p><p>He appeared to be doing the same thing.</p><p>\u201cMeg Remington?\u201d he asked uncertainly.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSteve Conlan?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, too.</p><p>He wore a suit and tie. A suit and tie. The guy had really gone all out for her. Meg swallowed uncomfortably. He\u2019d invited her to this ultrafancy restaurant expecting to meet the woman who\u2019d exchanged those letters and messages with him. Meg felt her heart settle somewhere in the vicinity of her knees. She couldn\u2019t very well introduce herself and immediately say it had all been a mistake and cancel dinner. Not when he\u2019d gone to so much trouble.</p><p>\u201cI believe our table is ready,\u201d Steve said, holding out his arm to her. His hand touched her elbow and he addressed the hostess. \u201cWe can be seated now.\u201d</p><p>The woman gave him an odd look, then picked up two huge menus. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Meg might\u2019ve been wrong, but she thought she heard some reluctance in his voice. Perhaps she was a disappointment to Steve Conlan. After the fitness drill Lindsey and Brenda had put her through, Meg was feeling her advancing age.</p><p>Pride stiffened Meg\u2019s shoulders. So she hadn\u2019t signed any modeling contracts lately. What did he expect from a thirty-seven-year-old woman? If he wanted to date a woman in her twenties, he shouldn\u2019t have answered her ad. Lindsey\u2019s ad, she corrected. It was all Meg could do not to stop Steve Conlan right then and there and tell him this was as good as it got.</p><p>Especially in this dress. It was simply gorgeous. Meg knew now the girls had made the perfect choice. She was glad she\u2019d given in to them on this one. Besides, Lindsey was right; she didn\u2019t own anything fancy enough for Chez Michelle. Before she could stop herself she\u2019d agreed to wear it. Soon both girls were offering her fashion advice.</p><p>They were escorted to a linen-covered table next to the window, which overlooked Elliot Bay and Puget Sound. The moon\u2019s reflection on the water sent gilded light across the surface, and the restaurant\u2019s interior was dimly lit.</p><p>Meg squinted, barely able to read her menu. She wondered if Steve was having the same problem. Originally she hadn\u2019t intended to have dinner with him. Wouldn\u2019t even now, if he hadn\u2019t gone to so much trouble on her behalf. It seemed crass to drop in, announce it had all been a misguided attempt by her daughter to play matchmaker, ask his forgiveness and speedily disappear.</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ll have the chicken cordon bleu,\u201d she said, deciding on the least expensive item on the menu. \u201cAnd please, I insist on paying for my own meal.\u201d It would be unforgivable to gouge him for that as well.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s on me,\u201d Steve insisted, setting his menu aside. He smiled for the first time and it transformed his face. He studied her, as if he wasn\u2019t sure what to make of her.</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d Meg lowered her gaze and closed her mouth. She didn\u2019t know where to start and yet she didn\u2019t know how much longer she could maintain the pretense. \u201cThis is all very elegant ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed, spinning the stem of his water glass between his thumb and index finger.</p><p>\u201cYou look different than your picture.\u201d Meg had no idea why she\u2019d told him that. What she should be doing was explaining about Lindsey and Brenda.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are much bluer and you\u2019ve cut your hair.\u201d</p><p>He gave a slight grin. \u201cAnd your picture didn\u2019t do you justice.\u201d</p><p>Meg hadn\u2019t thought to ask Lindsey which one she\u2019d mailed Steve. \u201cCan I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He pulled it out of his pocket and handed it over.</p><p>Meg took one look and rolled her eyes. She couldn\u2019t believe Lindsey had sent this particular photograph to anyone. It\u2019d been taken just before Christmas a year earlier. She was standing in front of the Christmas tree wearing a white dress that drained all the color from her face. The flash from the camera made her eyes appear red. She looked like she was recovering from a serious ailment.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of the worst pictures ever taken of me,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cThe one of me at the bookstore is much better.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s brow creased with a frown. \u201cI see. You should\u2019ve sent that one.\u201d</p><p>Meg realized what she\u2019d said too late. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I should have .... How silly of me.\u201d</p><p>The waitress came and they placed their orders, both declining a drink, Meg to keep down the cost and Steve, no doubt, to hurry the meal along.</p><p>Once the server had left the table, Meg carefully smoothed the napkin across her lap. \u201cListen, Steve ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cMeg ... \u201c</p><p>They both stopped.</p><p>\u201cYou go first,\u201d he said, gesturing toward her.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She cocked her head to one side and then the other, going over the words in her mind. \u201cThis isn\u2019t easy ....\u201d</p><p>Steve frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure to meet me, but the chemistry just isn\u2019t there and you\u2019d like to let me down gently and be done with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d she hurried to assure him.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>The disappointment in his tone came as a mild shock. Then she understood. \u201cYou ... expected a different kind of woman and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. If the truth be known, I\u2019m pleasantly surprised.\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed. \u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ...\u201d She dragged in a deep breath. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not the person you think I am. I mean ...\u201d This was proving even more difficult than it should have. \u201cI didn\u2019t write those letters.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThen who did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter and her friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ... see.\u201d</p><p>Meg\u2019s fingers crushed the linen napkin in her lap. \u201cYou have every reason to be upset. It was an underhanded thing to do to us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know anything about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I didn\u2019t. I would\u2019ve put a stop to it immediately if I had.\u201d</p><p>Steve reached for his water and drank thirstily. \u201cI would have, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to know I intend to discipline Lindsey for this. I can only apologize ...\u201d She stopped midsentence when she saw his shoulders moving with suppressed laughter. \u201cSteve?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t write those letters, either. The ones from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Disbelief settled over Meg. \u201cYou mean to say you didn\u2019t respond to the ad in Dateline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. My romantic little sister did. Nancy\u2019s on this kick about seeing me married. I don\u2019t understand it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Meg said, raising her hand. \u201cLet me see if I\u2019ve got this straight. You didn\u2019t place the ad in Dateline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cProbably for the same reason you are. I figured you were some lonely heart seeking companionship and frankly I felt bad that Nancy had led you on like this. It isn\u2019t your fault my crazy sister thinks it\u2019s time I got married.\u201d</p><p>He paused when their meals were delivered.</p> <p>Meg dug into her chicken with gusto. Irritation usually made her hungry. She stabbed a carrot slice with her fork.</p><p>\u201cSo you felt sorry for me?\u201d she said, chewing the carrot vigorously.</p><p>He looked up, apparently sensing her irritation. \u201cNo sorrier than you felt for me.\u201d</p><p>He had her there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the reason you showed up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>She agreed with a nod. \u201cWhen did you find out about this dinner date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning. You?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her watch. \u201cAbout two hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Steve chuckled. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give you much opportunity to object, did they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually they got the days mixed up and went into a panic. I don\u2019t suppose you happened to read any of the letters or e-mails they wrote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact I did. Interesting stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d She stabbed one of the potato pieces with her fork. \u201cYou should know that not everything they said was the truth.\u201d She put the potato in her mouth and chewed.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t actually run an eight-minute mile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cNine minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly run, and before you ask me about carbs and fat grams, you can forget everything Lindsey told you about those, too. And for the record, my appendix is in great shape.\u201d</p><p>Steve chuckled. \u201cWhat did Nancy tell you about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve only read tidbits of your letters and e-mails, I can\u2019t really say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His voice fell noticeably.</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, your sister did suggest that your life\u2019s quite empty and you\u2019re looking for something to fill your lonely nights\u2014\u201d she paused for effect \u201c\u2014until you realized it wasn\u2019t something you were searching for but someone.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cShe said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Meg took some pleasure in telling him that.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a crock of bull. I certainly hope you didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Meg smiled. \u201cNot really. Lindsey didn\u2019t mean any harm, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNancy, either, although I\u2019d like to throttle her. The kid\u2019s nineteen and she\u2019s got romance and marriage on her mind. Unfortunately, it\u2019s me she\u2019s trying to marry off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey thinks I\u2019m lost and lonely, but I\u2019m perfectly content with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ruin everything now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Steve agreed with conviction. \u201cA woman would want to change everything about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man would string me along until he found someone prettier and sexier. Besides,\u201d Meg added, \u201cI have no intention of becoming a pawn in some ploy of my daughter\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNancy can take a flying leap into Green Lake before I\u2019ll let her arrange my love life,\u201d Steve told her adamantly. \u201cI certainly intend to marry, but on my time\u2014not when my kid sister ropes me into a lonely-hearts-club relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Steve grinned at her, and Meg had to admit he had a wonderful smile. It lit up his eyes and softened his features. \u201cShall we drink to our agreement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Steve attracted the waitress\u2019s attention and ordered a bottle of wine.</p><p>Meg was astonished by the ease with which they could talk, once all the pretense between them had been resolved. She told him about her bookstore and liked hearing about his body shop. They lingered over coffee and dessert, and not until it became apparent that the restaurant was about to close did they get up to leave.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed myself,\u201d Meg said as they strolled to the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I am.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI guess I am, too.\u201d</p><p>The valet brought her Ford Escort to the front of the restaurant and held open her door.</p><p>\u201cThank you for a lovely dinner,\u201d she said, suddenly feeling shy and awkward.</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure was all mine.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them made an effort to move. The valet checked his watch and Meg glanced at him guiltily. Steve ignored him and eventually so did Meg.</p><p>\u201cI guess this is goodbye,\u201d she said, wishing now that she hadn\u2019t made such a big issue about not being her daughter\u2019s pawn.</p><p>\u201cLooks that way.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes, fighting the enticement she read in his. \u201cThanks again.\u201d</p><p>Steve traced his finger along her jaw. His work-calloused fingertip felt warm against her skin. If they hadn\u2019t been standing under the lights of a fancy French restaurant with a valet looking on, Meg wondered if he would\u2019ve kissed her. She wanted to think he might have.</p><p>On the drive home, she dismissed the idea as fanciful. It had been a long time since she\u2019d been wined and dined, that was all. And an even longer time since she\u2019d been kissed ...</p><p>Sensation after sensation traveled across her face where he\u2019d touched her. Smile after smile flirted with her mouth at the memory of his lips so close to hers. She wouldn\u2019t forget the date or the man anytime soon. That was for sure.</p><p>\u201cWell, how\u2019d it go?\u201d Nancy demanded. His teenage sister met Steve at the door. Her eyes were wide with curiosity as she followed him inside.</p><p>Steve looked at his watch and frowned. \u201cWhat are you still doing up?\u201d</p><p>Nancy\u2019s face fell. \u201cYou asked me to wait for you, so we could talk.\u201d</p><p>Steve slid his fingers through his hair. \u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re much later than you thought you\u2019d be.\u201d He didn\u2019t respond, unwilling to let his sister know how much he\u2019d enjoyed himself. \u201cI\u2019m furious with you for what you did,\u201d he said, forcing his voice to sound gruff with irritation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you,\u201d she agreed readily enough.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you got an exam to study for or something?\u201d he asked, although he knew very well she didn\u2019t. Nancy attended the nearby University of Washington. She was staying with Steve for the summer, since their parents were now living in Montana.</p><p>\u201cYou liked her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nancy sounded much too smug to suit Steve.</p><p>\u201cAnd no, I don\u2019t have any exams to study for, and you know it. They ended two weeks ago.\u201d Since then, she\u2019d taken a summer job at the university library.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to stay in Seattle and make my life miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve decided to stay in Seattle and see you married. Come on, Steve, you\u2019re thirty-eight! That\u2019s getting up there.\u201d She flopped down on the sofa and sat with her legs underneath her, as if she planned to plant herself right there until he announced his engagement.</p><p>The problem, Steve decided, was that Nancy was the product of parents who\u2019d never expected a second child and had spoiled her senseless. He was partially to blame, as well, but he\u2019d never thought she\u2019d pull something like this.</p><p>\u201cYou work too hard,\u201d she said. \u201cLoosen up and enjoy life a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to write Meg Remington a formal letter of apology.\u201d He refused to back down on this.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll write her.\u201d All at once she was on her feet. \u201cWhen are you seeing her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Nancy fell back onto the sofa. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Darned if Steve could give her an answer. He and Meg had made that decision early on in their conversation, and for the life of him he couldn\u2019t remember why.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he growled. \u201cNow leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Nancy threw back her head and laughed. \u201cYou like her. You really, really like her.\u201d</p><p>Meg sat in the back storeroom and rubbed her aching feet. The new shoes pinched her toes, but this was what she got for buying them half a size too small. They were on sale and she loved them, although the store had been out of size eights. Even knowing her feet would pay the penalty later, Meg had chosen to wear them today.</p><p>Laura stuck her head through the door and smiled when she saw her. \u201cA beautiful bouquet of flowers just arrived for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the envelope said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t read the card, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking, but Lindsey\u2019s here and she grabbed it and let out a holler. My guess is the flowers are from Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Pain or no pain, Meg was on her feet. She hobbled to the front of the store and found her fifteen-year-old daughter grinning triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cSteve Conlan sent flowers,\u201d she crowed.</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d Meg\u2019s fingers shook as she removed the card from the small envelope.</p><p>\u201cHe said, and I quote, \u2018You\u2019re one special woman, Meg Remington. Love, Steve.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The bouquet was huge, with at least ten different varieties of flowers all arranged in a white wicker basket. It must have cost him easily a hundred dollars. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe agreed,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAgreed to what?\u201d Lindsey prodded.</p><p>\u201cThat we weren\u2019t going to see each other again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously he changed his mind,\u201d Lindsey said, as excited as if she\u2019d just discovered a twenty-dollar bill in the bottom of her purse.</p> <p>Unwilling to trust her daughter\u2019s assessment of the situation, Meg stared at her best friend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Laura said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Meg said to Lindsey, her heart still beating a little too fast.</p><p>\u201cWhy else would he send flowers?\u201d Lindsey asked calmly.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to say he was glad we met, that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t think we should make something out of this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just ... a courtesy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall him,\u201d Lindsey pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly will not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom, don\u2019t you see? Steve\u2019s saying he likes you, but he doesn\u2019t want to pressure you into anything unless you like him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Whatever confidence she\u2019d felt a moment earlier vanished like ice cream at a Fourth of July picnic.</p><p>\u201cThe next move is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d her fickle friend said. \u201cI\u2019ve been married to the same man for twenty-six years. All this intrigue is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with your daughter,\u201d a shy voice said from the other side of the counter. \u201cYou should call him.\u201d</p><p>It was Meg\u2019s customer, Judith Wilson. Meg wasn\u2019t sure she should listen to the older woman who faithfully purchased romance novels twice a month. Judith was a real romantic and would undoubtedly read more into the gesture than Steve had intended.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Lindsey said excitedly. \u201cThe ball\u2019s in your court. Steve made his move and now he\u2019s waiting for yours.\u201d</p><p>Meg didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three days,\u201d Lindsey reminded her. \u201cHe\u2019s had time to think over the situation, and so have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him,\u201d Laura suggested. \u201cIf for nothing more than to thank him for the flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, call him,\u201d Judith echoed, clutching her bag of books.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least you can do.\u201d Once more it was her daughter offering advice.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Meg said reluctantly. The flowers were gorgeous, and thanking him would be the proper thing to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get his work number for you,\u201d Lindsey volunteered, pulling the Yellow Pages from behind the cash register.</p><p>The kid had Steve\u2019s shop number faster than directory assistance could have located it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll use the phone in the back room,\u201d Meg said. She didn\u2019t need several pairs of ears listening in on her conversation.</p><p>She felt everyone\u2019s eyes on her as she hurried into the storeroom. Her hand actually shook as she punched out the telephone number.</p><p>\u201cEmerald City,\u201d a gruff male voice answered.</p><p>\u201cHello, this is Meg Remington calling for Steve Conlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Steve was on the line. \u201cMeg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Steve. I know you\u2019re busy, so I won\u2019t take up much of your time. I\u2019m calling to thank you for the flowers.\u201d</p><p>A long pause followed her words. \u201cFlowers? What flowers?\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know anything about these flowers?\u201d Meg cried, her voice raised. Steve could see that he hadn\u2019t done a very good job of breaking the news, but he was as shocked as she was.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t send them, who did?\u201d Meg demanded.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t difficult to figure that one out. \u201cI can make a wild guess,\u201d he said with heavy sarcasm. He jerked his fingers through his hair, then glanced at the wall clock. It was close to quitting time. \u201cCan you meet me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her blatant lack of enthusiasm irritated him. He\u2019d been thinking about her for three days. Nancy was right\u2014he liked Meg Remington. She was a bit eccentric and a little on the hysterical side, but he was willing to overlook that. During their time together, he\u2019d been struck by her intelligence and her warmth. He\u2019d wished more than once that they\u2019d decided to ignore the way they\u2019d been thrown together and continue to see each other. Apparently Meg suffered no such regrets and was pleased to be rid of him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to meet?\u201d she repeated, lowering her voice.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a drink? Can you get away from the store in the next hour or so?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Steve mentioned a popular sports bar in Kent, and she agreed to meet him there at five-thirty. His spirits lifted considerably at the prospect of seeing her again. He must\u2019ve been smiling as he hung up because his foreman, Gary Wilcox, cast him a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had yourself a new girlfriend,\u201d Gary said. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t.\u201d The last thing Steve needed was Gary feeding false information to his sister. Nancy and her outrageous ideas about marrying him off was enough of a problem, without Gary encouraging it.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened yet, you mean,\u201d Gary said, making a notation in the appointment schedule.</p><p>Steve glanced over his shoulder, to be sure Gary wasn\u2019t making notes about the conversation he\u2019d had with Meg. He was getting paranoid already. A woman did that to a man, made him jumpy and insecure; he knew that much from past experience.</p><p>An hour later Steve sat in the bar, facing a big-screen television with a frosty mug of beer in his hand. The table he\u2019d chosen was in the far corner of the room, where he could easily watch the front door.</p><p>Meg walked in ten minutes after him. At least Steve thought it was Meg. The woman carried a tennis racket and wore one of those cute little pleated-skirt outfits. He hadn\u2019t realized Meg played tennis. He knew she didn\u2019t run and disliked exercise, but ...</p><p>Steve squinted and stared, unsure. After all, he\u2019d only seen her the one time, and in the slinky black dress she\u2019d looked a whole lot different.</p><p>Meg solved his problem when she apparently recognized him. She walked across the room, and he noticed that she was limping. She slid into the chair beside him, then set the tennis racket on the table.</p><p>\u201cLindsey knows,\u201d she announced.</p><p>Steve\u2019s head went back to study her. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter figured it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured what out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was meeting you,\u201d she said in exasperated tones. \u201cFirst, I called you from the back room at the store, so our conversation could be private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cThen I made up this ridiculous story about a tennis game I\u2019d forgotten. I haven\u2019t played tennis in years and Lindsey knows that. She immediately had all these questions. She saw straight through me.\u201d She pulled the sweatband from her hair and stuffed it in her purse. \u201cShe\u2019s probably home right now laughing her head off. I can\u2019t do this .... I could never lie convincingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell your daughter the truth?\u201d He was puzzled by the need to lie at all.</p><p>Meg\u2019s look of consternation said that would\u2019ve been impossible. \u201cWell ... because Lindsey would think the two of us meeting meant something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You told her I didn\u2019t write those letters and e-mails, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Meg played with the worn strings of the tennis racket as her eyes avoided his. \u201cI should have .... I mean, this is crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d He tried to sound nonchalant and wondered if he\u2019d managed it. He didn\u2019t think so. He was actually rather amused by the whole setup. Her daughter and his sister. The girls were close in age and obviously spoke the same language.</p><p>\u201cLindsey\u2019s still got romantic ideas when it comes to men and marriage, but ...\u201d Meg paused and chanced a look at him. \u201cShe really stepped over the line with this stunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say about our date?\u201d</p><p>Meg\u2019s hands returned to the tennis racket. \u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>Steve hadn\u2019t been willing to discuss the details of their evening together with Nancy, either. Nothing had surprised him more than discovering how attractive he\u2019d found Meg Remington. It wasn\u2019t solely a sexual attraction, although she certainly appealed to him.</p><p>Whenever he\u2019d thought about her in the past three days, he\u2019d remember how they\u2019d talked nonstop over wine and dessert. He remembered how absorbed she\u2019d been in what he was saying; at one point she\u2019d leaned forward and then realized her dress revealed a fair bit of cleavage. Red-faced, she\u2019d pulled back and attempted to adjust her bodice.</p><p>Steve liked the way her eyes brightened when she spoke about her bookstore and her daughter, and the way she had of holding her breath when she was excited about something, as if she\u2019d forgotten to breathe.</p><p>\u201cYour sister\u2014the one who wrote the letters\u2014is the same one who sent the flowers?\u201d Meg asked, breaking into his thoughts.</p><p>Steve nodded. \u201cI\u2019d bet on it.\u201d</p><p>Meg fiddled with the clasp of her purse and brought out a small card, which she handed him.</p><p>Steve raised his arm to attract the cocktail waitress\u2019s attention and indicate he wanted another beer for Meg.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, reaching for a pretzel. \u201cIf I come home with beer on my breath, Lindsey will know for sure I wasn\u2019t playing tennis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to you, she\u2019s already figured it out.\u201d</p><p>She slid the bowl of pretzels closer and grabbed another handful. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Steve opened the card that had come with the flowers and rolled his eyes. \u201cThis is from Nancy, all right,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019d never write anything this hokey.\u201d</p><p>The waitress came with another mug of beer and Steve paid for it. \u201cDo you want more pretzels?\u201d he asked Meg.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Then in a lower voice, she added, \u201cThis type of situation always makes me hungry.\u201d</p><p>She licked the salt from her fingertips. \u201cHas my daughter, Lindsey, been in contact with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but then I wouldn\u2019t know, would I?\u201d</p><p>Meg was holding the pretzel in front of her mouth. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Lindsey would be writing to Nancy.\u201d</p><p>Meg\u2019s head dropped in a gesture of defeat. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Much more of this craziness and heaven only knows what they could do to our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to take control,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\u201cI totally agree with you,\u201d was her response. She took a sip of her beer and set the mug down. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be drinking this on an empty stomach\u2014it\u2019ll go straight to my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bar\u2019s got great sandwiches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretzels are fine.\u201d Apparently she\u2019d realized that she was holding the bowl, and she shoved it back to the center of the table. \u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>He saw her wince and recalled that she\u2019d been limping earlier. \u201cIs there something wrong with your foot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shoes I wore to work were too tight,\u201d she said, speaking so quietly he had to strain to hear.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, reaching under the table for her feet and setting them on his lap.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked in a shocked voice.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d rub them for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It didn\u2019t seem so odd to him. The fact was, he hated to see her in pain. \u201cBesides, we need to talk over how we\u2019re going to handle this situation. I have a feeling that we\u2019ll have to be in top mental form to deal with these kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d She closed her eyes and purred like a well-fed kitten when he removed her tennis shoes and kneaded her aching feet.</p> <p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d he asked after a couple of minutes.</p><p>She nodded, her eyes still closed. \u201cI think you should stop,\u201d she said, sounding completely unconvincing.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He asked the question, but he stopped and bent down to pick up her shoes, which he\u2019d placed on the floor.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Meg said. She looked around a little self-consciously as she slipped her shoes back on and tied the laces.</p><p>Feeling somewhat embarrassed by his uncharacteristic response to her, Steve cleared his throat and picked up his beer. \u201cDo you have any ideas?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She stared at him as if she didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, then straightened abruptly. \u201cOh, you mean for dealing with the kids. No, not really. What about you? Any suggestions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re agreed that we\u2019ve got to stop letting them run our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. We can\u2019t allow them to force us into a relationship.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. But if that was the case, he wondered, why did he experience the almost overwhelming desire to kiss her? All of a sudden, it bothered him that they were discussing strategies that would ensure the end of any contact between them.</p><p>He imagined leaning toward her, touching his lips to hers ....</p><p>There\u2019s something wrong with this picture, Conlan, he said to himself, but he couldn\u2019t keep from studying her\u2014and picturing their kiss.</p><p>He\u2019d been wrong about her face, he decided. She was beautiful, with classic features, large eyes, a full mouth. He\u2019d trailed his finger down the curve of her cheek the first time they\u2019d met, and now he did so a second time, mentally.</p><p>She knew what he was thinking. Steve swore she did. The pulse in her throat hammered wildly and she looked away.</p><p>Steve did, too. He didn\u2019t know what was happening, didn\u2019t want to know. He reached for his beer and gulped down two deep swallows.</p> <p>What on earth was he doing? Rubbing her feet, thinking about kissing her. He didn\u2019t need a woman messing up his life!</p><p>Especially a woman like Meg Remington.</p><p>\u201cSo you met Steve again,\u201d Laura said. They sat on a bench in Lincoln Park enjoying huge ice-cream cones. A ferry eased toward the dock at Fauntleroy.</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d Meg answered, deciding to play dumb.</p><p>\u201cLindsey, who else? You really didn\u2019t think you fooled her, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Clearly she had no talent for subterfuge.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me how your meeting went.\u201d</p><p>Meg didn\u2019t answer. She couldn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t sure what, if anything, she and Steve had accomplished during their meeting at the bar. They\u2019d come up with a plan to dissuade his sister and her daughter, but the more hours that passed, the more ridiculous it seemed. And Meg\u2019s willingness, indeed her eagerness, to see Steve again was disturbing.</p><p>In retrospect she saw that it\u2019d been a mistake for them to get together. All she could think about was how he\u2019d lifted her legs onto his lap and rubbed the tired achiness away. There\u2019d been a sudden explosion of awareness between them. A living, breathing, throbbing awareness.</p><p>Rarely had Meg wanted a man to kiss her more. Right in the middle of a sports bar, for heaven\u2019s sake! It was the craziest thing to happen to her in years. That of itself was distressing, but what happened afterward baffled her even more.</p><p>Melting ice cream dripped onto her hand and Meg hurriedly licked it away.</p><p>\u201cMeg?\u201d Laura said, studying her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, laughing off her friend\u2019s concern. \u201cWhat could possibly be wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been yourself the last couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I have,\u201d she said, then deciding it was pointless to go on lying, she blurted out the truth. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I could really fall for this guy.\u201d</p><p>Laura laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s so awful about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, he isn\u2019t interested in me.\u201d</p><p>This time Laura eyed her suspiciously. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral things.\u201d</p><p>Laura bit into her waffle cone. \u201cName one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he wanted to meet so we could figure out a way to keep the kids from manipulating our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds suspiciously like an excuse to see you again,\u201d Laura murmured.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it wasn\u2019t. Steve did everything but come right out and say he\u2019s not interested in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am! There was ample opportunity for him to suggest we get to know each other better, and he didn\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d assumed Steve had experienced the same physical attraction she had, but maybe she\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Lindsey and Brenda had insisted she still had it. All Meg could say was that recent experience had proven otherwise. Whatever it was had long since deserted her.</p><p>\u201cDid it occur to you that he might\u2019ve been waiting for you to suggest something?\u201d Laura asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Meg told her frankly. Steve wasn\u2019t a man who took his cues from a woman. If he wanted something or someone, he\u2019d make it known. If he wanted to continue to see her, he would\u2019ve said so.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s got to be more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is.\u201d Meg took a deep breath. \u201cI was just getting ready to tell you. Steve came up with the idea originally, but I agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>Meg stood and found the closest garbage receptacle to dump what remained of her ice cream. \u201cBefore I tell you, remember I\u2019d been drinking beer on an empty stomach.\u201d Okay, she\u2019d had the pretzels.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound promising,\u201d Laura said.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d Drawing in another deep breath, she sat down on the park bench again. \u201cWe realized that the louder we protested and the more often we said we weren\u2019t attracted to each other, the less likely either Lindsey or Nancy will believe us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a problem with this scenario,\u201d Laura muttered.</p><p>\u201cThere is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You are interested in Steve. Very interested.\u201d Laura gave her a look that said Meg hadn\u2019t fooled her.</p><p>Meg glanced away. \u201cI don\u2019t want to confuse the issue with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, go on,\u201d Laura said with a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cSteve thinks the only possible way we have of convincing Lindsey that he\u2019s not the right person for me is if he starts dating me and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Laura said triumphantly. \u201cHe\u2019s interested. Don\u2019t you get it? This idea of his is just an excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Meg could see no reason for him to play games if he truly wanted a relationship with her. \u201cYou can come over this evening if you want and see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve\u2019s coming to meet Lindsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Laura grinned widely. \u201cR-e-a-l-l-y,\u201d she said, dragging out the word.</p><p>\u201cReally. But it isn\u2019t what you think.\u201d Because if Laura did believe Steve wanted to pursue something with Meg, her friend was in for a major disappointment.</p><p>Meg got home an hour later. Lindsey had taken Steve\u2019s visit seriously. She\u2019d cleaned the house, baked cookies and wore her best jeans. A dress would\u2019ve been asking too much.</p><p>\u201cHello, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Lindsey said, frowning at her watch. \u201cDo you have any idea what time it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should shower and change clothes? Steve will be here in an hour and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She supposed she should reveal more enthusiasm, if only for show, but she couldn\u2019t make herself do it. This had been Steve\u2019s idea and she\u2019d agreed, but she still wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking you should wear that sundress we bought last year with the pretty red-rose print,\u201d Lindsey suggested. \u201cThat and your white sandals.\u201d She studied her mother critically. \u201cI wish you had one of those broad-brimmed sun hats. A pretty white one would be perfect. Very romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to make do with the sombrero Grandpa bought you in Mexico,\u201d Meg teased.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Lindsey cried, appalled. \u201cThat would look stupid!\u201d</p><p>Meg sighed dramatically, for effect. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I managed to dress myself all these years without you.\u201d</p><p>She thought\u2014or hoped\u2014that her daughter would laugh. Lindsey didn\u2019t. \u201cThat might be the reason you\u2019re still single. Have you considered that?\u201d</p><p>This kid was no help when it came to boosting her confidence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a great mother,\u201d Lindsey said, redeeming herself somewhat, \u201cbut promise me you\u2019ll never go clothes-shopping without me again.\u201d</p><p>Rather than make rash pledges she had no intention of keeping, Meg hurried up the stairs and got into the shower. The hot water pulsating against her skin refreshed her and renewed her sense of humor. She could hardly wait to see Lindsey\u2019s face when she met Steve.</p><p>With a towel tucked around her, Meg wandered into her bedroom and examined the contents of her closet. In this case, Lindsey was right; the sundress was her best choice. She wore it, Meg told herself, because it looked good on her and not because Lindsey had suggested it.</p><p>Her daughter was waiting for her in the living room. The floral arrangement Steve, or rather Nancy, had sent was displayed in the middle of the coffee table.</p><p>Lindsey had polished the silver tea set until it gleamed. The previous time Meg had used it was when Pastor Delany came for a visit shortly after Meg\u2019s father died.</p><p>The doorbell chimed. Lindsey turned to her mother with a grin. \u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d she said, and gave her a thumbs-up sign.</p><p>Meg had assumed she knew what to expect, but when she opened the front door her mouth sagged open.</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d she whispered to the man dressed in a black leather jacket, tight blue jeans and a white T-shirt. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>He winked at her. \u201cYou expecting someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>\u201cInvite me in,\u201d he said in a low voice. As she stepped aside, he walked past her and placed his index finger under her chin, closing her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stood in the archway between the entry and her living room, feet braced apart. \u201cYou must be Lindsey,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI\u2019m Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Steve?\u201d Lindsey sounded uncharacteristically meek.</p><p>\u201cLindsey, this is Steve Conlan,\u201d Meg said, standing next to him.</p><p>Steve slid his arm around Meg\u2019s waist and planted a noisy kiss on her cheek. He glanced at Lindsey. \u201cI understand you\u2019re the one who got us together. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Lindsey\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t so much as flicker. She certainly wasn\u2019t about to let them read her thoughts. \u201cYou, uh, don\u2019t look anything like your picture.\u201d</p><p>Steve refused to take his eyes off Meg. He squeezed her waist again. \u201cThe one I sent was taken a while back,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore I went to prison.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey gasped. \u201cPrison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart. It wasn\u2019t a violent crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat ... were you in for?\u201d Lindsey asked, her voice shaking.</p> <p>Steve rubbed the side of his jaw, shadowed by a dark growth of beard. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather not say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Steve,\u201d Meg said from between gritted teeth. Talk about overkill. Any more of this and everything would be ruined.</p><p>\u201cWould you care for coffee?\u201d Lindsey asked. Her young voice continued to tremble.</p><p>\u201cYou got a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to be drinking this early in the afternoon, is it?\u201d Meg asked sweetly.</p><p>Steve sat down on the sofa, balancing his ankle on the opposite knee. He looked around as if he were casing the joint.</p> <p>Meg moved to the silver service. \u201cCoffee or tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee, but add a little something that\u2019ll give it some kick.\u201d</p><p>Meg poured coffee for him and added a generous dollop of half-and-half. He frowned at the delicate bone china cup as though he wasn\u2019t sure how to hold it.</p><p>Lindsey sat down on the ottoman, her eyes huge. \u201cI ... you never said anything about prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like to mention it until people have a chance to meet me for themselves. Some of \u2018em tend to think the worst of a person when they hear he\u2019s had a felony conviction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ... felony.\u201d Lindsey snapped her mouth shut, inhaled deeply, then said in a subdued tone, \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe flowers are lovely.\u201d Meg fingered a rosebud from the bouquet.</p><p>Steve grinned. \u201cMy probation officer told me women like that sort of thing. Glad to know he was right.\u201d He sipped his coffee and made a slurping sound. \u201cBy the way, you\u2019ll be glad to hear I told him about you and me, and he did a background check on you and said it was fine for us to see each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Meg said with enthusiasm that wasn\u2019t entirely faked.</p><p>Steve set aside the delicate cup and leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. He stared at Lindsey and smiled. \u201cYup, I got to thank you,\u201d he said. \u201cI realize your mother\u2019s upset with you placing that ad and everything. It\u2019s usually not a good idea to fool someone like that, but I wasn\u2019t being completely honest with you, either, so I guess we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey nodded.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s one special woman. There aren\u2019t a lot of females who\u2019d be willing to overlook my past. Most women don\u2019t care that I\u2019ve got a heart of gold. Your mama did. We sat down in that fancy restaurant and I took one look at her pretty face and I knew she was the woman for me.\u201d He rubbed the side of his unshaven jaw and laughed. \u201cI do have to tell you, though, that when you suggested Chez Michelle, I was afraid Meg might be too high maintenance for someone like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry ...\u201d Lindsey floundered with the apology. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry. Your mama was worth every penny of that fancy dinner. Just getting to know her and love her\u2014why, a man couldn\u2019t ask for a prettier gal.\u201d He eyed her as if she were a Thanksgiving feast, then moistened his lips, implying it was all he could do to keep from grabbing her right then and there and kissing her.</p><p>\u201cSteve ...\u201d Meg muttered.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, and seemed to pull himself together. \u201cEarl Markham, my probation officer, says I\u2019ve gotta be careful not to rush things. But I look at your beautiful eyes and I can\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me how good-looking your daughter is,\u201d he said, as though Meg had purposely been holding out on him.</p><p>\u201cLindsey\u2019s my pride and joy,\u201d Meg said, beaming her daughter a smile.</p><p>\u201cI got plenty of friends who wouldn\u2019t mind meeting a good-looking girl like you.\u201d He winked at Lindsey, suggesting that all he needed was one word from her and he\u2019d make the arrangements immediately.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Meg said, forgetting this was just a game. \u201cI won\u2019t have you introducing my daughter to your friends.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes widened with surprise and he held up his right hand, as if taking an oath. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to offend. You don\u2019t want Lindsey dating any of my buddies, fine, I\u2019ll see it never happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Meg had to acknowledge that Steve was an excellent actor. He almost had her believing him. She suspected that was because he\u2019d turned himself into the man she\u2019d half expected to meet that night.</p><p>Steve smacked his lips. \u201cI gotta tell you when I first saw Meg in that pretty black dress, my heart went all the way to the floor. She\u2019s the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve seen since I was released.\u201d His eyes softened as his gaze fell on Meg.</p><p>\u201cReleased?\u201d Lindsey squeaked.</p><p>\u201cFrom prison,\u201d Steve clarified, his gaze immediately returning to Meg.</p><p>It would help considerably if he didn\u2019t look so sincere, Meg thought.</p><p>\u201cYes, well ...\u201d she said, standing. But once she was on her feet, she wasn\u2019t sure what to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you want me to take you on that motorcycle ride I been promising you,\u201d Steve said, downing the last of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s going on a motorcycle with you?\u201d Lindsey asked, swallowing visibly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better change clothes,\u201d Meg said, eager to escape so she could speak to Steve alone.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Steve said. \u201cYou can ride sidesaddle if you want. I brought my Hog. There\u2019s plenty of room, although I gotta tell you, I been dreaming about you sitting behind me, wrapping your arms around my waist. You\u2019ll need to hold on tight, honey, real tight.\u201d His eyes didn\u2019t waver from hers, and the sexual innuendo was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cYes, well ...\u201d Either the room had grown considerably warmer or Meg was in deep trouble.</p><p>Judging by the look of disgust Lindsey cast her, she could see it was the latter.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll change into a pair of jeans, if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Steve said, wiping the back of his hand across his mouth. \u201cJust don\u2019t keep me waiting long, you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Meg rushed toward the stairs, anxious to get away.</p><p>Steve reached out to stop her. His hand closed over her shoulder and he brought her into his arms. She gasped in shock. Without giving her time to recover, he lowered his mouth to hers.</p><p>It was all for show, but that didn\u2019t keep her heart from fluttering wildly. Her stomach muscles tightened at the unexpectedness of his kiss.</p><p>Her lips parted and she slid her arms tightly around his narrow waist.</p><p>Steve groaned and Meg was afraid the hunger she felt in him was a reflection of her own. By the time he dragged his lips from hers they were both panting. Speechless, they stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ... I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she managed to whisper. Then she raced up the stairs as if demons were in hot pursuit. On the way she caught a glimpse of Lindsey staring after her, open-mouthed.</p><p>Four</p><p>The minute they were alone outside, Meg hit Steve across his upper arm, hurting her hand in the process. Biting her lip, she shook her fingers several times, then clutched her aching hand protectively with the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Steve demanded, glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cYou overdid it,\u201d she snapped, barely understanding her own outrage.</p><p>\u201cI had to convince her I was unsuitable, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Meg bristled. \u201cYes, but you went above and beyond what we discussed. All that business about me being so beautiful,\u201d she muttered as she walked to the driveway where he\u2019d parked the Harley-Davidson. She climbed onto the leather seat without thinking.</p><p>\u201cI thought I did a great job,\u201d Steve argued. A smile raised the edges of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing,\u201d she said, unable to stop looking at him. \u201cWas that kiss really necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said calmly, but Meg could tell that he didn\u2019t take kindly to her rebuke. \u201cLindsey needed to see me in action,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou frightened my daughter half out of her wits as it was. There was no need to ... \u201c</p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes widened, then softened into a smile. \u201cYou liked the kiss,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cYou liked it and that scared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! It ... it was disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d His smile was cocky. He laughed, the timbre low and mildly threatening. \u201cMaybe I should prove how wrong you are.\u201d</p><p>Meg shifted uncomfortably on the seat. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with,\u201d she said, feigning boredom. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take me out for an hour or so and then drive me back. Right? By the way, where did you get the motorcycle?\u201d</p><p>He advanced a step toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d He was exactly the kind of man her mother had warned her about, and here she was flirting with danger. He moved a step closer and she held herself rigid.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know much about men, do you?\u201d he asked, his voice low and husky.</p><p>\u201cI was married for nearly six years,\u201d she informed him primly. He was close now, too close. She kept her spine stiff and her eyes straight ahead. If the motorcycle was his, it was reasonable to assume the leather jacket belonged to him as well. The persona he\u2019d taken on, the criminal element, might not be too far from the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been with a man since, have you?\u201d</p><p>She felt his breath against her flushed face. \u201cI refuse to answer questions of a personal nature,\u201d she returned, her voice hoarse and low.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t,\u201d he said confidently. \u201cLook at me, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s get this ride over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She tried to resist, but the words were warm and hypnotic. Against her better judgment, she twisted toward him. \u201cYes?\u201d she asked, her heart pounding so hard she thought it might leap right through her chest.</p><p>He wove his hands into her hair and tilted her head back so that she couldn\u2019t avoid staring up at him. His gaze bored relentlessly into hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAdmit it,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou enjoyed the kiss.\u201d His eyes were compelling, she admitted reluctantly, resisting him every step.</p><p>\u201cHow like a man\u2014everything\u2019s about ego,\u201d she said in an effort to make light of what had happened. \u201cEven a silly little kiss.\u201d</p><p>Steve frowned.</p><p>There was a fluttery feeling in the pit of her stomach, the same feeling that had attacked her when he\u2019d kissed her by the staircase. She felt vulnerable and helpless.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t little and it wasn\u2019t silly. But it was what we both wanted,\u201d he said in a deceptively normal voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d she murmured, hurrying to assure him that he\u2019d been wrong. Very wrong. She lowered her eyes, but this proved to be a tactical error. Before she realized what he intended, he was kissing her again.</p><p>Meg wanted to protest. If she\u2019d fought him, struggled, he might have released her. But her one weak objection came in the form of a moan, and it appeared to encourage rather than dissuade him.</p><p>All at once it was important to get closer. A moment later she was kneeling on the leather cushion and Steve had slipped his arms around her middle. They didn\u2019t stay there long. He glided his hands along her back, urging her more tightly against him.</p><p>Meg didn\u2019t require much inducement. Her body willfully molded itself to his. Then, abruptly, her eyes fluttered open and with a determined effort she broke free. Steve\u2019s arms tightened before he relaxed and finally released her.</p> <p>The look on his face was one of shock.</p><p>For her own part, Meg was having a difficult time breathing. Sensations swarmed through her. Unwanted sensations. Steve made her feel as if she\u2019d never been kissed before, never been held or loved. Never been married or shared intimacies with a man.</p><p>She blinked, and Steve backed away. He frowned and raked his fingers through his hair, apparently sorting out his own troubled emotions.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you expect me to admit I enjoyed that,\u201d she said with more than a hint of belligerence. These feelings frightened her. The fact that she\u2019d reacted to him could easily be explained. Good grief, she was a normal woman\u2014but this giddy, end-of-the-world sensation wasn\u2019t anything she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to admit to a damned thing,\u201d he said. He climbed onto the Hog and revved the engine aggressively.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she cried, shouting above the noise. She waved a hand to clear away the exhaust.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now?\u201d he snapped, twisting around to look at her.</p><p>\u201cNothing .... Just go slow, all right?\u201d</p><p>Separated by only a couple of inches, Meg felt him tense. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly in a slow mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guessed as much.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what he intended as he expertly maneuvered the motorcycle out of her driveway. Mortified, Meg glanced up and down the street, wondering how many of her neighbors had witnessed the exchange between her and Steve. Fortunately Lindsey wasn\u2019t at the front window watching as Meg had half feared.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>She placed her hands lightly on either side of his waist, hoping to keep the contact as impersonal as possible\u2014until they turned the first corner. From that moment on, she wrapped her arms around him as tightly as she could.</p><p>Meg was grateful that he chose not to drive far. He stopped at a park less than a mile from her house. After he\u2019d eased into a parking space, he switched off the engine and sat motionless for a couple of minutes.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked after a while.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Great. That was ... fun.\u201d She was astonished at her new talent for telling white lies. She was far from fine. Her insides were a mess, although that had almost nothing to do with the motorcycle ride. Her heart refused to settle down to a normal pace, and she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about their kisses. The first time had been traumatic, but it didn\u2019t compare to her nearly suffocating reaction to his second kiss.</p><p>Steve checked his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it another five minutes and then I\u2019ll take you back to the house. That should give Lindsey enough time to worry about you without sending her into a panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said brightly\u2014a little too brightly.</p><p>\u201cThen tomorrow afternoon I\u2019ll pick you up after work and you can do your thing with my sister.\u201d</p><p>Although he couldn\u2019t see her, she nodded. Meg only hoped her act for Nancy would be as convincing as Steve\u2019s had been with Lindsey.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, we won\u2019t need to see each other again,\u201d Steve said. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it isn\u2019t a minute too soon.\u201d</p><p>Meg felt much the same way. She was just as eager to get him out of her life.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been a good day. Steve would\u2019ve liked to blame his foul mood on work-related problems, but everything at Emerald City Body Shop had run like clockwork. The one reason that presented itself was Meg Remington.</p><p>He\u2019d known from the first night that getting involved with her would mean trouble. Sure enough, he was waist-deep in quicksand, and all because he hadn\u2019t wanted to hurt the woman\u2019s feelings.</p><p>Okay, that accounted for their dinner date, but afterward ... what happened was no one\u2019s fault except his own. Donning his leather jacket and jeans and playing the role of the disgruntled ex-con had been fun. But then he had to go and do something stupid.</p><p>The stupid part was because of the kiss. He\u2019d been a fool to force Meg to admit how good it had been. This was what he got for allowing his pride to stand in the way.</p><p>Well, Steve had learned his lesson. The next time he was tempted to kiss Meg, he\u2019d go stand in the middle of the freeway. Man, oh man, she could kiss. Only she didn\u2019t seem to realize it. Much more of that kissing and he would\u2019ve been renting a hotel room.</p><p>Not Meg, though. Oh, no. She acted as outraged as a nun. Apparently she\u2019d forgotten that men and women did that sort of thing. Enjoyed it, too. Looked forward to doing it again.</p><p>The woman was insane, and the sooner he could extract her from his life, the better. He didn\u2019t need this. Who did?</p><p>One more night, he assured himself. He was taking Meg to meet Nancy this evening, and when they were finished, it would be over and they\u2019d never have to see each other again. If she played her cards right. He\u2019d done his part.</p><p>Despite his sour mood, Steve grinned. He\u2019d never forget the look of shock and horror in Lindsey\u2019s eyes when he walked into the house. Her jaw had nearly hit the carpet when he put his arms around Meg\u2019s waist and announced that he was an ex-con. He wouldn\u2019t forget the look in Meg\u2019s eyes, either.</p><p>Steve laughed outright.</p><p>\u201cSomething funny?\u201d Gary Wilcox asked.</p><p>Steve glared at his foreman. \u201cNot a thing. Now get back to work.\u201d</p><p>At six o\u2019clock, Steve pulled into the parking space in the alley behind Meg\u2019s bookstore. He didn\u2019t like the idea of sneaking around and going to her back door, but that was what Meg wanted and far be it from him to argue. He\u2019d be well rid of the woman\u2014at least that was what he kept trying to tell himself.</p><p>He knocked and waited a few minutes, growing impatient.</p><p>The door opened and a woman in black mesh nylons and the shortest miniskirt he\u2019d seen in years stood in front of him. She vaguely resembled Tina Turner. She wore tons of makeup and she\u2019d certainly had her hair done at the same salon as Tina.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for Meg Remington,\u201d he said, annoyed that Meg had made such a fuss about his coming to the back door and then sent someone else to answer it.</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d Meg whispered, \u201cit\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He jerked his head back and examined her more thoroughly. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting my sister,\u201d he reminded her stiffly, \u201cnot going to some costume party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took my cue from you,\u201d she said. \u201cGood grief! You arrived at my door looking like a Hell\u2019s Angel\u2014what did you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>Steve rubbed his face. Darned if he knew anymore. All he wanted was to get this over with. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute. I need to change shoes.\u201d</p><p>She slipped out of a perfectly fine pair of flats and into spiky high heels that added a good five inches to her height. Steve wondered how she\u2019d manage to walk in those things. She might as well have been on stilts.</p><p>He led her around to his car and opened the door. He noticed that she sighed with what sounded like relief once she was inside the car.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do if you brought that motorcycle again.\u201d She tugged down her miniskirt self-consciously.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I don\u2019t often take it out.\u201d</p><p>She looked relieved, but why it should matter to her one way or the other, he had no idea.</p><p>\u201cJust remember,\u201d he said, feeling obliged to caution her. \u201cNancy\u2019s a few years older than Lindsey. She won\u2019t be as easily fooled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful about overkill,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cunlike certain people I know.\u201d</p><p>The drive took an eternity, and it wasn\u2019t due to heavy traffic, either. In fact, when Steve looked at his watch he was surprised at what good time they\u2019d made. What made the drive so troublesome\u2014he hated to admit this\u2014was Meg\u2019s legs. She\u2019d crossed them, exposing plenty of smooth, shapely thigh. Her high heels dangled from the ends of her toes.</p><p>Steve appreciated women as a whole\u2014some more than others, of course. He didn\u2019t focus on body parts. But it was torture to sit with Meg in the close confines of his car and keep his eyes off her legs. The woman looked incredible. If only she\u2019d keep her mouth shut!</p><p>Nancy was standing on the porch when Steve pulled into the driveway.</p><p>\u201cThis is where your sister lives?\u201d Meg asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my home,\u201d Steve answered, certain she was about to find something wrong with it.</p><p>\u201cYour home?\u201d She sounded impressed. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He turned off the engine. \u201cNancy\u2019s quite a bit younger than I am\u2014a surprise for my mom and dad. She attends college at the University of Washington nine months out of the year. Our parents retired to Montana a couple of years back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Does Nancy live with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life,\u201d he said, climbing out of the car. \u201cShe\u2019s in residence during the school year. She got a job here this summer and I agreed to let her stay with me a few months. A mistake I don\u2019t plan to repeat anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>Steve was watching for his sister\u2019s reaction when he helped Meg out of the car. To her credit, the nineteen-year-old didn\u2019t reveal much, but Steve knew her well enough to realize she was shocked by Meg\u2019s appearance.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Nancy,\u201d Meg said in a low, sultry voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be Meg,\u201d Nancy said, coming down the steps to greet her. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not a disappointment.\u201d This was said in a soft, cooing tone, as if she couldn\u2019t have tolerated disillusioning Steve\u2019s little sister. She clasped Steve\u2019s arm and he noticed for the first time that her nails\u2014now two inches long\u2014were painted a brilliant fire engine red. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nancy held open the door and smiled in welcome. \u201cPlease, come inside.\u201d</p><p>Meg\u2019s high heels clattered against the tile entryway. Steve looked around, pleased to note that his sister had cleaned up the house a bit.</p><p>\u201cOh, Stevie,\u201d Meg whined, \u201cyou never told me what a beautiful home you have.\u201d She trailed one finger along the underside of his jaw. \u201cBut then, we haven\u2019t had time to discuss much of anything, have we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake yourself comfortable,\u201d Steve said and watched as Meg chose to sit on the sofa. She sat, crossing her legs with great ceremony. Then she patted the empty space beside her, silently requesting Steve to join her there. He glanced longingly at his favorite chair, but moved across the room and sat down next to Meg.</p> <p>The minute he was comfortable, Meg placed her hand possessively on his knee and flexed her nails into his thigh. Inch by provocative inch she raked her nails up his leg until it was all Steve could do not to pop straight off the sofa. He caught her hand and stopped her from reaching what seemed to be her ultimate destination.</p><p>Her expression was mildly repentant when she looked at him, but Steve knew her well enough to know the action had been deliberate.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might be hungry before Steve takes you to dinner, so I made a few hors d\u2019oeuvres,\u201d Nancy said and excused herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Steve whispered the minute his sister was out of the room.</p><p>\u201cDoing? What do you mean?\u201d She had wide-eyed innocence down to an art.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he muttered as Nancy returned from the kitchen carrying a small silver platter.</p><p>\u201cThose look wonderful,\u201d Meg said sweetly when his sister put the tray on the coffee table in front of them. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t eat a thing.\u201d</p><p>To the best of his knowledge it was the first time his sister had cooked from the moment she\u2019d moved in with him, and he wasn\u2019t about to let it go to waste. He chose a tiny wiener wrapped in some kind of crispy dough and tossed it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gone to all this trouble,\u201d Meg told his sister.</p><p>Nancy sat across the room from them, apparently at a complete loss for words.</p><p>\u201cI suspect you\u2019re wondering about all these letters and e-mails I wrote,\u201d Meg said, getting the conversation going. \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t unhappy with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, not at all,\u201d Nancy said, rushing the words together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve come to know what people really want from me by the things they say.\u201d She turned, and with the tip of her index finger wiped a crumb from the corner of his mouth. Her tongue moistened her lips and Steve\u2019s insides turned to mush.</p><p>\u201cI learned a long time ago what men want from a woman,\u201d Meg continued after a moment, \u201cespecially when I went to work for a phone sex line. Most of the guys are just looking for a woman to talk dirty to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Nancy folded her hands primly in her lap.</p><p>\u201cThere was the occasional guy who was looking for a good girl to shock, of course. I got very talented at acting horrified.\u201d She made a soft, gasping sound, then laughed demurely.</p><p>\u201cWhy ... why would someone like you place an ad in Dateline?\u201d Nancy asked, nervously brushing the hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cWell, first,\u201d Meg said, holding his sister\u2019s gaze, \u201cit\u2019s just about the only way someone like me can meet anyone decent. But it wasn\u2019t your brother who answered the ad, now, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot that it matters,\u201d Meg said, cutting her off. \u201cI was tired of my job and all those guys asking me to say those nasty things, and I didn\u2019t want to start working on my back again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn your ... back,\u201d Nancy repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sugar. I didn\u2019t mean to shock you. I\u2019ve got a colorful past\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a bad girl. I\u2019ve got a heart just brimming with love. All I need is the right man.\u201d Her gaze wandered to Steve and was long and deliberate. \u201cYour brother\u2019s given me a reason to dream again,\u201d Meg said softly. \u201cLots of people think women like me don\u2019t have feelings, but they\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true,\u201d Nancy said tentatively.</p><p>\u201cI knew I chose right when I found out your brother has his own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s struggled financially for years,\u201d Nancy was quick to tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s still touch and go. He lives from one month to the next.\u201d Nancy glared at him pointedly. \u201cDon\u2019t you, Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. I\u2019m more than solvent now,\u201d Steve tossed in for good measure, struggling not to laugh. He was enjoying this.</p><p>Meg tightened her arm around his. \u201cI can see how well Stevie\u2019s doing for himself. He\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she said, refusing to look away. The adoration on her face embarrassed him.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Steve here could make enough money to keep me in the lifestyle to which I\u2019d like to become accustomed.\u201d She laughed coyly.</p><p>\u201cAh ...\u201d It sounded to Steve as if his sister was close to hyperventilating.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I wouldn\u2019t take anything from him without giving in return. That wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d She snuggled closer to his side and gave him a look so purely sexual Steve was convinced he\u2019d embarrass them all.</p><p>\u201cThere are things I could teach your brother,\u201d Meg said in a husky voice full of sexual innuendo. She acted as though she was eager to get started right that moment and the only thing holding her back was propriety. Her breathing grew heavy\u2014and if he didn\u2019t know better he\u2019d think she actually had worked for one of those disreputable phone services.</p><p>Soon he was having a problem controlling his own breathing.</p><p>\u201cSteve!\u201d Nancy snapped.</p><p>He turned his attention back to his sister, staring at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear Meg?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. He knew the two women were talking, but he\u2019d barely noticed their conversation.</p><p>\u201cMeg\u2019s talking about moving in with you,\u201d Nancy said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to rush you, darling\u2019,\u201d Meg whispered. Leaning forward, she licked his earlobe with the tip of her tongue.</p><p>Hot sensation shot down his spine.</p><p>Meg threw back her head and laughed softly, then whispered just loudly enough for Nancy to hear, \u201cI have an incredibly talented tongue.\u201d</p><p>Nancy closed her eyes as if she couldn\u2019t bear to watch another minute of this. Frankly, Steve didn\u2019t know how much more he could take himself.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time we left for dinner,\u201d he said. Otherwise he was going to start believing all the promises Meg was making. Heaven knew, he wanted to believe them. The demure bookseller had turned into something completely different. All traces of innocence had disappeared and in their place was the most sexually provocative female he\u2019d ever met. Just being in the same room with her made his blood sizzle.</p><p>\u201cYou want to leave already?\u201d Meg gave the impression that she was terribly disappointed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably best,\u201d Nancy muttered, and then realizing what she\u2019d said, hurried to add, \u201cI mean, you two don\u2019t want to waste your evening with me, do you?\u201d She frowned at Steve. \u201cYou won\u2019t be late, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m still working for the phone people,\u201d Meg said, \u201cso I won\u2019t keep him too long, but I can\u2019t promise he\u2019ll have much kick left in him when I\u2019m finished.\u201d Apparently thinking herself exceptionally clever, Meg laughed at her own joke.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they were back in the car and on the freeway that Steve recognized how angry he was. It made no sense, but he wasn\u2019t exactly rational just then.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so mad?\u201d Meg asked about halfway back to the bookstore. They hadn\u2019t spoken a word from the time they\u2019d left his house.</p><p>\u201cTalk about overkill,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI thought I did a good job,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou came off like a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s what I wanted. After meeting me, do you honestly think your sister\u2019s going to encourage our relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee you that Lindsey doesn\u2019t want me to see you, either. I thought that\u2019s what this whole scheme of yours was about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounded like a good idea at the time.\u201d He tightened his hands on the steering wheel. \u201cIt seemed like a surefire way to convince your daughter that I was the wrong man for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your sister that I was equally wrong for you.\u201d</p><p>Silence settled over them like nightfall. Neither of them seemed inclined to talk again.</p><p>Steve edged his car into the alley behind Meg\u2019s store and parked his car behind hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure anymore,\u201d he said without looking at her.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of us. Somewhere in the middle of all this, I decided I kind of like you.\u201d It hadn\u2019t been easy to admit, and he hoped she appreciated what it had cost his pride. \u201cIt probably wouldn\u2019t have been as obvious if you hadn\u2019t made yourself out to be so cheap. That isn\u2019t you any more than the rebel without a cause is me.\u201d</p><p>He wished she\u2019d say something. When she did speak, her voice was timid and small. \u201cThen there was the kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKisses,\u201d he corrected. \u201cThey were pretty great and we both know it,\u201d he said with confidence. He knew what his own reaction had been, and she hadn\u2019t fooled him with hers.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cEspecially the one on the motorcycle,\u201d he said, prompting her to continue.</p><p>\u201cEspecially the one on the motorcycle,\u201d she mimicked. \u201cHonestly, Steve, you must\u2019ve known.\u201d</p><p>His smile was full blown. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I didn\u2019t do a very good job of disguising what I was feeling.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t, but he was in a gracious mood.</p><p>\u201cHow about dinner?\u201d he suggested. He was eager to have the real Meg Remington back. Eager to experiment with a few more kisses\u2014see if they were anything close to what his memory kept insisting they\u2019d been.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI want to, but I can\u2019t,\u201d she eventually said.</p><p>He bristled and turned in the driver\u2019s seat to face her. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised Lindsey I\u2019d be home by seven and it\u2019s nearly that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall her and tell her you\u2019re going out to dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>She dragged in a deep breath and seemed to hold it. \u201cI can\u2019t do that, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter meeting you, I promised her we\u2019d talk. She wanted to last evening, and we didn\u2019t .... That was my fault. You kissed me,\u201d she said, \u201cand I didn\u2019t feel like a heart-to-heart with my daughter after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s all my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what Lindsey wants to discuss?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course, I know. You. She doesn\u2019t want me seeing you again, which is exactly the point of the entire charade. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said, scowling.</p><p>\u201cAre ... are you telling me you\u2019ve changed your mind?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He hated to be the one to say it first, but one of them had to. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>Steve flattened his hand against the steering wheel. \u201cI swear you\u2019re about the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to my ego.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and rested her hand on his shoulder. The wig she had on tilted sideways and she righted it. \u201cThat does sound terrible, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYeah. The least you could do is show some enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t dated much in the last ten years. But if I was going to choose any man, it would be you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said. He wanted to kiss her. He\u2019d been thinking about it from the moment he\u2019d picked her up.</p><p>\u201cOnly ...\u201d Meg said sadly.</p><p>\u201cOnly what?\u201d he repeated, lowering his mouth to hers.</p><p>Their lips met and it was heaven, just the way he\u2019d known it would be. By the time the kiss ended, Steve was leaning his head against the window of the car door, his eyes closed. It was even more wonderful than he\u2019d remembered, and that seemed impossible.</p><p>Meg\u2019s head was on his chest, tucked beneath his chin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s too late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone to all this trouble to convince Lindsey that you\u2019re all wrong for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cDo you think Nancy will believe this was all a silly joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should end everything right here and now, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Steve stiffened. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>She moved away from him. \u201cI guess it is,\u201d she said, with just a hint of regret.</p> <p>Five</p><p>Lindsey was pacing the living room, waiting for Meg when she walked in the front door.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey,\u201d Meg said, trying to sound cheerful yet exhausted\u2014since she\u2019d led Lindsey to believe she was taking inventory at the bookstore and that was why she\u2019d come home so late.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s way after seven!\u201d her daughter cried, rushing toward her. \u201cYou weren\u2019t with Steve, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ...\u201d Meg wasn\u2019t willing to lie outright. Half truths and innuendos were about as far as she wanted to stretch this.</p><p>Lindsey closed her eyes and waved her hands vaguely. \u201cForget it. Don\u2019t answer that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Meg asked as calmly as she could. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t think she sounded all that reassuring. She\u2019d left Steve only moments earlier and was already feeling some regret. After following through with this ridiculous charade, Steve wanted to change his mind and continue seeing Meg. She\u2019d quickly put an end to that idea. Now she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Lindsey said, her dark eyes challenging, \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Meg walked into the kitchen and took the china teapot from the hutch. \u201cMy mother always made tea when we had something to discuss.\u201d Somehow, the ritual of drinking tea together put everything in perspective. Meg missed those times with her mother.</p><p>Lindsey helped her assemble everything they needed and carried it into the dining room. Meg poured them each a cup, once the tea had steeped, and they sat across from each other at the polished mahogany table.</p><p>Meg waited, and when Lindsey wasn\u2019t immediately forthcoming she decided to get the conversation started. \u201cYou wanted to talk to me about Steve, right?\u201d</p><p>Lindsey clasped the delicate china cup with one hand and lowered her gaze. \u201cDo you really, really like him?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>Meg answered before she took time to censor the question. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? I mean, he\u2019s nothing like what I thought he\u2019d be.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI suppose this is what Brenda and I get for pretending we were you,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cMaybe if you\u2019d read his stuff, you would\u2019ve been able to tell what kind of guy he really is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve is actually a fine person.\u201d And he was. Or at least the Steve Meg knew.</p><p>Lindsey risked a glance at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve said hundreds of times that you don\u2019t want me to judge others by outward appearances, but sometimes that\u2019s all there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about me and Steve, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Meg said gently.</p><p>Lindsey rubbed her finger along the edge of the teacup. \u201cI realize now that what Brenda and I did was really stupid. We linked you up with a guy who has a prison record. We sure were easy to fool,\u201d Lindsey said with a scowl. \u201cWe\u2019re only fifteen years old!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I like Steve,\u201d Meg felt obliged to tell her.</p><p>Lindsey looked as if she didn\u2019t know how to account for that. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Meg assured her, \u201cbut I understand your concern, honey, and I promise you I won\u2019t let the situation get out of hand.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey frowned, stiffened her shoulders and blurted out, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Mom. This guy is trouble.\u201d</p><p>Talk about role reversal!</p><p>\u201cI want you to promise me you won\u2019t see Steve Conlan again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cThis is important. You may not understand it now, but I promise you will in the future. There are plenty of other men, law-abiding citizens, who\u2019d give their right arms to meet a woman like you.\u201d</p><p>Meg stared. She couldn\u2019t be hearing this. This sounded exactly like something her mother had said back when Meg was in high school.</p><p>The intense look in Lindsey\u2019s eyes softened and she gestured weakly. \u201cThe time will come when you\u2019ll thank me for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Meg couldn\u2019t resist raising her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be a boy in my life that you\u2019ll disapprove of and I won\u2019t understand why,\u201d Lindsey went on. \u201cWhen that happens, I want you to remind me of now.\u201d</p><p>Meg shook her head\u2014in bafflement and disbelief. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019d break up with a boy simply because I didn\u2019t like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lindsey said carefully. \u201cBut I\u2019d consider it because I know how I feel about you seeing Steve, and I\u2019d understand how you might feel about someone I was dating. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d she hurried to add, \u201cI don\u2019t dislike Steve .... He\u2019s kind of cute. It\u2019s just that I feel you could do a whole lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Meg promised.</p><p>Lindsey nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t ask for more than that.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter had behaved just as Meg had predicted. This had gone precisely according to plan. But Meg didn\u2019t feel good about it. If anything, she felt more depressed following their conversation than before.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any talent when it came to relationships, Meg decided, as she finished putting away the dinner dishes later that evening. Steve had come right out and told her he\u2019d had a change of heart, and she\u2019d bungled everything. Instead of admitting that she felt the same way he did, she\u2019d trampled all over his ego.</p><p>Meg turned to the kitchen phone, tempted to call him. It couldn\u2019t end like this, with such confusion, such uncertainty about what she really wanted. What they wanted.</p><p>Never had an evening passed more slowly. It seemed to take Lindsey hours to go to bed, and by then Meg was yawning herself.</p><p>As soon as Meg could be reasonably sure that her daughter was asleep, she tiptoed toward the kitchen phone and dialed Steve\u2019s number, her heart pounding. Finally she heard his groggy voice.</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank goodness it\u2019s you. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do if Nancy answered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeg? Is that you?\u201d He sounded surprised to hear from her, and none too pleased.</p><p>She bristled. \u201cHow many other women do you have phoning you at eleven o\u2019clock at night?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond right away, and when he spoke his voice definitely lacked welcome. \u201cI thought you said it wasn\u2019t a good idea for us to see each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you expect me to make your decisions for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d This wasn\u2019t going well. In fact, it was going very badly. She probably should\u2019ve waited until she\u2019d had time to figure this out a little more clearly.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you called?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, sorry now that she\u2019d phoned him. \u201cI wanted to apologize for being abrupt earlier. I ... can see now that I shouldn\u2019t have called.\u201d</p><p>Having said that, she carefully replaced the receiver. For a long moment she stared at the phone, feeling like an idiot.</p><p>She\u2019d turned away to head up the stairs when the phone rang, jolting her. Quickly she grabbed it before the noise could wake Lindsey.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMeet me.\u201d It was Steve.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave Lindsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? She\u2019s in bed, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cWrite her a note. Tell her you\u2019re going to the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>How reasonable he made it sound\u2014as if she usually did her shopping in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t even know you\u2019re gone,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>Meg closed her eyes. They\u2019d been together only a few hours earlier, and yet it felt as if they\u2019d been apart for weeks.</p><p>Her stomach twisted. Then\u2014before she could change her mind\u2014she blurted out, \u201cAll right, but I can\u2019t stay long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>They agreed to meet in the Albertson\u2019s parking lot. The huge store was open twenty-four hours a day. Meg had been shopping there for years. The note she left Lindsey said she\u2019d gone to pick up some milk\u2014that classic excuse\u2014but it was exactly what she intended to do.</p><p>She sat in her car until she saw Steve pull into the nearly empty lot. Uncertain she was doing the right thing, she got out and waited for him.</p><p>Steve parked in the spot next to hers. They stood facing each other for a moment, neither speaking.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re doing this,\u201d she said.</p><p>It appeared she wasn\u2019t the only one with doubts. Steve\u2019s face was blank, emotionless. \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the store together and reached for grocery carts. Meg\u2019s had a squeaky wheel. The sound echoed through the cavernous store.</p><p>The deli was closed, but Steve was able to get them each a cup of coffee from the friendly night manager. They parked their empty carts and sat at a small white table in the deli section. Neither seemed inclined to speak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt encouraged that Steve had phoned her back, but she suspected he regretted it now.</p><p>\u201cYou know what you said earlier?\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cI said lots of things earlier.

She\u2019s worried that you\u2019re the wrong man for me.\u201d It would\u2019ve helped if he hadn\u2019t bragged about his prison record and mentioned his parole officer\u2019s name. But now didn\u2019t seem to be the time to bring that up.</p><p>\u201cDid you or did you not promise her you wouldn\u2019t see me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d Meg sipped from the disposable cup and grimaced at the taste of burned coffee.</p><p>\u201cThen what did you say to her?\u201d</p><p>Meg lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cThat I\u2019d think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d</p> <p>Propping her elbows on the table\u2019s edge, Meg swirled the black liquid around the cup and avoided looking at Steve. \u201cI called you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t figured out why.\u201d</p><p>That was the problem: she hadn\u2019t, either. Not really. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because you have a point about seeing each other again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d He gave her a cocky grin.</p><p>Her anger flared. \u201cWould you stop it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cThe next thing I know, you\u2019re going to ask me how much I enjoyed kissing you.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled for the first time. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, since it means so much to you, I\u2019ll admit it. No man\u2019s ever kissed me the way you do. It scares me\u2014but at the same time I wish it could go on forever.\u201d Having admitted this much, she supposed she might as well say it all. \u201cMy marriage left me wondering if I was ... if I was capable of those kinds of feelings ....\u201d She paused and lowered her eyes. \u201cI was afraid I was, you know, frigid,\u201d she said in a choked whisper.</p><p>She stared down at her coffee, then took a sip, followed by several more, as if the vile stuff were the antidote to some dreaded illness.</p><p>The last thing she expected her small confession to provoke in Steve was a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d</p><p>She shook her head forcefully. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh. Please.\u201d</p><p>His hand reached for hers and their fingers entwined. \u201cI wasn\u2019t laughing at you, Meg,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the most sensual women I\u2019ve ever met. Trust me, if you\u2019re frigid\u2014and there\u2019s a word I haven\u2019t heard in years\u2014then I\u2019m a monk.\u201d</p><p>Meg looked up and offered him a fragile smile. It astonished her that this man who\u2019d known her for only a few days could chase away the doubts that had hounded her through the years after her divorce.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI, uh, don\u2019t think you should look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you want me to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drifted shut. \u201cMaybe I do .... That\u2019s what makes everything so complicated. I\u2019m really attracted to you. I haven\u2019t felt like this before\u2014not ever, not even with my ex-husband, and like I said, that scares me.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, still holding Meg\u2019s hand, and tugged her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeplace private,\u201d he said, scanning the store. He led her through the frozen food section, past the bakery and into a small alcove where the wine was kept. With her back to the domestic beer, he brought her into his arms and covered her mouth with his.</p><p>Their kiss was rough with need, but she wasn\u2019t sure whose need was greater. Meg could feel Steve\u2019s heart racing as hard as her own. She supposed she should\u2019ve pulled away, ended the kiss, stepped out of his arms. But Meg didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>Steve yawned. He was so tired. With good reason. It\u2019d been almost three before he\u2019d gone to bed and four before he\u2019d been able to fall asleep. His alarm had gone off at six.</p><p>He arrived at the shop and made a pot of coffee. He mumbled a greeting when Gary got in.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re in a better mood than you were yesterday,\u201d his foreman told him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Steve checked over the job orders for the day. \u201cWomen,\u201d he muttered in explanation and apology.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve guessed. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear this,\u201d he said and headed for the garage.</p><p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d Gary said, following him. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose this has anything to do with Nancy, does it?\u201d</p><p>Steve glared at him. \u201cWhat do you know about my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Gary said and held up both hands. \u201cJust what you said about her fixing you up with some woman. It\u2019s none of my business, but you and this woman seem to be hitting it off just fine.\u201d</p><p>Steve continued to glare at him. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Gary laughed. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you this miserable in years. Which probably means you\u2019ve fallen for her. Why don\u2019t you put yourself out of your misery? Shoot yourself and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Steve turned away. The kid was a smartass, although now that Steve thought about it, Gary might have come up with the perfect solution.</p><p>It was noon before Steve had a chance to go into his office. He made sure no one was looking, then closed the door and reached for the phone.</p><p>\u201cBook Ends, Laura speaking,\u201d a woman said in a friendly voice.</p><p>\u201cIs Meg available?\u201d he asked, sounding as businesslike as possible.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask who\u2019s calling?\u201d</p><p>Steve hesitated. \u201cSteve Conlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne minute, please.\u201d</p><p>It took longer than that for Meg to get on the line. \u201cSteve, hi.\u201d She seemed tired but happy to hear from him. That helped.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked, struggling to hold back a yawn.</p><p>\u201cDead on my feet. I\u2019m not as young as I used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Lindsey know you slipped out of the house last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I should never have stayed out that late.\u201d</p><p>Steve didn\u2019t have any argument there. They\u2019d left the Albertson\u2019s store when a stock boy stumbled upon them in the wine section, embarrassing Meg no end\u2014although Steve had rather enjoyed the way her blush had brightened her cheeks.</p><p>With no other idea of where to take her at that hour, Steve had driven down to Alki Point in west Seattle, where they sat on the beach and talked.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t discussed anything of earth-shattering importance, but he discovered that they had a great deal in common. Mostly, he discovered that he liked Meg. He was already well aware of what Meg, the sensuous and beautiful woman, was capable of doing to him physically. Last night, he learned about Meg, the person.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t kissed again. Steve was convinced they both knew how dangerous kissing had become. It wouldn\u2019t take much for their kisses to lead to more ... a lot more. And when that happened, he didn\u2019t plan to have it take place on a public beach.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know where the time had gone, but when he\u2019d looked at his watch he\u2019d been shocked. Meg, too. It was after three in the morning. They\u2019d rushed their farewells without making arrangements to see each other again.</p><p>\u201cWhen can we get together?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know ....\u201d</p><p>Was this how it was going to be? Would they have to start over each and every time they met? \u201cWould you rather we didn\u2019t meet again?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said immediately.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make some decisions,\u201d he said, angry with himself for not saying anything about it on that moonlit beach. They\u2019d discussed so many different things, from politics to movies to lifelong dreams, yet hadn\u2019t talked about their own relationship.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould tonight work?\u201d he asked. \u201cSame time?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and he gritted his teeth with impatience.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The longing in her voice reassured him.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said, relieved. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at your house at eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Me, too.\u201d</p><p>Steve replaced the receiver and glanced up to find Nancy standing in his office doorway, her arms folded in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cWas that Meg?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Steve said sharply.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about her and I\u2019m tired of you putting me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not discussing Meg Remington with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you date someone like her?\u201d Nancy asked, her face wrinkled in disgust.</p><p>\u201cMight I remind you that you were the one who introduced us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she deceived me. Steve, be serious! Can you honestly imagine introducing her to Mom and Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered calmly.</p><p>Nancy threw her arms in the air. \u201cThis is your problem. You\u2019re thinking with your you-know-what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNancy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of my business. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cI make my own decisions,\u201d Steve said forcefully.</p><p>\u201cAnd your own mistakes,\u201d Nancy muttered, walking out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both crazy,\u201d Meg said, sitting next to Steve in his car. She sipped from a can of cold soda, enjoying the sweet taste of it.</p><p>\u201cCandidates for the loony bin,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to get away,\u201d Meg confessed. \u201cBrenda\u2019s spending the night with Lindsey, and those two are going to be up half the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell them you were leaving the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I left them a note. Just in case ... Although I\u2019m hoping they won\u2019t come downstairs. Oh, and this time I should remember to bring home some milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking Lindsey and I should have another meeting,\u201d Steve began. \u201cOnly this time I want you to bring her to the shop. I\u2019ll show her around and explain that the whole biker, ex-con routine was a joke.\u201d He waited, then looked at Meg. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid hell hath no fury like a teenager fooled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was afraid you were going to say.\u201d Steve finished his drink and placed his arm around her shoulder. \u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m through with sneaking around in the middle of the night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meg covered her mouth as she yawned. \u201cI\u2019m too old for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d</p><p>Meg finished her soda, too, and leaned back against Steve, his chest supporting her back. She didn\u2019t dare close her eyes for fear she\u2019d fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cNancy isn\u2019t any too happy about me seeing you, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her, explain everything.\u201d Except that, like Lindsey, Steve\u2019s sister probably wouldn\u2019t be too pleased.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled, then,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Lindsey and you\u2019ll talk to Nancy. Neither one of them is going to enjoy being the butt of a joke, but it wasn\u2019t like we planned this. Besides, it serves them right for manipulating us like they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d be pleased,\u201d Meg inserted. \u201cTheir plan worked\u2014not the way they wanted, mind you, but we\u2019re seeing each other and that\u2019s the whole point. Right?\u201d</p><p>Steve chuckled and stroked her hair. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it wasn\u2019t like this,\u201d Meg whispered.</p> <p>Steve kissed the top of her head. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Meg smiled, twisting in his arms so they faced each other.</p><p>Steve\u2019s hands lingered on her face. His mouth was so close she could feel his breath against her cheek. A shiver of awareness skittered down her spine.</p><p>Meg closed her eyes and lifted her mouth to Steve\u2019s. He hesitated for a fraction of a second, as if he had second thoughts about what might happen next.</p><p>His kiss was warm and gentle. But his gentleness didn\u2019t last long. There was a hunger in Steve, a hunger in Meg that flared to life like a fire stoked.</p><p>\u201cMeg ... \u201c</p> <p>\u201cI know ... I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said and drew in a deep, even breath.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she repeated, but she had no idea what she was agreeing to. She opened her eyes and leaned back. \u201cWhat about tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to Lindsey and Nancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Steve dropped her off at the house.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he drove away that she realized she\u2019d left her purse in his car. Her purse with the key to her house ...</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d she muttered, hurrying into the backyard, hoping Lindsey had forgotten to lock the sliding glass door. She hadn\u2019t; it was locked tight.</p> <p>No help for it\u2014she searched until she found the spare key, hidden under one of the flowerpots on her porch. It\u2019d been there for so many years she wasn\u2019t sure it would work.</p><p>Luckily it did. As quietly as she could, Meg slipped into the house.</p><p>She climbed the stairs and tiptoed into her room. She undressed without turning on the light and was in bed minutes later.</p><p>The neighbor\u2019s German shepherd barked, obviously from inside their house, and Lindsey looked up from painting her toenails. \u201cThere it is again,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI heard it, too,\u201d Brenda said.</p><p>\u201cWolf doesn\u2019t bark without a reason.\u201d</p><p>Ever curious, Brenda walked over to the bedroom window and peered into the yard below. After a moment, she whirled around. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in your backyard,\u201d she whispered, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for jokes,\u201d Lindsey said, continuing to paint her toenails a bright shade of pink. \u201cWe were discussing my mother, remember?\u201d</p><p>Brenda didn\u2019t move away from the window. \u201cThere is someone there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a man .... Oh, my goodness, come and look.\u201d</p><p>The panic in her friend\u2019s voice made Lindsey catapult to a standing position. Walking on her heels to keep her freshly painted toenails off the carpet, she hobbled toward the window.</p><p>Brenda was right; she did see someone in the yard. \u201cTurn the lights off,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Lindsey\u2019s heart lodged in her throat as she recognized the dark form. \u201cIt\u2019s Steve Conlan!\u201d She saw him clearly in the moonlight; he wasn\u2019t even making any attempt to hide.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that in his hand?\u201d</p><p>Lindsey focused her attention on the object Steve was carrying. It looked like a purse. Gasping, she twisted away from the window and placed her back against the wall. She gestured wildly toward the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Brenda cried. \u201cAre you having an asthma attack?\u201d</p><p>Lindsey shook her head. \u201cHe broke in to the house and stole my mother\u2019s purse.\u201d Brenda handed her the phone and Lindsey dialed 911 as fast as her nervous fingers would let her.</p><p>She barely gave the operator time to answer. \u201cThere\u2019s a man in our backyard,\u201d she whispered frantically. \u201cHe took my mother\u2019s purse.\u201d</p><p>The emergency operator seemed to have a thousand questions she wanted Lindsey to answer. Lindsey did the best she could.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a convicted felon .... I can give you the name of his probation officer if you want. Just hurry!\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cOfficers have been dispatched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, please hurry.\u201d Lindsey was afraid that unless the police arrived within the next minute Steve would make a clean getaway.</p><p>Steve debated whether he should leave Meg\u2019s purse on the front porch. It would be easy enough to tuck it inside the mailbox, but then she might not find it until much later the next day.</p><p>He walked around the house to the backyard, thinking there might be someplace he could put it where she\u2019d find it in the morning.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The only thing he\u2019d managed to do was rouse the neighbor\u2019s dog. He would\u2019ve rung the doorbell and given her the silly thing if there\u2019d been any lights on, but apparently she\u2019d gone to bed. He wasn\u2019t especially eager to confront Lindsey, either. Not yet.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t made up his mind, when he heard a noise from behind him.</p><p>\u201cPolice! Freeze!\u201d</p><p>Was this a joke? Maybe not\u2014whoever it was sounded serious. He froze.</p><p>\u201cPut the purse down and turn around slowly.\u201d</p><p>Once more Steve did as instructed. With his arms raised, he turned to find two police officers with their weapons drawn and pointed at him.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we caught ourselves a burglar,\u201d one of them said, switching on a huge flashlight.</p><p>\u201cCaught him redhanded,\u201d the other agreed.</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d let me explain,\u201d Steve said, squinting against the light at the two officers. A dog barked ferociously in the next-door neighbor\u2019s yard. A man in pajamas had let the dog out and joined the audience.</p><p>\u201cDo you always carry a woman\u2019s purse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belongs to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother.\u201d</p><p>Although Steve couldn\u2019t see her face, he recognized the righteous tones as belonging to Meg\u2019s daughter. Lindsey and her friend stood beside the two officers and looked as if they\u2019d gladly provide the rope for a hanging.</p><p>\u201cWolf.\u201d The neighbour silenced the German shepherd, but made no move to go inside.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Steve Conlan,\u201d Steve said, striving to come across as sane and reasonable. This was, after all, merely a misunderstanding.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe him if I were you,\u201d Lindsey advised the officers. \u201cIt might not be his real name.\u201d Then in lower tones she added, \u201cHe has a criminal record. I happen to know for a fact that he\u2019s a convicted felon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a felon,\u201d Steve growled. \u201cAnd it is my real name. Officers, if you\u2019d give me the opportunity to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis parole officer\u2019s name is Earl Markham.\u201d Lindsey cut him off, her voice indignant. \u201cHe told me himself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Earl Markham,\u201d the younger of the two policemen said. \u201cAnd he is a parole officer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know him, too,\u201d Steve barked impatiently. \u201cWe went to high school together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>The scorn in Lindsey\u2019s voice reminded Steve of Meg when she was furious with him. Like mother, like daughter, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d let me explain.\u201d Steve tried again, struggling to stay calm. It wasn\u2019t easy with two guns aimed at him and a man in pajamas clutching the collar of a huge dog\u2014thank goodness for the fence. Not to mention a couple of teenage girls accusing him of who knew what.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d the other girl was saying. \u201cHe lies! He had us believing all kinds of things, and all because he thought we were Lindsey\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>A short silence followed her announcement. \u201cSay that again?\u201d the older officer muttered. \u201cHow well do you know this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Steve Conlan.\u201d Steve tried yet again.</p><p>\u201cWhich may or may not be his real name.\u201d This, too, came from Lindsey\u2019s friend.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll let me get my wallet, I\u2019ll prove who I am,\u201d Steve assured them. He made an effort to sound vaguely amused by the whole situation. He lowered one arm and started to move his hand toward his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands up where I can see them,\u201d the older cop snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d The voice drifted down from the upstairs area of the house. A sweetly feminine, slightly groggy voice.</p><p>Steve glanced up, and to his great relief saw Meg\u2019s face framed in the second-floor window.</p><p>\u201cMeg,\u201d Steve shouted, grateful that she\u2019d finally heard the commotion. \u201cTell these men who I am, so they can put their weapons away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d she cried, shocked. \u201cWhat are you doing at my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know this man?\u201d the cop asked, tilting his head back and shouting up at Meg.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, would you mind stepping outside?\u201d the second officer asked. He mumbled something Steve couldn\u2019t hear under his breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right down,\u201d Meg told them, and Steve watched her turn away from the window.</p><p>\u201cHave you been sneaking around seeing my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey, it\u2019s not like it seems,\u201d Steve said, experiencing a twinge of guilt at the way he\u2019d misled the girl. He\u2019d planned to talk to Meg\u2019s daughter soon, but he hadn\u2019t intended to do it in front of the police.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be more interested to find out why he has your mother\u2019s purse, if I were you,\u201d the second teenager said.</p><p>\u201cI already know why he\u2019s got Mom\u2019s purse,\u201d Lindsey said loudly. \u201cHe stole it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t!\u201d Steve rolled his eyes. \u201cI was trying to return it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my purse?\u201d This was from Meg. \u201cOh, hello, Mr. Robinson. Hi, Wolf. I think everything\u2019s under control here.\u201d Man and dog went back inside a moment later.</p><p>\u201cMy purse!\u201d she said again.</p><p>Steve relaxed and lowered his arms. \u201cYou left it in my car,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness you found it.\u201d Meg, at least, displayed the appropriate amount of appreciation. \u201cI didn\u2019t know when I\u2019d get it back.\u201d</p><p>Now that the flashlight wasn\u2019t blinding him and the officers had returned the guns to their holsters, Steve saw Meg for the first time. In fact, he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her. She\u2019d thrown a flimsy cotton robe over her babydoll pajamas but despite that, they revealed a length of sleek, smooth thigh whenever she moved. The top was low-cut and the robe gaped open and ... Meg grabbed the lapels and held them together with both hands. It didn\u2019t help much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Steve was afraid he wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d noticed Meg\u2019s attire. Both officers looked approvingly in her direction. Steve was about to ask the younger of the two to wipe the grin off his face, but he held his breath and counted backward from ten.</p><p>He got to five. \u201cLindsey, go get your mother a coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to take orders from you,\u201d the girl snapped.</p><p>Meg blinked and seemed to realize that despite the robe, such as it was, her nightwear left little to the imagination.</p> <p>In an apparent effort to deflect a shouting match, one officer asked Lindsey a few questions, while the other engaged Steve and Meg in conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou know this man?\u201d he asked Meg.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. His name\u2019s Steve Conlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve Conlan.\u201d The officer made note of it on a small pad. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said earlier.\u201d</p><p>Steve pulled out his wallet and flipped it open, silently thrusting it out. The cop glanced at it and nodded.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t steal my purse, either,\u201d Meg went on.</p><p>Steve cast the other man an I-told-you-so look, but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou went out with Steve behind my back?\u201d Lindsey cried, peering around the second policeman. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do something like that\u2014after our talk and everything.\u201d</p><p>Meg cast her a guilty look. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this later.\u201d</p><p>But Lindsey wasn\u2019t going to be so easily dissuaded. \u201cAfter our talk, I really, really thought I was getting through to you. Now I see how wrong I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d give me a chance to explain ...\u201d Steve began, wanting to avoid an argument between Meg and her daughter.</p> <p>Static from the police officer\u2019s walkie-talkie was followed by a muffled voice. The two men were obviously being dispatched to another location.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay here?\u201d the policeman asked Meg.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung lady?\u201d</p><p>Lindsey folded her arms and pointed her nose toward the night sky. \u201cAll I can say is that my mother\u2019s a serious disappointment to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you could,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI thought better of her than this\u2014sneaking out at night to see a man of ... of low moral fiber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we all go inside and discuss this,\u201d Steve suggested. He felt more than a little ridiculous standing in Meg\u2019s yard, and he was eager to clear the air between Lindsey and him.</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say to either of you,\u201d Lindsey said. She marched into the house, with Brenda scurrying behind.</p><p>Steve watched them stomp off in single file and released a deep breath. He was about to apologize for having made such a mess of things, when Meg whirled around to face him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d</p><p>Steve ran his fingers through his hair. Meg didn\u2019t seem to grasp that this ordeal hadn\u2019t exactly been a pleasure for him, either.</p><p>\u201cI apologize, Meg.\u201d He did feel bad about all the trouble he\u2019d caused, but he\u2019d only been trying to help. When he\u2019d found her purse, returning it had seemed the best thing to do. He didn\u2019t want her wondering where it was, and he\u2019d honestly thought he could do it without ending up in jail.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you tell my daughter to get me a coat.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s head jerked up. His throat tightened with the strength of his anger. \u201cI nearly got myself arrested\u2014thanks to your daughter, I might add\u2014and you\u2019re upset because I objected to you traipsing around in front of the neighborhood half-naked?\u201d</p><p>Meg opened her mouth and then closed it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he amended, \u201cyou are wearing a robe, although it\u2019s not much of one. Neither of those cops could take their eyes off you. I supposed you enjoyed the attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! I came downstairs as fast as I could, in order to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call parading in front of those men like that helping me? All I needed was for you to identify me so I could leave. That\u2019s all.\u201d His words grew louder. He was close to losing his cool and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better go,\u201d Meg said, pointing in the direction of the street. Steve noticed with satisfaction that her finger shook.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of here,\u201d he told her, \u201cand not a minute too soon. You might have appreciated the embarrassment I endured trying to do you a favor, but I can see you don\u2019t. Which is fine by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you didn\u2019t embarrass me?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t the one who had a gun pointed at you and a kid claiming you were a menace to society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey was only repeating what you\u2019d told her.\u201d Meg pushed the hair away from her face, using both hands. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cIt\u2019s working all too well. You make me crazy, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to get arrested, I want it to be for someone who\u2019s willing to acknowledge the trouble I\u2019ve gone through for her.\u201d Certain he was making no sense whatsoever, Steve stalked over to his car and drove away.</p><p>Meg squared her shoulders and drew her flimsy robe more tightly around her as she opened the screen door and walked back inside. The exhaust from Steve\u2019s car lingered in the yard, reminding her how angry he\u2019d been when he left.</p><p>She was angry, too. And confused.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help to find Lindsey and Brenda sitting in the darkened living room waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cYou should both be in bed,\u201d Meg told them.</p><p>\u201cWe want to talk to you first,\u201d Lindsey announced, her hands folded on her knees.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d she said shortly. \u201cI\u2019m tired and upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Lindsey cried. \u201cBrenda and I are exhausted, but that doesn\u2019t matter. What does is that you broke your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t promise not to see Steve again,\u201d Meg told her. She\u2019d been careful about that.</p><p>Meg went back to the door and stood in front of the screen, half hoping Steve would return\u2014not knowing what she\u2019d say or do if he did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sneaking out of the house to see him, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Meg lifted one shoulder in a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou have!\u201d Lindsey was outraged. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Meg lifted the other shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I trust you anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey, Steve\u2019s not exactly what he said he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s got you fooled, hasn\u2019t he? You\u2019d believe anything he says because that\u2019s what you want to believe. You\u2019re so crazy about this guy you can\u2019t even see what\u2019s right in front of your face.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d been a little less upset herself, Meg might\u2019ve been willing to set the record straight then and there. \u201cWe want to talk to you,\u201d Meg told her daughter. \u201cSteve and I, together, and explain everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Remington, don\u2019t let him fool you,\u201d Brenda threw in dramatically.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not worry about this now,\u201d she said as defeat settled over her. \u201cIt\u2019s late and I have to be at the store early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey stood, her hands clenched at her sides. \u201cI want you to promise me you won\u2019t see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, Mom, I\u2019ll never be able to trust you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time we had a little talk,\u201d Nancy said, bringing a steaming cup of coffee to the breakfast table. After the night he\u2019d had, the last thing Steve wanted was a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with his troublesome younger sister.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Nancy left the table, taking the coffee with her.</p><p>\u201cHey, I want the coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She brought it back and slipped into the chair across from him. \u201cSomething\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing gets past you, does it?\u201d He almost scalded his mouth in his eagerness to get some caffeine into his system.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d She stared at him with big brown eyes that suggested she could solve all his problems, if only he\u2019d let her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to do with that Meg, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Steve mumbled a noncommittal reply. He didn\u2019t care to discuss Meg Remington just then. What he\u2019d told Meg was the simple truth\u2014she made him crazy. No woman had ever affected him as powerfully as she did. After the way they\u2019d parted, he doubted they\u2019d see each other again, and damn it all, that wasn\u2019t what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the woman for you,\u201d Nancy said, her eyes solemn.</p><p>\u201cNancy,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201cdon\u2019t say any more. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re falling in love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he muttered. Cradling the mug in both hands, he tried the coffee again, sipping from the edge to avoid burning his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThou protest too much,\u201d she told him, with a sanctimonious sigh. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve made it necessary for me to take matters into my own hands. Someone\u2019s got to look out for your best interests.\u201d</p><p>Steve lowered the mug and glared at his sister. \u201cWhat did you do this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing yet. There\u2019s this woman, a widow I met on campus, and I\u2019d like you to get to know her. She\u2019s nothing like Meg, but as far as I\u2019m concerned ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He wasn\u2019t listening to another word. The last time his sister had roped him into her schemes he\u2019d met a crazy woman with an even crazier daughter. No more.</p><p>\u201cBut Steve ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d The chair made a scraping sound against the tile floor as he stood. \u201cI won\u2019t be home for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Nancy stood, too. \u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d</p><p>Steve regarded her suspiciously. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the least you can do is meet Sandy.\u201d</p><p>Steve gritted his teeth. \u201cYou invited her to the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I didn\u2019t mention you. I wanted the two of you to meet casually. She\u2019s nervous about dating again, and I was afraid if I told her about my big, bad brother she\u2019d run in the opposite direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. If you want to work on anyone\u2019s love life, you might try your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Nancy said, sounding defeated. \u201cJust stay away from Meg, okay? The woman\u2019s bad news.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s laugh was humorless. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me?\u201d</p><p>A week passed. Steve refused to dwell on his confrontation with Meg. He didn\u2019t call her and she didn\u2019t phone him, either.</p><p>He hated to end it all, but he didn\u2019t see any other option.</p><p>He missed her, though. He tried to tell himself otherwise. Tried to convince himself a man has his pride. Tried not to think about her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And failed.</p><p>Early one afternoon, Nancy came by the shop with a friend. They were on their way to a movie, or so Nancy claimed.</p><p>Nancy smiled a little-sister smile and cheerfully asked Steve if he\u2019d give Sandy an estimate on repairing her fender.</p><p>Sandy was petite. Cute. A little fragile.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take Steve long to figure out that this Sandy was the same one Nancy had wanted him to meet. The widow. The woman who\u2019d save him from Meg\u2019s clutches.</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d Steve said, wiping his greasy hands on the pink cloth he had tucked in his hip pocket.</p><p>Nancy smiled innocently, looking pleased with herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a written estimate for you by the time you two get back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to work late again, do you?\u201d Nancy asked, not even attempting to be coy.</p> <p>Steve could already see what was coming. His conniving sister was about to wrangle a dinner invitation out of him. One that meant he\u2019d be stuck entertaining Sandy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m tied up this evening,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cOh, darn. I was hoping you could take Sandy and me to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cIt was a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Conlan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure was mine,\u201d he said and turned away.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t end with Sandy. His sister had several other friends with dented fenders or cracked windshields. They all seemed to need estimates in the days that followed.</p><p>\u201cThe next time a woman comes in and asks for me, I\u2019m unavailable,\u201d he told his crew. Steve made sure that on her next visit Nancy would know he didn\u2019t have time for her matchmaking games. He told her as much when she stopped by\u2014alone\u2014a couple of days later.</p><p>\u201cI was only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d He sat at his desk, making his way through the piles of paperwork stacked in front of him.</p><p>Nancy expelled a sigh. \u201cYou aren\u2019t seeing Meg again, are you?\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened around the pen. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is! A woman like that could ruin your life.\u201d</p><p>In some ways she already had, but Nancy wouldn\u2019t understand. Whenever he met another woman, Steve found himself comparing her to Meg. Invariably everyone else fell short. Far short. He was miserable without her.</p> <p>Nancy left, and Steve leaned back in his chair, studying the phone. All it would take was one call. He wouldn\u2019t have to mention the incident with the police. He could even make a joke of it, maybe buy her a pair of flannel pajamas. The kind that went from her neck to her feet. They\u2019d both laugh, say how sorry they were and put an end to this stalemate.</p><p>Then he\u2019d take her in his arms, hold her and kiss her. This was the part he dwelled on most. The reconciliation.</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Gary Wilcox stuck his head in the office door.</p><p>Steve jerked his attention away from the phone.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone here to see you. A woman.\u201d</p><p>Impatience made Steve\u2019s blood boil. \u201cWhat did I say earlier? I gave specific instructions to tell any of my sister\u2019s friends that I\u2019m unavailable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so hard to understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Gary said without emotion. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem doing that, if it\u2019s what you really want, but I kinda had the feeling this one\u2019s special.\u201d</p><p>Knowing his foreman had cast an appreciative eye at the widow, Steve suspected it was Sandy who\u2019d dropped by unannounced. \u201cYou talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to say?\u201d</p><p>Steve rubbed a hand down his tired face. Did he have to do everything himself? \u201cI don\u2019t know, just say whatever seems appropriate. I promise you Nancy won\u2019t be sending any more eligible women to the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNancy didn\u2019t send this one.\u201d</p><p>The pen slipped from Steve\u2019s hands and rolled across the desk. \u201cWho did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say. All I got was her name. Meg Remington. I seem to recall hearing it mentioned a time or two\u2014generally when you were upset.\u201d</p><p>Steve pushed back his chair and slowly stood. His heart reacted with a swift, furious pace. \u201cMeg\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you for the last five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Steve sank back into the chair. \u201cSend her in.\u201d</p><p>A mischievous grin danced across Gary\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought you\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>Steve stood, then sat back down and busied himself with things on his desk. He wanted Meg to think he was busy. The minute she walked into the room, he\u2019d set everything aside.</p><p>A full five minutes passed and still she didn\u2019t show up. Steve came out of his office and ran into Gary, who frowned and shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d</p><p>Gary nodded. \u201cThe only thing I can figure out is that she must\u2019ve overheard you say you weren\u2019t available and left.\u201d</p><p>Steve muttered a four-letter word and hurried out. He wasn\u2019t sure where he\u2019d find her, but he wasn\u2019t going to let her walk out of his life.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at the bookstore and he didn\u2019t see her car at home. He tried the grocery store, too, for good measure. Without success.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until nearly seven that he drove to her house again. That he was willing to confront her daughter was a sign of how desperate he\u2019d become.</p><p>He stood on her front porch and rang the doorbell. Waiting for someone to answer, he buried his hands deep in his pockets. A preventive action, he realized, to keep from reaching for her the instant she appeared.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d he heard her call.</p><p>Then the door opened and Meg was standing there.</p><p>His gaze drifted over her. He\u2019d planned to play it cool, casually mention that he was in the neighborhood and heard she\u2019d stopped by the office. Their eyes met, held, and Steve forgot about hiding his feelings. She wore a pretty pale blue summer dress.</p><p>\u201cHello, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>The screen door stood between them.</p><p>They continued to stare at each other.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asked. Pride be damned. It\u2019d been cold comfort in the past two weeks. If he had to apologize, or grovel or beg forgiveness, then so be it. He wanted her back in his life.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She unlatched the door and pushed it open.</p><p>Steve stepped inside. He could barely breathe, never mind think. Pulling her into his arms didn\u2019t seem appropriate, but that was all he wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lindsey?\u201d he managed to ask.</p><p>Meg\u2019s voice was breathy and uneven. \u201cShe\u2019s out for the evening.\u201d</p><p>He needed to touch her. Reaching up, he cupped her cheek in his rough palm. Slowly, Meg closed her eyes and leaned her head into his hand.</p><p>\u201cI had to come here,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. About everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Unable to wait a second longer, Steve folded her in his arms and brought her mouth to his. Gentleness was beyond him, his hunger as great as any he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Meg grabbed his shirt as if she needed an anchor, something to secure her during the wild, sensual storm. He backed her against the door.</p><p>Meg gasped, and Steve moved a few inches away. With his hands framing her cheeks, he studied her beautiful face. Her shoulders were heaving, and he realized his own breathing was just as labored.</p><p>He rubbed the pad of his thumb across her moist, swollen lips. The action was unhurried\u2014an apology for his roughness, his eagerness.</p><p>She moaned softly and he kissed her again. Gently. With restraint. Her arms were around his neck, and Steve had never tasted a sweeter kiss.</p><p>\u201cI was going to call,\u201d he told her, burying his face in the slope of her neck. \u201cA thousand times I told myself I\u2019d call. Every minute apart from you was torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to call you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d Meg confessed. \u201cI should\u2019ve been wearing something more ... discreet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was jealous, pure and simple.\u201d He felt her smile against the side of his face and smiled, too.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve been jealous if the situation had been reversed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t date a single one of the women Nancy arranged for me to meet.\u201d</p><p>Meg jerked back. \u201cWhat women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ... it\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is to me.\u201d</p><p>He knew it would\u2019ve been to him, as well, so he explained. \u201cNancy felt it was necessary to save me from a loose woman, so she introduced me to some of her friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you refused to go out with them.\u201d Meg sounded pleased.</p><p>\u201cAll I want to do is talk to Lindsey. Get things straightened out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. But we can\u2019t right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold me,\u201d she said, nestling in his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave for a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>Steve planted tiny kisses along the side of her neck, marking his way back to her lips. \u201cWhen will Lindsey be back?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s spending the night at Brenda\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>His hold tightened. \u201cMeg,\u201d he said, then kissed her with a hunger he couldn\u2019t deny. \u201cI want to make love to you. There\u2019s a lot we have to discuss before we make that kind of commitment, but we have an opportunity to do that now, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, pacing himself. \u201cThank God you dropped in at the office. I don\u2019t know how long it would\u2019ve taken me to come to my senses otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe office?\u201d Meg repeated, breaking away from him. \u201cI was never at your office.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you were at my office or not,\u201d Steve said, kissing Meg again. Slowly. Thoroughly.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t manage even a token resistance, although her mind whirled with questions.</p><p>She was starved for the taste of him. Starved for his touch. Starved for him. The loneliness had been suffocating. Before she\u2019d met Steve, her life had seemed just fine. Then within a matter of weeks she\u2019d realized how empty everything was without him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much,\u201d she told him between deep kisses.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve phoned,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>She was so tempted to throw caution to the wind and make love with this man who excited her so much. Who made her feel alive.</p><p>If ever the moment was right it was now, with Lindsey gone until morning.</p><p>But ...</p><p>The questions returned. There\u2019d only been one man in her life, her ex-husband, Lindsey\u2019s father, and by the time they\u2019d divorced Meg had felt like a failure as a wife. Inadequate. Unresponsive.</p><p>\u201cSteve ... Steve.\u201d Her fingers were in Steve\u2019s hair as his mouth roamed over her throat. \u201cStop, please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He went still, his lips pressed against the hollow of her throat. \u201cYou want me to stop? Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease ... for just a minute. Did you say you thought I\u2019d been to your office?\u201d She wanted that confusion cleared up first.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what Gary told me.\u201d He raised his head, eyes clouded with passion. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter\u2014I\u2019m here now. I\u2019ve missed you so much. I can\u2019t believe either of us let this go on so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it does matter,\u201d she argued. \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p> <p>Steve shut his eyes and seemed to be fighting something in himself. Finally, he straightened and eased away from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too. It\u2019s just that before we ...\u201d She felt as though her face was on fire. How she wished she was more experienced, more sophisticated. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake love,\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>\u201cYes ... We should come to some sort of understanding. It\u2019s like you said\u2014we should talk first.\u201d</p><p>Steve took her by the hand. He led her into the living room and chose the big overstuffed chair that was her favorite.</p> <p>He sat and, reaching up, pulled her onto his lap. \u201cSo let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, hating the way her voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cFirst I want to clear something up. You say you didn\u2019t stop by my office this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was at the store until after six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the back room, processing orders.\u201d Because she was afraid he\u2019d think she was lying in order to save face, she added, \u201cYou can check with Laura if you want.\u201d</p> <p>Steve frowned. \u201cI believe you. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d He studied her. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t why you stopped us just now, is it?\u201d</p><p>Meg lowered her gaze. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. Are you going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d Steve\u2019s arm went around her waist. It felt good to be this close to him.</p><p>\u201cI suspect your reluctance has to do with your marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a detective to figure out that your ex-husband hurt you badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo divorce is easy,\u201d Meg admitted, \u201cbut I\u2019m not an emotional cripple, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d He drew her even closer and kissed her again. She kissed him back, offering him her heart, her soul, her body ...</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t seem to keep my hands off you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about your marriage. Instead, I\u2019m a second away from ravishing you.\u201d</p><p>And she was a second away from letting him.</p><p>\u201cIt was a friendly divorce,\u201d Meg insisted, returning to the subject he\u2019d introduced. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable one\u2014but it was safer than touching and kissing and where that would lead.</p><p>Steve eyed her suspiciously. \u201cHow friendly?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe parted amicably. It was a mutual decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat caused the divorce?\u201d</p><p>Meg closed her eyes and sighed. \u201cHe had a girlfriend,\u201d she said, trying not to reveal her bitterness. For years she\u2019d kept the feelings of hurt and betrayal buried deep.</p><p>In the beginning, that had been for Lindsey\u2019s sake. Later, she was afraid to face the anger for fear of what it would do to her. \u201cDave didn\u2019t love me anymore,\u201d she said, in an unemotional voice. As if it didn\u2019t matter. As if it had never mattered.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lindsey? He abandoned her, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew I\u2019d always be there for her, and I will. He lives in California now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his commitment to you and his daughter? That wasn\u2019t important to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014you\u2019d need to ask Dave about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did this business with the girlfriend go on before he told you about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said again. She had her suspicions, plenty of them, but none she was willing to discuss with Steve. \u201cI do know that when Dave got around to telling me he wanted a divorce, she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you felt there was nothing you could do but step aside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no problem doing that.\u201d Maybe if she\u2019d loved Dave more, she would\u2019ve been willing to fight for him. But by the time Dave told her about Brittany, she wanted out of the marriage. Just plain out.</p><p>\u201cSo you got divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, with no fuss at all. He gave me what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was willing to let me raise Lindsey.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I thinking?\u201d</p><p>She placed the back of her hand against her forehead and gave him a forlorn look, like the heroine of a silent movie. \u201cThat the divorce traumatized me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking that at all,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYour marriage had already taken care of that.\u201d</p><p>Meg dropped her hand, then raised it again to brush away her tears. How well Steve understood.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough that your husband had an affair. When he walked out on you and Lindsey, he made sure you blamed yourself for his infidelity, didn\u2019t he?\u201d She didn\u2019t respond, and he asked her a second time, his voice gentle. \u201cDidn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Meg jerked her head away for fear he\u2019d read the truth in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s over now .... It was all a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t over. If it was, we\u2019d be upstairs making love instead of sitting here talking. You haven\u2019t been able to trust another man since Dave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, her head lowered.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d he said tenderly, gathering her in his arms. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She blinked rapidly in an effort to forestall more tears. \u201cI trust you,\u201d she told him, and she knew instinctively that Steve would never betray his wife or walk away from his family.</p><p>\u201cYou do trust me,\u201d he said, \u201cotherwise you wouldn\u2019t have let me get this close to you. Just be warned. I intend to get a whole lot closer, and soon.\u201d</p><p>With anyone else Meg would have felt threatened, but with Steve it felt like a promise. A promise she wanted him to fulfill.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better that we wait to make love,\u201d he surprised her by adding.</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Her head shot up.</p><p>\u201cI want to clear the air with Lindsey first,\u201d he told her. \u201cGet things settled between us. I\u2019d much rather be her friend than her foe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d like to be Nancy\u2019s friend, too,\u201d Meg said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThose girls don\u2019t know what they started\u2014or where it\u2019s going to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly where are we going?\u201d Lindsey asked, staring out the car window.</p><p>\u201cI already told you.\u201d Meg was losing patience with her daughter.</p><p>\u201cTo see Steve at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork release, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey!\u201d Meg said emphatically. She\u2019d never known her to be this difficult. \u201cSteve has his own business. We both thought if you could see him at work, you\u2019d know that what he told you about being an ex-con was all a farce.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey remained sullen for several minutes, then asked, \u201cWhy\u2019d he say all those things if they weren\u2019t true?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter had a valid point, but they\u2019d gone over this same ground a dozen times. \u201cWe wanted you to dislike him.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately Steve\u2019s plan had worked all too well. And Meg had obviously done an equally good job with Nancy, because his sister didn\u2019t want him continuing to see her, either. What a mess they\u2019d created.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you and Steve want me to like him?\u201d Lindsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already explained, and I don\u2019t feel like repeating the story yet again,\u201d Meg said. \u201cSuffice it to say I\u2019m not especially proud of our behavior.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey pouted, but didn\u2019t ask any more questions.</p><p>Meg pulled into the parking lot at Steve\u2019s business and watched as Lindsey took in everything\u2014the well-established body shop, the customers, the neat surroundings.</p><p>There were three large bays all filled with vehicles in various states of disrepair. Men dressed in blue-striped coveralls worked on the cars.</p><p>\u201cThey all look like they came straight from a prison yard,\u201d Lindsey mumbled under her breath.</p><p>\u201cLindsey,\u201d Meg pleaded, wanting this meeting to go well. \u201cAt least give Steve a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did once, and according to you he lied.\u201d</p><p>Once more, Meg had no argument. \u201cJust listen to him, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but I\u2019m not making any promises.\u201d</p><p>The shop smelled of paint and grease; the scents weren\u2019t unpleasant. There was a small waiting area with a coffeepot, paper cups and several outdated magazines.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Meg said to the man standing behind the counter. \u201cI\u2019m Meg Remington. Steve is expecting me.\u201d</p><p>The man studied her. \u201cYou\u2019re Meg Remington?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like the Meg Remington who was in here last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind, Gary,\u201d Steve said, walking out from the office. He smiled warmly when he saw Meg. Lindsey sat in the waiting area, reading a two-year-old issue of Car and Driver as if it contained the answers to life\u2019s questions.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lindsey,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she returned in starched tones.</p><p>\u201cWould you and your mother care to come into my office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we be safe?\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile cracked Steve\u2019s mouth, but otherwise he didn\u2019t let on that her question had amused him. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, fine, since you insist.\u201d She set aside the magazine and stood.</p><p>Steve ushered them into the spotlessly clean office and gestured at the two chairs on the other side of his desk. \u201cPlease, have a seat.\u201d</p><p>They did, with Lindsey perched stiffly on the edge of hers.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Meg didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen Lindsey less friendly. It wasn\u2019t like her to behave like this. Presumably she thought she was protecting her mother.</p><p>\u201cI have a confession to make,\u201d Steve said, after an awkward moment. He leaned back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be telling this to the police?\u201d Lindsey asked.</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d His eyes connected with Meg\u2019s. She tried to tell him how sorry she was, but nothing she\u2019d said had changed Lindsey\u2019s attitude.</p><p>\u201cI did something I regret,\u201d Steve continued undaunted. \u201cI lied to you. And as often happens when people lie, it came back to haunt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I was a party to this falsehood myself,\u201d Meg added. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s really a lie?\u201d Lindsey demanded of Meg. \u201cSteve could actually be a convicted criminal. He might be sitting behind that desk, but how do we know if what he says is true?\u201d</p><p>Meg rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho are you really, Steve Conlan?\u201d Lindsey leaned forward, planting both hands on the edge of his desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exactly who I appear to be. I\u2019m thirty-eight years old. Unmarried. I own this shop and have ten full-time employees.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you prove it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Steve called.</p><p>The man who\u2019d greeted her when she first arrived stuck his head inside the door. He smiled apologetically. \u201cSorry to interrupt, but Sandy Janick\u2019s on the phone.\u201d</p> <p>Steve frowned. \u201cAre we working on Sandy\u2019s vehicle?\u201d he wanted to know. \u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing a work order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s that friend your sister was trying to set you up with. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019ll call her back,\u201d Steve said without hesitating.</p><p>Meg bristled. He\u2019d admitted that his sister had been playing matchmaker. So Nancy had set him up with another woman. Probably one without a troublesome teenager and a bunch of emotional garbage she was dragging around from a previous marriage. Meg tried to swallow the lump forming in her throat.</p><p>\u201cGary,\u201d Steve said, stopping the other man from leaving. \u201cWould you kindly tell Lindsey who owns this shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d the other man said with a grin. \u201cMostly the IRS.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Steve said impatiently.</p><p>Gary chuckled. \u201cLast I heard it was Walter Milton at Key Bank. Oops, there goes the phone again.\u201d He was gone an instant later.</p><p>\u201cWalter Milton,\u201d Lindsey said skeptically. \u201cSo you really don\u2019t own this business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalter Milton\u2019s my banker and a good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is Earl Markham, your parole officer,\u201d Lindsey snapped. \u201cA high school friend, correct?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t believe you, Mr. Conlan. If you were trying to get me to change my mind about you seeing my mother, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d Then turning to Meg, she said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust him if I were you. He\u2019s got a look about him ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d Meg and Steve asked simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2014a criminal look. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen his face before, and my guess is that it was in some post office.\u201d</p><p>Meg ground her teeth with frustration. \u201cLindsey, would you please stop being so difficult?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to date a man who lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Steve surprised them both by saying. \u201cI should never have made up that ridiculous story about being a felon. I\u2019ve learned my lesson and I won\u2019t pull that stunt again. All I\u2019m asking is that you give me a second chance to prove myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Meg resisted throwing her arms in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou know what really bothers me?\u201d Lindsey went on. \u201cThat you\u2019d involve my mother in this stupid scam of yours. That\u2019s really low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you for being angry with me,\u201d Steve said, before Meg could respond. \u201cBut don\u2019t be upset with your mother\u2014it was my idea, not hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother wouldn\u2019t stoop to anything that underhanded on her own.\u201d</p><p>Meg\u2019s eyes met Steve\u2019s and she wanted to weep with frustration.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d find it in your heart to forgive me,\u201d Steve said contritely, returning his attention to Lindsey. \u201cI\u2019d like us to be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if we were, that doesn\u2019t mean I approve of you seeing my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey,\u201d Meg began. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, we can\u2019t trust this guy,\u201d Lindsey interrupted. \u201cWe know how willing he is to lie. And what about that phone call just now?\u201d She pointed at Steve. \u201cAnother woman calls and he can hardly wait to get back to her. You saw the expression on his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Steve snapped. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about your mother. I wouldn\u2019t hurt her for the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever. That\u2019s what they all say.\u201d Lindsey had perfected the world-weary tone so beloved of teenagers everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough, Lindsey,\u201d Meg said sternly. \u201cI think you\u2019d better go wait in the car.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey leapt eagerly out of her chair and rushed from the office, leaving Steve and Meg alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, standing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to talk to her again.\u201d Steve walked around the desk and pulled her into his arms. \u201cAll she needs is a little time. Eventually she\u2019ll learn to trust me.\u201d He raised her hand to his mouth and kissed the knuckles. \u201cBut one thing\u2019s for sure ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m through with sneaking around meeting you. I\u2019m taking you to dinner tonight and I\u2019m coming to the front door. Lindsey will just have to accept that we\u2019re dating. In fact, I\u2019ll ask her if she\u2019d like to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t,\u201d Meg said with certainty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still going to ask. She may not like me now, but in time I\u2019ll win her heart, just the way I intend to win her mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>What Steve didn\u2019t seem to understand was that he\u2019d already won hers.</p><p>At seven that night, Meg was humming softly to herself and dabbing perfume on her wrists. Steve was due any minute.</p><p>The telephone rang, but Meg didn\u2019t bother to answer. There was no point. The call was almost guaranteed to be for Lindsey. She heard the girl racing at breakneck speed for the phone, as if reaching it before the second ring was some kind of personal goal.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Lindsey screeched from the kitchen downstairs, reaching her in the master bath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d she called back, checking her reflection in the bathroom mirror one last time.</p><p>Lindsey yelled something else that Meg couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Meg asked, coming out of her bedroom and hurrying downstairs.</p><p>\u201cI already told you it\u2019s Steve,\u201d Lindsey said indifferently as she passed her leaving the kitchen.</p><p>Meg glanced at her watch and reached for the phone. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, sounding discouraged. \u201cI ran into a problem and it looks like I\u2019m going to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of problem?\u201d It was already later than her normal dinnertime, and Meg was hungry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. Sandy Janick phoned and apparently she\u2019s got a flat tire ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Meg said with feigned cheerfulness, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we cancel dinner for this evening? It sounds like you\u2019ve got your hands full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry right now. It\u2019s no big deal\u2014we\u2019ll have dinner another night.\u201d</p><p>Steve hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d She was trembling so badly it was difficult to remain standing. Steve and Sandy. She suspected Nancy had arranged the flat tire, but if Steve couldn\u2019t see through that, then it was obvious he didn\u2019t want to. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Meg insisted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure .... That would be great.\u201d She barely heard the rest of the conversation. He kept talking and Meg hoped she made the appropriate responses. She must have, because a couple of minutes later he hung up.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Meg exhaled and replaced the receiver.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Meg turned to face her daughter.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unable to chase away the burning pain that attacked the pit of her stomach and radiated out.</p><p>\u201cThen how come you\u2019re so pale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, honey. Steve and I won\u2019t be going out to dinner after all.\u201d She tried to sound as if nothing was amiss, but her entire world seemed to be collapsing around her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get a pizza? Do you want to call? Order whatever you want. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She was overreacting and knew it. If Steve was doing something underhanded, he wouldn\u2019t tell her he was meeting Sandy Janick. He\u2019d do the same things Dave had done. He\u2019d lie and cheat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to change my clothes,\u201d Meg said, heading blindly for the stairs.</p><p>She half expected Lindsey to follow her and announce that she\u2019d been right all along, that Steve wasn\u2019t to be trusted. But to Meg\u2019s astonishment, her daughter said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI knew if anyone could help Sandy with her flat tire it would be you,\u201d Nancy said, smiling benevolently at her older brother.</p><p>Steve glanced at his watch, frustrated and angry with his sister\u2014and himself. She\u2019d done it again. She\u2019d manipulated him into doing something he didn\u2019t want to do. Instead of spending the evening with Meg, he\u2019d been trapped into helping these two out of a fix.</p><p>Leave it to his sister. Not only had Nancy and Sandy managed to get a flat, but they\u2019d been on the Mercer Island floating bridge in the middle of rush-hour traffic. Steve had to arrange for a tow truck and then meet them at his shop. From there, they\u2019d all ended up back at the house, and Sandy had made it clear that she was looking for a little male companionship. There was a time Steve would\u2019ve jumped at the chance to console the attractive widow. But no longer.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate your help,\u201d Sandy told him now. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He looked pointedly at his watch. It was just after nine, still early enough to steal away and visit Meg. Lindsey would disapprove, but that couldn\u2019t be avoided.</p><p>The girl was proving to be more of a problem than Steve had expected. She was downright stubborn and unwilling to give him the slightest bit of credit. Well, she was dealing with a pro, and Steve wasn\u2019t about to give up on either of the Remington women. Not without a fight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Nancy asked as Steve marched to the front door.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d His sister wore a downtrodden look, as if he\u2019d disappointed her.</p><p>\u201cI have to be going, too,\u201d Sandy Janick said. \u201cAgain, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Steve walked her to the door and said a polite goodbye, hoping it really was goodbye. He wished her well, but wasn\u2019t interested in becoming her knight in shining armor. Not when there was another damsel whose interest he coveted.</p><p>He closed the door as he went to retrieve his car keys from the hall table and grab his jacket.</p><p>Nancy got up and followed him as he prepared to leave. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Steve glared at his sister. \u201cWhat makes you think it\u2019s any of your business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have a feeling that you\u2019re off to see that ... that floozy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFloozy? What on earth have you been reading?\u201d Shaking his head, he muttered, \u201cMeg isn\u2019t a floozy or a woman of ill repute or a hussy or any other silly term you want to call her. She\u2019s a single mother and a businesswoman. She owns a bookstore. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what she told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen. I\u2019m thirty-eight years old and I won\u2019t have my little sister running my love life. Now, I helped you and your friend, but I had to break a dinner date with Meg to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m glad Sandy got that flat tire,\u201d she said defiantly.</p> <p>Steve had had enough. \u201cStay out of my life, Nancy. I\u2019m warning you.\u201d</p><p>His sister raised her head dramatically, as if she\u2019d come to some momentous decision. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m really sorry, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand idly by and watch the brother I\u2019ve always loved and admired make a complete fool of himself. Especially over a woman like that.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s patience was gone. Vanished. But before he could say a word, Nancy threw herself in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you do this!\u201d she said, stretching her arms across the door.</p><p>The phone rang just then, and Steve knew he\u2019d been saved by the bell. Nancy flew across the room to answer it.</p><p>Hoping to make a clean getaway, Steve opened the door and dashed outside. As he\u2019d suspected, Nancy tore out after him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d she called from the front porch.</p><p>Steve was already in his car and he wasn\u2019t going to be waylaid by his sister a second time.</p><p>\u201cTell whoever it is I\u2019ll call back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey,\u201d she called at the top of her voice. \u201cAnd she wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>The last person Steve expected to hear from was Meg\u2019s standoffish teenage daughter. He climbed out of his car and ran up the porch steps. He walked directly past his sister and without saying a word went straight to the phone.</p><p>\u201cLindsey? What\u2019s the problem?\u201d he asked. He was in no mood for games and he wanted her to know it.</p><p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d Lindsey asked him.</p><p>Steve noticed that her voice was lower than usual. He assumed that meant Meg wasn\u2019t aware of her daughter\u2019s call.</p> <p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s here,\u201d he answered. Nancy stood with her arms folded, frowning at him with unconcealed disapproval.</p><p>\u201cAnyone else?\u201d Lindsey asked, then added snidely, \u201cEspecially someone named Sandy.\u201d</p><p>It sounded as if Lindsey was jealous on her mother\u2019s behalf, which was ridiculous. The kid would be glad of an excuse to get rid of him. \u201cNo. Sandy left a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were with her,\u201d she accused.</p><p>In light of the confrontation he\u2019d just had with his sister, Steve\u2019s hold on his patience was already strained. \u201cIs there a reason for your call?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lindsey muttered with an undignified huff. \u201cI want to know what you said that upset my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I said?\u201d Steve didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cAfter you called, she told me to order pizza for dinner and then she said I could have anything on it I wanted. She knows I like anchovies and she can\u2019t stand \u2018em. Then,\u201d Lindsey said, after a short pause, \u201cthe pizza came and she looked at me like she didn\u2019t have a clue where it came from. Something\u2019s wrong and I want you to tell me what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s just not herself.\u201d Another pause, a longer one this time. \u201cYou\u2019d better come over and talk to her.\u201d</p><p>An invitation from the veritable dragon of a daughter herself? This was a stroke of luck. \u201cYou sure you can trust me?\u201d he couldn\u2019t resist asking.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said with feeling. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I have a choice. My mom likes you although I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d</p><p>The kid was a definite hazard to his ego, but Steve decided to let the comment pass.</p><p>\u201cYou think your mother\u2019s upset because I broke our dinner date?\u201d he asked. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got news for you\u2014she\u2019s the one who called it off. She said it was no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Steve could picture the girl rolling her eyes. \u201cEither you aren\u2019t as smart as you look, or you\u2019ve been in prison for so long you don\u2019t know anything about women.\u201d</p><p>Steve didn\u2019t find either possibility flattering. \u201cAll I did was phone to tell her I was going to be late. What\u2019s so awful about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were late because you were meeting another woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d Steve protested. \u201cI was helping another woman. Actually two women, one of whom was my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it? My dad left my mother because of another woman. He made up all these lies about where he was and what he was doing so he could be with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re worried that your mother assumes I\u2019m doing the same thing? Lindsey, isn\u2019t that a bit of a stretch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ... no. I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I know is you canceled\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe canceled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dinner date because you were meeting another woman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping another woman and my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. All I know is that Mom hasn\u2019t been the same since, and if you care about her the way you keep saying ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest you get over here, and fast.\u201d The line was abruptly disconnected.</p><p>Steve stared at the receiver, then replaced it, shaking his head as he did.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Meg?\u201d Nancy asked.</p><p>Steve shrugged. \u201cDarned if I know. No one ever told me falling in love was so complicated.\u201d Having said that, he marched out the door.</p><p>Nancy ran after him. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure am.\u201d</p><p>A huge smile lit up his sister\u2019s face. Steve stood next to his car, wondering if he was seeing things. A smile was the last reaction he would\u2019ve expected from Nancy.</p><p>He muttered to himself on the short drive to Meg\u2019s house. He didn\u2019t stop muttering\u2014about women and daughters and sisters\u2014until he rang the doorbell.</p><p>The door was opened two seconds later by Lindsey. \u201cIt took you long enough,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLindsey, who is it?\u201d Meg asked, stepping out from the kitchen. She\u2019d apparently been putting away dishes, because she had a plate and a coffee mug in her hand. \u201cSteve,\u201d she whispered, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had dinner yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Lindsey answered for her mother. \u201cShe nibbled on a slice of pizza, but that was only so I wouldn\u2019t bug her. I ordered her favorite kind, too.\u201d She paused and grimaced. \u201cVegetarian. Even though I like anchovies and pepperoni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you hungry?\u201d Steve asked, silencing Lindsey with a look.</p><p>Meg raised one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cNot really. What about you? Did you get anything to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s leftover pizza if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m interested,\u201d he said, moving toward her. Lindsey was right\u2014Meg seemed upset.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to eat, are you?\u201d Lindsey demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Steve asked.</p><p>The girl sighed loudly. \u201cWhat my mother needs here is reassurance. If you had a romantic thought in that empty space between your ears, you\u2019d take her in your arms and ... and kiss her.\u201d</p><p>All Steve could do was stand there and stare. This was the same annoying girl who\u2019d been a source of constant irritation from the moment they\u2019d met. Something had changed, and he didn\u2019t know what or why.</p><p>\u201cLindsey?\u201d Meg obviously had the same questions as Steve.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lindsey asked. \u201cOh, you want to know why I changed my mind. Well, I\u2019ve been thinking. If Steve really meant what he said about being friends, then I guess I\u2019m willing to meet him halfway.\u201d This was said as if it had come at great personal sacrifice. She turned to Steve. \u201cActually, I can\u2019t see any way around it. It\u2019s clear to me that my mother\u2019s fallen in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey!\u201d</p><p>Steve enjoyed the way Meg\u2019s blush colored her pale cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s equally clear to me that Steve feels the same, especially if he was willing to put up with all my insults. Frankly, I can\u2019t see fighting it any longer. What\u2019s the point? And really, I can\u2019t keep a constant eye on you two. I do have my own life.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey\u2019s change of heart was welcome news to Steve. The kid held the all-important key to Meg\u2019s heart. He\u2019d never win her love, if he didn\u2019t gain Lindsey\u2019s approval first.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get the idea I like any of this,\u201d Lindsey added\u2014to salvage her pride, he guessed. \u201cBut I can learn to live with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Steve said, offering her his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s shake on it.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey studied his hand as if she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to touch him. But once she did, her shake was firm and confident.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like you were supposed to be,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for being such a disappointment,\u201d he said out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do anything about that now. Mom\u2019s crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s pretty terrific, too.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey sighed. \u201cSo I noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d Meg asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Lindsey answered with exaggerated innocence. She looked at Steve and winked.</p><p>He returned her wink, pleased to be on solid ground with the girl. \u201cDid someone say something about pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Meg told him. \u201cCome into the kitchen and I\u2019ll microwave the leftovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Lindsey groaned. \u201cI thought I could count on you to be a little more romantic. Or do I have to do everything myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do wrong now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you make Steve something special?\u201d</p><p>Meg took a moment to think this over. \u201cI\u2019ve got chicken I could make into a salad. If he doesn\u2019t like that, there\u2019s always peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have the pizza,\u201d Steve interjected. He didn\u2019t want Meg wasting her time preparing a meal, all in the name of some romantic fantasy. He wanted her to talk\u2014and to listen.</p><p>Before Lindsey could protest, Steve followed Meg into the kitchen. \u201cDo you know what that was about?\u201d</p><p>Meg smiled and opened the refrigerator. \u201cNope.\u201d She took out the pizza box and set it on the counter.</p><p>Steve climbed onto the stool. \u201cSo what happened earlier?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meg hesitated, separating a piece of the pizza. \u201cI suppose Lindsey called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I was already on my way over here.\u201d</p><p>He saw that she avoided his eyes, as she made busy-work of setting two huge slices of pizza on a plate and heating them in the microwave. \u201cAfter your phone call, I had kind of a panic attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d he prompted.</p> <p>\u201cYou ... Us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I worked it out myself. I felt pretty foolish afterward. I realized you aren\u2019t the same kind of man Dave was ... is. If you call to say you\u2019re helping another woman, then that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was seeing someone else?\u201d Lindsey had implied as much, but he hadn\u2019t taken it seriously.</p><p>\u201cI feel silly now,\u201d she said, setting the sizzling pizza slices in front of him. She propped her elbows on the counter and rested her chin in her palms. \u201cIt was as if the craziness of my marriage was back. You see, at one time I tried to believe Dave. He\u2019d make up the most outrageous stories to account for the huge periods of time he was away from home, and like a naive idiot, I\u2019d believe him.\u201d She paused. \u201cI guess because I wanted to. But Dave\u2019s not my problem anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA leopard doesn\u2019t change his spots,\u201d Steve said, finishing off the first slice. \u201cIf Dave cheated on you, he\u2019ll cheat on his present wife, too. It stands to reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. From what Lindsey said after her last visit to California, Dave\u2019s marriage is on shaky ground. I\u2019m sorry for him and for his wife.\u201d</p><p>Steve offered Meg the second slice, which she declined. He\u2019d just taken a bite when the low strains of soulful violin music drifted toward them. Steve glanced at Meg and she shrugged, perplexed.</p><p>Lindsey appeared in the kitchen, looking thoroughly disgusted. \u201cYou two need my help, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d Steve repeated. \u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomance.\u201d She walked into the room and took Steve\u2019s hand and then her mother\u2019s. She led them both into the living room. The furniture had been pushed to one side and the lights turned down low. Two crystal glasses and a bottle of red wine sat on the coffee table, ready to be put to good use.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I\u2019ll disappear into my room for a while,\u201d she said, \u201cand you two can do all the things I\u2019ve read about in novels.\u201d</p><p>Steve and Meg stared blankly at each other.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you need help with that, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can take it from here,\u201d Steve was quick to assure her.</p><p>\u201cI should hope so,\u201d Lindsey muttered. With an air of superiority she headed up the stairs.</p><p>The music was sultry. Inviting. Once Lindsey was out of sight, Steve held his arms open to Meg. \u201cShall we dance?\u201d</p><p>Steve could\u2019ve sworn she blushed, very prettily, too, before she slipped into his embrace. He brought her close and sighed, reveling in the feel of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very good at dancing,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t worry. All we have to do is shift our feet a little.\u201d He laid his cheek next to hers.</p><p>He\u2019d never had the time or the patience for romance. Or so he\u2019d believed. Then he\u2019d met Meg and his organized, safe, secure world had been turned upside down. Nothing had been the same since, and Steve suspected it never would be again.</p><p>Even Gary Wilcox seemed to recognize the difference between Steve\u2019s attitude toward Meg and his attitude to the other women he\u2019d dated over the years. Steve didn\u2019t know how his foreman had figured it out, but he had. Of course, inviting Meg and Lindsey to the shop might have given Gary a clue. The idea of letting Lindsey see him at work had been an excuse; in reality he\u2019d been trying to impress Meg, show her how successful he was. Prove to her that he was worthy of her attention.</p><p>Steve had always kept his personal life separate from the business. His personal life\u2014that was a joke. He\u2019d worked for years, dedicating his life to building a thriving business. He\u2019d been successful, but that success had come at a price. There was very little room in his life for love.</p><p>But there was room for Meg and Lindsey.</p><p>Meg\u2019s lithe body moved with the music provocatively, seductively, against his. He wanted to hold her even tighter, kiss her, caress her ...</p><p>They stopped moving, the pretense of dancing more than he could sustain. \u201cI want you so badly,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Meg sighed and raised her head so their eyes met in the dim light. \u201cI want you, too. It frightens me how much ... \u201c</p><p>He ran his fingers up through her hair and held his breath as he slowly lowered his mouth to hers. \u201cOh, Meg.\u201d He kissed her over and over, unable to get enough of her.</p><p>The sound of a throat being cleared suddenly penetrated his brain.</p><p>Lindsey. Again.</p><p>Steve groaned inwardly. Slowly, reluctantly, he loosened his grip on Meg and eased his body away from hers.</p><p>She resisted. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey\u2019s back,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Meg buried her face in his sweater.</p><p>\u201cHello, again,\u201d Lindsey said cheerfully from the stairs. \u201cIt looks like I returned in the nick of time.\u201d She pranced down the steps, walked over to the wine bottle and sadly shook her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even open the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get a chance,\u201d Steve muttered.</p><p>\u201cI gave you twenty minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom what I can see, that was about five minutes longer than I should\u2019ve waited. You\u2019re a fast worker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey,\u201d Meg said, in what was obviously meant to be her sternest voice. Unfortunately, the effect was more tentative than severe.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m making a pest of myself\u2014and I apologize, I really do. But we\u2019ve been talking about this stuff in my sex-ed. class, and there\u2019s a case to be made for abstinence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with your mother and me?\u201d Steve made the mistake of asking.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really want me to answer that, do you?\u201d Lindsey asked. \u201cMom\u2019s flustered enough as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could discuss safe sex, if you want.\u201d</p><p>Steve watched in fascination as Meg\u2019s face turned a deep shade of red. \u201cLindsey!\u201d This time her mother\u2019s voice was loud and clear. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom, but I figured we should raise the subject now instead of later.\u201d She dropped down on the sofa, then reached for the wine bottle and examined the label. \u201cIt\u2019s a good month, too. September. Brenda\u2019s uncle bought it for us. He said it wasn\u2019t a great wine, but it\u2019d get the job done.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s hand gripped Meg\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt was, uh, thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She smiled broadly. \u201cBut we were going for the romantic element.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Steve said, \u201cwould you mind if your mother and I talked? By ourselves? We didn\u2019t get much of a chance to do that earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019d be all right\u2014only I need to know something first.\u201d She set the wine bottle down and looked intently at Steve. \u201cAre you going to marry my mother?\u201d</p><p>Meg made a small mewling noise that suggested she was mortified beyond words. She sank onto the ottoman and covered her face with both hands.</p><p>\u201cWell, are you?\u201d Lindsey pressed, ignoring her mother entirely.</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t very well say he hadn\u2019t been thinking along those lines. There\u2019d been little else on his mind for the past few days. He loved Meg. When he wasn\u2019t with her, it felt as if something was missing from his life. From his heart.</p><p>Steve had never imagined himself with a ready-made family, but he couldn\u2019t see himself without Meg and Lindsey. Not now.</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s a subject your mother and I need to discuss privately, but since you asked I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey got to her feet and Meg dropped her hands and looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to marry us, aren\u2019t you.\u201d Lindsey\u2019s words were more statement than question. A satisfied smile lit up her face. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your mother will have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will, trust me,\u201d Lindsey answered, looking gleeful. \u201cI\u2019ve known my mother forever and I\u2019ve never seen her this gaga over a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do my own talking, thank you very much,\u201d Meg said. \u201cThis is the most humiliating moment of my life\u2014thanks to you, Lindsey Marie Remington.\u201d She stood, hands on her hips. \u201cGo to your room and we\u2019ll talk when I\u2019ve finished begging Steve to forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do that was so terrible?\u201d Lindsey muttered.</p><p>Meg pointed to the stairs.</p><p>It looked as though Lindsey was about to argue; apparently she thought better of it. Her shoulders slumped forward and she moved slowly toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI was just helping,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that later, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey\u2019s blue eyes met Steve\u2019s as she passed him. \u201cI know I\u2019m in trouble when she calls me young lady. She\u2019s mad. Be careful what you say. Don\u2019t ruin everything now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try my best,\u201d Steve promised.</p><p>Meg waited until her daughter had reached the top of the stairs before she spoke. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how sorry I am about that.\u201d Although her voice was calm, Steve wasn\u2019t fooled. Meg was angry, just as Lindsey had said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Lindsey apologize after I\u2019ve had a chance to cool down,\u201d Meg was saying. \u201cI don\u2019t dare speak to her now.\u201d She paced the carpet. \u201cI want you to know I absolve you from everything that was said.\u201d</p><p>Steve rubbed his jaw. \u201cAbsolve me from what, precisely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it understood, here and now, that I don\u2019t expect you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I like the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she flared. \u201cNot when my daughter practically ordered you to propose. Now,\u201d she said with a deep breath, \u201cI think it might be best if you left.\u201d</p><p>Steve tried to protest, but Meg ushered him to the door and he could see that this wasn\u2019t the time to reason with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been so mortified in my life,\u201d Meg told Laura. She counted the change and put it in the cash register. The store was due to open in ten minutes and she felt far from ready to deal with customers.</p><p>\u201cBut he said he wanted to marry you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a pity proposal. Good grief, what else could he say?\u201d</p><p>Laura restocked the front display with the latest bestsellers. \u201cSteve doesn\u2019t look like the kind of guy who\u2019d propose if he didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>Meg wanted to find a hole, crawl inside and hide for the rest of her natural life. No one seemed to appreciate the extent of her humiliation. Steve certainly hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d tried to conceal it from her, but he\u2019d viewed the incident with Lindsey as one big joke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hadn\u2019t intended to mention it to anyone. Laura knew because she\u2019d sensed something was wrong with Meg, and in a moment of weakness, Meg had blurted out the entire episode.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Lindsey about what she did?\u201d Laura asked.</p><p>\u201cIn my current frame of mind,\u201d Meg told her, \u201cI thought it better not to try. I\u2019ll talk to her when I can do so without screaming or weeping in frustration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Laura said, hugging a book to her chest, \u201cis what happened to bring about such a reversal in her attitude to Steve. The last time we talked, you were pulling out your hair because she refused to believe he wasn\u2019t a convicted felon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with her. I just don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit, this romance between you and Steve has taken some unexpected twists and turns,\u201d Laura said. \u201cFirst, you didn\u2019t even want to meet him, then once you did you agreed not to see each other again. It would\u2019ve ended there if not for the flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich didn\u2019t even come from Steve. He was just glad to be done with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way I remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019ll ever see him again,\u201d Meg said, slamming the cash drawer shut.</p> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d Laura said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame him. No man in his right mind would want to get tangled up with Lindsey and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Laura sounded so definite about that. Meg desperately wanted to believe her, but she knew better. When she closed the shop at six that evening, she still hadn\u2019t heard from Steve, which convinced Meg that he was relieved to be free of her.</p><p>Lindsey was sitting in the living room reading when Meg got home from work. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, taking a huge bite out of a big red Delicious apple.</p><p>Meg set aside her purse and slipped off her shoes. The tiles in the entryway felt cool against her aching feet.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me anymore, are you?\u201d Lindsey asked. She got off the sofa and moved into the kitchen, where Meg was pouring herself a glass of iced tea.</p><p>\u201cYou embarrassed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve wasn\u2019t embarrassed,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you feel if I called up Dale Kotz and told him you wanted to go to the ninth-grade dance with him? He\u2019d probably agree, because he likes you, but you\u2019d never know if Dale would\u2019ve asked you himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lindsey didn\u2019t say anything for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s more than that, Lindsey. I was mortified to the very marrow of my bones. I felt like you pressured Steve into proposing.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey sat in one of the kitchen chairs. \u201cWould you believe me if I told you I was sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it doesn\u2019t change what happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are still angry, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Meg said, opening the refrigerator and taking out lettuce for a salad. \u201cI\u2019m not angry anymore, just incredibly embarrassed and hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, Mom,\u201d Lindsey said in a low voice. \u201cI was only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey, but you didn\u2019t. You made everything much, much worse.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey hung her head. \u201cI feel just awful.\u201d</p><p>Meg didn\u2019t feel much better herself. She sat down at the table, next to her daughter, and patted Lindsey\u2019s hand.</p><p>Lindsey managed a weak smile, then fell into her mother\u2019s arms and hid her face against Meg\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMen are so dumb sometimes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBrenda says love is like a game of connect the dots. Only with men, you have to make the dots and then draw the lines. They don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Meg stroked her daughter\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Meg smiled for the first time that day. \u201cYeah, I think I do. I certainly didn\u2019t plan on falling in love with him, that\u2019s for sure. It just sort of ... happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he expected to fall in love with you, either.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell chimed, and horrified that she might be caught crying, Lindsey broke away from her mother and hurriedly brushed the tears from her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Meg said. She padded barefoot into the hallway and opened the door.</p><p>Steve stood on the other side, holding a dozen long-stemmed roses. He grinned. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, handing her the flowers. \u201cI thought we\u2019d try this marriage-proposal thing again, only this time we\u2019ll do it my way\u2014not Lindsey\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cMarriage proposal?\u201d Meg repeated, staring down at the roses in her arms. \u201cReally, Steve, there\u2019s no need to do this.\u201d Her throat was closing up on her; she could barely speak and she couldn\u2019t meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\u201cIs it Brenda?\u201d Lindsey called from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve!\u201d Lindsey cried excitedly. \u201cThis is great. Maybe I didn\u2019t ruin everything after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Meg,\u201d Steve said softly.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She still couldn\u2019t look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I was hoping we could do that,\u201d Meg told him. \u201cThey\u2019re lovely, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She handed Lindsey the flowers. \u201cWould you take care of these for me?\u201d she asked her daughter. \u201cSteve and I are going to talk and we\u2019d appreciate some privacy. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey disappeared into the kitchen and Meg sat down on the sofa. Steve sat beside her and took her hand. She wished he wasn\u2019t so close. The man had a way of muddling her most organized thoughts.</p><p>\u201cBefore you say anything, I have a couple of things I\u2019d like to talk to you about,\u201d she began. She freed her hand from his and clasped her knees. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking and ... and I\u2019ve come to a few conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs,\u201d she said. Dragging in a deep breath, she continued. \u201cLaura reminded me this afternoon that our relationship has taken some unexpected twists and turns. Neither one of us wanted to meet the other\u2014we were thrown into an impossible situation.</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have seen each other again if it wasn\u2019t for the flowers your sister sent me. From the moment we met, we\u2019ve had two other people dictating our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo some extent that\u2019s true,\u201d Steve agreed, \u201cbut we wouldn\u2019t have allowed any of this to happen if we hadn\u2019t been attracted to each other from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she admitted slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, maybe?\u201d Steve asked.</p><p>\u201cI think we both need some time apart to decide what we really want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had thirty-eight years to look for what I want and I\u2019ve found it. I\u2019d like to make you and Lindsey a permanent part of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Lindsey,\u201d Meg said. \u201cAs you might have noticed, she\u2019s fifteen going on thirty. I have a feeling this is what the rest of the teen years are going to be like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could use a gentle hand to help you steer her in the right direction.\u201d Steve leapt to his feet and jerked his fingers through his hair. \u201cListen, if you\u2019re trying to suggest you\u2019d rather not marry me, just say so.\u201d</p><p>Meg straightened, keeping her back stiff. For a moment she couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying,\u201d she finally managed.</p><p>Steve froze, and it was clear to Meg that he was in shock. \u201cI see,\u201d he said after a long pause. \u201cThen what do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Meg closed her eyes. \u201cMaybe it\u2019d be best if we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it, Meg,\u201d he warned in low tones, \u201cbecause we\u2019ll both know it\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019d be best if we\u2014\u201d she felt she had to say the words \u201c\u2014didn\u2019t see each other for a while.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s smile was filled with sarcasm. \u201cLet me tell you something, Meg Remington, because someone obviously needs to. Your husband walked out on you and your daughter. It happens. It wasn\u2019t the first time a man deserted his family for another woman and it won\u2019t be the last. But you\u2019ve spent the past ten years building a wall around you and Lindsey.</p><p>\u201cNo one else was allowed in until Lindsey took matters into her own hands. Now that I\u2019m here, you don\u2019t know what to do. You started to care for me and now you\u2019re scared to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cYour safe, secure world is being threatened by another man. Do you think I don\u2019t know you love me?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy about me. I feel the same way about you, and to be fair, you\u2019ve done a damned good job of shaking up my world, too.</p><p>\u201cIf you want it to end here and now, okay, but at least be honest about it. You\u2019re pushing me away because you\u2019re afraid of knocking down those walls of yours. You\u2019re afraid to trust another man with your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have me all figured out,\u201d she said, trying\u2014without much success\u2014to sound sarcastic. To sound as if her emotions were unaffected by his words.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to leave without giving you this diamond burning a hole in my pocket, then fine. But don\u2019t think it\u2019s over, because it isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t give up that easily.\u201d He stalked out of the room and paused at her front door. \u201cDon\u2019t get a false sense of security. I\u2019ll be back and next time I\u2019m bringing reinforcements.\u201d The door closed with a bang.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Lindsey asked, slipping into the room and sitting down next to Meg. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Meg struggled not to weep. \u201cI ... got cold feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you told me you were in love with Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you send him away?\u201d</p><p>Meg released her breath. \u201cBecause I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop him,\u201d Lindsey said urgently.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t .... It\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Lindsey argued and rushed out the front door. A part of Meg wanted to stop her daughter. Meg\u2019s pride had taken enough of a beating in the past few days. But her heart, her treacherous heart, knew that the battle had already been lost. She was in love with Steve Conlan.</p><p>A minute later Lindsey burst into the house, breathing hard. Panting, she said between giant gulps of air, \u201cSteve says ... if you want to talk to him ... you\u2019re going to have to come outside ... yourself.\u201d</p><p>Meg clasped her hands together. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSitting in his truck. Hurry, Mom! I don\u2019t think ... he\u2019ll wait much longer.\u201d</p><p>With her heart pounding, Meg walked onto the porch and leaned against the column. Steve\u2019s truck was parked at the curb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned his head when he saw her. His eyes were cold. Unfriendly. Unwelcoming.</p><p>Meg bit her lip and met his gaze squarely. It took every ounce of resolve she had to move off the porch and take a few steps toward him. She paused halfway across the freshly mowed lawn.</p><p>Steve rolled down the window. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She blinked, her heart racing.</p> <p>\u201cLindsey said you had something you wanted to tell me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Meg should\u2019ve known better than to let Lindsey do her talking for her. She opened her mouth, but her throat was clogged with tears. She tried to swallow, refusing to cry in front of him.</p><p>\u201cSay it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither you say it or I\u2019m leaving.\u201d He turned away from her and started the engine.</p> <p>\u201cMom, we\u2019re going to lose him,\u201d Lindsey cried from the porch. \u201cDon\u2019t let him go ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Steve switched off the engine. \u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Steve Conlan. I\u2019m scared out of my wits. You\u2019re right\u2014I have built a wall around us. I don\u2019t want to lose you. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m ... afraid.\u201d Her voice caught on the last word.</p><p>His eyes held hers and after a moment, he smiled. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so difficult, now, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d she countered. \u201cIt was incredibly hard.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to realize she was standing on her front lawn with half the neighborhood looking on as she told him how much she loved him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to marry me, Meg Remington.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>He got out of his truck, slammed the door and with three long strides eliminated the distance between them. \u201cWill you or will you not marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said, laughing and crying at the same time, then she ran to meet him halfway.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Steve hauled her into his arms and buried her in his embrace. He grabbed her about the waist and whirled her around, then half carried her back into the house.</p><p>Once inside, he kicked the door shut and and they leaned against it, kissing frantically.</p><p>Lindsey cleared her throat behind them. \u201cI hate to interrupt, but I have a few important questions.\u201d</p><p>Steve hid his face in Meg\u2019s neck and mumbled something she couldn\u2019t hear, which was no doubt for the best.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, kiddo, what do you want to know?\u201d Steve asked when he\u2019d regrouped.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married?\u201d Lindsey asked. Meg liked the way she\u2019d included herself.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Steve assured her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a family.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey let out a holler that could be heard three blocks away.</p><p>\u201cWhere will we live? Your house or ours?\u201d</p><p>Steve looked at Meg. \u201cDo you care?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll live wherever you want,\u201d Steve told the girl. \u201cI imagine staying close to your friends is important, so we\u2019ll take that into consideration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Lindsey beamed him a smile. \u201cWhat about adding to the family? Mom\u2019s willing, I think.\u201d</p><p>Once more Steve looked at Meg, and laughing, she nodded. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d she murmured, \u201cthere\u2019ll be several additions to this family.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes grew intense, and Meg knew he was thinking the same thing she was. She wanted his babies as much as she wanted this man. She loved him, desired him, anticipating all they could discover together, all they could learn from each other.</p><p>\u201cOne last thing,\u201d Lindsey said.</p><p>It was hard to pull her eyes away from Steve, but she wanted to include Lindsey in these important decisions. \u201cYes, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t go shopping for your wedding dress alone. You\u2019re really good at lots of things, but frankly, Mom, you don\u2019t have any fashion sense.\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, Lindsey, Brenda and Steve\u2019s sister, Nancy, were all involved in the process of choosing the all-important wedding dress. Steve, naturally, wasn\u2019t allowed within a hundred feet of Meg and her dress until the day of the ceremony.</p><p>The wedding took place three months later, with family and friends gathered around. Lindsey proudly served as her mother\u2019s maid of honor.</p><p>Steve endured all the formality because he knew it mattered to Meg and to Lindsey. Nancy and his mother seemed to enjoy making plans for the wedding, too. All that was required of him was to show up and say \u201cI do,\u201d which suited Steve just fine.</p><p>In his view, this fuss over weddings was for women. Men considered it a necessary evil. Or so he believed until his wedding day. When he saw Meg walk down the aisle, the emotion that throbbed in his chest came as a complete and utter surprise.</p><p>He\u2019d known he loved her\u2014he must, to put up with all the craziness that had befallen their courtship. But he hadn\u2019t realized how deep that love went. Not until he saw Meg so solemn and so beautiful. His bride. She stole his breath as he gazed at her.</p><p>The reception was a blur. Every time he looked at Meg he found it difficult to believe that this beautiful, vibrant woman was his wife. His thoughts were a jumbled, confused mess as he greeted those he needed to greet and thanked those he needed to thank.</p><p>It seemed half a lifetime before he was alone with his wife. He\u2019d booked the honeymoon suite at a hotel close to Sea-Tac airport. The following morning they were flying to Hawaii for two weeks. Meg had never seen the islands. Steve suspected he didn\u2019t need a tropical playground to discover paradise. He would find that in her arms.</p><p>\u201cMy husband.\u201d Meg said the word shyly as Steve fumbled with the key card to unlock their suite. \u201cI like the way it sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I, but not quite as much as I like the sound of wife.\u201d With the door open, he swept Meg into his arms and carried her into the room.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t taken two steps before they started to kiss.</p><p>Meg tasted of wedding cake and champagne, of passion and love. She wound her arms around his neck and enticed him to kiss her again. Steve didn\u2019t need much of an invitation.</p><p>At the unbridled desire he read in her eyes, Steve moaned and carried her to the bed. After he\u2019d set her feet on the floor, he kissed her again, slowly, with all the pent-up desire inside him.</p><p>He reached behind her for the zipper of her dress. \u201cI haven\u2019t made any secret of how much I want to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she whispered, kissing his jaw. \u201cThank you for agreeing to wait. It meant a lot to me to start our marriage this way.\u201d</p><p>He slipped the sleeve down her arm and kissed the ivory perfection of one shoulder. Then he kissed the other, his lips blazing a trail up the side of her neck to the hollow of her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou make my knees go weak,\u201d she told him in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cMine are, too.\u201d</p><p>Together they collapsed on the bed. Steve kissed her and loosened his tie. With their lips joined, Meg\u2019s fingers worked at his shirt, undressing him.</p><p>Soon they were lost in each other, loving each other, immersed in a world of their own. A world from which they didn\u2019t emerge until the summer sun had been replaced by a glittering moon and a sky full of stars.</p><p>Back at the reception, Lindsey sat with Steve\u2019s sister, Nancy, and licked the icing off their fingertips. \u201cDo you suppose they\u2019ll ever figure it out?\u201d</p><p>Nancy sipped champagne from a crystal flute. \u201cI doubt either of them is thinking about much right now\u2014except each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made some real mistakes, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Nancy said, eyeing Lindsey.</p><p>\u201cOkay, me. I\u2019ll admit I nearly ruined everything by pushing the marriage issue. How was I to know my mother would take it so personally? Jeez, she just about had a heart attack, and all because I suggested Steve marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked out, though,\u201d Nancy said, looking pleased with herself. \u201cAnd I made a few blunders of my own. Getting my friend to go to the shop and say she was Meg wasn\u2019t the smartest thing I\u2019ve ever done. Steve was bound to find out sooner or later that it wasn\u2019t Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we had to do something,\u201d Lindsey insisted. \u201cThey were both being so stubborn. One of them had to give in. Besides, your ploy worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than the flowers I sent.\u201d</p><p>Lindsey sampled another bite of wedding cake. \u201cYou know what was the hardest part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it was for me. I had one heck of a time keeping a straight face when your mother came to the house dressed in a Tina Turner wig and five-inch heels. Oh, Lindsey, if you could\u2019ve seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve was pretty funny himself, with his leather jacket and that bad-boy smirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one of them\u2019s any good at acting,\u201d Nancy said, still grinning.</p><p>\u201cNot like us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like us,\u201d Nancy agreed.</p><p>Father\u2019s Day</p><p>Debbie Macomber</p><p>For Lois and Bill Hoskins,</p><p>living proof that love is</p><p>better the second time around.</p><p>One</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this,\u201d Robin Masterson muttered as she crawled into the makeshift tent, which was pitched over the clothesline in the backyard of her new home.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mom,\u201d ten-year-old Jeff urged, shifting to make room for her. \u201cIt\u2019s nice and warm in here.\u201d</p><p>Down on all fours, a flashlight in one hand, Robin squeezed her way inside. Jeff had constructed the flimsy tent using clothespegs to hold up the blankets and rocks to secure the base. The space was tight, but she managed to maneuver into her sleeping bag.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this great?\u201d Jeff asked. He stuck his head out of the front opening and gazed at the dark sky and the spattering of stars that winked back at them. On second thought, Robin decided they were laughing at her, those stars. And with good reason. There probably wasn\u2019t another thirty-year-old woman in the entire state of California who would\u2019ve agreed to this craziness.</p><p>It was the first night in their new house and Robin was exhausted. They\u2019d started moving out of the apartment before five that morning and she\u2019d just finished unpacking the last box. The beds were assembled, but Jeff wouldn\u2019t hear of doing anything as mundane as sleeping on a real mattress. After waiting years to camp out in his own backyard, her son wasn\u2019t about to delay the adventure by even one night.</p><p>Robin couldn\u2019t let him sleep outside alone and, since he hadn\u2019t met any neighbors yet, there was only one option left. Surely there\u2019d be a Mother of the Year award in this for her.</p><p>\u201cYou want to hear a joke?\u201d Jeff asked, rolling on to his back and nudging her.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She swallowed a yawn, hoping she could stay awake long enough to laugh at the appropriate time. She needn\u2019t have worried.</p><p>For the next half hour, Robin was entertained with a series of riddles, nonsense rhymes and off-key renditions of Jeff\u2019s favourite songs from summer camp.</p><p>\u201cKnock knock,\u201d she said when it appeared her son had run through his repertoire.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWanda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanda who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanda who thinks up these silly jokes?\u201d</p><p>Jeff laughed as though she\u2019d come up with the funniest line ever devised. Her son\u2019s enthusiasm couldn\u2019t help but rub off on Robin and some of her weariness eased. Camping was fun\u2014sort of. But it\u2019d been years since she\u2019d slept on the ground and, frankly, she couldn\u2019t remember it being quite this hard.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll be warm enough?\u201d she teased. Jeff had used every blanket they owned, first to construct the tent and then to pad it. To be on the safe side, two or three more were piled on top of their sleeping bags on the offchance an arctic frost descended upon them. It was spring, but a San Francisco spring could be chilly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he answered, missing the kidding note in her voice. \u201cBut if you get cold, you can have one of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>Now that she thought about it, she was. \u201cSure. Whatcha got?\u201d</p> <p>Jeff disappeared into his sleeping bag and returned a moment later with a limp package of licorice, a small plastic bag full of squashed marshmallows and a flattened box of raisins. Robin declined the snack.</p><p>\u201cWhen are we going to buy me my dog?\u201d Jeff asked, chewing loudly on the raisins.</p><p>Robin listened to the sound and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cMom ... the dog?\u201d he repeated after a few minutes.</p><p>Robin had been dreading that question most of the day. She\u2019d managed to forestall Jeff for the past month by telling him they\u2019d discuss getting a dog after they were settled in their house.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d start looking for ads in the paper first thing tomorrow,\u201d Jeff said, still munching.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure when we\u2019ll start the search for the right dog.\u201d She was a coward, Robin freely admitted it, but she hated to disappoint Jeff. He had his heart set on a dog. How like his father he was, in his love for animals.</p><p>\u201cI want a big one, you know. None of those fancy little poodles or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA golden retriever would be nice, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a German shepherd,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cYour father loved dogs,\u201d she whispered, although she\u2019d told Jeff that countless times. Lenny had been gone for so many years, she had trouble remembering what their life together had been like. They\u2019d been crazy in love with each other and married shortly after their high-school graduation. A year later, Robin became pregnant. Jeff had been barely six months old when Lenny was killed in a freak car accident on his way home from work. In the span of mere moments, Robin\u2019s comfortable world had been sent into a tailspin, and ten years later it was still whirling.</p><p>With her family\u2019s help, she\u2019d gone back to school and obtained her degree. She was now a certified public accountant working for a large San Francisco insurance firm. Over the years she\u2019d dated a number of men, but none she\u2019d seriously consider marrying. Her life was far more complicated now than it had been as a young bride. The thought of falling in love again terrified her.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dog did Dad have when he was a kid?\u201d Jeff asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Rover was any particular breed,\u201d Robin answered, then paused to recall exactly what Lenny\u2019s childhood dog had looked like. \u201cI think he was mostly ... Labrador.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas he black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Dad have any other animals?\u201d</p><p>Robin smiled at her warm memories of her late husband. She enjoyed the way Jeff loved hearing stories about his father\u2014no matter how many times he\u2019d already heard them. \u201cHe collected three more pets the first year we were married. It seemed he was always bringing home a stray cat or lost dog. We couldn\u2019t keep them, of course, because we weren\u2019t allowed pets in the apartment complex. We went to great lengths to hide them for a few days until we could locate their owners or find them a good home. For our first wedding anniversary, he bought me a goldfish. Your father really loved animals.\u201d</p><p>Jeff beamed and planted his chin on his folded arms.</p><p>\u201cWe dreamed of buying a small farm someday and raising chickens and goats and maybe a cow or two. Your father wanted to buy you a pony, too.\u201d Hard as she tried, she couldn\u2019t quite hide the pain in her voice. Even after all these years, the memory of Lenny\u2019s sudden death still hurt. Looking at her son, so eager for a dog of his own, Robin missed her husband more than ever.</p><p>\u201cYou and Dad were going to buy a farm?\u201d Jeff cried, his voice ebullient. \u201cYou never told me that before.\u201d He paused. \u201cA pony for me? Really? Do you think we\u2019ll ever be able to afford one? Look how long it took to save for the house.\u201d</p><p>Robin smiled. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have to give up on the idea of you and me owning a farm, at least in the near future.\u201d</p><p>When they were first married, Robin and Lenny had talked for hours about their dreams. They\u2019d charted their lives, confident that nothing would ever separate them. Their love had been too strong. It was true that she\u2019d never told Jeff about buying a farm, nor had she told him how they\u2019d planned to name it Paradise. Paradise, because that was what the farm would be to them. In retrospect, not telling Jeff was a way of protecting him. He\u2019d lost so much\u2014not only the guidance and love of his father but all the things they could have had as a family. She\u2019d never mentioned the pony before, or the fact that Lenny had always longed for a horse ....</p><p>Jeff yawned loudly and Robin marvelled at his endurance. He\u2019d carried in as many boxes as the movers had, racing up and down the stairs with an energy Robin envied. He\u2019d unpacked the upstairs bathroom, as well as his own bedroom and had helped her organize the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly wait to get my dog,\u201d Jeff said, his voice fading. Within minutes he was sound asleep.</p><p>\u201cA dog,\u201d Robin said softly as her eyes closed. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to break the bad news to Jeff. They couldn\u2019t get a dog\u2014at least not right away. She was unwilling to leave a large dog locked indoors all day while she went off to work and Jeff was in school. Tying one up in the backyard was equally unfair, and she couldn\u2019t afford to build a fence. Not this year, anyway. Then there was the cost of feeding a dog and paying the vet\u2019s bills. With this new home, Robin\u2019s budget was already stretched to the limit.</p><p>Robin awoke feeling chilled and warm at the same time. In the gray dawn, she glanced at her watch. Six-thirty. At some point during the night, the old sleeping bag that dated back to her high-school days had come unzipped and the cool morning air had chilled her arms and legs. Yet her back was warm and cozy. Jeff had probably snuggled up to her during the night. She sighed, determined to sleep for another half hour or so. With that idea in mind, she reached for a blanket to wrap around her shoulders and met with some resistance. She tugged and pulled, to no avail. It was then that she felt something wet and warm close to her neck. Her eyes shot open. Very slowly, she turned her head until she came eyeball to eyeball with a big black dog.</p><p>Robin gasped loudly and struggled into a sitting position, which was difficult with the sleeping bag and several blankets wrapped around her legs, imprisoning her.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d she demanded, edging away from the dog. The Labrador had eased himself between her and Jeff and made himself right at home. His head rested on his paws and he looked perfectly content, if a bit disgruntled about having his nap interrupted. He didn\u2019t seem at all interested in vacating the premises.</p><p>Jeff rolled over and opened his eyes. Immediately he bolted upright. \u201cMom,\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cYou got me a dog!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014he isn\u2019t ours. I don\u2019t know who he belongs to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d Jeff\u2019s voice was triumphant. \u201cHe belongs to me.\u201d His thin arms hugged the animal\u2019s neck. \u201cYou really got me a dog! It was supposed to be a surprise, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t know where this animal came from, but he isn\u2019t ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t?\u201d His voice sagged in disappointment. \u201cBut who owns him, then? And how did he get inside the tent with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Robin rubbed the sleep from her eyes while she attempted to put her garbled thoughts in order. \u201cHe looks too well fed and groomed to be a stray. He must belong to someone in the neighborhood. Maybe he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackie!\u201d As if in response, she was interrupted by a crisp male voice. \u201cBlackie. Here, boy.\u201d</p><p>The Labrador lifted his head, but stayed where he was. Robin didn\u2019t blame him. Jeff was stroking his back with one hand and rubbing his ears with the other, all the while crooning to him softly.</p><p>With some effort, Robin managed to divest herself of the sleeping bag. She reached for her tennis shoes and crawled out of the tent. No sooner was she on her feet than she turned to find a lanky man standing a few yards from her, just on the other side of the three-foot hedge that separated the two properties. Obviously he was her neighbor. Robin smiled, but the friendly gesture was not returned. In fact, the man looked downright unfriendly.</p><p>Her neighbor was also an imposing man, at least six feet tall. Since Robin was only five-three, he towered head and shoulders above her. Instinctively, she stiffened her back, meeting his dark eyes. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said coolly.</p><p>He barely glanced in her direction, and when he did, he dismissed her with little more than a nod. After a night on the ground, with her son and a dog for bedmates, Robin realized she wasn\u2019t looking her best, but she resented the way his eyes flicked disinterestedly over her.</p><p>Robin usually gave people the benefit of the doubt, but toward this man, she felt an immediate antipathy. His face was completely emotionless, which lent him an intimidating air. He was clearly aware of that and used it to his advantage.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said again, clasping her hands tightly. She drew herself to her full height and raised her chin. \u201cI believe your dog is in the tent with my son.\u201d</p><p>Her news appeared to surprise him; his expression softened. Robin was struck by the change. When his face relaxed, he was actually a very attractive man. For the most part, Robin hardly noticed how good-looking a man was or wasn\u2019t, but this time ... she noticed. Perhaps because of the contrast with his forbidding demeanor of a moment before.</p><p>\u201cBlackie knows better than to leave the yard. Here, boy!\u201d He shouted for the Labrador again, this time including a sharp whistle loud enough to pierce Robin\u2019s eardrums. The dog emerged from the tent and approached the hedge, slowly wagging his tail.</p><p>\u201cIs that your dog?\u201d Jeff asked, dashing out behind Blackie. \u201cHe\u2019s great. How long have you had him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure he doesn\u2019t bother you again,\u201d the man said, ignoring Jeff\u2019s question. Robin supposed his words were meant to be an apology. \u201cHe\u2019s well trained\u2014 he\u2019s never left my yard before. I\u2019ll make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackie wasn\u2019t any bother,\u201d Jeff hurried to explain, racing forward. \u201cHe crawled into the tent with us and made himself at home, which was all right with us, wasn\u2019t it, Mom?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Robin answered, flipping her shoulder-length auburn hair away from her face. She\u2019d had it tied back when she\u2019d gone to bed, but it had pulled free during the night. Robin could well imagine how it looked now. Most mornings it tended to resemble foam on a newly poured mug of beer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t we, Blackie?\u201d Jeff knelt, and without hesitation the dog came to him, eagerly licking his face.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes revealed astonishment, however fleeting, and his dark brows drew together over his high-bridged nose. \u201cBlackie,\u201d he snapped. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>The Labrador squeezed between two overgrown laurel bushes and returned to his master, who didn\u2019t look any too pleased at his dog\u2019s affection for Jeff.</p> <p>\u201cMy son has a way with animals,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>\u201cDo you live here?\u201d Jeff asked next. He seemed completely unaware of their new neighbor\u2019s unfriendliness.</p><p>\u201cNext door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Jeff grinned widely and placed his right hand on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m Jeff Masterson and this is my mom, Robin. We moved in yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cole Camden. Welcome to the neighborhood.\u201d</p> <p>Although his words were cordial, his tone wasn\u2019t. Robin felt about as welcome as a punk-rock band at a retirees\u2019 picnic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a dog myself,\u201d Jeff went on affably. \u201cThat\u2019s why we moved out of the apartment building\u2014I couldn\u2019t have a pet there except for my goldfish.\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded without comment.</p><p>Oh, great, Robin thought. After years of scrimping and saving to buy a house, they were going to be stuck with an ill-tempered next-door neighbor. His house was older than the others on the block. Much bigger, too. Robin guessed that his home, a sprawling three-story structure, had been built in the early thirties. She knew that at one time this neighborhood had been filled with large opulent homes like Cole Camden\u2019s. Gradually, over the years, the older places had been torn down and a series of two-story houses and trendy ramblers built in their place. Her neighbor\u2019s house was the last vestige of an era long past.</p><p>\u201cHave you got any kids?\u201d Jeff could hardly keep the eagerness out of his voice. In the apartment complex there\u2019d always been plenty of playmates, and he was eager to make new friends, especially before he started classes in an unfamiliar school on Monday morning.</p><p>Cole\u2019s face hardened and Robin could have sworn the question had angered him. An uncomfortable moment passed before he answered. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have any kids.\u201d His voice held a rough undertone, and for a split second Robin was sure she saw a flash of pain in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWould it be okay if I played with Blackie sometimes? Just until I get my own dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cole\u2019s response was sharp, but, when Jeff flinched at his vehemence, Cole appeared to regret his harsh tone. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but it\u2019d probably be best if you stayed in your own yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cYou can send Blackie over here to visit anytime you want. I like dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d A hint of a smile lifted the corners of his mouth. Then his cool gaze moved from Jeff to Robin, his face again expressionless, but she sensed that he\u2019d made up his mind about them, categorized them and come to his own conclusions.</p><p>If Cole Camden thought he could intimidate her, Robin had news for him. He\u2019d broadcast his message loud and clear. He didn\u2019t want to be bothered by her or her son, and in exchange he\u2019d stay out of her way. That was fine with her. Terrific, in fact. She didn\u2019t have time for humoring grouches.</p><p>Without another word, Cole turned and strode toward his house with Blackie at his heels.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Mr. Camden,\u201d Jeff called, raising his hand.</p><p>Robin wasn\u2019t surprised when their neighbor didn\u2019t give them the courtesy of a reply.</p> <p>In an effort to distract Jeff from Cole Camden\u2019s unfriendliness, she said brightly, \u201cHey, I\u2019m starving. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Jeff didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll let me play with Blackie?\u201d</p><p>Robin sighed, considering the dilemma that faced her. She didn\u2019t want Cole to hurt Jeff\u2019s feelings, but it wasn\u2019t likely their neighbor would appreciate her son\u2019s affinity with his Labrador. By the same token, a neighbor\u2019s dog, even one that belonged to a grouch, would ease her guilt over not being able to provide Jeff with the dog she\u2019d promised him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Mom?\u201d Jeff prompted. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably let me play with Blackie sometimes, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, honey,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Later the same day, after buying groceries to stock their bare kitchen shelves and picking up other necessities, Robin counted the change at the bottom of her purse. She needed to be sure she had money for the subway on Monday morning. Luckily she had enough spare change for BART\u2014Bay Area Rapid Transit\u2014to last the week, but it was packed lunches for her and Jeff until her next payday, which was in two weeks.</p><p>Her finances would\u2019ve been in better shape if she\u2019d waited another year to move out of the apartment. But interest rates were at a two-year low and she\u2019d decided soon after the first of the year that if they were ever going to move out of the apartment this was the time.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Jeff crashed through the back door, breathless. \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Robin glanced up from the salad she was mixing. A completely disgusted look on his face, her son flung himself into a chair and propped his elbows on the table. Then he let out a forceful sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we made a bad mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing but girls in this neighborhood.\u201d He made it sound as though they\u2019d unexpectedly landed in enemy territory. \u201cI rode my bike up and down the street and all I saw were girls.\u201d He wrinkled his nose.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be meeting lots of boys in school on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t taking this seriously!\u201d Jeff cried. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand what this means. There are seven houses on this block. Six of them have kids and only one has a boy, and that\u2019s me. I\u2019m surrounded by women!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find all this out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked, of course.\u201d He sighed again. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Robin asked. \u201cAre you suggesting we move back to the apartment?\u201d</p><p>Jeff considered this for only a moment. \u201cI\u2019d think we should if it wasn\u2019t for two things. We can\u2019t have a dog there. And I found a fort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s hidden way back in Mr. Camden\u2019s yard and covered by a bunch of brush. It\u2019s real neat there. I don\u2019t think he knows about it, because the word on the street is he doesn\u2019t like kids. Someone must\u2019ve built it and I\u2019m going to find out who. If there\u2019s a club going, I want in. I\u2019ve got the right\u2014I live closer to Mr. Camden than anyone else does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Robin munched on a slice of green pepper and handed one to Jeff. \u201cSo you think it\u2019d be all right if we stayed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Jeff conceded, \u201cat least until I find out more about the fort.\u201d</p><p>Robin was about to say something else when the doorbell chimed.</p><p>Jeff\u2019s blue eyes met hers. \u201cI bet it\u2019s one of those pesky girls,\u201d he said in disgust.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get rid of her?\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded emphatically.</p><p>Robin was smiling when she answered the front door. Jeff was right; it was a girl, one who seemed to be a couple of years younger than her son. She hadn\u2019t come alone, though. Standing with the youngster was an adult.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d the woman said cheerfully, flashing Robin a warm smile. \u201cI know you\u2019ve hardly had a chance to get settled, but I wanted to introduce myself. I\u2019m Heather Lawrence and this is my daughter, Kelly. We live next door, and we\u2019d like to welcome you to the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Robin introduced herself as she opened the door and invited them in. Heather was cute and perky. Her hair was cut in a short bob that bounced when she spoke. Robin knew right away that she was going to like these neighbors. Heather\u2019s warm reception was a pleasant change from the way Cole Camden had greeted her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d Robin asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure I\u2019m not interrupting anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Robin led her into the kitchen, where Jeff sat waiting. He cast her a look that suggested she should be shot for treason, then muttered something about forgetting that mothers were really girls in disguise. Then he headed out the front door.</p><p>Robin reached for two matching ceramic mugs and poured coffee for herself and her new friend. She offered Kelly a glass of juice, then slid into a chair across the table from the girl and her mother. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Jeff.\u201d She felt obliged to apologize. \u201cHe\u2019s at the age where he thinks girls are a plague to society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Heather said, smiling. \u201cKelly isn\u2019t keen on boys herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re creeps. I\u2019d rather ride my bicycle than play with a boy,\u201d the girl announced. \u201cBut Mom wanted me to come over with her so she didn\u2019t look like a busybody. Right, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Heather blushed and threw her daughter a murderous glance.</p><p>Robin laughed. \u201cI thought it would take several weeks to get to know my neighbors and I\u2019ve met two in one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else has already been over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole Camden introduced himself this morning,\u201d she explained, keeping her eyes averted to hide the resentment she felt toward her unfriendly neighbor. Even now, hours later, she couldn\u2019t help thinking about the way he\u2019d reacted to her and Jeff.</p><p>\u201cCole Camden introduced himself?\u201d Heather repeated, sounding shocked. She frowned, staring into space as though digesting the fact.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I think he would\u2019ve preferred to avoid me, but his dog wanted to make friends with Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Heather\u2019s mouth opened and closed twice. \u201cBlackie did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something strange about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, yes. To say Cole keeps to himself is an understatement. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s said more than a handful of words to me in the entire two years since Kelly and I moved here. I don\u2019t know why he stays in the neighborhood.\u201d She paused to respond to her daughter, who was asking permission to go home. \u201cThank Robin for the juice, honey. Anyway,\u201d she went on, turning back to Robin when her daughter had skipped out the door, \u201che\u2019s all alone in that huge house and it\u2019s ridiculous, really. Can you imagine what his heating bills must be? Although, personally, I don\u2019t think money is much of a problem for him. But I\u2019ve never heard any details.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise Robin to learn Cole lived alone. She\u2019d barely met the man, but guessed that life held little joy for him. It was as though love, warmth and friendship had all been found lacking and had therefore been systematically dismissed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cApparently, he was married once, but he was divorced long before I came here.\u201d</p><p>Robin had dealt with unfriendly men before, but something about Cole struck her hard and deep, and she wasn\u2019t sure what it was or why he evoked such a strong feeling within her.</p><p>\u201cHe and his dog are inseparable,\u201d Heather added.</p><p>Robin nodded, hardly listening. He\u2019d intimidated her at first, but when she\u2019d pulled herself together and faced him squarely he\u2019d loosened up a bit and, later, even seemed amused. But then Jeff had asked him about children, and Robin had seen the pain in his eyes.</p> <p>As if by magic, her son\u2019s face appeared around the door. When he saw that Kelly was gone, he walked into the room, hands in his back pockets.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a dog?\u201d he asked Heather.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no. Kelly\u2019s allergic.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded as though to say that was exactly the kind of thing he expected from a girl. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a German shepherd soon, aren\u2019t we, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Robin responded, feeling wretched. After Heather left, she was going to tell Jeff the truth. She fully intended to let him have his dog, but he\u2019d have to wait a while. She\u2019d been practicing what to say. She\u2019d even come up with a compromise. They could get a cat. Cats didn\u2019t seem to mind being left on their own, and they didn\u2019t need to be walked. Although she wasn\u2019t happy about keeping a litter box in the house, Robin was willing to put up with that inconvenience. Then, when she could afford to have a fence built, they\u2019d get a dog. She planned to be positive and direct with Jeff. He\u2019d understand. At least she hoped he would.</p> <p>Heather stayed only a few more minutes. The visit had been a fruitful one. Robin had learned that Heather was divorced, worked mornings in an office and provided after-school day care in an effort to spend more time with Kelly. This information was good news to Robin, and the two women agreed that Jeff would go to the Lawrence house before and after school, instead of the community center several blocks away. The arrangement suited them both; even Jeff shrugged in agreement.</p><p>Robin would\u2019ve liked to ask her new friend more about Cole, but his name didn\u2019t come up again, and she didn\u2019t want to seem too curious about him.</p><p>After Heather left, Robin braced herself for the talk with Jeff about getting a dog. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t go well. It seemed that after waiting nearly ten years, a few more months was completely unacceptable.</p><p>\u201cYou promised!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou said I could have a dog when we moved into the house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can, sweetheart, but not right away.\u201d</p><p>Unusual for Jeff, tears gathered in his eyes, and he struggled to hold them back. Soon Robin felt moisture filling her own eyes. She hated disappointing Jeff more than anything. His heart was set on getting a dog right away, and he considered the offer of a cat a poor substitute.</p> <p>He left the house soon afterward. In an effort to soothe his hurt feelings, Robin cooked her son\u2019s favorite meal\u2014macaroni and cheese with sliced sausage and lots of ketchup.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see him on the pavement or the street when she went to check half an hour later. She stood on the porch, wondering where he\u2019d gone. His bike was inside the garage, and he\u2019d already aired his views about playing with any of the girls in the neighborhood.</p><p>It would be just like him to storm into his room in a fit of indignation and promptly fall asleep. Robin hurried upstairs to his bedroom, which was across the hall from her own.</p><p>His bed was made and his clothes hung neatly in the closet. Robin decided that in another day or two, everything would be back to normal.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she turned to leave that she saw the note on his desk. Picking it up, Robin read the first line and felt a swirling sense of panic.</p><p>Dear Mom,</p><p>You broke your promise. You said I could have a dog and now you say I have to wait. If I can\u2019t have a dog, then I don\u2019t want to live with you anymore. This is goodbye forever.</p><p>Love, Jeff</p> <p>Two</p><p>For a moment, Robin was too stunned to react. Her heart was pounding so hard it echoed in her ears like thunder, so loud it seemed to knock her off balance.</p><p>Rushing down the stairs, she stood on the porch, cupped her hands over her mouth and screamed frantically. \u201cJeff! Jeffy!\u201d</p><p>Cole Camden was standing on his front porch, too. He released a shrill whistle and stood waiting expectantly. When nothing happened, he called, \u201cBlackie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff!\u201d Robin tried again.</p><p>\u201cBlackie!\u201d</p><p>Robin called for Jeff once more, but her voice cracked as the panic engulfed her. She paused, placed her hand over her mouth and closed her eyes, trying to regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cBlackie!\u201d Cole yelled. He looked furious about his dog\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>It took Robin only a moment to put two and two together. \u201cCole,\u201d she cried, running across the lawn toward him. \u201cI think Jeff and Blackie might have run away together.\u201d</p><p>Cole looked at her as if she was deranged, and Robin couldn\u2019t blame him. \u201cJeff left me a note. He wants a dog so badly and we can\u2019t get one right now because ... well, because we can\u2019t, and I had to tell him, and he was terribly disappointed and he decided to run away.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s mouth thinned. \u201cThe whole idea is ridiculous. Even if Jeff did run away, Blackie would never go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019d make this up?\u201d she shrieked. \u201cThe last time I saw Jeff was around four-thirty, and I\u2019d bet cold cash that\u2019s about the same time Blackie disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cThen where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew that, do you think I\u2019d be standing around here arguing with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, lady, I don\u2019t know your son, but I know my dog and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s not lady,\u201d Robin flared, clenching her hands at her sides. He was looking at her as though she were a madwoman on the loose\u2014which she was where her son was concerned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have troubled you. When I find Jeff, I\u2019ll make sure your dog gets home.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes shot sparks in her direction, but she ignored them. Turning abruptly, she ran back to her own house. Halfway there, she stopped dead and whirled around to face Cole again. \u201cThe fort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fort?\u201d Cole demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe one that\u2019s in the back of your yard. It\u2019s covered with brush .... Jeff found it earlier today. He wouldn\u2019t know anywhere else to go and that would be the perfect hiding place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s been there in years,\u201d Cole said, discounting her suggestion.</p><p>\u201cThe least we can do is look.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s nod was reluctant. He led the way to his backyard, which was much larger than hers. There was a small grove of oak trees at the rear of the property and beyond that a high fence. Apparently the fort was situated between the trees and the fence. A few minutes later, in the most remote corner of the yard, nestled between two trees, Robin saw the small wooden structure. It blended into the terrain, and if she hadn\u2019t been looking for the hideaway, she would never have seen it.</p><p>It was obvious when they neared the space that someone had taken up residence. Cole lowered himself down to all fours, peered inside, then looked back at Robin with a nod. He breathed in sharply, apparently irritated by this turn of events, and crawled through the narrow entrance.</p><p>Not about to be left standing by herself, Robin got down on her knees and followed him in.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d suspected, Jeff and Blackie were huddled together in a corner. Jeff was fast asleep and Blackie was curled up by his side, guarding him. When Cole and Robin entered, the Labrador lifted his head and wagged his tail in greeting.</p><p>The fort wasn\u2019t much bigger than the tent Jeff had constructed the night before, and Robin was forced to pull her knees close and loop her arms around them. Cole\u2019s larger body seemed to fill every available bit of space.</p><p>Jeff must have sensed that his newfound home had been invaded because his eyes fluttered open and he gazed at Robin, then turned his head to stare at Cole.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d he said sheepishly. \u201cI bet I\u2019m in trouble, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Robin was so grateful to find him that all she could do was nod. If she\u2019d tried to speak, her voice would\u2019ve been shaking with emotion, which would only have embarrassed them both.</p><p>\u201cSo, Jeff,\u201d Cole said sternly. \u201cYou were going to run away from home. I see you brought everything you needed.\u201d He pushed the frying pan and atlas into the middle of their cramped quarters. \u201cWhat I want to know is how you convinced Blackie to join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came on his own,\u201d Jeff murmured, but his eyes avoided Cole\u2019s. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have taken him on purpose\u2014he\u2019s your dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t ... coerce him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you took was a frying pan and an atlas!\u201d Robin cried, staring at the cast-iron skillet and the atlas with its dog-eared pages.</p><p>Cole and Jeff both ignored her outburst.</p><p>\u201cI take it you don\u2019t like living here?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>Jeff stiffened, then shook his head vigorously. \u201cMom told me that when we moved I could have a dog and now I can\u2019t. And ... and she dragged me into a neighborhood filled with girls. That might\u2019ve been okay if I had a dog, but then she broke her promise. A promise is a promise and it\u2019s sacred. A guy would never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t have a dog until later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll because of a stupid fence.\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded. \u201cFences are important, you know. And you know what else? Your mom was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Jeff looked at Robin, who was blinking furiously to keep the tears from dripping down her face. The upheaval and stress of the move had drained her emotionally and she was an unmitigated mess. Normally, she was a calm, controlled person, but this whole drama with Jeff was her undoing. That and the fact she\u2019d hardly slept the night before in his makeshift tent.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff said, studying her anxiously, \u201care you all right?\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with both hands. \u201cI slept with a dog and you ran away and all you took was a frying pan and an atlas.\u201d That made no sense whatsoever, but she couldn\u2019t help it, and once the tears started they wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom,\u201d Jeff said softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cI want you to have a dog, I really do, but we can\u2019t keep one locked up in the house all day and we don\u2019t have a fence and ... and the way you just looked at me, I swear it was Lenny all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Lenny?\u201d Cole cocked his head toward Jeff, speaking in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cLenny was my dad. He died when I was real little. I don\u2019t even remember him.\u201d</p><p>Cole shared a knowing look with her son. \u201cIt might be a good idea if we got your mother back inside the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m getting hysterical, don\u2019t you?\u201d Robin burst out. \u201cI want you both to know I\u2019m in perfect control. A woman can cry every now and then if she wants. Venting your emotions is healthy\u2014all the books say so.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight, Mom.\u201d Jeff gently patted her shoulder, then crawled out of the fort. He waited for Robin, who emerged after him, and offered her a hand. Cole and Blackie followed.</p><p>Jeff took Robin\u2019s arm, holding her elbow as he led her to the back door of their house, as if he suspected she couldn\u2019t find her way without his guidance.</p><p>Once inside, Robin grabbed a tissue and loudly blew her nose. Her composure was shaky, but when she turned to Cole, she intended to be as reasonable as a judge. As polite as a preacher.</p><p>\u201cHave you got any aspirin?\u201d Cole asked Jeff.</p> <p>Jeff nodded, and dashed up the stairs to the bathroom, returning in thirty seconds flat with the bottle. Cole filled a glass with water and delivered both to Robin. How he knew she had a fierce headache she could only guess.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you lie down for a few minutes? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel just fine, thank you,\u201d she snapped, more angry with herself for overreacting than with him for taking charge.</p><p>\u201cDo you have family close by?\u201d Again Cole directed the question to Jeff, which served to further infuriate Robin. Jeff was ten years old! She, on the other hand, was an adult. If this man had questions they should be directed to her, not her son.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Jeff answered in an anxious whisper. \u201cGrandma and Grandpa moved to Arizona last year, and my uncle lives in LA.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to lie down,\u201d Robin said forcefully. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff countered, his voice troubled, \u201cyou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were talking about frying pans and sleeping with dogs in the same breath,\u201d Cole elaborated, his eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cI think Mr. Camden\u2019s right,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cYou need rest\u2014lots of rest.\u201d</p><p>Her own son had turned traitor on her. Robin was shocked. Jeff took her hand and led her into the family room, which was off the kitchen. He patted the quilted pillow on the sofa, wordlessly suggesting she place her head there. When she resisted, he pulled the afghan from the chair and draped it around her, tucking the ends behind her shoulders.</p><p>Robin couldn\u2019t believe she was allowing herself to be led around like a ... like a puppy. As if reading her thoughts, Blackie wandered over to her side and lowered his bulk onto the carpet beside the sofa.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a neat fort you\u2019ve got there,\u201d Jeff told Cole once he\u2019d finished tucking in the blanket. Robin watched him hurry back to the kitchen, grab a plate, then load it with macaroni and cheese and hand it to Cole, apparently wanting to share his favorite meal with their neighbor.</p><p>Cole set the plate on the counter. \u201cThanks anyway, Jeff, but I\u2019ve got to get back to the house. In the future, if you\u2019re thinking about running away\u2014don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d Jeff said with a mildly guilty look. \u201cMy mom turned into a basket case.\u201d</p><p>Cole smiled\u2014at least, it was as close to a smile as Robin had seen. \u201cYou\u2019re both going to be fine. She intends to get you that dog, you know. Just hang on. It\u2019ll be sooner than you think.\u201d</p><p>Jeff walked to the sliding glass door with Cole. \u201cMr. Camden, can I ask you something important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs anyone using the fort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</p> <p>Jeff\u2019s expression was hopeful. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like anyone had been inside for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix years,\u201d Cole murmured absently.</p><p>\u201cThat long? How come?\u201d Jeff asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a great fort. If it\u2019s all right with you I\u2019d like to go over there sometimes. I promise not to walk in any flowerbeds or anything, and I won\u2019t leave a mess. I\u2019ll take real good care of everything.\u201d</p><p>Cole hesitated for a moment. He looked at Jeff, and Robin held her breath. Then he shook his head. \u201cMaybe sometime in the future, but not now.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s deep blue eyes brightened; apparently the refusal didn\u2019t trouble him. \u201cOkay. When I can use the fort, would it be all right if I took Blackie with me? He followed me today, you know. I didn\u2019t have to do anything to get him to tag along.\u201d Jeff paused and lowered his eyes. \u201cWell, hardly anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought as much. As your mom said, you have a way with animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad did, too. If he hadn\u2019t died he would\u2019ve gotten me a pony and everything.\u201d</p><p>There was such pride in Jeff\u2019s voice that Robin bit her bottom lip to keep from crying all over again. Jeff and Lenny were so much alike. What she\u2019d told her son earlier was true. More and more, Jeff was starting to take on his father\u2019s looks and personality.</p><p>Cole gazed down at Jeff, and an emotion flashed in his eyes, so transient Robin couldn\u2019t recognize it. He laid his hand on Jeff\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSince your mother explained there\u2019s going to be a delay in getting you a dog, it\u2019d be okay with me if you borrowed Blackie every now and then. You have to stay in your own yard, though. I don\u2019t want him running in the neighborhood unless he\u2019s on a leash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean it? Thanks, Mr. Camden! I\u2019ll do everything you ask.\u201d</p><p>Robin had the feeling Jeff would\u2019ve agreed to just about any terms as long as he could see Blackie. It wasn\u2019t a dog of his own, but it was as close as he was going to get for the next few months.</p><p>Once Cole had left, Jeff joined her on the sofa, his hands folded on his lap. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom,\u201d he muttered, his chin buried in his chest. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll never run away again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope not,\u201d she said. Wrapping her arms around him, she hugged him close, kissing his cheek.</p><p>\u201cGee whiz,\u201d Jeff grumbled, rubbing his face. \u201cI\u2019d never have apologized if I\u2019d known you were going to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>A week passed. Jeff liked his new school and, as Robin had predicted, found his class contained an equal number of boys and girls. With his outgoing personality, he quickly collected new friends.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, Robin was in the family room reading the paper when Jeff ambled in and sat down across from her. He took the baseball cap from his head and studied it for a moment.</p><p>\u201cSomething bothering you?\u201d she asked, lowering the paper to get a better view of her son.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDid you know Mr. Camden used to be married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I heard,\u201d Robin said absently. But other than Heather\u2019s remarks the previous week, she hadn\u2019t heard anything else. In fact, she\u2019d spoken to her neighbor only when she\u2019d gone to pick up Jeff every afternoon. The child-care arrangement with Heather was working beautifully, but there\u2019d been little opportunity to chat.</p><p>As for Cole, Robin hadn\u2019t seen him at all. Since he\u2019d been so kind and helpful in the situation with Jeff, Robin had revised her opinion of him. He liked his privacy and that was fine by her; she had no intention of interrupting his serene existence. The memory of their first meeting still rankled, but she was willing to overlook that shaky beginning.</p><p>\u201cMr. Camden had a son who died.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s heart constricted. It made sense: the pain she\u2019d seen when Jeff had asked him about children, the word on the street that Cole didn\u2019t like kids, the abandoned fort. \u201cI ... How did you find that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJimmy Wallach. He lives two streets over and has an older brother who used to play with Bobby Camden. Jimmy told me about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Robin murmured, saddened by the information. She couldn\u2019t imagine her life without Jeff\u2014the mere thought of losing him was enough to tear her apart.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wallach heard Jimmy talking about Bobby Camden, and she said Mr. Camden got divorced and it was real bad, and then a year later Bobby died. She said Mr. Camden\u2019s never been the same since.\u201d</p><p>Robin ached for Cole, and she regretted all the uncharitable thoughts she\u2019d had that first morning.</p><p>\u201cI feel sad,\u201d Jeff whispered, frowning. His face was as intent as she\u2019d ever seen it.</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Robin returned softly.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wallach seemed real surprised when I told her Mr. Camden said I could play in Bobby\u2019s fort someday. Ever since his son died, he hasn\u2019t let any kids in the yard or anything. She said he hardly talks to anyone in the neighborhood anymore.\u201d</p><p>Heather Lawrence had said basically the same thing, but hadn\u2019t explained the reason for it. Probably because she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cAre you still going to barbecue hamburgers for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded, surprised by the abrupt way Jeff had changed the subject. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Next to macaroni and cheese, grilled burgers were Jeff\u2019s all-time favorite food.</p><p>\u201cCan I invite Mr. Camden over to eat with us?\u201d</p><p>Robin hated to refuse her son, but she wasn\u2019t sure a dinner invitation was a good idea. She didn\u2019t know Cole very well, but she\u2019d already learned he wasn\u2019t one to socialize with the neighbors. In addition, Jeff might blurt out questions about Cole\u2019s dead son that would be terribly painful for him.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff pleaded, \u201cI bet no one ever invites him to dinner and he\u2019s all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I don\u2019t know if that would be the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we owe him, Mom,\u201d Jeff implored. \u201cHe let me throw sticks for Blackie twice this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Mr. Camden\u2019s home,\u201d Robin said, picking up the newspaper while she weighed the pros and cons of Jeff\u2019s suggestion. Since last Sunday, Robin hadn\u2019t spoken to Cole once, and she wasn\u2019t eager to initiate a conversation. He might read something into it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and see if he\u2019s home.\u201d Before she could react, Jeff was out the front door, letting the screen door slam in his wake.</p><p>He returned a couple of minutes later breathless and excited. \u201cMr. Camden\u2019s home and he said he appreciates the invitation, but he has other plans for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d Robin said, hoping she sounded sincere.</p><p>\u201cI told him we were having strawberry shortcake for dessert and he said that\u2019s his favorite.\u201d</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t want to admit it, but she was relieved Cole wouldn\u2019t be showing up for dinner. The man made her feel nervous and uncertain. She didn\u2019t know why that should be, only that it was a new and unfamiliar sensation.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Robin jerked her head up from the paper. \u201cThanks for what?\u201d She hadn\u2019t read a word in five minutes. Her thoughts had been on her neighbor.</p><p>Jeff rolled his eyes. \u201cFor letting me take a piece of strawberry shortcake over to Mr. Camden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you could do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now.\u201d He walked over to her and playfully tested her forehead with the back of his hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel hot, but then, with brain fever you never know.\u201d</p><p>Robin swatted playfully at her son\u2019s backside.</p><p>Laughing, Jeff raced outdoors, where his bicycle was waiting. A half hour later, he was back in the house. \u201cMom! Mom!\u201d he cried, racing into the kitchen. \u201cDid you know Mr. Camden owns a black Porsche?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I did.\u201d She was more interested in peeling potatoes for the salad than discussing fancy cars. She didn\u2019t know enough about sports cars to get excited about them.</p><p>Jeff jerked open the bottom drawer and rooted through the rag bag until he found what he was looking for. He pulled out a large square that had once been part of his flannel pyjamas, then started back outside. \u201cHe has another car, too, an SUV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust where are you going, young man?\u201d Robin demanded.</p><p>\u201cMr. Camden\u2019s waxing his car and I\u2019m gonna help him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he ask for your help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jeff said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cHe may not want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Jeff rolled his eyes as if to suggest she was overdoing this mothering thing. \u201cCan I go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ... I suppose,\u201d she agreed, but her heart was in her throat. She moved into the living room and watched as Jeff strolled across the lawn to the driveway next door, where Cole was busy rubbing liquid wax on the gleaming surface of his Porsche. Without a word, Jeff started polishing the dried wax with his rag. Cole straightened and stopped smearing on the wax, obviously surprised to see Jeff. Robin bit her lip, not knowing how her neighbor would react to Jeff\u2019s willingness to help. Apparently he said something, because Jeff nodded, then walked over and sat cross-legged on the lawn. They didn\u2019t seem to be carrying on a conversation and Robin wondered what Cole had said to her son.</p> <p>Robin returned to the kitchen, grateful that Cole\u2019s rejection had been gentle. At least he hadn\u2019t sent Jeff away. She peeled another potato, then walked back to the living room and glanced out the window again. This time she saw Jeff standing beside Cole, who was, it seemed, demonstrating the correct way to polish a car. He made wide circular motions with his arms, after which he stepped aside to let Jeff tackle the Porsche again. Cole smiled, then patted him on the head before walking around to the other side of the car.</p><p>Once the salad was ready, Robin ventured outside.</p><p>Jeff waved enthusiastically when he caught sight of her on the porch. \u201cIsn\u2019t she a beaut?\u201d he yelled.</p><p>It looked like an ordinary car to Robin, but she nodded enthusiastically. \u201cWonderful,\u201d she answered. \u201cAfternoon, Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin.\u201d He returned her greeting absently.</p><p>He wore a sleeveless gray sweatshirt and she was surprised by how muscular and tanned his arms were. From a recent conversation with Heather Lawrence, Robin had learned Cole was a prominent attorney. And he seemed to fit the lawyer image to a T. Not anymore. The lawyer was gone and the man was there, bold as could be. Her awareness of him as an attractive virile male was shockingly intense.</p> <p>The problem, she decided, lay in the fact that she hadn\u2019t expected Cole to look so ... fit. The sight of all that lean muscle came as a pleasant surprise. Cole\u2019s aggressive, unfriendly expression had been softened as he bantered with Jeff.</p><p>Blackie ambled to her side and Robin leaned over to scratch the dog\u2019s ears while she continued to study his master. Cole\u2019s hair was dark and grew away from his brow, but a single lock flopped stubbornly over his forehead and he had to toss it back from his face every once in a while. It was funny how she\u2019d never noticed that about him until now.</p><p>Jeff must\u2019ve made some humorous remark because Cole threw back his head and chuckled loudly. It was the first time she\u2019d ever heard him laugh. She suspected he didn\u2019t often give in to the impulse. A smile crowded Robin\u2019s face as Jeff started laughing, too.</p><p>In that moment the oddest thing happened. Robin felt something catch in her heart. The tug was almost physical, and she experienced a completely unfamiliar feeling of vulnerability ....</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to roll out the barbecue for you?\u201d Jeff shouted when he saw that she was still on the porch. He\u2019d turned his baseball cap around so the bill faced backward. While he spoke, his arm continued to work feverishly as he buffed the passenger door with his rag.</p><p>\u201cNot ... yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, \u2018cause Mr. Camden needs me to finish up this side for him. We\u2019re on a tight schedule here, and I don\u2019t have time. Cole\u2019s got a dinner date at five-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Standing on the porch, dressed in her old faded jeans, with a mustard-spotted terrycloth hand towel tucked in the waistband, Robin felt as appealing as Ma Kettle. \u201cAny time you\u2019re finished is fine.\u201d</p> <p>So Cole Camden\u2019s got a date, Robin mused. Of course he\u2019s got a date, she told herself. Why should she care? And if watching Jeff and Cole together was going to affect her like this, it would be best to go back inside the house now.</p><p>Over dinner, all Jeff could talk about was Cole Camden. Every other sentence was Cole this and Cole that, until Robin was ready to slam her fist on the table and demand Jeff never mention their neighbor\u2019s name again.</p><p>\u201cAnd the best part is, he paid me for helping him wax his car,\u201d Jeff continued, then stuffed the hamburger into his mouth, chewing rapidly in his enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cThat was generous of him.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded happily. \u201cBe sure and save some shortcake for him. He said not to bring it over \u2018cause he didn\u2019t know exactly when he\u2019d get home. He\u2019ll stop by, he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d But Robin doubted her neighbor would. Jeff seemed to be under the impression that Cole would show up at any time; Robin knew better. If Cole had a dinner date, he wasn\u2019t going to rush back just to taste her dessert, although she did make an excellent shortcake.</p><p>As she suspected, Cole didn\u2019t come over. Jeff grumbled about it the next morning. He was convinced Cole would\u2019ve dropped by if Robin hadn\u2019t insisted Jeff go to bed at his regular time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make shortcake again soon,\u201d Robin promised, hurrying to pack their lunches. \u201cAnd when I do, you can take a piece over to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jeff muttered.</p><p>That evening, when Robin returned home from work, she found Jeff playing with Blackie in Cole\u2019s backyard.</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she cried, alarmed that Cole might discover her son on his property. He\u2019d made it clear Jeff wasn\u2019t to go into his yard. \u201cWhat are you doing at Mr. Camden\u2019s? And why aren\u2019t you at Heather\u2019s?\u201d She walked over to the hedge and placed her hands on her hips in frustration.</p><p>\u201cBlackie\u2019s chain got all tangled up,\u201d Jeff said, looking sheepish. \u201cHe needed my help. I told Heather it would be okay with you and ...\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s untangled now,\u201d Robin pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI know, but since I was here it seemed like a good time for the two of us to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay,\u201d Robin completed for him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d her son said, nodding eagerly. Jeff was well aware he\u2019d done something wrong, but had difficulty admitting it.</p><p>\u201cMr. Camden doesn\u2019t want you in his yard, and we both know it.\u201d Standing next to the laurel hedge, Robin watched with dismay as Cole opened his back door and stepped outside. Blackie barked in greeting, and his tail swung with enough force to knock Jeff off balance.</p><p>When Cole saw Jeff in his yard, he frowned and cast an accusing glare in Robin\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cJeff said Blackie\u2019s chain was tangled,\u201d she rushed to explain.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get over here?\u201d Cole asked her son, and although he didn\u2019t raise his voice it was clear he was displeased. \u201cThe gate\u2019s locked and the hedge is too high for him to jump over.\u201d</p><p>Jeff stared down at the lawn. \u201cI came through the gap in the hedge\u2014the same one Blackie uses. I crawled through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas his chain really tangled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Jeff said in a voice so low Robin had to strain to hear him. \u201cAt least not much ... I just thought, you know, that maybe he\u2019d like company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was all alone and so was I.\u201d Jeff lifted his eyes defiantly to his mother\u2019s, as if to suggest the fault was entirely hers. \u201cI go to Mrs. Lawrence\u2019s after school, but it\u2019s all girls there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what I said about coming into my yard?\u201d Cole asked him.</p><p>Jeff\u2019s nod was sluggish. \u201cYeah. You said maybe I could sometime, but not now. I thought ... I hoped that since you let me help you wax your car, you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mind,\u201d Cole said flatly.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t do it again,\u201d Robin promised. \u201cWill you, Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Camden.\u201d</p><p>For a whole week Jeff kept his word. The following Monday, however, when Robin came home from the BART station, Heather told her Jeff had mysteriously disappeared about a half hour earlier. She assumed he\u2019d gone home; he\u2019d said something about expecting a call.</p><p>Unfortunately, Robin knew exactly where to look for him, and it wasn\u2019t at home. Even more unfortunate was the fact that Cole\u2019s car pulled into the driveway just as she was opening her door. Throwing aside her briefcase and purse, she rushed through the house, jerked open the sliding glass door at the back and raced across her yard.</p><p>Her son was nowhere to be seen, but she immediately realized he\u2019d been with Blackie. The dog wasn\u2019t in evidence, either, and she could see Jeff\u2019s favorite baseball cap on the lawn.</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she called, afraid to raise her voice. She sounded as though she was suffering from a bad case of laryngitis.</p><p>Neither boy nor dog appeared.</p><p>She tried again, taking the risk of shouting for Jeff in a normal tone, praying it wouldn\u2019t attract Cole\u2019s attention. No response. Since Jeff and Blackie didn\u2019t seem to be within earshot, she guessed they were in the fort. There was no help for it; she\u2019d have to go after him herself. Her only hope was that she could hurry over to the fort, get Jeff and return to her own yard, all without being detected by Cole.</p><p>Finding the hole in the laurel proved difficult enough. The space was little more than a narrow gap between two thick plants, and for a distressing moment, Robin doubted she was slim enough to squeeze through. Finally, she lowered herself to the ground, hunched her shoulders and managed to push her way between the shrubs. Her head had just emerged when she noticed a pair of polished men\u2019s shoes on the other side. Slowly, reluctantly, she glanced up to find Cole towering above her, eyes narrowed with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d she said, striving to sound as though it was perfectly normal for her to be crawling into his yard on her hands and knees. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re wondering what I\u2019m doing here ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question did cross my mind.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cIt was the most embarrassing moment of my entire life,\u201d Robin repeated for the third time. She was sitting at the kitchen table, resisting the urge to hide her face in her hands and weep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already said that,\u201d Jeff grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat possessed you to even think about going into Mr. Camden\u2019s yard again? Honestly, Jeff, you\u2019ve been warned at least half a dozen times. What do I have to do? String barbed wire between our yards?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although he\u2019d thoroughly disgraced himself, Jeff casually rotated the rim of his baseball cap between his fingers. \u201cI said I was sorry.\u201d</p><p>A mere apology didn\u2019t begin to compensate for the humiliation Robin had suffered when Cole found her on all fours, crawling through his laurel hedge. If she lived to be an old woman, she\u2019d never forget the look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou put me on TV, computer and phone restriction already,\u201d her son reminded her.</p><p>That punishment could be another mistake to add to her growing list. At times like this, she wished Lenny were there to advise her. She needed him, and even after all these years, still missed him. Often, when there was no one else around, Robin found herself talking to Lenny. She wondered if she\u2019d made the right decision, wondered what her husband would have done. Without television, computer or phone, the most attractive form of entertainment left open to her son was playing with Blackie, which was exactly what had gotten him into trouble in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cBlackie belongs to Mr. Camden,\u201d Robin felt obliged to tell him. Again.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jeff said, \u201cbut he likes me. When I come home from school, he goes crazy. He\u2019s real glad to see me, Mom, and since there aren\u2019t very many boys in this neighborhood\u2014\u201d he paused as if she was to blame for that \u201c\u2014Blackie and I have an understanding. We\u2019re buds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all fine and dandy, but you seem to be forgetting that Blackie doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d Robin stood and opened the refrigerator, taking out a package of chicken breasts.</p><p>\u201cI wish he was my dog,\u201d Jeff grumbled. In an apparent effort to make peace, he walked over to the cupboard, removed two plates and proceeded to set the table.</p><p>After dinner, while Robin was dealing with the dishes, the doorbell chimed. Jeff raced down the hallway to answer it, returning a moment later with Cole Camden at his side.</p> <p>Her neighbor was the last person Robin had expected to see\u2014and the last person she wanted to see.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff said, nodding toward Cole, \u201cit\u2019s Mr. Camden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, again,\u201d she managed, striving for a light tone, and realizing even as she spoke that she\u2019d failed. \u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019d like to talk to both of you about\u2014\u201d</p><p>Not giving him the opportunity to continue, Robin nodded so hard she nearly dislocated her neck. \u201cI really am sorry about what happened. I\u2019ve had a good long talk with Jeff and, frankly, I understand why you\u2019re upset and I don\u2019t blame you. You\u2019ve been very kind about this whole episode and I want you to know there won\u2019t be a repeat performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom either of you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said, knowing her cheeks were as red as her nail polish. Did he have to remind her of the humiliating position he\u2019d found her in earlier?</p><p>\u201cMom put me on TV, computer and phone restriction for an entire week,\u201d Jeff explained earnestly. \u201cI promise not to go into your fort again, Mr. Camden. And I promise not to go in my backyard after school, either, because Blackie sees me and gets all happy and excited\u2014and I guess I get all happy and excited, too\u2014and that\u2019s when I do stuff I\u2019m not supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Cole smiled down at Jeff. Robin thought it was a rather unusual smile. It didn\u2019t come from his lips as much as his eyes. Once more she witnessed a flash of pain, and another emotion she could only describe as longing. Slowly his gaze drifted to Robin. When his dark eyes met hers, she suddenly found herself short of breath.</p><p>\u201cActually I didn\u2019t come here to talk to you about what happened this afternoon,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out of town for the next couple of days, and since Jeff and Blackie seem to get along so well I thought Jeff might be willing to look after him. That way I won\u2019t have to put him in the kennel. Naturally I\u2019m prepared to pay your son for his time. If he agrees, I\u2019ll let him play in the fort while I\u2019m away, as well.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s eyes grew rounder than Robin had ever seen them. \u201cYou want me to watch Blackie?\u201d he asked, his voice incredulous. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to pay me? Can Blackie spend the night here? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that answers your question,\u201d Robin said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cBlackie can stay here if it\u2019s okay with your mom,\u201d Cole told Jeff. Then he turned to her. \u201cWould that create a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>Once more his eyes held hers, and once more she experienced that odd breathless sensation.</p> <p>\u201cI ... No problem whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>Cole smiled then, and this time it was a smile so potent, so compelling, that it sailed straight through Robin\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff hollered as he burst through the front door late Thursday afternoon. \u201cKelly and Blackie and I are going to the fort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly? Surely this isn\u2019t the girl named Kelly, is it? Not the one who lives next door?\u201d Robin couldn\u2019t resist teasing her son. Apparently Jeff was willing to have a \u201cpesky\u201d girl for a friend, after all.</p><p>Jeff shrugged as he opened the cookie jar and groped inside. He frowned, not finding any cookies and removed his hand, his fingertips covered with crumbs that he promptly licked off. \u201cI decided Kelly isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got Blackie\u2019s leash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to need it. We\u2019re playing Sam Houston and Daniel Boone, and the Mexican army is attacking. I\u2019m going to smuggle Blackie out and go for help. I can\u2019t use a leash for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Just don\u2019t go any farther than the Alamo and be back by dinnertime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s less than an hour!\u201d Jeff protested.</p><p>Robin gave him one of her don\u2019t-argue-with-me looks.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not hungry and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d Robin said softly, widening her eyes just a bit, increasing the intensity of her look.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Mom,\u201d Jeff said with a cry of undisguised disgust, \u201cyou don\u2019t fight fair.\u201d He hurried out the front door with Blackie trotting faithfully behind.</p><p>Smiling to herself, Robin placed the meat loaf in the oven and carried her coffee into the backyard. The early evening air was filled with the scent of spring flowers. A gentle breeze wafted over the budding trees. How peaceful it seemed. How serene. All the years of pinching pennies to save for a house of their own seemed worth it now.</p><p>Her gaze wandered toward Cole Camden\u2019s yard. Jeff, Kelly and Blackie were inside the fort, and she could hear their raised voices every once in a while.</p><p>Cole had been on her mind a great deal during the past couple of days; she\u2019d spent far too much time dwelling on her neighbor, thinking about his reputation in the neighborhood and the son he\u2019d lost.</p><p>The tranquillity of the moment was shattered by the insistent ringing of the phone. Robin walked briskly to the kitchen, set her coffee on the counter and picked up the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin, it\u2019s Angela. I\u2019m not catching you at a bad time, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Robin assured her. Angela worked in the same department as Robin, and over the years they\u2019d become good friends. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked, as if she didn\u2019t already know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling to invite you to dinner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Saturday so I can meet your cousin Frank,\u201d Robin finished, rolling her eyes. Years before, Angela had taken on the task of finding Robin a husband. Never mind that Robin wasn\u2019t interested in meeting strangers! Angela couldn\u2019t seem to bear the thought of anyone spending her life alone and had appointed herself Robin\u2019s personal matchmaker.</p><p>\u201cFrank\u2019s a really nice guy,\u201d Angela insisted. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t steer you wrong, you know I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Robin restrained herself from reminding her friend of the disastrous date she\u2019d arranged several weeks earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Frank all my life,\u201d Angela said. \u201cHe\u2019s decent and nice.\u201d</p><p>Decent and nice were two words Robin had come to hate. Every man she\u2019d ever met in this kind of arrangement was either decent or nice. Or both. Robin had come to think the two words were synonymous with dull, unattractive and emotionally manipulative. Generally these were recently divorced men who\u2019d willingly placed themselves in the hands of family and friends to get them back into circulation.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me that Frank just got divorced?\u201d Robin asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, about six months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not interested?\u201d Angela demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to meet him. Angela, I know you mean well, and I apologize if I sound like a spoilsport, but I can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve had to nurse the fragile egos of recently divorced men. Most of the time they\u2019re emotional wrecks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Frank\u2019s divorce was final months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you still want me to meet him in a year, I\u2019ll be more than happy to have you arrange a dinner date.\u201d</p><p>Angela released a ragged sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>There was a short disappointed silence. \u201cFine,\u201d Angela said in obvious frustration. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Because she felt guilty, Robin added, \u201cI\u2019ll bring the coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Robin lingered in the kitchen, frowning. She hated it when her friends put her on the spot like this. It was difficult enough to say no, but knowing that Angela\u2019s intentions were genuine made it even worse. Just as she was struggling with another attack of guilt, the phone rang again. Angela! Her friend must have suspected that Robin\u2019s offer to buy the coffee was a sign that she was weakening.</p><p>Gathering her fortitude, Robin seized the receiver and said firmly, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in dating Frank. I don\u2019t want to be rude, but that\u2019s final!\u201d</p><p>Her abrupt words were followed by a brief shocked silence, and then, \u201cRobin, hello, this is Cole Camden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole,\u201d she gasped, closing her eyes. \u201cUh, I\u2019m sorry, I thought you were someone else. A friend.\u201d She slumped against the wall and covered her face with one hand. \u201cI have this friend who\u2019s always trying to arrange dates for me, and she doesn\u2019t take no for an answer,\u201d Robin quickly explained. \u201cI suppose you have friends wanting to arrange dates for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Of course he didn\u2019t. No doubt there were women all over San Francisco who longed to go out with Cole. He didn\u2019t require a personal matchmaker. All someone like him had to do was look interested and women would flock to his side.</p><p>Her hand tightened around the receiver and a sick weightless feeling attacked the pit of her stomach. \u201cI apologize. I didn\u2019t mean to shout in your ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you called to talk to Jeff,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s with Blackie and Kelly\u2014Kelly Lawrence, the little girl who lives on the other side of us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back in a few minutes, if you\u2019d like to call then.

What\u2019s Jeff doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re playing in the fort, pretending they\u2019re Houston and Daniel Boone. The fort is now the Alamo.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cI see. No, don\u2019t worry about chasing after him. I\u2019d hate to see you waylaid by the Mexican army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d care for that myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>She must have sounded rushed because he said, \u201cYou\u2019re sure this isn\u2019t a bad time? If you have company ... \u201c</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m here alone.\u201d</p><p>Another short silence, which was broken by Cole. \u201cSo everything\u2019s okay with Blackie? He isn\u2019t causing you any problems, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, everything\u2019s great. Jeff lavishes him with attention. The two of them are together practically every minute. Blackie even sleeps beside his bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you said, Jeff has a way with animals,\u201d Cole murmured.</p><p>His laugh, so tender and warm, was enough to jolt her. She had to pinch herself to remember that Cole was a prominent attorney, wealthy and respected. She was an accountant. A junior accountant at that.</p><p>The only thing they had in common was the fact that they lived next door to each other and her son was crazy about his dog.</p> <p>The silence returned, only this time it had a relaxed, almost comfortable quality, as though neither wanted the conversation to end.</p><p>\u201cSince Jeff isn\u2019t around,\u201d Cole said reluctantly, \u201cI\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him you phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything important,\u201d Cole said. \u201cJust wanted to let you know when I\u2019ll be back\u2014late Friday afternoon. Will you be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know, your friend might talk you into going out with Fred after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Frank, and there isn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamous last words!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee you Friday,\u201d she said with a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cRight. Goodbye, Robin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Cole.\u201d</p><p>Long after the call had ended, Robin stood with her hand on the receiver, a smile touching her eyes and her heart.</p><p>\u201cMom, I need my lunch money,\u201d Jeff yelled from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute,\u201d she said. Mornings were hectic. In order to get to the Glen Park BART station on time, Robin had to leave the house half an hour before Jeff left for school.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have for breakfast?\u201d she hollered as she put the finishing touches on her makeup.</p><p>\u201cFrozen waffles,\u201d Jeff shouted back. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t drown them in syrup and I rinsed off the plate before I put it in the dishwasher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRinsed it off or let Blackie lick it for you?\u201d she asked, as she hurried down the stairs. Her son was busy at the sink and didn\u2019t turn around to look at her.</p><p>\u201cBlackie, honestly, is that maple syrup on your nose?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his name, the Labrador trotted over to her. Robin took a moment to stroke his thick fur before fumbling for her wallet to give Jeff his lunch money.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom, you look nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jeff said without the slightest bit of concern. \u201cYou won\u2019t be late tonight, will you? Remember Mr. Camden\u2019s coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember, and no, I won\u2019t be late.\u201d She grabbed her purse and her packed lunch, putting it in her briefcase, and headed for the front door.</p><p>Even before Robin arrived at the subway station, she knew the day would drag. Fridays always did.</p><p>She was right. At six, when the subway pulled into the station, Robin felt as though she\u2019d been away forty hours instead of the usual nine. She found herself hurrying and didn\u2019t fully understand why. Cole was scheduled to return, but that didn\u2019t have anything to do with her, did it? His homecoming wasn\u2019t anything to feel nervous about, nor any reason to be pleased. He was her neighbor, and more Jeff\u2019s friend than hers.</p><p>The first thing Robin noticed when she arrived on Orchard Street was Cole\u2019s Porsche parked in the driveway of his house.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d Jeff called as he raced across the lawn between the two houses. \u201cMr. Camden\u2019s back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d She removed her keys from her purse and opened the front door.</p><p>Jeff followed her inside. \u201cHe said he\u2019d square up with me later. I wanted to invite him to dinner, but I didn\u2019t think I should without asking you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was smart,\u201d she said, depositing her jacket in the closet on her way to the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator and took out the thawed hamburger and salad makings.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jeff sat down at the table and propped his elbows on it. \u201cAll right, I guess. What are you making for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaco salad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about just tacos? I don\u2019t get why you want to ruin a perfectly good dinner by putting green stuff in it.\u201d</p><p>Robin paused. \u201cI thought you liked my taco salad.\u201d</p><p>Jeff shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, but I\u2019d rather have just tacos.\u201d Once that was made clear, he cupped his chin in his hands. \u201cCan we rent a movie tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Robin returned absently as she added the meat to the onions browning in the skillet.</p><p>\u201cBut I get to choose this time,\u201d Jeff insisted. \u201cLast week you picked a musical.\u201d He wrinkled his nose as if to suggest that being forced to watch men and women sing and dance was the most disgusting thing he\u2019d ever had to endure.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we can find a compromise,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jeff nodded. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t have a silly love story in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Robin said, doing her best not to betray her amusement. Their difference in taste when it came to movies was legendary. Jeff\u2019s favorite was an older kids\u2019 film, Scooby Doo, that he watched over and over, which Robin found boring, to say the least. Unfortunately, her son was equally put off by the sight of men and women staring longingly into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>The meat was simmering in the skillet when Robin glanced up and noted that her son was looking surprisingly thoughtful. \u201cIs something troubling you?\u201d she asked, and popped a thin tomato slice into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever noticed that Mr. Camden never mentions he had a son?\u201d</p><p>Robin set the paring knife on the cutting board. \u201cIt\u2019s probably painful for him to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded, and, with the innocent wisdom of youth, he whispered, \u201cThat man needs someone.\u201d</p><p>The meal was finished, and Robin was standing in front of the sink rinsing off the dinner plates when the doorbell rang. Robin knew it had to be Cole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Jeff cried as he raced past her at breakneck speed. He threw open the door. \u201cHi, Mr. Camden!\u201d he said eagerly.</p><p>By this time Robin had smoothed her peach-colored sweater over her hips and placed a friendly\u2014but not too friendly\u2014smile on her face. At the last second, she ran her fingers through her hair, striving for the casual I-didn\u2019t-go-to-any-trouble look, then wondered at her irrational behavior. Cole wasn\u2019t coming over to see her.</p><p>Robin could hear Jeff chatting away at ninety miles an hour, telling Cole they were renting a movie and how Robin insisted that every show he saw had to have the proper rating, which he claimed was totally ridiculous. He went on to explain that she considered choosing the film a mother\u2019s job and apparently a mere kid didn\u2019t have rights. When there was a pause in the conversation, she could envision Jeff rolling his eyes dramatically.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she stepped into the entryway and smiled. \u201cHello, Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met instantly. Robin\u2019s first coherent thought was that a woman could get lost in eyes that dark and not even care. She swallowed and lowered her gaze.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d she asked, having difficulty dragging the words out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d Or it wouldn\u2019t be if she could stop her heart from pounding so furiously.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Blackie?\u201d Jeff asked, opening the screen door and glancing outside.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring him over. I thought you\u2019d be tired of him by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired of Blackie?\u201d Jeff cried. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I should\u2019ve known better,\u201d Cole teased.</p><p>Robin returned to the kitchen and took mugs from the cupboard, using these few minutes to compose herself.</p><p>The screen door slammed, and a moment later Cole appeared in her kitchen. \u201cJeff went to my house to get Blackie.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and nodded. \u201cDo you take cream or sugar?\u201d she asked over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJust black, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Robin normally drank hers the same way. But for some reason she couldn\u2019t begin to fathom, she added a generous teaspoonful of sugar to her own, stirring briskly as though she feared it wouldn\u2019t dissolve.</p><p>\u201cI hope your trip went well,\u201d she said, carrying both mugs into the family room, where Cole had chosen to sit.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She sat a safe distance from him, across the room in a wooden rocker, and balanced her mug on her knee. \u201cEverything around here went without a hitch, but I\u2019m afraid Jeff may have spoiled Blackie a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what he said, they did everything but attend school together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving the dog has been wonderful for him. I appreciate your giving Jeff this opportunity. Not only does it satisfy his need for a dog, but it\u2019s taught him about responsibility.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened and the canine subject of their conversation shot into the room, followed by Jeff, who was grinning from ear to ear. \u201cMom, could Mr. Camden stay and watch the movie with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ...\u201d Caught off guard, Robin didn\u2019t know what to say. After being away from home for several days, watching a movie with his neighbors probably held a low position on Cole\u2019s list of priorities.</p><p>To Robin\u2019s astonishment, Cole\u2019s eyes searched hers as though seeking her approval.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be welcome ... I mean, you can stay if you\u2019d like, unless ... unless there\u2019s something else you\u2019d rather do,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d ... we\u2019d like it if you did, but ...\u201d She let whatever else she might have said fade away. She was making a mess of this, and every time she tried to smooth it over, she only stuck her foot further down her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat movie did you rent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t yet,\u201d Jeff explained. \u201cMom and me had to come to an understanding first. She likes mushy stuff and gets all bent out of shape if there\u2019s an explosion or anything. You wouldn\u2019t believe the love story she made me watch last Friday night.\u201d His voice dripped with renewed disgust. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow about if you and I go rent the movie while your mother and Blackie make the popcorn?\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s blue eyes brightened immediately. \u201cThat\u2019d be great, wouldn\u2019t it, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she agreed, and was rewarded by Jeff\u2019s smile.</p><p>Jeff and Cole left a few minutes later. It was on the tip of her tongue to give Cole instructions on the type of movie appropriate for a ten-year-old boy, but she swallowed her concerns, willing to trust his judgment. Standing on the porch, she watched as they climbed inside Cole\u2019s expensive sports car. She pressed her hand to her throat, grateful when Cole leaned over the front seat and snapped Jeff\u2019s seat belt snugly in place. Suddenly Cole looked at her; she raised her hand in farewell, and he did the same. It was a simple gesture, yet Robin felt as if they\u2019d communicated so much more.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Blackie,\u201d Robin said, \u201clet\u2019s go start the popcorn.\u201d The Lab trailed behind her as she returned to the kitchen. She placed a packet of popcorn in the microwave. It was while she was waiting for the kernels to start popping that the words slipped from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell, Lenny, what do you think?\u201d Talking to her dead husband came without conscious thought. It certainly wasn\u2019t that she expected him to answer. Whenever she spoke to him, the words came spontaneously from the deep well of love they\u2019d once shared. She supposed she should feel foolish doing it, but so many times over the long years since his death she\u2019d felt his presence. Robin assumed that the reason she talked to him came from her need to discuss things with the one other person who\u2019d loved her son as much as she did. In the beginning she was sure she needed to visit a psychiatrist or arrange for grief counseling, but later she convinced herself that every widow went through this in one form or another.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s grown so much in the past year, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d she asked, and smiled. \u201cMeeting Cole has been good for Jeff. He lost a child, you know, and I suppose having Jeff move in next door answers a need for him, too.\u201d</p><p>About ten minutes later, she\u2019d transferred the popcorn to a bowl and set out drinks. Jeff and Cole came back with a movie that turned out to be an excellent compromise\u2014a teen comedy that was surprisingly witty and entertaining.</p><p>Jeff sprawled on the carpet munching popcorn with Blackie by his side. Cole sat on the sofa and Robin chose the rocking chair. She removed her shoes and tucked her feet beneath her. She was enjoying the movie; in fact, several times she found herself laughing out loud.</p> <p>Cole and Jeff laughed, too. The sounds were contrasting\u2014one deep and masculine, the other young and pleasantly boyish\u2014yet they harmonized, blending with perfect naturalness.</p><p>Soon Robin found herself watching Jeff and Cole more than the movie. The two ... no, the three of them had grown comfortable together. Robin didn\u2019t try to read any significance into that. Doing so could prove emotionally dangerous, but the thought flew into her mind and refused to leave.</p><p>The credits were rolling when Cole pointed to Jeff, whose head was resting on his arms, his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep,\u201d Cole said softly.</p><p>Robin smiled and nodded. She got up to bring the empty popcorn bowl into the kitchen. Cole stood, too, taking their glasses to the sink, then returned to the family room to remove the DVD.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to carry him upstairs for you?\u201d he asked, glancing down at the slumbering Jeff.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhen he wakes up in the morning, he\u2019ll think you treated him like a little kid. Egos are fragile at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>The silence seemed to resound. Without Jeff, awake and chattering, as a buffer between them, Robin felt clumsy and self-conscious around Cole.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice of you to stay,\u201d she said, more to fill the silence than because she had anything important to communicate. \u201cIt meant a lot to Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Jeff had told her Cole had an active social life. Heather Lawrence had confirmed it by casually letting it drop that Cole was often away on weekends. Robin wasn\u2019t entirely sure what to think about it all. But if there was a woman in his life, that was his business, not hers.</p><p>\u201cIt meant a lot to me, too,\u201d he said, returning the DVD to its case.</p><p>The kitchen and family room, actually quite spacious, felt close and intimate with Cole standing only a few feet away.</p><p>Robin\u2019s fingers were shaking as she placed the bowls and soda glasses in the dishwasher. She tried to come up with some bright and witty comment, but her mind was blank.</p> <p>\u201cI should be going.\u201d</p><p>Was that reluctance she heard in his voice? Somehow Robin doubted it; probably wishful thinking on her part. Half of her wanted to push him out the door and the other half didn\u2019t want him to leave at all. But there really wasn\u2019t any reason for him to stay. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackie.\u201d Cole called for his dog. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>The Lab didn\u2019t look pleased. He took his own sweet time lumbering to his feet and stretching before trotting to Cole\u2019s side.</p><p>Robin was about to open the door when she realized she hadn\u2019t thanked Cole for getting the movie. She turned, and his dark eyes delved into hers. Whatever thoughts had been taking shape fled like leaves scattering in the wind. She tried to smile, however weakly, but it was difficult when he was looking at her so intently. His gaze slipped to her mouth, and in a nervous movement, she moistened her lips. Before she was fully aware of how it had happened, Cole\u2019s fingers were in her hair and he was urging her mouth to meet his.</p><p>His eyes held hers, as if he expected her to stop him, then they slowly closed and their lips touched. Robin\u2019s eyes drifted shut, but that was the only response she made.</p><p>He kissed her again, even more gently than the first time. Robin moaned softly, not in protest, but in wonder and surprise. It had been so long since a man had kissed her like this. So long that she\u2019d forgotten the wealth of sensations a mere kiss could evoke. Her hands crept to his chest, and her fingers curled into the soft wool of his sweater. Hesitantly, timidly, her lips trembled beneath his. Cole sighed and took full possession of her mouth.</p><p>Robin sighed, too. The tears that welled in her eyes were a shock. She was at a loss to explain them. They slipped down her face, and it wasn\u2019t until then that she realized she was crying.</p><p>Cole must have felt her tears at the same moment, because he abruptly broke off the kiss and raised his head. His eyes searched hers as his thumb brushed the moisture from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d The question was whispered.</p><p>She shook her head vehemently.</p><p>\u201cThen why ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She couldn\u2019t explain something she didn\u2019t understand herself. Rubbing her eyes, she attempted to wipe away the evidence. She forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m nothing if not novel,\u201d she said with brittle cheerfulness. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine many women break into tears when you kiss them.\u201d</p><p>Cole looked as confused as Robin felt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m fine.\u201d She wanted to reassure him, but was having too much trouble analyzing her own reactions.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down and talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly. Adamantly. That was the last thing she wanted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cole. I really am. This has never happened before and I don\u2019t understand it either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cThe best thing we can do is chalk it up to a long workweek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, but I\u2019d prefer to just forget it. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotionally or physically?\u201d She tried to joke, but didn\u2019t succeed.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>He was so serious, so concerned, that it was all Robin could do not to dissolve into fresh tears. She\u2019d made a world-class fool of herself with this man, not once but twice.</p><p>This man, who had suffered such a tremendous loss himself, was so gentle with her, and instead of helping, that only made matters worse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, really I am,\u201d she said raggedly, \u201cbut perhaps you should go home now.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m in the mood for?\u201d Angela Lansky said as she sat on the edge of Robin\u2019s desk early Monday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope you\u2019re going to say food,\u201d Robin teased. They had shared the same lunch hour and were celebrating a cost-of-living raise by eating out.</p><p>\u201cA shrimp salad,\u201d Angela elaborated. \u201cHeaped six inches high with big fresh shrimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking Chinese food myself,\u201d Robin said, \u201cbut, now that you mention it, shrimp salad sounds good.\u201d She opened her bottom drawer and took out her purse.</p><p>Angela was short and enviably thin with thick brown hair that fell in natural waves over her shoulders. She used clips to hold the abundant curls away from her face and looked closer to twenty than the thirty-five Robin knew her to be.</p><p>\u201cI know just the place,\u201d Angela was saying. \u201cThe Blue Crab. It\u2019s on the wharf and worth the trouble of getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>They stopped at the bank, then headed for the restaurant. They decided to catch the Market Street cable car to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf and joined the quickly growing line.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the kid doing?\u201d Angela asked. She and her salesman husband didn\u2019t plan to have children themselves, but Angela enjoyed hearing about Jeff.</p><p>\u201cHe signed up for baseball through the park program and starts practice this week. I think it\u2019ll be good for him. He was lonely this weekend now that Blackie\u2019s back with Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t Blackie over at your place as much as before?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Robin shook her head. \u201cCole left early Saturday morning and took the dog with him. Jeff moped around for most of the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d your handsome neighbor go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to know?\u201d Robin asked with a soft laugh, hiding her disappointment at his disappearance. \u201cCole doesn\u2019t clear his schedule with me.\u201d</p><p>The way he\u2019d left\u2014without a word of farewell or explanation\u2014still hurt. It was the kind of hurt that came from realizing what a complete fool she\u2019d made of herself with this worldly, sophisticated man. He\u2019d kissed her and she\u2019d started crying. Good grief, he was probably doing backflips in order to avoid seeing her again.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Cole was with a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of my business!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought your neighbor said Cole spent his weekends with a woman.\u201d</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t remember mentioning that to Angela, but she obviously had, along with practically everything else. Robin had tried to convince herself that confiding in Angela about Cole was a clever way of thwarting her friend\u2019s matchmaking efforts. Unfortunately, the whole thing had backfired in her face. In the end, the last person she wanted to talk about was Cole, but of course Angela persisted in questioning her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Angela demanded. \u201cDid he spend his weekend with a woman or not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat he does with his time is his business, not mine,\u201d Robin reiterated. She pretended not to care. But she did. Too much. She\u2019d promised herself she wasn\u2019t going to put any stock in the kiss or the powerful attraction she felt for Cole. Within the space of one evening, she\u2019d wiped out every pledge she\u2019d made to herself. She hadn\u2019t said anything to Jeff\u2014how could she?\u2014but she was just as disappointed as he was that Cole had left for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping something might develop between the two of you,\u201d Angela murmured. \u201cSince you\u2019re obviously not interested in meeting Frank, it would be great if you got something going with your neighbor.\u201d</p><p>Robin cast her a plaintive look that suggested otherwise. \u201cCole Camden lives in the fanciest house in the neighborhood. He\u2019s a partner in the law firm of Blackwell, Burns and Dailey, which we both know is one of the most prestigious in San Francisco. And he drives a car with a name I can barely pronounce. Now, what would someone like that see in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of things,\u201d Angela said.</p> <p>Robin snickered. \u201cI hate to disillusion you, my friend, but the only thing Cole Camden and I have in common is the fact that my small yard borders his massive one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Angela agreed, raising her eyebrows. \u201cBut I could tell you were intrigued by him the very first time you mentioned his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Angela insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve watched you with other men over the past few years. A guy will show some interest, and at first everything looks peachy-keen. You\u2019ll go out with him a couple of times, maybe even more, but before anything serious can develop you\u2019ve broken off the relationship without really giving it a chance.\u201d</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t have much of an argument, since that was true, but she made a token protest just the same. \u201cI can\u2019t help it if I have high standards.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHigh standards!\u201d Angela choked back a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be the understatement of the century. You\u2019d find fault with Prince Charming.\u201d</p><p>Robin rolled her eyes, but couldn\u2019t hold back a smile. Angela was right, although that certainly hadn\u2019t slowed her matchmaking efforts.</p><p>\u201cFrom the time you started talking about your neighbor,\u201d Angela went on, \u201cI noticed something different about you, and frankly I\u2019m thrilled. In all the years we\u2019ve known each other, this is the first time I can remember you giving a man this much attention. Until now, it\u2019s always been the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in Cole,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cOh, honestly, Angela, I can\u2019t imagine where you come up with these ideas. I think you\u2019ve been reading too many romance novels.\u201d</p><p>Angela waved her index finger under Robin\u2019s nose. \u201cListen, I\u2019m on to you. You\u2019re not going to divert me with humor, or weasel your way out of admitting it. You can\u2019t fool me\u2014you\u2019re attracted to this guy and it\u2019s scaring you to death. Right?\u201d</p><p>The two women gazed solemnly at each other, both too stubborn to admit defeat. Under the force of her friend\u2019s unyielding determination, Robin was the one who finally gave in.</p> <p>\u201cAll right!\u201d she cried, causing the other people waiting for the cable car to turn and stare. \u201cAll right,\u201d she repeated in a whisper. \u201cI like Cole, but I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><p>Angela\u2019s winged brows arched speculatively. \u201cHe\u2019s attractive and wealthy, crazy about your son, generous and kind, and you haven\u2019t figured it out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also way out of my league.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d quit categorizing yourself. You make it sound as though you aren\u2019t good enough for him, and that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Robin just sighed.</p><p>The cable car appeared then, its bell clanging as it drew to a stop. Robin and Angela boarded and held on tight.</p><p>Jeff loved hearing about the history of the cable cars, and Robin loved telling him the story. Andrew Hallidie had designed them because of his deep love for horses. Day after day, Hallidie had watched them struggling up and down the treacherous hills of the city, dragging heavy burdens. Prompted by his concern for the animals, he\u2019d invented the cable cars that are pulled by a continuously moving underground cable. To Jeff and to many others, Andrew Hallidie was a hero.</p><p>Robin and Angela were immediately caught up in the festive atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. The rows of fishing boats along the dock bobbed gently with the tide, and although Robin had never been to the Mediterranean the view reminded her of pictures she\u2019d seen of French and Italian harbors.</p> <p>The day was beautiful, the sky blue and cloudless, the ocean sparkling the way it did on a summer day. This spring had been exceptionally warm. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for Robin to wear a winter coat in the middle of July, especially in the mornings, when there was often a heavy fog accompanied by a cool mist from the Bay. But this spring, they\u2019d experienced some lovely weather, including today\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat outside,\u201d Angela suggested, pointing at a free table on the patio.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Robin agreed cheerfully. The Blue Crab was a popular restaurant and one of several that lined the wharf. More elegant dining took place inside, but the pavement was crowded with diners interested in a less formal meal.</p><p>Once they were seated, Robin and Angela were waited on quickly and ordered their shrimp salads.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Angela said, spreading out her napkin while closely studying Robin. \u201cTell me more about your neighbor.\u201d</p><p>Robin froze. \u201cI thought we were finished with this subject. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, I\u2019d prefer not to discuss Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed, but unfortunately I was just getting started. It\u2019s unusual for you to be so keen on a man, and I know hardly anything about him. It\u2019s time, Robin Masterson, to tell all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell. I already told you everything I care to,\u201d Robin said crossly. She briefly wondered if Angela had guessed that Cole had kissed her. At the rate things were going, she\u2019d probably end up admitting it before lunch was over. Robin wished she could think of some surefire way to change the subject.</p><p>Tall glasses of iced tea arrived and Robin was reaching for a packet of sugar when she heard a masculine chuckle that reminded her instantly of Cole. She paused, savoring the husky sound. Without really meaning to, she found herself scanning the tables, certain Cole was seated a short distance away.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d she whispered before she could guard her tongue.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole. I just heard him laugh.\u201d</p><p>Pushing back her chair in order to get a fuller view of the inside dining area, Robin searched through a sea of faces, but didn\u2019t find her neighbor\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he look like?\u201d Angela whispered.</p><p>Ten different ways to describe him shot through her mind. To say he had brown hair, neatly trimmed, coffee-colored eyes and was about six foot two seemed inadequate. To add that he was strikingly attractive further complicated the problem.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to look for,\u201d Angela insisted. \u201cCome on, Robin, this is a golden opportunity. I want to check this guy out. I\u2019m not letting a chance like this slip through my fingers. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Robin continued to scan the diners, but she didn\u2019t see anyone who remotely resembled Cole. Even if she did see him, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d point him out to Angela, although she hated to lie. Perhaps she wouldn\u2019t have to. Perhaps she\u2019d imagined the whole thing. It would\u2019ve been easy enough to do. Angela\u2019s questions had brought Cole to the forefront of her mind; they\u2019d just been discussing him and it was only natural for her to\u2014</p><p>Her heart pounded against her rib cage as Cole walked out of the restaurant foyer. He wasn\u2019t alone. A tall, slender woman with legs that seemed to go all the way up to her neck and a figure as shapely and athletic as a dancer\u2019s was walking beside him. She was blond and, in a word, gorgeous. Robin felt as appealing as milkweed in comparison. The woman\u2019s arm was delicately tucked in Cole\u2019s, and she was smiling up at him with eyes big and blue enough to turn heads.</p><p>Robin\u2019s stomach tightened into a hard knot.</p><p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Angela said anxiously, leaning toward her, \u201cwhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Cole was strolling past them, and in an effort not to be seen, Robin stuck her head under the table pretending to search for her purse.</p><p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Angela muttered, lowering her own head and peeking under the linen tablecloth, \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Other than the fact that she was going to be ill. Other than the fact that she\u2019d never been more outclassed in her life. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really.\u201d A smile trembled on her pale lips.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing with your head under the table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d believe my napkin fell off my lap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A pair of shiny black shoes appeared. Slowly, Robin twisted her head and glanced upward, squinting at the flash of sunlight that nearly blinded her. It was their waiter. Heaving a giant sigh of relief, Robin straightened. The first thing she noticed was that Cole had left.</p><p>The huge shrimp salads were all but forgotten as Angela, eyes narrowed and elbows braced on the table, confronted her. \u201cYou saw him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>There was no point in pretending otherwise, so Robin nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe was with someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just someone! The most beautiful woman in the world was draped all over his arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Angela said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re jumping to conclusions? Honestly, she could\u2019ve been anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Any fight left in Robin had long since evaporated. There was nothing like seeing Cole with another woman to bring her firmly back to earth\u2014which was right where she belonged.</p><p>\u201cShe could\u2019ve been a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably was,\u201d Robin concurred, reaching for her fork. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to manage one shrimp, let alone a whole plate of them. Heaving another huge sigh, she plowed her fork into the heap of plump pink darlings. It was then that she happened to glance across the street. Cole and Ms. Gorgeous were walking along the sidewalk, engrossed in their conversation. For some reason, known only to the fates, Cole looked across the street at that very moment. His gaze instantly narrowed on her. He stopped midstride as though shocked to have seen her.</p><p>Doing her best to pretend she hadn\u2019t seen him, Robin took another bite of her salad and chewed vigorously. When she glanced up again, Cole was gone.</p><p>\u201cMom, I need someone to practice with,\u201d Jeff pleaded. He stood forlornly in front of her, a baseball mitt in one hand, a ball in the other.</p><p>\u201cI thought Jimmy was practicing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to go home and then Kelly threw me a few pitches, but she had to go home, too. Besides, she\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I?\u201d Robin muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a mom,\u201d Jeff answered, clearly not understanding her question. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? I\u2019ve got a chance of making pitcher for our team if I can get someone to practice with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Robin agreed, grumbling a bit. She set aside her knitting and followed her son into the backyard. He handed her his old catcher\u2019s mitt, which barely fit her hand, and positioned her with her back to Cole\u2019s yard.</p><p>Robin hadn\u2019t been able to completely avoid her neighbor in the past week, but she\u2019d succeeded in keeping her distance. For that matter, he didn\u2019t seem all that eager to run into her, either. Just as well, she supposed.</p><p>He stayed on his side of the hedge. She stayed on hers.</p> <p>If he passed her on his way to work, he gave an absent wave. She returned the gesture.</p><p>If they happened to be outside at the same time, they exchanged smiles and a polite greeting, but nothing more. It seemed, although Robin couldn\u2019t be sure, that Cole spent less time outside than usual. So did she.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jeff called, running to the end of their yard. \u201cSquat down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Robin shouted indignantly. \u201cI agreed to play catch with you. You didn\u2019t say anything about having to squat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff said impatiently, \u201cthink about it. If I\u2019m going to be the pitcher, you\u2019ve got to be the catcher, and catchers have to be low to the ground.\u201d</p> <p>Complaining under her breath, Robin sank to her knees, worried the grass would stain her jeans.</p><p>Jeff tossed his arms into the air in frustration. \u201cNot like that!\u201d He said something else that Robin couldn\u2019t quite make out\u2014something about why couldn\u2019t moms be guys.</p><p>Reluctantly, Robin assumed the posture he wanted, but she didn\u2019t know how long her knees would hold out. Jeff wound up his arm and let loose with a fastball. Robin closed her eyes, stuck out the mitt and was so shocked when she caught the ball that she toppled backward into the wet grass.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Jeff yelled, racing toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she shouted back, discounting his concern as she brushed the dampness from the seat of her jeans. She righted herself, assumed the position and waited for the second ball.</p><p>Jeff ran back to his mock pitcher\u2019s mound, gripped both hands behind his back and stepped forward. Robin closed her eyes again. Nothing happened. She opened her eyes cautiously, puzzled about the delay. Then she recalled the hand movements she\u2019d seen pitchers make and flexed her fingers a few times.</p> <p>Jeff straightened, placed his hand on his hip and stared at her. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a signal ... I think. I\u2019ve seen catchers do it on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, leave that kind of stuff to the real ballplayers. All I want you to do is catch my pitches and throw them back. It might help if you kept your eyes open, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Robin suspected she heard a tinge of sarcasm in her son\u2019s voice. She didn\u2019t know what he was getting so riled up about; she was doing her best. It was at times like these that she most longed for Lenny. When her parents had still lived in the area, her dad had stepped in whenever her son needed a father\u2019s guiding hand, but they\u2019d moved to Arizona a couple of years ago. Lenny\u2019s family had been in Texas since before his death. Robin hadn\u2019t seen them since the funeral, although Lenny\u2019s mother faithfully sent Jeff birthday and Christmas gifts.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Jeff asked.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d Squinting, Robin stuck out the mitt, prepared to do her best to catch the stupid ball, since it seemed so important to her son. Once more he swung his arms behind him and stepped forward. Then he stood there, poised to throw, for what seemed an eternity. Her knees were beginning to ache.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to throw the ball, or are you going to stare at me all night?\u201d she asked after a long moment had passed.</p><p>\u201cThat does it!\u201d Jeff tossed his mitt to the ground. \u201cYou just broke my concentration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for crying out loud, what\u2019s there to concentrate on?\u201d Robin grimaced, rising awkwardly to her feet. Her legs had started to lose feeling.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t working,\u201d Jeff cried, stalking toward her. \u201cKelly\u2019s only in third grade and she does a better job than you do.\u201d</p><p>Robin decided to ignore that comment. She pressed her hand to the small of her back, hoping to ease the ache she\u2019d begun to feel.</p><p>\u201cHello, Robin. Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s voice came at her like a hangman\u2019s noose. She straightened abruptly and winced at the sharp pain shooting through her back.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. Camden!\u201d Jeff shouted as though Cole was a conquering hero returned from the war. He dashed across the yard, past Robin and straight to the hedge. \u201cWhere have you been all week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d He might\u2019ve been talking to Jeff, but his eyes were holding Robin\u2019s. She tried to look away\u2014but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>His eyes told her she was avoiding him.</p><p>Hers answered that he\u2019d been avoiding her.</p><p>\u201cI guess you have been busy,\u201d Jeff was saying. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in days and days and days.\u201d Blackie squeezed through the hedge and Jeff fell to his knees, his arms circling the dog\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the baseball going?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>Jeff sent his mother a disgusted look, then shrugged. \u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat position are you playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably outfield. I had a chance to make pitcher, but I can\u2019t seem to get anyone who knows how to catch a ball to practice with me. Kelly tries, but she\u2019s a girl and I hate to say it, but my mother\u2019s worthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did my best,\u201d Robin protested.</p><p>\u201cShe catches with her eyes closed,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cHow about if you toss a few balls at me?\u201d Cole offered.</p><p>Jeff blinked as if he thought he\u2019d misunderstood. \u201cYou want me to throw you a few pitches? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>The look on her son\u2019s face defied description as Cole jumped over the hedge. Jeff\u2019s smile stretched from one side of his face to the other as he tore to the opposite end of the yard, unwilling to question Cole\u2019s generosity a second time.</p><p>For an awkward moment, Robin stayed where she was, not knowing what to say. She looked up at Cole, her emotions soaring\u2014and tangling like kites in a brisk wind. She was deeply grateful for his offer, but also confused. Thrilled by his presence, but also frightened.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Jeff muttered. \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, you\u2019re in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make coffee and invite me in for a chat later?\u201d Cole asked quietly.</p><p>Her heart sank. \u201cI have some things that need to be done, and ... and ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Jeff shouted.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time you and I talked,\u201d Cole said, staring straight into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMom, are you moving or not?\u201d</p><p>Robin looked frantically over her shoulder. \u201cOh ... oh, sorry,\u201d she whispered, blushing. She hurried away, then stood on the patio watching as the ball flew across the yard.</p><p>After catching a dozen of Jeff\u2019s pitches, Cole got up and walked over to her son. They spoke for several minutes. Reluctantly, Robin decided it was time to go back in.</p><p>She busied herself wiping kitchen counters that were already perfectly clean and tried to stop thinking about the beautiful woman she\u2019d seen with Cole on the Wharf.</p><p>Jeff stormed into the house. \u201cMom, would it be okay if Mr. Camden strings up an old tire from the apple tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I can use it to practice pitching, and I wouldn\u2019t have to bother you or Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have an old tire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Camden has one.\u201d He ran outside again before she could comment.</p><p>Jeff was back in the yard with Cole a few minutes later, far too soon to suit Robin. She forced a weak smile. That other woman was a perfect damsel to his knight in shining armor, she thought wryly. Robin, on the other hand, considered herself more of a court jester.</p><p>Her musings were abruptly halted when Cole walked into the kitchen, trailed by her son.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it time for your bath, Jeff?\u201d Cole asked pointedly.</p><p>It looked for a minute as though the boy was going to argue. For the first time in recent memory, Robin would\u2019ve welcomed some resistance from him.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d he said. Bathing was about as popular as homework.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make any coffee,\u201d Robin said in a small voice. She simply couldn\u2019t look at Cole and not see the beautiful blonde on his arm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m more interested in talking, anyway,\u201d he said. He walked purposefully to the table and pulled out a chair, then gestured for her to sit down.</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t. Instead, she frowned at her watch. \u201cMy goodness, will you look at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cole headed toward her, and Robin backed slowly into the counter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going talk about that kiss,\u201d Cole warned her.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt meant nothing! We\u2019d both had a hectic week. We were tired .... I wasn\u2019t myself.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes burned into hers. \u201cThen why did you cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... don\u2019t know. Believe me, if I knew I\u2019d tell you, but I don\u2019t. Can\u2019t we just forget it ever happened?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders rose in a sigh as he threaded his long fingers through his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve tried to do all week. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put it completely out of my mind,\u201d Robin said, resuming her string of untruths. \u201cI wish you\u2019d do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried,\u201d Cole told her softly. He smiled and his sensuous mouth widened as his eyes continued to hold hers. The messages were back. Less than subtle messages. You can\u2019t fool me, they said, and I didn\u2019t want to admit it either.</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d</p><p>The sense of expectancy was written across his face. For the life of her, Robin couldn\u2019t tear her eyes from him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember stepping into his arms, but suddenly she was there, encompassed by his warmth, feeling more sheltered and protected than she had since her husband\u2019s death. This comforting sensation spun itself around her as he wove his fingers into her hair, cradling her head. He hadn\u2019t kissed her yet, but Robin felt the promise of it in every part of her.</p><p>Deny it though she might, she knew in her heart how badly she wanted Cole to hold her, to kiss her. He must have read the longing in her eyes, because he lowered his mouth to hers, stopping a fraction of an inch from her parted lips. She could feel warm moist breath, could feel a desire so powerful that she wanted to drown in his kiss.</p><p>From a reservoir of strength she didn\u2019t know she possessed, Robin managed to shake her head. \u201cNo ... please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ... please,\u201d he whispered just before his mouth settled firmly over hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His kiss was the same as it had been before, only more intense. More potent. Robin felt rocked to the very core of her being. Against her will, she felt herself surrendering to him. She felt herself forgetting to breathe. She felt herself weakening.</p><p>His mouth moved to her jaw, dropping small, soft kisses there. She sighed. She couldn\u2019t help it. Cole\u2019s touch was magic. Unable to stop herself, she turned her head, yearning for him to trace a row of kisses on the other side, as well. He complied.</p><p>Robin sighed again, her mind filled with dangerous, sensuous thoughts. It felt so good in his arms, so warm and safe ... but she knew the feeling was deceptive. She\u2019d seen him with another woman, one far more suited to him than she could ever be. For days she\u2019d been tormented by the realization that the woman in the restaurant was probably the one he spent his weekends with.</p><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t.\u201d Once more she pleaded, but even to her own ears the words held little conviction.</p> <p>In response, Cole brought a long slow series of feather-light kisses to her lips, effectively silencing any protest. Robin trembled, breathless.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you fighting me so hard?\u201d he whispered. His hands framed her face, his thumbs stroking her cheeks. They were damp and she hadn\u2019t even known she was crying.</p><p>Suddenly she heard footsteps bounding down the stairs. At the thought of Jeff finding her in Cole\u2019s arms, she abruptly broke away and turned to stare out the darkened window, hoping for a moment to compose herself.</p><p>Jeff burst into the room. \u201cDid you kiss her yet?\u201d he demanded. Not waiting for an answer, Jeff ran toward Robin and grabbed her by the hand. \u201cWell, Mom, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout ... what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Camden kissing you. He did, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to deny the whole thing, but she decided to brazen it out. \u201cYou want me to rate him? Like on a scale of one to ten?\u201d</p><p>Jeff blinked, uncertain. His questioning glance flew to Cole.</p><p>\u201cShe was a ten,\u201d Cole said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cA ... high seven,\u201d Robin returned.</p><p>\u201cA high seven!\u201d Jeff cried, casting her a disparaging look. He shook his head and walked over to Cole. \u201cShe\u2019s out of practice,\u201d he said confidingly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t know how to rate guys. Give her a little time and she\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJeff,\u201d Robin gasped, astounded to be having this kind of discussion with her son, let alone Cole, who was looking all too smug.</p><p>\u201cShe hardly goes out at all,\u201d Jeff added. \u201cMy mom\u2019s got this friend who arranges dates for her, and you wouldn\u2019t believe some of the guys she\u2019s been stuck with. One of them came to the door\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d Robin said sharply, \u201cthat\u2019s enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut one of us needs to tell him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Camden was just leaving,\u201d Robin said, glaring at her neighbor, daring him to contradict her.</p><p>\u201cI was? Oh, yeah. Your mom was about to walk me to the door, isn\u2019t that right, Robin?\u201d</p><p>She gaped at Cole as he reached for her hand and gently led her in the direction of the front door. Meekly she submitted, but not before she saw Jeff give Cole a thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Cole said, standing in the entryway, his hands heavy on her shoulders. \u201cI want to know what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWrong? Nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of Victoria, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria?\u201d she asked, already knowing that had to be the woman with him the day she\u2019d seen him at the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cYes. Victoria. I saw you practically hiding under your table, pretending you didn\u2019t notice me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... Why should I care?\u201d She hated the way her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cYes, why should you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. Couldn\u2019t answer him. She told herself it didn\u2019t matter that he was with another woman. Then again, it mattered more than she dared admit.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Robin lowered her gaze. If only he\u2019d stop holding her, stop touching her. Then she might be able to think clearly. \u201cYou looked right together. She was a perfect complement to you. She\u2019s tall and blond and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold as an iceberg. Victoria\u2019s a business associate\u2014we had lunch together. Nothing more. I find her as appealing as ... as dirty laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t explain. It\u2019s none of my business who you have lunch with or who you date or where you go every weekend or who you\u2019re with. Really. I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I don\u2019t know why I did. It was wrong of me\u2014very wrong. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re even talking about this.\u201d</p><p>Jeff poked his head out from the kitchen. \u201cHow are things going in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Robin said. \u201cI was just telling Cole how much we both appreciated his help with your pitching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was having real problems until Cole came along,\u201d Jeff confirmed. \u201cGirls are okay for some things, but serious baseball isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>Robin opened the front door. \u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered, her eyes avoiding Cole\u2019s, \u201cfor everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>She blushed, remembering the kisses they\u2019d shared. But before she could think of a witty reply, Cole brushed his lips across hers.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cole,\u201d Jeff said, hurrying to the front door. \u201cI\u2019ve got a baseball game Thursday night. Can you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d Cole answered, his eyes holding Robin\u2019s. Then he turned abruptly and strode out the door.</p><p>\u201cJeff, we\u2019re going to be late for the game if we don\u2019t leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Cole isn\u2019t home yet,\u201d Jeff protested. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably a very good explanation,\u201d Robin said calmly, although she was as disappointed as Jeff. \u201cHe could be tied up in traffic, or delayed at the office, or any one of a thousand other things. He wouldn\u2019t purposely not come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he forgot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t. Come on, sweetheart, let\u2019s get a move on. You\u2019ve got a game to pitch.\u201d The emphasis came on the last word. The first game of the season and Jeff had won the coveted position of first-string pitcher. Whether it was true or not, Jeff believed Cole\u2019s tutoring had given him an advantage over the competition. Jeff hadn\u2019t told him the news yet, keeping it a surprise for today.</p><p>\u201cWhen you do see Cole, don\u2019t say anything, all right?\u201d Jeff pleaded as they headed toward the car. \u201cI want to be the one who tells him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed,\u201d she said, holding up her hand. For good measure, she pantomimed zipping her mouth closed. She slid into the car and started the engine, but glanced in the rearview mirror several times, hoping Cole would somehow miraculously appear.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>The game was scheduled for the baseball diamond in Balboa Park, less than two miles from Robin\u2019s house. A set of bleachers had been arranged around the diamonds, and Robin climbed to the top. It gave her an excellent view of the field\u2014and of the parking area.</p><p>Cole knew the game was at Balboa Park, but he didn\u2019t know which diamond and there were several. Depending on how late he was, he could waste valuable time looking for the proper field.</p><p>The second inning had just begun when Heather Lawrence joined Robin. Robin smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Heather said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the score?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing nothing. It\u2019s the top of the second inning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the neighborhood Randy Johnson doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff\u2019s doing great. He managed to keep his cool when the first batter got a hit off his second pitch. I think I took it worse than Jeff did.\u201d</p><p>Heather grinned and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with me. Kelly played goalie for her soccer team last year, and every time the opposing team scored on her I took it like a bullet to the chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kelly now?\u201d</p><p>Heather motioned toward the other side of the field. The eight-year-old was leaning casually against a tall fir tree. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want Jeff to know she\u2019d come to watch him. Her game was over a few minutes ago. They lost, but this is her first year and just about everyone else\u2019s, too. The game was more a comedy of errors than anything.\u201d</p><p>Robin laughed. It was thoughtful of Heather to stop by and see how Jeff\u2019s team was doing.</p><p>Heather laced her fingers over her knees. \u201cJeff\u2019s been talking quite a bit about Cole Camden.\u201d She made the statement sound more like a question and kept her gaze focused on the playing field.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Robin wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. \u201cCole was kind enough to give Jeff a few pointers about pitching techniques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of pitching techniques, you two certainly seem to be hitting it off.\u201d</p><p>Heather was beginning to sound a lot like Angela, who drilled her daily about her relationship with Cole, offering advice and unsolicited suggestions.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how surprised I am at the changes I\u2019ve seen in Cole since you two moved in. Kelly\u2019s been wanting to play in that fort from the moment she heard about it, but it\u2019s only since Jeff came here that she was even allowed in Cole\u2019s yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been good for Jeff,\u201d Robin said, training her eyes on the game. Cole\u2019s relationship with her son forced Robin to examine his motives. He\u2019d lost a son, and there was bound to be a gaping hole in his heart. At first he hadn\u2019t allowed Jeff in his yard or approved of Blackie and Jeff\u2019s becoming friends. But without anything ever being said, all that had fallen to the wayside. Jeff played in Cole\u2019s yard almost every day, and with their neighbor\u2019s blessing. Jeff now had free access to the fort and often brought other neighborhood kids along. Apparently Cole had given permission. Did he consider Jeff a sort of substitute son? Robin shook off the thought.</p><p>\u201cJeff talks about Cole constantly,\u201d Heather said. \u201cIn fact, he told me this morning that Cole was coming to see him pitch. What happened? Did he get hung up at the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He must\u2019ve been delayed, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere he is! Over there.\u201d Heather broke in excitedly. \u201cYou know, in the two years we\u2019ve lived on Orchard Street, I can only recall talking to Cole a few times. He was always so standoffish. Except when we were both doing yard work, I never saw him, and if we did happen to meet we said hello and that was about it. The other day we bumped into each other at the grocery store and he actually smiled at me. I was stunned. I swear that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen that man smile. I honestly think you and Jeff are responsible for the change in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think you\u2019re crediting me with more than my due,\u201d Robin said, craning her head to look for Cole.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Heather argued. \u201cYou can\u2019t see the difference in him because you\u2019re new to the neighborhood, but everyone who\u2019s known him for any length of time will tell you he\u2019s like a different person.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jeff was sitting on the bench while his team was up at bat. Suddenly he leapt to his feet and waved energetically, as though he was flagging down a rescue vehicle. His face broke into a wide, eager smile. His coach must have said something to him because Jeff nodded and took off running toward the parking area.</p><p>Robin\u2019s gaze followed her son. Cole had indeed arrived. The tension eased out of her in a single breath. She hadn\u2019t realized how edgy she\u2019d been. In her heart she knew Cole would never purposely disappoint Jeff, but her son\u2019s anxiety had been as acute as her own.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Heather said, standing, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for stopping by.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlad to.\u201d Heather climbed down the bleachers. She paused when she got to the ground and wiggled her eyebrows expressively, then laughed merrily at Robin\u2019s frown.</p><p>Heather must have passed Cole on her way out, but Robin lost sight of them as Jeff raced on to the pitcher\u2019s mound for the bottom of the second inning. Even from this distance Robin could see that his eyes were full of happy excitement. He discreetly shot her a look and Robin made a V-for-victory sign, smiling broadly.</p><p>Cole vaulted up the bleachers and sat down beside her. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late. I was trapped in a meeting, and by the time I could get out to phone you I knew you\u2019d already left for the field. I would\u2019ve called your cell,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t have the number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff and I figured it had to be something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s pitching!\u201d Cole\u2019s voice rang with pride.</p> <p>\u201cHe claims it\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him believe that,\u201d Cole said, grinning, \u201cbut he\u2019s a natural athlete. All I did was teach him a little discipline and give him a means of practicing on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, according to Jeff you taught him everything he knows.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t miss the whole game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be others,\u201d she said, but she was grateful he\u2019d come when he had. From the time they\u2019d left the house, Robin had been tense and guarded. Cole could stand her up for any date, but disappointing Jeff was more than she could bear. Rarely had she felt this emotionally unsettled. And all because Cole had been late for a Balboa Park Baseball League game. It frightened her to realize how much Jeff was beginning to depend on him. And not just Jeff, either ....</p><p>\u201cThis is important to Jeff,\u201d Cole said as if reading her mind, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t disappoint him. If it had been anyone else it wouldn\u2019t have been as important. But Jeff matters\u2014\u201d his eyes locked with hers \u201c\u2014and so do you.\u201d</p> <p>Robin felt giddy with relief. For the first time since Lenny\u2019s tragic death, she understood how carefully, how completely, she\u2019d anesthetized her life, refusing to let in anyone or anything that might cause her or Jeff more pain. For years she\u2019d been drifting in a haze of denial and grief, refusing to acknowledge or deal with either. What Angela had said was true. Robin had dated infrequently and haphazardly, and kept any suitors at a safe distance.</p><p>For some reason, she hadn\u2019t been able to do that with Cole. Robin couldn\u2019t understand what was different or why; all she knew was that she was in serious danger of falling for this man, and falling hard. It terrified her ....</p><p>\u201cHave you and Jeff had dinner?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>Robin turned to face him, but it was a long moment before she grasped that he\u2019d asked her a question. He repeated it and she shook her head. \u201cJeff was too excited to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. There\u2019s an excellent Chinese restaurant close by. The three of us can celebrate after the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be nice,\u201d she whispered, thinking she should make some excuse to avoid this, and accepting almost immediately that she didn\u2019t want to avoid it at all.</p><p>\u201cCan I have some more pork-fried rice?\u201d Jeff asked.</p><p>Cole passed him the dish and Robin watched as her son heaped his plate high with a third helping.</p> <p>\u201cYou won,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cMom, I wish you\u2019d stop saying that. It\u2019s the fourth time you\u2019ve said it. I know we won,\u201d Jeff muttered, glancing at Cole as if to beg forgiveness for his mother, who was obviously suffering from an overdose of maternal pride.</p><p>\u201cBut Jeff, you were fantastic,\u201d she couldn\u2019t resist telling him.</p><p>\u201cThe whole team was fantastic.\u201d Jeff reached for what was left of the egg rolls and added a dollop of plum sauce to his plate.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea you were such a good hitter,\u201d Robin said, still impressed with her son\u2019s athletic ability. \u201cI knew you could pitch\u2014but two home runs! Oh, Jeff, I\u2019m so proud of you\u2014and everyone else.\u201d It was difficult to remember that Jeff was only one member of a team, and that his success was part of a larger effort.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure I played well, especially \u2018cause you were there, Cole.\u201d Jeff stretched his arm across the table again, this time reaching for the nearly empty platter of almond chicken.</p><p>As for herself, Robin couldn\u2019t down another bite. Cole had said the food at the Golden Wok was good, and he hadn\u2019t exaggerated. It was probably the best Chinese meal she\u2019d ever tasted. Jeff apparently thought so, too. The boy couldn\u2019t seem to stop eating.</p><p>It was while they were laughing over their fortune cookies that Robin heard bits and pieces of the conversation from the booth behind them.</p><p>\u201cI bet they\u2019re celebrating something special,\u201d an elderly gentleman remarked.</p><p>\u201cI think their little boy must have done well at the baseball game,\u201d his wife said.</p><p>Their little boy, Robin mused. The older couple dining directly behind them thought Cole and Jeff were father and son.</p><p>Robin\u2019s eyes flew to Cole, but if he had heard the comment he didn\u2019t give any sign.</p><p>\u201cHis mother and father are certainly proud of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a delight to see these young people so happy. A family should spend time together.\u201d</p><p>A family. The three of them looked like a family.</p><p>Once more Robin turned to Cole, but once more he seemed not to hear the comments. Or if he had, he ignored them.</p><p>But Cole must have sensed her scrutiny because his gaze found hers just then. Their eyes lingered without a hint of the awkwardness Robin had felt so often before.</p><p>Jeff chatted constantly on the ride home with Robin. Since she and Cole had both brought their cars, they drove home separately. They exchanged good-nights in the driveway and entered their own houses.</p><p>Jeff had some homework to finish and Robin ran a load of clothes through the washing machine. An hour later, after a little television and quick baths, they were both ready for bed. Robin tucked the blankets around Jeff\u2019s shoulders, although he protested that he was much too old for her to do that. But he didn\u2019t complain too loudly or too long.</p><p>\u201cNight, Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Mom. Don\u2019t let the bedbugs bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go all sentimental on me, okay?\u201d she teased as she turned off his light. He seemed to fall asleep the instant she left the room. She went downstairs to secure the house for the night, then headed up to her own bedroom. Once upstairs, she paused in her son\u2019s doorway and smiled gently. They\u2019d both had quite a day.</p><p>At about ten o\u2019clock, she was sitting up in bed reading a mystery when the phone rang. She answered quickly, always anxious about late calls. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still awake.\u201d It was Cole, and his voice affected her like a surge of electricity.</p><p>\u201cI ... was reading,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt suddenly occurred to me that we never had the chance to finish our conversation the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat conversation?\u201d Robin asked.</p><p>\u201cThe one at the front door ... that Jeff interrupted. Remind me to give that boy lessons in timing, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even remember what we were talking about.\u201d She settled back against the pillows, savoring the sound of his voice, enjoying the small intimacy of lying in bed, listening to him. Her eyes drifted shut.</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, you\u2019d just said something about how it isn\u2019t any of your business who I lunch with or spend my weekends with. I assume you think I\u2019m with a woman.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s eyes shot open. \u201cI can assure you, I don\u2019t think anything of the sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I should explain about the weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, Cole, it really isn\u2019t my business. It doesn\u2019t matter. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some property north of here, about forty acres,\u201d he said gently, despite her protests. \u201cThe land once belonged to my grandfather, and he willed it to me when he passed away a couple of years back. This house was part of the estate, as well. My father was born and raised here. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of my free time remodeling the old farmhouse. Sometime in the future I might move out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to think about Cole leaving the neighborhood, ever.</p><p>\u201cThe place still needs a lot of work, and I\u2019ve enjoyed doing it on my own. It\u2019s coming along well.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and a second later realized he couldn\u2019t see her action. \u201cIt sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there any other questions you\u2019d like to ask me?\u201d His voice was low and teasing.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she denied immediately.</p><p>\u201cThen would you be willing to admit you enjoy it when I kiss you? A high seven? Really? I think Jeff\u2019s right\u2014we need more practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ...\u201d Robin didn\u2019t know how to answer that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing,\u201d he said, and she could almost hear him smile.</p><p>Robin lifted the hair from her forehead with one hand. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I told you how much I enjoy kissing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease ... don\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. She didn\u2019t want him to tell her that. Every time he kissed her, it confused her more. Despite the sheltered feeling she experienced in his arms, something deep and fundamental inside her was afraid of loving again. No, terrified. She was terrified of falling in love with Cole. Terrified of what the future might hold.</p><p>\u201cThe first time shook me more than I care to admit,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember that Friday night we rented the movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to stay away from you afterward. For an entire week I avoided you.\u201d</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t answer. She couldn\u2019t. Lying back against the pillows, she stared at the ceiling as a sense of warmth enveloped her. A feeling of comfort ... of happiness.</p><p>There was a short silence, and in an effort to bring their discussion back to a less intimate\u2014less risky\u2014level, she said, \u201cThank you for dinner. Jeff had the time of his life.\u201d She had, too, but she couldn\u2019t find the courage to acknowledge it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going away this weekend to work on the property?\u201d</p><p>She had no right to ask him that, and was shocked at how easily the question emerged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d After another brief pause, he murmured, \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you went on a picnic and flew a kite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you consider going with me on Saturday afternoon? You and Jeff. The three of us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ... Jeff would love it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about you? Would you love it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be anything more to say, and Robin ended the conversation. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Jeff in the morning. He\u2019ll be thrilled. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood night, Robin.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly. He said her name the way she\u2019d always dreamed a man would, softly, with a mixture of excitement and need. \u201cGood night, Cole.\u201d</p><p>For a long time after they\u2019d hung up Robin lay staring at her bedroom walls. When she did flick off her light, she fell asleep as quickly as Jeff seemed to have. She woke about midnight, surprised to find the sheets all twisted as if she\u2019d tossed and turned frantically. The bedspread had slipped onto the floor, and the top sheet was wound around her legs, trapping her.</p><p>Sitting up, she untangled her legs and brushed the curls from her face, wondering what had caused her restlessness. She didn\u2019t usually wake abruptly like this.</p><p>She slid off the bed, found her slippers and went downstairs for a glass of milk.</p><p>It was while she was sitting at the table that it came to her. Her hand stilled. Her heartbeat accelerated. The couple in the Chinese restaurant. Robin had overheard them and she was certain Cole had, too.</p> <p>Their little boy. A family.</p><p>Cole had lost a son. From the little Robin had learned, Cole\u2019s son had been about the same age Jeff was now when he\u2019d died. First divorce, and then death.</p><p>Suddenly it all made sense. A painful kind of sense. A panicky kind of sense. The common ground between them wasn\u2019t their backyards, but the fact that they were both victims.</p><p>Cole was trying to replace the family that had been so cruelly taken from him.</p><p>Robin was just as guilty. She\u2019d been so caught up in the tide of emotion and attraction that she\u2019d refused to recognize what was staring her in the face. She\u2019d ignored her own suspicions and fears, shoving them aside.</p><p>She and Cole were both hurting, needy people.</p><p>But once the hurt was assuaged, once the need had been satisfied, Cole would discover what Robin had known from the beginning. They were completely different people with little, if anything, in common.</p><p>Six</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean you want to meet my cousin?\u201d Angela demanded, glancing up from her desk, a shocked look on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been after me for weeks to go out with Fred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank. Yes, I have, but that was B.C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB.C.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore Cole. What happened with you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pigs have wings,\u201d Angela said with more than a trace of sarcasm. She stood up and walked around to the front of her desk, leaning against one corner while she folded her arms and stared unblinkingly at Robin.</p><p>Robin knew it would do little good to try to disguise her feelings. She\u2019d had a restless night and was convinced it showed. No doubt her eyes were glazed; they ached. Her bones ached. But mostly her heart ached. Arranging a date with Angela\u2019s cousin was a sure indication of her distress.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I heard, Cole was supposed to attend Jeff\u2019s baseball game with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Robin walked to her own desk and reached for the cup of coffee she\u2019d brought upstairs with her. Peeling off the plastic lid, she cautiously took a sip.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff pitched and he played a fabulous game,\u201d Robin said, hoping her friend wouldn\u2019t question her further.</p><p>Angela continued to stare at Robin. Good grief, Robin thought, the woman had eyes that could cut through solid rock.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Robin snapped when she couldn\u2019t stand her friend\u2019s scrutiny any longer. She took another sip of her coffee and nearly scalded her lips. If the rest of her day followed the pattern set that morning, she might as well go home now. The temptation to climb back into bed and hide her head under the pillow was growing stronger every minute.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened with Cole,\u201d Angela said again.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I already told you he was at Jeff\u2019s baseball game. What more do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is tell me what went on last night,\u201d Angela said slowly, carefully enunciating each word as though speaking to someone who was hard of hearing.</p><p>\u201cBefore or after Jeff\u2019s game?\u201d Robin pulled out her chair and sat down.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Robin gave up. Gesturing weakly with her hands, she shrugged, took a deep breath and poured out the whole story in one huge rush. \u201cCole was held up at the office in a meeting, so we didn\u2019t meet at the house the way we\u2019d planned. Naturally Jeff was disappointed, but we decided that whatever was keeping Cole wasn\u2019t his fault, and we left for Balboa Park without him. Cole arrived at the bottom of the second inning, just as Jeff was ready to pitch. Jeff only allowed three hits the entire game, and scored two home runs himself. Afterward Cole took us all out for Chinese food at a fabulous restaurant I\u2019ve never heard of but one you and I will have to try sometime. Our next raise, okay? Later Cole phoned and asked to take Jeff and me on a picnic Saturday. I think we\u2019re going to Golden Gate Park because he also talked about flying kites.\u201d She paused, dragged in a fresh gulp of air and gave Angela a look that said \u201cmake something out of that if you can!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Angela said after a lengthy pause.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Robin wasn\u2019t up to explaining things, so if Angela really didn\u2019t understand, that was just too bad. She only knew that she was dangerously close to letting her emotions take charge of her life. She was becoming increasingly attracted to a man who could well be trying to replace the son he\u2019d lost. Robin needed to find a way to keep from following her heart, which was moving at breakneck speed straight into Cole\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cWill you introduce me to Frank or not?\u201d she asked a second time, strengthening her voice and her conviction.</p><p>Angela was still watching her with those diamond-cutting eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sure!\u201d Robin echoed, dismayed. \u201cFor weeks you\u2019ve been spouting his virtues. According to you, this cousin is as close to a god as a human being can get. He works hard, buys municipal bonds, goes to church regularly and flosses his teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about,\u201d Robin muttered. \u201cI made up the part about flossing his teeth. Yet when I ask to meet this paragon of limitless virtue, you say you\u2019re not sure you want to introduce me. I would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am pleased,\u201d Angela said, frowning, \u201cbut I\u2019m also concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your job to be concerned. All you have to do is call Fred and let him know I\u2019m available Saturday evening for drinks or dinner or a movie or whatever. I\u2019ll let him decide what he\u2019s most comfortable with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Frank, and I thought you said you were going on a picnic with Cole on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Robin turned on her computer, prepared to check several columns of figures. If she looked busy and suitably nonchalant, it might prompt Angela to agree. \u201cJeff and I will be with Cole earlier in the day. I\u2019ll simply make sure we\u2019re back before late afternoon, so there\u2019s no reason to worry.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s forehead puckered. \u201cI am worried. I can\u2019t help being worried. Honestly, Robin, I\u2019ve never seen you like this. You\u2019re so ... so determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been determined,\u201d Robin countered, glancing up from the computer.</p><p>\u201cOh, I agree one hundred percent,\u201d Angela said with a heavy sigh, \u201cbut not when it comes to anything that has to do with men. My thirteen-year-old niece has more savvy with the opposite sex than you do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, look how high my kite is,\u201d Jeff hollered as his box kite soared toward the heavens.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s touching the sky!\u201d Robin shouted, and laughed with her son as he tugged and twisted the string. Despite all her misgivings about her relationship with Cole, she was thoroughly enjoying the afternoon. At first, she\u2019d been positive the day would turn into a disaster. She was sure Cole would take one look at her and know she was going out with another man that evening. She was equally sure she\u2019d blurt it out if he didn\u2019t immediately guess.</p><p>Cole had been as excited as Jeff about the picnic and kite-flying expedition. The two of them had been fussing with the kites for hours\u2014buying, building and now flying them. For her part, Robin was content to soak up the sunshine.</p><p>The weather couldn\u2019t have been more cooperative. The sky was a brilliant blue and the wind was perfect. Sailboats scudding on the choppy green waters added dashes of bright color.</p><p>In contrast to all the beauty surrounding her, Robin\u2019s heart was troubled. Watching Cole, so patient and gentle with her son, filled her with contradictory emotions. Part of her wanted to thank him. Thank him for the smile that lit up Jeff\u2019s face. Thank him for throwing open the shades and easing her toward the light. And part of her wanted to shut her eyes and run for cover.</p><p>\u201cMom, look!\u201d Jeff cried as the kite whipped and kicked in the wind. Blackie raced at his side as the sleek red-and-blue kite sliced through the sky, then dipped sharply and crashed toward the ground at heart-stopping speed, only to be caught at the last second and lifted higher and higher.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking, I\u2019m looking!\u201d Robin shouted back. She\u2019d never seen Jeff happier. Pride and joy shone from his face, and Robin was moved almost to tears.</p><p>Cole stood behind Jeff, watching the kite. One hand rested on the boy\u2019s shoulder, the other shaded his eyes as he gazed up at the sky. They laughed, and once more Robin was struck by the mingling of their voices. One mature and measured, the other young and excited. Both happy.</p><p>A few minutes later, Cole jogged over to Robin\u2019s blanket and sat down beside her. He did nothing more than smile at her, but she felt an actual jolt.</p><p>Cole stretched out and leaned back on his elbows, grinning at the sun. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I laughed so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two seem to be enjoying this,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>If Cole noticed anything awry, he didn\u2019t comment. She\u2019d managed not to tell him about the date with Angela\u2019s cousin; she certainly didn\u2019t want him to think she was trying to make him jealous. That wasn\u2019t the evening\u2019s purpose at all. Actually she wasn\u2019t sure what she hoped to accomplish by dating Fred ... Frank. She mentally shouted the name five times. Why did she keep calling him Fred? She didn\u2019t know that any more than she knew why she was going out with him. On the morning she\u2019d talked Angela into making the arrangements for her, it had seemed a matter of life and death. Now she only felt confused and regretful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJeff says you\u2019ve got a date this evening.\u201d</p><p>So much for her worry that she might blurt it out herself, Robin thought. She glanced at Cole. He might\u2019ve been referring to the weather for all the emotion revealed in his voice.</p><p>\u201cA cousin of a good friend. She\u2019s been after me for months to meet Frank\u2014we\u2019re having dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould this be the Frank you weren\u2019t going out with and that was final?\u201d</p> <p>Robin stared at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cYou answered the phone with that when I called to inquire about Blackie. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes ...\u201d Suddenly she felt an intense need to justify her actions. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Angela\u2019s been talking about him for so long and it seemed like the right thing to do. He\u2019s apparently very nice and Angela\u2019s been telling me he\u2019s a lot of fun and I didn\u2019t think it would hurt to meet him ....\u201d Once she got started, Robin couldn\u2019t seem to stop explaining.</p><p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Cole said, his eyes tender. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me any explanations.\u201d</p><p>She instantly grew silent. He was right, she knew that, yet she couldn\u2019t help feeling guilty. She was making a terrible mess of this.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the jealous type,\u201d Cole informed her matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to make you jealous,\u201d she returned stiffly.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Cole said and shrugged. His gaze moved from her to Jeff, who was jogging across the grass. Blackie was beside him, barking excitedly.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t asked, but she felt obliged to explain who\u2019d be looking after her son while she was out. \u201cJeff\u2019s going to the movies with Heather and Kelly Lawrence while I\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>Cole didn\u2019t say anything. All he did was smile. It was the same smile he\u2019d flashed at her earlier. The same devastating, wickedly charming smile.</p><p>He seemed to be telling her she could dine with a thousand different men and it wouldn\u2019t disturb him in the least. As he\u2019d said, he wasn\u2019t the jealous type. Great. This was exactly the way she\u2019d wanted him to respond, wasn\u2019t it? She could date a thousand different men, because Cole didn\u2019t care about her. He cared about her son.</p> <p>\u201cLet me know when you want to leave,\u201d he said with infuriating self-assurance. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to be late.\u201d</p><p>On that cue, Robin checked her watch and was surprised to note that it was well past four. They\u2019d been having so much fun, the day had simply slipped away. When she looked up, she found Cole studying her expectantly. \u201cIt\u2019s ... I\u2019m not meeting Frank until later,\u201d she said, answering his unspoken question evasively while she gathered up the remains of their picnic.</p><p>An hour later, they decided to leave Golden Gate Park. Jeff and Cole loaded up the kites, as well as the picnic cooler, in the back of Cole\u2019s car. It took them another hour to get back to Glen Park because of the traffic, which made Robin\u2019s schedule even tighter. But that was hardly Cole\u2019s fault\u2014it wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d arranged for an accident on the freeway.</p><p>Cole and Jeff chatted easily for most of the ride home. When they finally arrived at the house, both Robin and Jeff helped Cole unload the car. Blackie\u2019s barking only added to the confusion.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019d better get inside,\u201d Robin said, her eyes briefly meeting Cole\u2019s. She felt awkward all of a sudden, wishing Jeff was standing there as a barrier, instead of busily carrying things onto Cole\u2019s porch.</p><p>\u201cWe had a great time,\u201d she added self-consciously. She couldn\u2019t really blame her nervousness on Cole; he\u2019d been the perfect companion all day. \u201cThank you for the picnic.\u201d</p><p>Jeff joined them, his eyes narrowing as he looked at Cole. \u201cAre you gonna let her do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Robin asked.</p> <p>\u201cGo out with that other man,\u201d Jeff said righteously, inviting Cole to leap into the argument. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re letting her get away with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff. This isn\u2019t something we should be discussing with Mr. Camden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he murmured with a sigh. \u201cBut I think you\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d He cast a speculative glance in Cole\u2019s direction. \u201cBoth of you,\u201d he mumbled under his breath and headed for the house.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the wonderful afternoon, Cole,\u201d Robin said again.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he responded, hands in his pockets, his stance relaxed. \u201cHave a good time with Frank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I will,\u201d she said, squinting at him suspiciously just before she turned toward the house. Darn it, she actually felt guilty! There wasn\u2019t a single solitary reason she should feel guilty for agreeing to this dinner date with Angela\u2019s cousin, yet she did. Cole must\u2019ve known it, too, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have made that remark about having a good time. Oh, he knew all right.</p><p>As Robin was running the bath, Jeff raced up the stairs. \u201cMom, I need money for the movie.\u201d He thrust her purse into her hands. \u201cHow much are you giving me for goodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, popcorn, pop, a couple of candy bars. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff, you haven\u2019t stopped eating all day. What about the two hot dogs I just fixed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ate them, but that was fifteen minutes ago. I\u2019m hungry again.\u201d</p><p>Robin handed him fifteen dollars, prepared for an argument. That amount should be enough to pay his way into the movie and supply him with popcorn and a soda. Anything beyond that he could do without.</p><p>Jeff took the money from her and slowly shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s it, kid,\u201d she said in a firm voice.</p><p>\u201cDid I complain?\u201d Bright blue eyes gazed innocently back at her.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. I could see it in your face.\u201d</p><p>Jeff was ready to leave a few minutes later, just as Robin was getting dressed. He stood outside her bedroom door and shouted that Kelly and her mom were there to pick him up.</p><p>\u201cHave fun. I won\u2019t be any later than ten-thirty,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I wait for you over at Cole\u2019s after the movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Robin\u2019s heart skidded to a dead stop at the suggestion. The last person she wanted to face at the end of this evening was Cole Camden. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask him, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... but I\u2019m not all that excited about going to Kelly\u2019s. I\u2019m there every day, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, I\u2019m sorry. I promise I won\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure I can\u2019t go over to Cole\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeffrey Leonard Masterson, don\u2019t you dare bother Cole. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. She rarely used that tone with him, but she didn\u2019t have the time or energy to argue about this.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d he said with an exaggerated sigh. \u201cBut could you make it home by ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to do anything stupid like fall asleep in front of Kelly,\u201d he whispered heatedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>Glancing at her clock radio, she gasped at the time. She was running late. From the moment she\u2019d made the arrangements to meet Frank, she hadn\u2019t given the reality of this evening much thought. Just forcing herself to go through with it had depleted her of energy.</p><p>Robin had always hated situations like this. Always. She was going to a strange restaurant, meeting a strange man, and for what? She didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Tucking her feet into her pumps, Robin hurried to the bathroom to spray on a little perfume. Not much, just enough to give herself some confidence. She rushed down the stairs and reached for her purse.</p><p>Her hand was on the doorknob when the phone rang. For a moment, Robin intended to ignore it. It was probably for Jeff. But what if the call was from her parents? Or Frank\u2014calling to cancel? Ridiculous though it was, each ring sounded more urgent than the last. She\u2019d have to answer or she\u2019d spend all evening wondering who it was. Muttering under her breath, she dashed into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said impatiently.</p><p>At first there was no response. \u201cRobin, it\u2019s Cole.\u201d He sounded nothing like himself. \u201cI lied.\u201d With that the line was abruptly disconnected.</p><p>Robin held the receiver away from her ear and stared at it for several seconds. He\u2019d lied? About what? Good heavens, why had he even phoned? To tell her he\u2019d lied.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time to phone him back and ask what he\u2019d meant.</p><p>\u201cWould you care for something to drink?\u201d Frank Eberle asked, glancing over the wine list.</p><p>\u201cNothing, thanks,\u201d Robin said. Frank had turned out to be a congenial sort, which was a pleasant surprise. He was quite attractive, with light blue eyes and a thick head of distinguished-looking salt-and-pepper hair. Angela had once mentioned he was \u201ca little bit\u201d shy, which had panicked Robin since she was a whole lot shy, at least around men. The way she\u2019d figured it, they\u2019d stare at each other most of the night, with no idea what to say. However, they did have Angela in common. Whereas with Cole, all she shared was\u2014</p><p>Her thoughts came to an abrupt halt. She refused to think about her neighbor or his last-minute phone call. She balked at the idea of dining with one man while wistfully longing for another\u2014which was exactly what she was doing.</p><p>Robin studied the menu, pretending to decide between the prime-rib special and the fresh halibut. But the entire time she stared at the menu, she was racking her brain for a topic of conversation.</p><p>Frank saved her the trouble. \u201cFor once,\u201d he said, \u201cAngela didn\u2019t exaggerate. You\u2019re a delightful surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d It was amusing to hear him echo her own reaction.</p><p>Frank nodded, his smile reserved. \u201cWhen Angie phoned earlier in the week, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. She keeps wanting me to date her friends. And to hear her talk, she\u2019s close friends with dozens of gorgeous women all interested in meeting me.\u201d</p><p>Robin grinned. \u201cShe should run a dating service. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times she\u2019s matched me up with someone, or tried to, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a comfortable person to be around. I could sense that right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I ... wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, either. Angela\u2019s raved about you for weeks, wanting to get the two of us together.\u201d Robin glanced from the menu to her companion, then back again. She felt the same misgivings every time she agreed to one of these arranged dates.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been divorced six months now,\u201d Frank volunteered, \u201cbut after fourteen years of married life, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get accustomed to dating again.\u201d</p><p>Robin found herself agreeing. \u201cI know what you mean. It all seems so awkward, doesn\u2019t it? When Lenny and I were dating, I was in high school, and there was so little to worry about. We knew what we wanted and knew what we had to do to get there.\u201d</p><p>Frank sent her a smile. \u201cNow that we\u2019re older and\u2014\u201d he paused \u201c\u2014I hesitate to use the word wiser ....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMore sophisticated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, more sophisticated,\u201d Frank repeated. His hand closed around the water glass. \u201cLife seems so complicated now. I\u2019ve been out of the swing of things for so long ....\u201d</p><p>The waitress came for their order then, and from that point on the evening went smoothly. The feeling of kinship she felt with Frank astonished Robin. He was obviously at ease with her, too. Before she knew it, Robin found herself telling him about Cole.</p><p>\u201cHe sounds like the kind of guy most women would leap off a bridge to meet.\u201d</p> <p>Robin nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s wonderful to Jeff, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wife and son.\u201d</p><p>Frank\u2019s mouth sagged open. \u201cHe\u2019s married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas,\u201d she rushed to explain. \u201cFrom what I understand, his wife left him and sometime later his son died.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s tough,\u201d Frank said, picking up his coffee. \u201cBut that was years ago, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... don\u2019t know. Cole\u2019s never told me these things himself. In fact, he\u2019s never mentioned either his wife or his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never mentioned them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cI heard it from a neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s bothering you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The question was sobering. Subconsciously, from the moment Robin had learned of Cole\u2019s loss, she\u2019d been waiting for him to tell her. Waiting for him to trust her enough.</p> <p>Frank and Robin lingered over coffee, chatting about politics and the economy and a number of other stimulating topics. But the question about Cole refused to fade from her mind.</p><p>They parted outside the restaurant and Frank kissed her cheek, but they were both well aware they wouldn\u2019t be seeing each other again. Their time together had been a brief respite. It had helped Frank deal with his loneliness and helped Robin understand what was troubling her about Cole.</p><p>The first thing Robin noticed when she pulled into her driveway was that Cole\u2019s house was dark. Dark and silent. Lonely. So much of her life had been like that\u2014before she\u2019d met him.</p><p>She needed to talk to him. She wanted to ask about his phone call. She wanted to ask about his wife and the son he\u2019d lost. But the timing was all wrong.</p><p>For a long moment Robin sat alone in her car, feeling both sad and disappointed.</p><p>Heather greeted her with a smile and a finger pressed to her lips. \u201cBoth kids were exhausted. They fell asleep in the living room almost as soon as we got back.\u201d</p><p>After Jeff\u2019s busy day, she could hardly believe he\u2019d lasted through the movie. \u201cI hope he wasn\u2019t cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least,\u201d Heather assured her.</p> <p>Robin yawned, completely exhausted. She wanted nothing more than to escape to her room and sleep until noon the following day.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of coffee before you go?\u201d Heather asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Robin had been blessed with good neighbors. Heather on her right and Cole on her left ....</p><p>Together Robin and Heather woke Jeff, who grumbled about his mother being late. He was too drowsy to realize it was only nine-thirty or that she\u2019d returned ahead of schedule.</p><p>After telling Heather a little about her evening, Robin guided her son across the yard and into the house. She walked upstairs with him and answered the slurred questions he struggled to ask between wide, mouth-stretching yawns.</p><p>Tugging back his quilt, Robin urged him into his bed. Jeff kicked off his shoes and reached for the quilt. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d slept in his clothes and it probably wouldn\u2019t be the last.</p><p>Smiling to herself, Robin moved quietly down the stairs.</p><p>On impulse, she paused in the kitchen and picked up the phone. When Cole answered on the first ring, she swallowed a gasp of surprise.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said a second time.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you lie about?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Without a further word, he hung up.</p><p>A minute later, Cole was standing at her front door, hands in his back pockets. He stared at her as if it had been months since they\u2019d seen each other.</p><p>\u201cYou win,\u201d he said, edging his way in.</p><p>\u201cWin what? The door prize?\u201d she asked, controlling her amusement with difficulty.</p><p>Not bothering to answer her, Cole stalked to the kitchen, where he sank down in one of the pine chairs. \u201cDid you have a good time?\u201d</p><p>She sat down across from him. \u201cI really did. Frank\u2019s a very pleasant, very caring man. We met at the Higher Ground\u2014that\u2019s a cute little restaurant close to the BART station and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout your phone call earlier. You said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Frank?\u201d</p><p>Cole gave her a look that suggested she have her intelligence tested.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, he\u2019s very pleasant. Divorced and lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he do for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works for the city, I think. We didn\u2019t get around to talking about our careers.\u201d No doubt Cole would be shocked if he knew she\u2019d spent the greater part of the evening discussing her relationship with him!</p><p>\u201cWhat did you talk about, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole, honestly, I don\u2019t think we should discuss my evening with Frank. Would you like some coffee? I\u2019ll make decaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to see him again?\u201d</p><p>Robin ignored the question. Instead she left the table and began to make coffee. She was concentrating so carefully on her task that she didn\u2019t notice Cole was directly behind her. She turned\u2014and found herself gazing into the darkest, most confused and frustrated pair of eyes she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, startled. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were so close.\u201d</p><p>His hands gripped her shoulders. \u201cWhy did you go out with him?\u201d</p><p>Surely that wasn\u2019t distress she heard in Cole\u2019s voice? Not after all that casual indifference this afternoon. She frowned, bewildered by the pain she saw in his eyes. And she finally understood. Contrary to everything he\u2019d claimed, Cole was jealous. Really and truly jealous.</p><p>\u201cDid he kiss you?\u201d he asked with an urgency, an intensity, she\u2019d never heard in his voice before.</p><p>Robin stared, frozen by the stark need she read in him.</p><p>Cole\u2019s finger rested on her mouth. \u201cDid Frank kiss you?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She shook her head and the motion brushed his finger across her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to, though, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Cole asked with a brooding frown.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t kiss me.\u201d She was finally able to say the words. She couldn\u2019t kiss Frank or anyone else. The only man she wanted to kiss and be kissed by was the man looking down at her now. The man whose lips were descending on hers ....</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cSo, did you like this guy you had dinner with last night?\u201d Jeff asked, keeping his eyes on his bowl of cold cereal.</p><p>\u201cHe was nice,\u201d Robin answered, pouring herself a cup of coffee and joining him at the table. They\u2019d slept late and were spending a lazy Sunday morning enjoying their breakfast before going to the eleven o\u2019clock service at church.</p><p>Jeff hesitated, his spoon poised in front of him. \u201cIs he nicer than Cole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole\u2019s ... nicer,\u201d Robin admitted reluctantly. Nice and nicer weren\u2019t terms she would\u2019ve used to describe the differences between Frank and Cole, but in her son\u2019s ten-year-old mind they made perfect sense.</p><p>A smile quivered at the edges of Jeff\u2019s mouth. \u201cI saw you two smooching last night,\u201d he said, grinning broadly.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Robin demanded\u2014a ridiculous question. It could only have happened when Cole had come over to talk to her. He\u2019d confessed how jealous he\u2019d been of Frank and how he\u2019d struggled with the emotion and felt like a fool. Robin had been convinced she was the one who\u2019d behaved like an idiot. Before either of them could prevent it, they were in each other\u2019s arms, seeking and granting reassurance.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was asleep, but I heard Cole talking and I wanted to ask him what he was gonna do about you and this other guy, so I came downstairs and saw you two with your faces stuck together.\u201d</p><p>The boy certainly had a way with words.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t look like you minded, either. Cole and me talked about girls once, and he said they aren\u2019t much when they\u2019re ten, but they get a whole lot more interesting later on. He said girls are like green apples. At first they\u2019re all sour and make your lips pucker, but a little while later they\u2019re real good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Robin muttered, not at all sure she liked being compared to an apple.</p><p>\u201cBut when I got downstairs I didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Jeff said, \u201cbecause, well, you know.\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded and sipped her coffee in an effort to hide her discomfort.</p><p>Jeff picked up his cereal bowl and drank the remainder of the milk in loud gulps. He wiped the back of his hand across his lips. \u201cI suppose this means you\u2019re going to have a baby now.\u201d</p><p>Robin was too horrified to speak. The swallow of coffee got stuck in her throat and she started choking. Trying to help her breathe, Jeff pounded her back with his fist, which only added to her misery.</p><p>By the time she caught her breath, tears were streaking down her face.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, Mom?\u201d Jeff asked, his eyes wide with concern. He rushed into the bathroom and returned with a wad of tissue.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered, wiping her face. It took her a moment or two to regain her composure. This was a talk she\u2019d planned on having with him soon\u2014but not quite yet. \u201cJeff, listen ... kissing doesn\u2019t make babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t? But I thought ... I hoped ... You mean you won\u2019t be having a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... Not from kissing,\u201d she whispered, taking in deep breaths to stabilize her pulse.</p><p>\u201cI suppose the next thing you\u2019re gonna tell me is we\u2019ll have to save up for a baby the way we did for the house and now the fence before we get me a dog.\u201d</p><p>This conversation was getting too complicated. \u201cNo, we wouldn\u2019t have to save for a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the holdup?\u201d her son demanded. \u201cI like the idea of being a big brother. I didn\u2019t think much about it until we moved here. Then when we were having dinner at the Chinese restaurant I heard this grandma and grandpa in the booth next to us talking, and they were saying neat things about us being a family. That\u2019s when I started thinking about babies and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d Robin said, rubbing her hands together as she collected her thoughts. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that. Before there\u2019s a baby, there should be a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course,\u201d Jeff returned, looking at her as if she\u2019d insulted his intelligence. \u201cYou\u2019d have to marry Cole first, but that\u2019d be all right with me. You like him, don\u2019t you? You must like him or you wouldn\u2019t be kissing him that way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Robin sighed. Of course she liked Cole, but it wasn\u2019t that simple. Unfortunately she wasn\u2019t sure she could explain it in terms a ten-year-old could understand. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember ever seeing you kiss a guy like that. You looked real serious. And when I was sneaking back up the stairs, I heard him ask you to have dinner alone with him tonight and that seemed like a real good sign.\u201d</p><p>The next time Cole kissed her, Robin thought wryly, they\u2019d have to scurry into a closet. The things that child came up with ...</p><p>\u201cYou are going to dinner with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem? I\u2019ll ask him to marry you if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff!\u201d she cried, leaping to her feet. \u201cAbsolutely not! That\u2019s between Cole and me, and neither of us would appreciate any assistance from you. Is that clearly understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he sighed, but he didn\u2019t look too pleased. He reached for a piece of toast, shredding it into thirds. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to marry him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? Cole\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to us.\u201d</p><p>Her son was staring at her intently, his baseball cap twisted around to the back of his head. Now that she had his full attention, Robin couldn\u2019t find the words to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than you realize, sweetie.\u201d She made a show of glancing at the clock. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s time to change and get ready for church.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded and rushed up the stairs. Robin followed at a much slower pace, grateful to put an end to this difficult and embarrassing subject.</p><p>The minute they were home from the service, Jeff grabbed his baseball mitt. \u201cJimmy Wallach and I are going to the school yard to practice hitting balls. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Robin said absently. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going grocery shopping, so if I\u2019m not home when you get back you know what to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Robin Masterson, aren\u2019t you?\u201d a tall middle-aged woman asked as she maneuvered her grocery cart alongside Robin\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Robin said. The other woman\u2019s eyes were warm and her smile friendly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you must be\u2014I\u2019ve seen you from a distance. I\u2019m Joyce Wallach. Jimmy and Jeff have become good friends. In fact, they\u2019re at the school yard now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Robin said, pleased to make the other woman\u2019s acquaintance. They\u2019d talked on the phone several times, and she\u2019d met Joyce\u2019s husband once, when Jimmy had spent the night. The boys had wanted to play on the same baseball team and were disappointed when they\u2019d been assigned to different teams. It had been Jimmy who\u2019d told Jeff about the death of Cole\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to invite you to the house for coffee,\u201d Joyce went on to say, \u201cbut I started working parttime and I can\u2019t seem to get myself organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d Working full-time, keeping up with Jeff and her home was about all Robin could manage herself. She didn\u2019t know how other mothers were able to accomplish so much.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a place to sit down here,\u201d Joyce said, and her eyes brightened at the idea. \u201cDo you have time to chat now?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded. \u201cSure. I\u2019ve been wanting to meet you, too.\u201d The Wallachs lived two streets over, and Robin fully approved of Jimmy as a friend for Jeff. He and Kelly had become friends, too, but her ten-year-old son wasn\u2019t as eager to admit being buddies with a girl. Kelly was still a green apple in Jeff\u2019s eye, but the time would come when he\u2019d appreciate having her next door.</p><p>\u201cI understand Jeff\u2019s quite the baseball player,\u201d Joyce said at the self-service counter.</p><p>Robin smiled. She poured herself a plastic cup of iced tea and paid for it. \u201cJeff really loves baseball. He was disappointed he couldn\u2019t play with Jimmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey separate the teams according to the kid\u2019s year of birth. Jimmy\u2019s birthday is in January so he\u2019s with another group.\u201d She frowned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t really make much sense, does it?\u201d She chuckled, and Robin couldn\u2019t help responding to the soft infectious sound of Joyce\u2019s laughter. She found herself laughing, too.</p><p>They pulled out chairs at one of the small tables in the supermarket\u2019s deli section.</p><p>\u201cI feel like throwing my arms around you,\u201d Joyce said with a grin. \u201cI saw Cole Camden at Balboa Park the other day and I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. It was like seeing him ten years ago, the way he used to be.\u201d She glanced at Robin. \u201cJeff was with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole came to his first game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She nodded slowly, as if that explained it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s told you, but there\u2019s been a marked difference in Cole lately. I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to see it. Cole\u2019s gone through so much heartache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole\u2019s been wonderful for Jeff,\u201d Robin said, then swallowed hard. She felt a renewed stab of fear that Cole was more interested in the idea of having a son than he was in a relationship with her.</p><p>\u201cI have the feeling you\u2019ve both been wonderful for him,\u201d Joyce added.</p><p>Robin\u2019s smile was losing its conviction. She lowered her eyes and studied the lemon slice floating in her tea.</p><p>\u201cMy husband and I knew Cole quite well before the divorce,\u201d Joyce went on to say. \u201cLarry, that\u2019s my husband, and Cole played golf every Saturday afternoon. Then Jennifer decided she wanted out of the marriage, left him and took Bobby. Cole really tried to save that marriage, but the relationship had been in trouble for a long time. Cole doted on his son, though\u2014he would\u2019ve done anything to spare Bobby the trauma of a divorce. Jennifer, however\u2014\u201d Joyce halted abruptly, apparently realizing how much she\u2019d said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to launch into all of this\u2014it\u2019s ancient history. I just wanted you to know how pleased I am to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Since Cole had told her shockingly little of his past, Robin had to bite her tongue not to plead with Joyce to continue. Instead, she bowed her head and said, \u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you, too.\u201d</p><p>Then she looked up with a smile as Joyce said, \u201cJimmy\u2019s finally got the friend he\u2019s always wanted. There are so few boys his age around here. I swear my son was ready to set off fireworks the day Jeff registered at the school and he learned you lived only two blocks away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff claimed he couldn\u2019t live in a house that\u2019s surrounded by girls.\u201d Robin shook her head with a mock grimace. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t met Jimmy, I might\u2019ve had a mutiny on my hands.\u201d</p><p>Joyce\u2019s face relaxed into another warm smile. She was energetic and animated, gesturing freely with her hands as she spoke. Robin felt as if she\u2019d known and liked Jimmy\u2019s mother for years.</p><p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been much turnover in this neighborhood. We\u2019re a close-knit group, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve discovered. Heather Lawrence is a real sweetie. I wish I had more time to get to know her. And Cole, well ... I realize that huge house has been in his family forever, but I half expected him to move out after Jennifer and Bobby were killed.\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed was punctuated by Robin\u2019s soft, involuntary gasp. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I couldn\u2019t understand why Cole\u2019s still living in the house on Orchard Street. Is that what you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, after that\u2014about Jennifer and Bobby.\u201d It was difficult for Robin to speak. Each word felt as if it had been scraped from the roof of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI assumed you knew they\u2019d both been killed,\u201d Joyce said, her eyes full of concern. \u201cI mean, I thought for sure that Cole had told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew about Bobby. Jimmy said something to Jeff, who told me, but I didn\u2019t have any idea that Jennifer had died, too. Heather Lawrence told me about the divorce, but she didn\u2019t say anything about Cole\u2019s wife dying ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Heather knows. She moved into the neighborhood long after the divorce, and Cole\u2019s pretty close-mouthed about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did all this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive or six years ago now. It was terribly tragic,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cJust thinking about it makes my heart ache all over again. I don\u2019t mean to be telling tales, but if there\u2019s any blame to be placed I\u2019m afraid it would fall on Jennifer. She wasn\u2019t the kind of woman who\u2019s easy to know or like. I shouldn\u2019t speak ill of the dead, and I don\u2019t mean to be catty, but Jen did Cole a favor when she left him. Naturally, he didn\u2019t see it that way\u2014he was in love with his wife and crazy about his son. Frankly, I think Cole turned a blind eye to his wife\u2019s faults because of Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Perhaps having a neighbor fill in the details of Cole\u2019s life was the wrong thing to do; Robin no longer knew. Cole had never said a word to her about Jennifer or Bobby, and she didn\u2019t know if he ever would.</p><p>\u201cJen was never satisfied with Cole\u2019s position as a city attorney,\u201d Joyce explained. \u201cWe\u2019d have coffee together every now and then, and all she\u2019d do was complain how Cole was wasting his talents and that he could be making big money and wasn\u2019t. She had grander plans for him. But Cole loved his job and felt an obligation to follow through with his commitments. Jennifer never understood that. She didn\u2019t even try to sympathize with Cole\u2019s point of view. She constantly wanted more, better, newer things. She didn\u2019t work herself, so it was all up to Cole.\u201d Joyce shrugged sadly.</p><p>\u201cJen was never happy, never satisfied,\u201d she went on. \u201cShe hated the house and the neighborhood, but figured out that all the whining and manipulating in the world wasn\u2019t going to do one bit of good. Cole intended to finish out his responsibilities to the city, so she played her ace. She left him, taking Bobby with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t Cole try to gain custody of Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. He knew, and so did everyone else, that Jennifer was using their son as a pawn. She was never the motherly type, if you know what I mean. If you want the truth, she was an alcoholic. There were several times I dropped Bobby off at the house and suspected Jen had been drinking heavily. I was willing to testify on Cole\u2019s behalf, and I told him so. He was grateful, but then the accident happened and it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe accident?\u201d A heaviness settled in her chest. Each breath pained her and brought with it the memories she longed to forget, memories of another accident\u2014the one that had taken her husband.</p><p>\u201cIt was Jennifer\u2019s fault\u2014the accident, I mean. She\u2019d been drinking and should never have been behind the wheel. The day before, Cole had been to see his attorneys, pleading with them to move quickly because he was afraid Jennifer was becoming more and more irresponsible. But it wasn\u2019t until after she\u2019d moved out that Cole realized how sick she\u2019d become, how dependent she was on alcohol to make it through the day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Robin whispered. \u201cCole must\u2019ve felt so guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d Joyce returned, her voice quavering. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if Cole would survive that first year. He hid inside the house and severed relationships with everyone in the neighborhood. He was consumed by his grief. Later he seemed to come out of it a little, but he\u2019s never been the same.</p><p>\u201cThe irony of all this is that eventually Jen would\u2019ve gotten exactly what she wanted if she\u2019d been more patient. A couple of years ago, Cole accepted a partnership in one of the most important law firms in the city. He\u2019s made a real name for himself, but money and position don\u2019t seem to mean much to him\u2014they never have. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he walked away from the whole thing someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right. Cole told me not long ago that he has some property north of here that he inherited from his grandfather. He\u2019s restoring the house, and he said something about moving there. It\u2019s where he spends most of his weekends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wondered if that was it,\u201d Joyce said, nodding. \u201cThere were rumors floating around the neighborhood that he spent his weekends with a woman. Anyone who knew Cole would realize what a crock that is. Cole isn\u2019t the type to have a secret affair.\u201d</p><p>Robin felt ashamed, remembering how she\u2019d been tempted to believe the rumor herself.</p><p>\u201cFor a long time,\u201d Joyce murmured, \u201cI wondered if Cole was ever going to recover from Jennifer\u2019s and Bobby\u2019s deaths, but now I believe he has. I can\u2019t help thinking you and Jeff had a lot to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... think he would gradually have come out of his shell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but the changes in him lately have been the most encouraging things so far. I don\u2019t know how you feel about Cole or if there\u2019s anything between you, but you couldn\u2019t find a better man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ... I\u2019m falling in love with him,\u201d Robin whispered, voicing her feelings for the first time. The words hung there, and it was too late to take them back.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s absolutely wonderful, I really do!\u201d Joyce said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Now that the shock had worn off, Robin was forced to confront her anger. Cole had told her none of this. Not a single word. That hurt. Hurt more than she would\u2019ve expected. But the ache she felt was nothing compared to the grief Cole must face each morning, the pain that weighed down his life.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cI\u2019ve really done it now, haven\u2019t I? I knew I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut. You\u2019re upset and it\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Robin whispered, making an effort to bring a smile to her dry lips and not succeeding. \u201cI\u2019m grateful we met, and more than grateful you told me about Jennifer, and about Cole\u2019s son.\u201d The knowledge produced a dull ache in Robin\u2019s heart. She felt grief for Cole and a less worthy emotion, too\u2014a sense of being slighted by his lack of trust in her.</p><p>She was so distressed on the short drive home that she missed the turn and had to take a side street and double back to Orchard Street.</p> <p>As she neared the house, she saw that Cole was outside watering his lawn. He waved, but she pretended not to see him and pulled into her driveway. Desperate for some time alone before facing Cole, Robin did her best to ignore him as she climbed out of the car. She needed a few more minutes to gather her thoughts and control her emotions.</p><p>She was almost safe, almost at the house, when Cole stopped her.</p><p>\u201cRobin,\u201d he called, jogging toward her. \u201cHold on a minute, would you?\u201d</p><p>She managed to compose herself, squaring her shoulders and drawing on her dignity.</p><p>His wonderful eyes were smiling as he hurried over. Obviously he hadn\u2019t noticed there was anything wrong. \u201cDid Jeff happen to say anything about seeing us kiss last night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her mouth was still so dry she had to swallow a couple of times before she could utter a single syllable. \u201cYes, but don\u2019t worry, I think I\u2019ve got him squared away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrat!\u201d he teased, snapping his fingers. \u201cI suppose this means I don\u2019t have to go through with the shotgun wedding?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, keeping her eyes lowered, fearing he\u2019d be able to read all the emotion churning inside her.</p> <p>\u201cYou have nothing to fear but fear itself,\u201d she said, forcing a lightness into her tone.</p><p>\u201cRobin?\u201d He made her name a question and a caress. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, shifting the bag of groceries from one arm to the other. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with the same feigned cheerfulness.</p><p>Cole took the bag from her arms. Robin knew she should have resisted, but she couldn\u2019t; she felt drained of strength. She headed for the house, knowing Cole would follow her inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked a second time, setting the groceries on the kitchen counter.</p><p>It was difficult to speak and even more difficult, more exhausting, to find the words that would explain what she\u2019d learned.</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve got a lot to do if we\u2019re going out for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear something fancy. I\u2019m taking you to a four-star restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething fancy?\u201d Mentally she reviewed the contents of her closet, which was rather lacking in anything fancy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not about to be outclassed by Frank,\u201d Cole said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m going to wine and dine you and turn your head with sweet nothings.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to do any of those things to turn her head. She was already dangerously close to being in love with him, so close that she\u2019d blurted it out to a woman she\u2019d known for a total of twelve minutes.</p><p>Abruptly switching her attention to the bag of groceries, Robin set several packages on the counter. When Cole\u2019s hands clasped her shoulders, her eyes drifted shut. \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Cole turned her around to face him. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dinner, the wine, the ... sweet nothings.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes held. As if choreographed, they moved into each other\u2019s arms. With a groan that came from deep in his throat, Cole kissed her. His hands tangled in the auburn thickness of her hair. His lips settled on hers with fierce protectiveness.</p><p>Robin curled her arms tightly around his neck as her own world started to dip and spin and whirl. She was standing on tiptoe, her heart in her throat, when she heard the front door open.</p><p>Moaning, she dragged her mouth from Cole\u2019s and broke away just as her son strolled into the kitchen.</p><p>Jeff stopped, his brow furrowed, when he saw the two of them in what surely looked like suspicious circumstances.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom. Hi, Cole.\u201d He went casually to the refrigerator and yanked open the door. \u201cAnything decent to drink around this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater?\u201d Robin suggested.</p><p>Jeff rolled his eyes. \u201cFunny, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a few more sacks of groceries in the car. Would you get them for me?\u201d He threw her a disgruntled look, until Robin added, \u201cYou\u2019ll find a six-pack of soda in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He raced out of the house and returned a minute later, carrying one sack and sorting through its contents as he walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Cole said, placing his hand on Jeff\u2019s shoulder. He glanced at Robin and his eyes told her they\u2019d continue their discussion at a more opportune moment.</p><p>Robin started emptying the sacks, hardly paying attention as Jeff and Cole brought in the last couple of bags. Cole told her he\u2019d pick her up at six, then left.</p><p>\u201cCan I play with Blackie for a while?\u201d Jeff asked her, a can of cold soda clenched in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Robin answered, grateful to have a few minutes alone.</p><p>Robin cleared the counters and made Jeff a sandwich for his lunch. He must\u2019ve become involved in his game with Cole\u2019s dog because he didn\u2019t rush in announcing he was hungry.</p><p>She went outside to stand on her small front porch and smiled as she watched Jeff and Blackie. Her son really had a way with animals\u2014like his father. Every time Robin saw him play with Cole\u2019s Labrador, she marveled at how attuned they were to each other.</p><p>She smiled when she realized Cole was outside, too; he\u2019d just finished watering his lawn.</p><p>\u201cJeff, I made a sandwich for you,\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. Hey, Mom, watch,\u201d he yelled as he tossed a ball across the lawn. Blackie chased after it, skidding to a stop as he caught the bright red ball.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Blackie,\u201d Jeff urged. \u201cThrow me the ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t do that,\u201d Robin said in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cSure, he can. Watch.\u201d</p><p>And just as Jeff had claimed, Blackie leapt into the air, tossed his head and sent the ball shooting into the street.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Jeff hollered.</p><p>It was Cole\u2019s reaction that Robin noticed first. A horrified look came over his face and he threw down the hose. He was shouting even as he ran.</p><p>Like her son, Robin had been so caught up in Blackie\u2019s antics that she hadn\u2019t seen the car barreling down the street, directly in Jeff\u2019s path.</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cJeff!\u201d Robin screamed, fear and panic choking her. Her hands flew to her mouth in relief as Cole grabbed Jeff around the waist and swept him out of the path of the speeding car. Together they fell backward onto the wet grass. Robin ran over to them.</p><p>\u201cJeff, how many times have I told you to look before you run into the street? How many times?\u201d Her voice was high and hysterical. \u201cYou deserve the spanking of your life for that stunt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the car,\u201d Jeff protested loudly. \u201cI did! I was going to wait for it. Honest.\u201d He struggled to his feet, looking insulted at what he obviously considered an overreaction.</p><p>\u201cGet into the house,\u201d Robin demanded, pointing furiously. She was trembling so badly she could barely speak.</p><p>Jeff brushed the grass from his jeans and raised his head to a dignified angle, then walked toward the house. Not understanding, Blackie followed him, the ball in his mouth, wanting to resume their play.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, boy,\u201d Jeff mumbled just loudly enough for her to hear. \u201cMy mother had some kind of anxiety attack that I\u2019m gonna get punished for.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s recovery was slower than Jeff\u2019s. He sat up and rubbed a hand across his eyes. His face was ashen, his expression stark with terror.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s all right. Jeff isn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Robin assured him. She slipped to her knees in front of him.</p><p>Cole nodded without looking at her. His eyes went blank and he shook his head, as if to clear his mind.</p><p>\u201cCole,\u201d Robin said softly, \u201care you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know.\u201d He gave her a faint smile, but his eyes remained glazed and distant. He placed one hand over his heart and shook his head again. \u201cFor a minute there I thought Jeff hadn\u2019t seen that car and ... I don\u2019t know ... If that boy had been hurt ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cThank you for acting so quickly,\u201d Robin whispered, gratitude filling her heart. She ran her hands down the sides of his face, needing to touch him, seeking a way to comfort him, although her heart ached at his words. So many times over the past few weeks, she\u2019d suspected\u2014and feared\u2014that Cole\u2019s feelings had more to do with replacing the family he\u2019d lost than love for her and Jeff. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a shudder, Cole locked his arms around her waist and pulled her close, burying his face in the curve of her neck as he dragged deep gulps of air into his lungs.</p><p>\u201cCome inside and I\u2019ll get us some coffee,\u201d Robin suggested.</p><p>Cole murmured agreement, but he didn\u2019t seem in any hurry to release her. Nor she him. Her hands were in his hair and she rested her cheek against his, savoring these moments of closeness now that the panic was gone.</p><p>\u201cI lost my son,\u201d Cole whispered and the words seemed to be wrenched from the deepest part of his soul. His voice held an agony only those who had suffered such a loss could understand. \u201cIn a car accident six years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Robin kissed the crown of his head. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Cole broke away from her, slowly raising his eyes to meet hers. Mingled with profound grief was confusion. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoyce Wallach.\u201d</p><p>Cole closed his eyes. \u201cI could use that coffee.\u201d</p><p>They both stood, and when Cole wrapped his arm around her waist Robin couldn\u2019t be sure if it was to lend support or to offer it.</p> <p>Inside the house, Jeff was sitting at the bottom of the stairs, his knees under his chin. Ever loyal, Blackie lay beside him.</p><p>Jeff looked up when Robin opened the front door. \u201cI saw the car,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re getting upset over nothing. I hope you realize that. Hey, what\u2019s wrong with Cole?\u201d he asked abruptly. He glanced from Robin to their neighbor and then back to his mother. \u201cHe looks like he\u2019s seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>In some way, Robin supposed, he had.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, sport?\u201d Cole asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you when we fell, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He bit his lip, eyes lowered.</p><p>Cole frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound all that certain. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p> <p>Jeff nodded reluctantly. \u201cI will be once I find out what my mother plans to do to me. I really was gonna stop at the curb. Honest.\u201d</p><p>The kid would make an excellent attorney, Robin thought wryly.</p><p>\u201cI think I might\u2019ve overreacted,\u201d Cole said. He held open his arms and Jeff flew into them without a second\u2019s hesitation. Briefly Cole closed his eyes, as though in silent thanksgiving for Jeff\u2019s safety.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d Jeff murmured. \u201cI would\u2019ve stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to be more careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>Cole released Jeff and sighed deeply, then looked at Robin. \u201cYou said something about coffee?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll get it in a minute. Jeff, you can go outside, but from now on if you\u2019re playing ball with Blackie, do it in the backyard. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mom,\u201d her son said eagerly. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d he paused \u201c\u2014you mean that\u2019s it? You aren\u2019t going to ground me or anything? I mean, of course you\u2019re not because I did everything I was supposed to\u2014well, almost everything. Thanks, Mom.\u201d He tossed the red ball in the air and caught it deftly with one hand. \u201cCome on, Blackie, we just got a pardon from the governor.\u201d</p><p>Robin followed the pair into the kitchen and watched as Jeff opened the sliding glass door and raced into the backyard with Blackie in hot pursuit. Reassured, she poured two mugs of coffee while Cole pulled out one of the kitchen chairs. She carried the mugs to the table, then sat down across from him.</p><p>Cole reached for her hand, lacing her fingers with his own. He focused his concentration on their linked hands. \u201cBobby was my son. He died when he was ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff\u2019s age,\u201d Robin said as a chill surrounded her heart.</p><p>\u201cBobby was so full of life and laughter I couldn\u2019t be around him and not smile.\u201d</p><p>Talking about Bobby was clearly difficult for Cole, and Robin longed to do or say something that would help. But she could think of nothing to ease the agony etched so deeply on his face.</p><p>\u201cHe was the kind of boy every father dreams of having. Inquisitive, sensitive, full of mischief. Gifted with a vivid imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot like Jeff,\u201d she said, and her hands tightened around the mug.</p><p>Cole nodded. \u201cBobby used to tell me I shouldn\u2019t worry about Jennifer\u2014she was my ex-wife\u2014because he, my ten-year-old son, was taking care of her.\u201d</p><p>Robin held her breath as she watched the fierce pain in his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me this.\u201d Not if it was going to rip open wounds that weren\u2019t properly healed.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve told you before this,\u201d he said, frowning slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that even now, after all this time, it\u2019s difficult to talk about my son. For a good many years, I felt as though part of me had died with Bobby. The very best part of me. I don\u2019t believe that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff reminds you a lot of Bobby, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Robin doubted Cole fully grasped that he was transferring his love from one boy to the other.</p><p>A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. \u201cBobby had a huskier build and was taller than Jeff. His sport was basketball, but he was more of a spectator than a participant. His real love was computers. Had he lived, I think Bobby would have gone into that field. Jen never understood that. She wanted him to be more athletic, and he tried to please her.\u201d Cole\u2019s gaze dropped to his hands. \u201cJennifer and I were divorced before the accident. She died with him. If there\u2019s anything to be grateful for in their deaths, it\u2019s the knowledge that they both went instantly. I couldn\u2019t have stood knowing they\u2019d suffered.\u201d He paused long enough to take a sip of the coffee, and grimaced once. \u201cYou added sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might need it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI have so much to thank you for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the afternoon Jeff ran away?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t likely to forget it. With Jeff around, Robin always figured she didn\u2019t need exercise to keep her heart in shape. Her son managed to do it with his antics.</p><p>\u201cI left on a business trip to Seattle soon afterward,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She nodded. That was when Jeff had looked after Blackie for him.</p><p>\u201cLate one afternoon, when the meeting was over and dinner wasn\u2019t scheduled for another couple of hours, I went for a stroll,\u201d Cole said. \u201cIt was still light and I found myself on the waterfront. The sky was a vivid blue and the waters green and clear. It\u2019s funny I\u2019d remember that, but it\u2019s all so distinct in my memory. I stood alone on the pier and watched as a ferry headed for one of the islands, cutting a path through the waves. Something brought Bobby to my mind, although he\u2019s never far from my thoughts, even now. The most amazing thing happened that afternoon. It\u2019s difficult to find the words to explain.\u201d He hesitated, as though searching for a way to make Robin understand. Then apparently he gave up the effort and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Robin said in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, standing there at the end of the pier ... I don\u2019t know. For the first time since I lost my son, I felt his presence more than I did his absence. It was as if he was there at my side, pointing out the Olympic Mountains and asking questions. Bobby was always full of questions. My heart felt lighter than it had in years\u2014as though the burden of pain and grief had been lifted from my shoulders. For no reason whatsoever, I started to smile. I think I\u2019ve been smiling ever since. And laughing. And feeling.</p><p>\u201cWhen I got back to the hotel, I had the sudden urge to hear your voice. I didn\u2019t have any excuse to call you, so I phoned on the pretense of talking to Jeff and checking up on Blackie. But it was your voice I wanted to hear.\u201d</p><p>Robin smiled through the unexpected rush of tears, wondering if Cole realized what he was saying. It might\u2019ve been her voice he thought he wanted to hear, but it was Jeff he\u2019d called.</p><p>\u201cI discovered a new freedom on that Seattle pier. It was as if, in that moment, I was released from the past. I can\u2019t say exactly what changed. Meeting you and Jeff played a big role in it, I recognize that much, but it was more than that. It was as if something deep inside me was willing to admit that it was finally time to let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad for you,\u201d Robin whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, I never allowed myself to grieve properly or deal with the anger I felt toward Jennifer. She was driving at the time and the accident was her fault. Yet deep in my heart I know she\u2019d never purposely have done anything to hurt Bobby. She loved him as much as I did. He was her son, too.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I met you that I knew I had to forgive her. I was never the kind of husband she needed and I\u2019m afraid I was a disappointment to her. Only in the last few years of our marriage was I willing to accept that she suffered from a serious emotional and mental illness. Her addiction to alcohol was as much a disease as cancer. I didn\u2019t understand her illness, and because of that we all suffered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being too hard on yourself,\u201d Robin said, but she doubted Cole even heard her.</p><p>\u201cAfter the accident, the anger and the grief were a constant gnawing pain. I refused to acknowledge or deal with either emotion. Over the years, instead of healing, I let the agony of my loss grow more intense. I closed myself off from friends and colleagues and threw myself into work, spending far more time in the office than I did at home. Blackie was virtually my only companion. And then a few years ago I started working on my place in the country. But the pleasure that gave me came from hard physical work, the kind that leaves you too tired to think.\u201d His features softened and he smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten what it was like to fly a kite or laze in the sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you suggested the picnic with Jeff and me?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and his dark eyes seemed almost boyish. \u201cThe last time I was in Golden Gate Park was with Bobby, shortly before the accident. Deciding to have a picnic there was a giant step for me. I half expected to feel pangs of grief, if not a full-blown assault. Instead I experienced joy\u2014and appreciation for the renewal I felt. Laughter is a gift I\u2019d forgotten. You and Jeff helped me see that, as well.\u201d</p><p>Everything Cole was saying confirmed her worst fears.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Jeff roared into the kitchen with Blackie at his heels. \u201cIs there anything to eat? Are you guys still going out to dinner? I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d bring me, would you?\u201d</p><p>Cole chuckled, then leapt to his feet to playfully muss Jeff\u2019s hair. \u201cNot this time, sport. Tonight\u2019s for your mother and me.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, as Robin stood in front of the bathroom mirror, she had her reservations about this dinner date. She was falling in love with a man who hadn\u2019t fully dealt with the pain of losing his wife and his son. Perhaps she recognized it in Cole because she saw the same thing in herself. She loved Lenny and always would. He\u2019d died years ago, and she still found herself talking to him, refusing to involve herself in another relationship. A part of her continued to grieve and she suspected it always would.</p><p>Examining herself in the mirror, Robin surveyed her calf-length skirt of soft blue velvet and white silk blouse with a pearl necklace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was fussing with her hair, pinning one side back with combs and studying the effect, when Jeff wandered in. He leaned casually against the doorway, a bag of potato chips in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, you look nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d She decided she\u2019d spent enough time on her hair and fastened her pearl earrings. Jeff was disappointed about not joining them, but he\u2019d been a good sport\u2014especially after Cole promised him lunch at a fish-and-chip place on the Wharf the following Saturday.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing your pearls,\u201d Jeff mumbled, his mouth full.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Robin said, turning to face him. \u201cDo they look all right?\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s halfhearted shrug didn\u2019t do a lot to boost Robin\u2019s confidence. \u201cI suppose. I don\u2019t know about stuff like that. Mrs. Lawrence could probably tell you.\u201d He popped another potato chip in his mouth and crunched loudly. \u201cMy dad gave you those earrings, didn\u2019t he? And the necklace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor our first wedding anniversary.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded. \u201cI thought so.\u201d His look grew reflective. \u201cWhen I grow up and get married, will I do mushy stuff like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Robin said, not bothering to disguise her amusement. \u201cAnd lots of other things, too. Like taking your wife out to dinner and telling her how beautiful she is and how much you love her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYuck!\u201d Jeff wrinkled his nose. \u201cYou really know how to ruin a guy\u2019s appetite.\u201d With that he turned to march down the stairs, taking his potato chips with him.</p><p>Robin stood at the top of the staircase. \u201cCole will be here any minute, so you can go over to Kelly\u2019s now,\u201d she called down.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I put my plate in the dishwasher. Is there anything you want me to tell Kelly\u2019s mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that I won\u2019t be too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure I can\u2019t come with you?\u201d Jeff tried one more time.</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t give him an answer, knowing he didn\u2019t really expect one. After a moment, Jeff grumbled, more for show than anything, then went out the front door to their neighbor\u2019s.</p> <p>Robin returned to the bathroom and smiled into the mirror, picturing Jeff several years into the future and seeing Lenny\u2019s handsome face smiling back at her. She was warmed by the image, certain that her son would grow into as fine a young man as his father had been.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m wearing the pearls for Cole, do you?\u201d she asked her dead husband, although she knew he wouldn\u2019t have objected. She ran the tips of her fingers over the earrings, feeling reassured.</p><p>The doorbell chimed just as Robin was dabbing perfume on her wrists. She drew in a calming breath, glanced quickly at her reflection one last time, then walked down the stairs to answer the door.</p><p>Cole was dressed in a black pin-striped suit and looked so handsome that her breath caught. He smiled as she let him in, but for the life of her she couldn\u2019t think of a thing to say.</p><p>His eyes held hers as he reached for her hands. Slowly he lowered his gaze, taking in the way she\u2019d styled her hair, the pearl necklace and the outfit she\u2019d chosen with such care.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking the same about you,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>His mouth tilted in a grin. \u201cIf I kiss you, will it ruin your lipstick?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you, anyway,\u201d he said in a husky murmur. Tenderly he fit his mouth to hers, slipping his fingers through her hair. The kiss was gentle and thorough and slow. A single kiss, and she was like clay ready to be molded. The realization struck her hard\u2014when Cole touched her, Robin felt alive all the way to the soles of her feet. Alive. Healthy. A red-blooded woman. He released her, and she was shocked to find she was trembling. From the inside out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve mussed your hair,\u201d he apologized. His hands slid under the soft cloud of hair to her nape.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve got lipstick on your mouth,\u201d she said with a quaver, reaching up to wipe it away. \u201cThere. It\u2019ll only take me a moment to fix my hair,\u201d she said, picking up her purse and moving to the hallway mirror.</p><p>He stood behind her, hands on her shoulders as she brushed her hair, then carefully tucked the loose curls back into place with the tortoiseshell combs.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked when she\u2019d finished.</p><p>Robin nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>Cole led her outside to his car and held the passenger door. He dropped a quick kiss on her unsuspecting lips, then hurried around the car, his movements lighthearted, and got into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me where we\u2019re having dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Heather Lawrence in case she needs to get hold of you, but otherwise it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Robin wasn\u2019t sure what to think. A number of San Francisco\u2019s restaurants were internationally famous, but her knowledge of fancy dining places was limited. She assumed this one was somewhere in the heart of the city, until he exited from the freeway heading south along Highway 101 toward the ocean.</p><p>\u201cCole?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, casting her a swift glance that didn\u2019t conceal the mischievous twinkle in his eyes. \u201cI promise you dinner will be worth the drive.\u201d</p><p>The restaurant sat high on a cliff, with a stunning view of the surf battering the jagged rocks below.</p><p>Cole parked the Porsche, then came around to help her out, taking the opportunity to steal another kiss. It was with obvious reluctance that he let her go. His arm around her waist, he directed her toward the doors leading into the elegant restaurant. The ma\u00eetre d\u2019 escorted them to a table that overlooked the water and with a flourish presented them with elaborate menus.</p><p>Robin scanned the entr\u00e9es, impressed with the interesting variations on basic themes. She was less impressed with the prices\u2014a single dinner cost as much as an entire week\u2019s worth of lunches. For her and Jeff.</p><p>\u201cWhen you said fancy you weren\u2019t joking, were you?\u201d she whispered, biting her lip.</p><p>Cole lowered his menu and sent her a vibrant smile. \u201cTonight is special,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me. If I wasn\u2019t having dinner with you, I\u2019d probably have eaten a toasted cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup with Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Their waiter appeared and they ordered wine\u2014a bottle of sauvignon blanc. Then they each chose the restaurant\u2019s specialty\u2014a scallop and shrimp saut\u00e9\u2014which proved as succulent and spicy as the menu had promised.</p><p>They talked through dinner and afterward, over steaming cups of Irish coffee. It astonished Robin that they had so much to say to each other, although they hadn\u2019t touched on the issue closest to her heart. But she hesitated to broach the subject of Cole\u2019s relationship with Jeff. She didn\u2019t want to risk the delightful camaraderie they were sharing tonight. Their conversation could have gone on for hours and in fact did. They talked about books they\u2019d read, recent movies they\u2019d seen, music they liked. It came as a pleasant surprise to discover that their tastes were similar.</p><p>All evening they laughed, they argued, they talked, as if they\u2019d been friends most of their lives. Cole grinned so often, it was hard for Robin to remember that at one time she\u2019d actually wondered if the man ever smiled.</p><p>Robin told Cole about her job and how much she enjoyed accounting. She voiced her fears about not being the kind of mother she wanted to be for Jeff. \u201cThere are so many things I want to share with him that I don\u2019t have time for. There just aren\u2019t enough hours in a day.\u201d</p><p>Cole talked about his career goals and his dreams. He spoke of the forty acres willed to him by his grandfather and how he\u2019d once hoped to close himself off from the world by moving there.</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t going to now?\u201d Robin asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I no longer have any reason to hide. The house is nearly finished and I may still move there, but I\u2019ll maintain my work schedule.\u201d He stared down into his coffee. \u201cI was approached last week about running for the state senate.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s heart swelled with pride. \u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not the right man for politics. I\u2019ll support someone else, but a political career doesn\u2019t interest me. It never has, although I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p><p>A band started playing then, and several couples took to the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Cole asked, nodding in that direction.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cole, I don\u2019t know. The last time I danced was at my cousin\u2019s wedding ten years ago. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll step all over your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game if you are.\u201d</p><p>She was reluctant but agreed to try. They stood, and she moved naturally into his embrace, as if they\u2019d been partners for years. Robin\u2019s eyes slowly closed when Cole folded her in his arms, and in that moment she experienced a surge of joy that startled her with its intensity.</p><p>The dance ended, but they didn\u2019t leave the floor.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you how lovely you are?\u201d Cole asked, his mouth close to her ear.</p><p>Grinning, Robin nodded. \u201cTwice. Once when you picked me up at the house and once during the meal. I know you\u2019re exaggerating, but ...\u201d She shrugged, then added, \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, I feel beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a woman\u2019s ever paid me a higher compliment.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyes and was shocked by the powerful emotions in his.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we leave now?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIf it was up to me I\u2019d spend the rest of the night here with you in my arms, but I have this sudden need to kiss you, and if I do it here and do it properly we\u2019re going to attract a lot of attention.\u201d</p><p>Cole quickly paid the bill and he hurried Robin to the car. The minute they were settled inside, he reached for her. He did as he\u2019d promised, kissing her until she was breathless. Her arms clung to him as his mouth sought hers once more.</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m not making you cry this time,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cThat still embarrasses me,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened before. I still don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t know if I ever will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cIt touched me in a way I can\u2019t explain. It helped me realize I was going to love you. After Jennifer and Bobby, I doubted there was any love left in me. You taught me otherwise. Jeff taught me otherwise. My heart is full and has been almost from the time we met.\u201d He took her hand and pressed her palm to his heart. \u201cDo you feel it?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s beating so hard,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous? About what?\u201d</p><p>Cole slid a hand into his pocket and brought out a small black velvet box.</p><p>Robin\u2019s heart started to pound in double time. \u201cCole?\u201d she said anxiously, not sure what she should think or how she should act. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you, Robin.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cI knew it the moment I heard your voice when I called from Seattle. And every moment since has convinced me how right this is.\u201d He opened the box and revealed the largest diamond Robin had ever seen. Slowly he raised his eyes to hers. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cYou mean this whole evening ... you arranged this whole evening because you intended to ask me to marry you?\u201d Robin asked, pressing the tips of her fingers to her trembling lips. Despite her fears a gentle gladness suffused her heart.</p><p>\u201cSurely it isn\u2019t that much of a surprise?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never made an effort to hide how I feel about you or how much I enjoy Jeff.\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to what Cole might think, his proposal did come as a surprise. \u201cI ... I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA simple yes would suit me,\u201d Cole urged warmly.</p><p>\u201cBut ... Oh, Cole, it would be so easy to marry you, so easy to join my life and Jeff\u2019s to yours and never look back. But I don\u2019t know if it would be right for us or for you. There\u2019s so much to consider, so many factors to weigh, in a decision this important. I\u2019d like nothing better than to just say yes, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking for time?\u201d Cole\u2019s eyes seemed to penetrate hers, even in the dark.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d For now, that seemed the simplest thing to say, although her hesitation was based on something much deeper. Cole had rediscovered a peace within himself since meeting her and Jeff; he\u2019d told her so that very afternoon. She was tempted to say yes, to turn away from her doubts and agree to marry him. Cole had been so good for Jeff, so wonderful to her.</p> <p>\u201cI hate to disappoint you,\u201d she murmured sadly.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you\u2019re thinking, exactly how you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Somehow she doubted it. But knowing she couldn\u2019t delay it any longer, she jumped in with both feet. \u201cI was ... just thinking about what you told me this afternoon. How you\u2019d recently dealt with the loss of Jennifer and Bobby. While you were talking, I couldn\u2019t help feeling your exhilaration. You\u2019ve obviously found a newborn sense of freedom. I think the question you need to ask yourself is if this rebirth you\u2019ve experienced is what prompted the idea of marrying again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cFalling in love with you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cole,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt must seem like fate to have Jeff and me move in next door, and it gets more complicated with Jeff being the same age as Bobby ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it does all appear too convenient, but if I was just looking for a woman and a child, then Heather Lawrence would\u2019ve filled the bill. It\u2019s you I fell in love with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut how can you be so sure?\u201d she countered quickly. \u201cWe barely know each other.\u201d</p><p>Cole smiled at her doubts. \u201cThe first time we kissed was enough to convince me I was going to love you. It was the Friday night after I returned from Seattle, remember?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded, wincing a little.</p><p>\u201cI was so stunned by the effect that kiss had on me, I avoided you for an entire week afterward. If you want the truth, I was terrified. You\u2019ll have to remember, up until that time I was convinced I was incapable of ever falling in love again. One kiss, and I felt jolted to the core. You hit me hard, Robin, and I needed time to step back and analyze what was happening. That\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t have any qualms about giving you however long you need to sort out what you\u2019re feeling. I want you to be very sure.\u201d</p><p>Robin released a pent-up sigh. Cole folded her in his arms and his chin brushed against her hair while his hands roved in wide circles across her back. The action was soothing and gentle. She was beginning to feel more confident in his love, but she had to be careful. She wanted him to love her, because she was so much in love with him.</p><p>Cole tucked a finger under her chin and lifted her face to his. As their eyes met, he slanted his mouth over hers in a wildly possessive kiss, a kiss filled with undisguised need.</p><p>When he broke away, Robin was trembling. She buried her face in his neck and drew several deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take some time to think about things,\u201d Cole whispered against her hair, \u201cthen I wanted to give you something else to think about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you had a chance to check those figures on\u2014\u201d Angela began, then stopped abruptly, waving her hand in front of Robin\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cA chance to check what figures?\u201d Robin asked, making a determined effort to focus. She knew she\u2019d been acting like a sleepwalker most of the morning, but she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Cole\u2019s proposal.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you today?\u201d Angela demanded. \u201cEvery time I look over here, I find you staring into space with this perplexed expression on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was ... just thinking,\u201d Robin muttered.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, girl, you know better than that. You can\u2019t fool me.\u201d Angela leaned against the edge of Robin\u2019s desk and crossed her arms, taking her usual aggressive stance. \u201cI\u2019ve known you far too long. From everything you haven\u2019t said, I\u2019d guess your handsome neighbor\u2019s involved. What\u2019s he done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole? What makes you ask anything so ridiculous?\u201d</p><p>Angela frowned, shaking her head. Then she stretched out her hands and made a come-hither motion. \u201cTell Mama everything,\u201d she intoned. \u201cYou might as well get it over with and tell me now, because you know that sooner or later I\u2019m going to drag it out of you. What kind of friend would I be if I didn\u2019t extract your deepest darkest secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took me to dinner,\u201d Robin admitted, knowing that Angela was right. Sooner or later, she\u2019d wheedle it out of her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he take you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, wanting to keep that to herself. \u201cIt was outside the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere outside the city?\u201d Angela pressed.</p><p>\u201cHeavens, I don\u2019t know. Somewhere along the coast on Highway 101.\u201d</p><p>Angela uncrossed her arms and started pacing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Cliffhouse, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I think it might have been,\u201d Robin murmured, concentrating on the task in front of her. The one she should\u2019ve finished hours earlier. The one she couldn\u2019t seem to focus on, even now.</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d Angela cried, pointing her index finger at the ceiling, like a detective in a comic spoof.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Robin cried.</p><p>\u201cIf Cole took you to the Cliffhouse, he did it for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. The food was fabulous. By the way, you were right about Frank, he\u2019s exceptionally nice,\u201d Robin said in an effort to interrupt her friend\u2019s line of thought.</p><p>\u201cYou already told me what you think of Frank, remember?\u201d Angela said. \u201cCole took you to dinner at the Cliffhouse,\u201d she repeated slowly, as though reviewing a vital clue in a murder mystery.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I think his choice of restaurant had something to do with Frank,\u201d Robin inserted, tossing her sleuth friend a red herring.</p><p>\u201cSo Cole was jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Robin said, leaning back in her chair. \u201cWell, maybe a little,\u201d she amended, knowing Angela would never believe her if she denied it completely. \u201cI mean, Cole did invite me to dinner as soon as he learned I was dining with Frank, so I guess you could say he was a little jealous. But not much. Cole\u2019s not the jealous type\u2014he told me that himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Angela was frowning as she walked back to her desk. Her look remained thoughtful for the rest of the morning, although she didn\u2019t question Robin again. But when they left for lunch, she showed a renewed interest in the subject of Cole.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jeff?\u201d she began as they stood in line in the employees cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Robin said as she reached for a plastic tray.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019re going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat more do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask about Jeff once a week or so, then sit back and listen for the next fifteen minutes while you tell me about the latest craziness,\u201d Angela said heatedly. \u201cIt never fails. You\u2019ve told me about him running away with a frying pan and an atlas. You\u2019ve bragged about what a fabulous pitcher he\u2019s turning out to be, and you\u2019ve given me a multitude of details about every game he\u2019s played. After you tell me all about his athletic ability, you generally mention how good he is with animals and all the tricks he\u2019s taught Blackie in the past week.\u201d</p><p>Robin tried to respond but Angela ignored her and kept talking. \u201cToday I innocently ask how Jeff is, and what do I get? Fine. All right, Robin, tell me what happened with Cole Camden before I go crazy trying to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I need to figure out myself,\u201d Robin said. She paused to study the salads before selecting a mound of cottage cheese and setting it on her tray.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d Angela cried, throwing her arms in the air. \u201cYou hate cottage cheese. You never eat it unless you\u2019re upset and looking for ways to punish yourself.\u201d She took the small bowl from Robin\u2019s tray and replaced it with a fresh fruit salad, shaking her head the entire time.</p><p>The problem with Angela was that she knew Robin all too well.</p><p>They progressed a little farther down the line. Robin stood in front of the entr\u00e9es, but before she chose one, she glanced at her friend. \u201cYou want to pick one of these for me, too?\u201d she asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, before you end up requesting liver and onions.\u201d</p><p>Angela picked the lasagne, thick with melted cheese and spicy tomato sauce. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for ways to punish yourself, girl, there are tastier methods.\u201d</p><p>Despite her thoughtful mood, Robin smiled.</p><p>Once they\u2019d paid for their lunches, Angela led her to a window table that offered a certain amount of privacy. Robin busied herself arranging her dishes and set the tray aside.</p><p>Angela sat directly across from her, elbows braced on either side of her lunch. \u201cAre you sure there isn\u2019t anything else you\u2019d care to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you and Cole, of course. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw you like this. It\u2019s as if ... as if you\u2019re trapped in some kind of maze and can\u2019t find your way out.\u201d</p><p>The description was so apt that Robin felt a tingling sensation along her spine. She did feel hopelessly lost. Her mind was cluttered, her emotions confused. She had one foot in the present, one in the past, and didn\u2019t know which way to turn.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Frank on Sunday afternoon,\u201d Angela continued, dipping her fork into a crisp green salad. \u201cHe said he enjoyed the evening you spent with him, but doubted you\u2019d be seeing each other again because it\u2019s obvious to him that you\u2019re in love with Cole Camden. In fact, Frank said you talked about little else the entire evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said all that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angela nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s right, isn\u2019t he?

You\u2019ve got that glazed look and you walk around in a trance, practically bumping into walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like I need an ambulance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr a doctor,\u201d Angela whispered, leaning across the table. \u201cOr maybe a lawyer ... That\u2019s it!\u201d she said loudly enough to attract the attention of several people at nearby tables. \u201cCole took you to bed, and now you\u2019re so confused you don\u2019t know what to do. I told you I\u2019d stumble on the answer sooner or later.\u201d Her eyes flashed triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d Robin declared, half rising from the table. She could feel the color crowding into her cheeks as she glanced around the cafeteria. When she sat back down, she covered her face with both hands. \u201cIf you must know, Cole asked me to marry him.\u201d</p><p>A moment of shocked silence followed before Angela shrieked with pure delight. \u201cThat\u2019s fabulous! Wonderful! Good grief, what\u2019s wrong with you? You should be in seventh heaven. It isn\u2019t every day a handsome, wealthy, wonderful man proposes to you. I hope you leapt at the chance.\u201d She hesitated, suddenly still. \u201cRobin? You did tell him you\u2019d marry him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Robin swallowed and shook her head. \u201cNo. I asked him for some time to think about things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about things?\u201d Angela squealed. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to think about? He\u2019s rich. He\u2019s handsome. He\u2019s in love with you and crazy about Jeff. What more could you possibly want?\u201d</p> <p>Tears brimmed in Robin\u2019s eyes as she looked up to meet her friend\u2019s avid gaze. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s more in love with the idea of having a family than he is with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Cole coming?\u201d Jeff asked, working the stiffness out of his baseball mitt by slamming his fist into the middle of it several times.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Robin said, glancing at their neighbor\u2019s house as they walked to the car. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him in the last few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at him, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Robin said, sliding into the driver\u2019s seat of her compact. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been busy.\u201d</p><p>Jeff fingered the bill of his baseball cap, then set the cap on his head. \u201cI saw him yesterday and told him about the game, and he said he might come. I hope he does.\u201d</p> <p>Secretly Robin hoped Cole would be there, too. Over the past five days, she\u2019d missed talking to him. She hadn\u2019t come to any decision, but he hadn\u2019t pressed her to make one, willing to offer her all the time she needed. Robin hadn\u2019t realized how accustomed she\u2019d grown to his presence. How much she needed to see him and talk to him. Exchange smiles and glances. Touch him ...</p><p>When she was married to Lenny, they were two people very much in love, two people who\u2019d linked their lives to form one whole. But Lenny had been taken from her, and for a long time afterward Robin had felt only half alive.</p><p>All week she\u2019d swayed back and forth over Cole\u2019s proposal, wondering if she should ignore her doubts. Wondering if she could ignore them. Sleepless nights hadn\u2019t yielded the answer. Neither had long solitary walks in Balboa Park while Jeff practiced with his baseball team.</p><p>\u201cCole said\u2014\u201d Jeff started to say, then stopped abruptly as his hands flew to his head. A panicky look broke out on his face and he stared at Robin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did you forget something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lucky hat!\u201d Jeff cried. \u201cIt\u2019s on my dresser. We have to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a baseball cap?\u201d Robin didn\u2019t disguise how silly she considered that idea. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing a baseball cap. What\u2019s wrong with that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work. You have to understand, Mom, it\u2019s my lucky hat. I\u2019ve been wearing it ever since we played our first game. I had that very same hat on when I hit my first two home runs. I can\u2019t play without it,\u201d he explained frantically. \u201cWe have to go back. Hurry, or we\u2019ll be late for the game. Turn here,\u201d he insisted, pointing at the closest intersection.</p> <p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she said, trying to reason with her son. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the hat that makes you play well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were going to say something like that,\u201d he muttered, \u201cand even if it\u2019s true, I want to be on the safe side, just in case. We\u2019ve got to go back and get that hat!\u201d</p><p>Knowing it would only waste valuable time to argue, Robin did as he requested. After all, his whole career as a major-league pitcher hung in the balance!</p><p>She was smiling as she entered her driveway. Sitting in the car while Jeff ran inside for his lucky cap, Robin glanced over at Cole\u2019s place. His car was gone. It\u2019d been gone since early that morning, and she suspected he was at the property, working on his house. Jeff would be disappointed about Cole missing his game, but he\u2019d understand.</p><p>Jeff came barreling out of the house, slamming the front door. He leapt into the car and fastened his seat belt. \u201cCome on, Mom,\u201d he said anxiously, \u201clet\u2019s get this show on the road.\u201d As if she\u2019d caused the delay, Robin thought to herself, amused by her son\u2019s sudden impatience.</p><p>By the time they arrived at Balboa Park, the car park was filled to overflowing. Robin was fortunate enough to find a space on the street, a minor miracle in itself. Perhaps there was something to this magic-cap business after all.</p><p>Jeff ran across the grass, hurrying toward his teammates, leaving Robin to fend for herself, which was fine. He had his precious cap and was content.</p><p>The bleachers were crowded with parents. Robin found a seat close to the top and had just settled in place when she saw Cole making his way toward her. Her heart did an immediate flip-flop and it wasn\u2019t until he sat next to her that she was able to speak.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were working up on the property this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss seeing Jeff pitch? Wild horses couldn\u2019t have kept me away.\u201d He was smiling at her with that cocky heart-stopping smile of his.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d she asked. She couldn\u2019t keep her eyes off him. He looked too good to be true, and his dark gaze was filled with warmth and tenderness. How could she help getting lost in eyes that generous? It seemed impossible to resist him any longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you like crazy,\u201d he whispered, and the humor seemed to drain out of him as his eyes searched hers. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible to feel this alone. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to relax once she\u2019d said that. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHave you been thinking about what I said last weekend?\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought of anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve made up your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She kept her face lowered, not wanting him to see her confusion.</p><p>He tilted her chin with one finger, forcing her to meet his eyes. \u201cI promised myself I wouldn\u2019t ask you and then I couldn\u2019t seem to stop myself. I won\u2019t again.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a weak smile, and Cole looked around him, clearly wanting to kiss her, but not in front of such a large gathering. The funny part was, Robin didn\u2019t care about being seen. She was so hungry for the reassurance of his touch, it didn\u2019t matter to her that they were in the middle of a crowded park.</p><p>\u201cI see Jeff\u2019s wearing his lucky hat,\u201d Cole said, clasping her hand and giving her fingers a comforting squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Jeff tells me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe panicked when he realized he was wearing the wrong one, and I had to make a U-turn in the middle of the street because he\u2019d left the guaranteed-to-pitch-well baseball cap on his dresser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame him. The luck has lasted through five games now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if it\u2019ll last until he reaches the pros,\u201d Robin said, sharing a smile with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing all right?\u201d Cole asked unexpectedly.</p><p>She nodded, although it wasn\u2019t entirely true. Now that she was with Cole, every doubt she\u2019d struggled with all week vanished like fog under an afternoon sun. Only when they were apart was she confronted by her fears.</p><p>\u201cAfter Jeff\u2019s finished here, let\u2019s do something together,\u201d Cole suggested. \u201cThe three of us.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unable to refuse him anything.</p><p>\u201cCome to think of it, didn\u2019t I promise Jeff lunch? I seem to recall making a rash pledge to buy him fish and chips because we were leaving him with Heather and Kelly when we went to dinner last week.\u201d</p><p>Robin grinned. \u201cIt seems to me you\u2019re remembering that correctly,\u201d she said.</p><p>They went to a cheerful little fish-and-chip restaurant down by the Wharf. The weather had been chilly all morning, but the sun was out in full force by early afternoon. Jeff was excited about his team\u2019s latest win and attributed it to the luck brought to them by his cap.</p><p>After a leisurely lunch, the three of them strolled along the busy waterfront. Robin bought a loaf of fresh sourdough bread and a small bouquet of spring flowers. Jeff found a plastic snake he couldn\u2019t live without and paid for it with his allowance.</p><p>\u201cJust wait till Jimmy Wallach sees this!\u201d he crowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more curious to see how Kelly Lawrence reacts,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kelly likes snakes,\u201d Jeff told them cheerfully. \u201cJimmy was over one day and I thought I\u2019d scare Kelly with a live garden snake, but Jimmy was the one who started screaming. Kelly said snakes were just another of God\u2019s creatures and there was nothing to be afraid of. Isn\u2019t it just like a girl to get religious about a snake?\u201d</p><p>Jeff raced down the sidewalk while Cole and Robin stood at the end of the pier, the bread and flowers at their feet.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Cole said, as his fingers gently touched her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted, gazing out at the cool green waters of San Francisco Bay. But Cole was right; she hadn\u2019t been sleeping well.</p><p>\u201cI see so much of myself in you,\u201d Cole said softly.</p><p>His words surprised her. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pain mostly. How many years has Lenny been dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen. In some ways I\u2019m still grieving him.\u201d She couldn\u2019t be less than honest with Cole.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sure if you can love another man, are you? At least not with the same intensity that you loved Jeff\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all. I ... I just don\u2019t know if I can stop loving him.\u201d</p><p>Cole went very still. \u201cI never intended to take Lenny away from you or Jeff. He\u2019s part of your past, an important part. Being married to Lenny, giving birth to Jeff, contributed to making you what you are.\u201d He paused, and they both remained silent.</p><p>\u201cBobby had been buried for six years before I had the courage to face the future. I hung on to my grief, carried it with me everywhere I went, dragging it like a heavy piece of luggage I couldn\u2019t travel without.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not that way about Lenny,\u201d she said, ready to argue, not heatedly or vehemently, but logically, because what he was saying simply wasn\u2019t true. She mourned her dead husband, felt his absence, but she hadn\u2019t allowed this sense of loss to destroy her life.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you aren\u2019t grieving as deeply as you once were,\u201d Cole amended. \u201cBut I wonder if you\u2019ve really laid your husband to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d she answered with a nod of her head, not wanting to talk about Lenny.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound unsympathetic,\u201d Cole said, his tone compassionate. \u201cI understand, believe me I do. Emotional pain is familiar territory for us both. It seems to me that those of us who sustain this kind of grief are afraid of what lies beyond.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating, Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely woman, Robin. Witty. Intelligent. Outgoing. I\u2019m sure one of the first questions anyone asks you is how long it\u2019s been since your husband died. And I\u2019ll bet when you tell them, they seem surprised.\u201d</p><p>That was true, and Robin wondered how Cole had guessed.</p><p>\u201cMost young widows remarry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting that because I didn\u2019t immediately fling myself back into matrimonial bliss I\u2019m a candidate for therapy? Come on, Cole, even you must realize how ridiculous that is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven me?\u201d he asked, chuckling.</p><p>Jeff came loping toward them, his face flushed with excitement. \u201cThey\u2019re filming a movie,\u201d he cried, pointing toward a congested area farther down the pier. \u201cThere\u2019s cameras and actors and everything. Can I go watch some more?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded. \u201cJust don\u2019t get in anyone\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Promise. Here, Mom, hold my snake.\u201d He entrusted her with his precious package before racing back down the pier.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fine boy, Robin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves you already. You and Blackie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how does his mother feel?\u201d</p><p>The knot in her throat thickened. \u201cShe loves you, too.\u201d</p><p>Cole grinned. \u201cShe just isn\u2019t sure if she can let go of her dead husband to take on a live one. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>His words hit their mark. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid you want to marry me because Jeff reminds you of Bobby. Or because you\u2019ve created a fantasy wife and think I\u2019ll fit the role.\u201d</p><p>Her words seemed to shock him. \u201cNo. You\u2019ve got that all wrong. Jeff is a wonderful plus in this relationship, but it\u2019s you I fell in love with. It\u2019s you I want to grow old with. You, and you alone, not some ideal. If you want to know the truth, I think you\u2019re stirring up all this turmoil because you\u2019re afraid of ever marrying again. The little world you\u2019ve made is tidy and safe. But is this what Lenny would\u2019ve wanted for you?\u201d He gripped her firmly by the shoulders. \u201cIf Lenny were standing beside you right now and you could ask him about marrying me, what would he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could seek Lenny\u2019s advice, what would he tell you? Would he say, \u2018Robin, look at this guy. He\u2019s in love with you. He thinks the world of Jeff, and he\u2019s ready to embark on a new life. This is an opportunity too good to pass up. Don\u2019t be a fool. Marry him.\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like something my friend Angela would say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to like this friend of yours\u2014just as long as she doesn\u2019t try to set you up with any more of her divorced cousins,\u201d Cole said, laughing. His eyes grew warm as he gazed at her, and she suspected he was longing to take her in his arms and kiss her doubts away. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he looked over his shoulder and sighed. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go see what Jeff\u2019s up to. I\u2019ll leave you to yourself for a few minutes. I don\u2019t mean to pressure you, but I do want you to think about what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t pressuring me,\u201d she whispered, staring out over the water.</p><p>Cole left her then, and her hands clutched the steel railing as she raised her eyes to the sky. \u201cOh, Lenny,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>\u201cCole wants me to ask your advice.\u201d Robin continued to look up at the cloudless blue sky. \u201cOh, Lenny, I honestly don\u2019t know what\u2019s right for Jeff and me anymore. I love Cole. I love you. But at the same time I can\u2019t help wondering about Cole\u2019s motives ....\u201d</p><p>Robin paused, waiting. Not that she expected an answer. Lenny couldn\u2019t give her one. He never did; he never would. But unlike the other times she\u2019d spoken to him, she needed a response, even though expecting one was totally illogical.</p><p>With every breath she took, Robin knew that, but the futility of it hit her, anyway. Her frustration was so hard and unexpectedly powerful that it felt like a body blow. Robin closed her eyes, hoping the heat of the sun would take away this bitter ache, this dreadful loneliness.</p><p>She felt so empty. Hollow all the way through.</p><p>Her fists were clenched at her sides as tears fell from her eyes. Embarrassed, she glanced around, grateful that the film crew had attracted most of the sightseers. No one was around to witness her distress.</p><p>Anger, which for so many years had lain dormant inside her, gushed forth in an avalanche of grief and pain. The tears continued to spill down her cheeks. Her lips quivered. Her shoulders shook. Her hands trembled. It was as if the emotion was pounding against her chest and she was powerless to do anything but stand there and bear it.</p><p>Anger consumed her now. Consumed her because she hadn\u2019t allowed it to when Lenny was killed. It had been more important to put on a brave front. More important to hold herself together for Jeff and for Lenny\u2019s parents. More important to deal with the present than the past.</p><p>Lenny had died and Robin was furious with him for leaving her alone with a child to raise. Leaving her alone to deal with filing taxes and taking out the garbage and repairing leaking pipes. All these years she\u2019d managed on her own. And she\u2019d bottled the anger up inside, afraid of ever letting it go.</p><p>\u201cRobin.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s voice, soft and urgent, reached out from behind her. At the sound, she turned and walked into his arms, sobbing, needing his comfort and his love in equal measure. Needing him as she\u2019d never needed anyone before.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long he held her. He was whispering soothing words to her. Gentle words. But she heard none of them over the sound of her own suffering.</p><p>Once she started crying, Robin couldn\u2019t seem to stop. It was as if a dam had burst inside her and the anguish, stored for too many years, came pouring out.</p><p>Cole\u2019s arms were securely wrapped around her, shielding her. She longed to control this outburst, longed to explain, but every time she tried to speak her sobbing only grew worse.</p><p>\u201cLet it out,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t answer,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI asked him ... Lenny never answers me ... because he can\u2019t. He left me ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to die,\u201d Cole told her.</p><p>\u201cBut he did ... he did.\u201d</p><p>Cole didn\u2019t argue with her. He simply held her, stroking the back of her head as though reassuring a small child.</p><p>It took several minutes for Robin to compose herself enough to go on. \u201cPart of me realizes that Lenny didn\u2019t want to leave me, didn\u2019t want to die. But he did and I\u2019m so angry at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat anger is what makes us human,\u201d Cole said. He continued to comfort her and, gradually, bit by bit, Robin felt her composure slip back into place.</p><p>She sensed Jeff\u2019s presence even before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat wrong with my mom?\u201d he asked Cole.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dealing with some emotional pain,\u201d Cole explained, speaking as one adult to another.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>Robin hadn\u2019t wanted her son to see her crying and made a concerted effort to break away from Cole, to reassure Jeff herself. Cole loosened his hold, but kept his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jeff. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>Her son had developed the irritating habit of talking to Cole and not to her when she was upset. They\u2019d done it that day her son had run away to the fort. Jeff and Cole had carried on an entire conversation about her while she was in their midst then, too.</p><p>Cole led her to a bench and they all sat down.</p><p>Jeff plopped down next to her and reached for her hand, patting it several times. Leaning toward Cole, he said earnestly, \u201cChocolate might help. One time Mom told me there wasn\u2019t anything in this world chocolate couldn\u2019t cure.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d actually said that? Robin started to smile. Wrapping her arms around her son, she hugged him close, loving him so much her heart seemed about to burst.</p><p>Jeff wasn\u2019t all that keen on being cuddled, especially in public, but although he squirmed he put up with his mother\u2019s sudden need to hold him.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, Jeff rolled his eyes and once more directed his comments to Cole. \u201cShe gets weird like this every once in a while. Remember what happened that day I ran away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Cole said, and Robin smiled at the trace of amusement she heard in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop excluding me from this conversation? I\u2019m going to be all right. I just had this ... urge to cry, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Jeff muttered to Cole.</p><p>\u201cBut Jeff\u2019s right,\u201d Robin said, ignoring her son\u2019s comment. \u201cSomething chocolaty would definitely help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay by yourself for a couple of minutes?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I ... don\u2019t know exactly what came over me, but I\u2019m going to be just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d He kissed her, his lips gentle against her cheek.</p><p>The two of them left and once more Robin was alone. She didn\u2019t really understand why the pain and anger had hit her so hard now, after all this time. Except that it had something to do with Cole. But the last place she would ever have expected to give in to her grief was on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf with half of San Francisco looking on.</p><p>Jeff returned less than a minute later, running to her side with a double-decker chocolate ice cream cone. \u201cCole\u2019s bringing two more for him and me,\u201d he explained. \u201cI told the guy it was an emergency and he gave me this one right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was nice of you,\u201d Robin said, wondering what the vendor must have thought. Smiling, she ran her tongue over the ice cream, savoring the cold chocolate. As profoundly as she\u2019d wept, she felt almost giddy with relief now, repressing the impulse to throw back her head and laugh.</p><p>Cole arrived, and with Jeff on her left and Cole on her right she sat on the concrete bench and ate her ice cream cone.</p><p>\u201cI told you this would work,\u201d Jeff told Cole smugly.</p><p>\u201cAnd to think I scoffed at your lucky baseball cap,\u201d she teased, feeling much better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they finished the cones, Cole gathered up their packages and led them back to where he\u2019d parked his car.</p><p>Blackie was there to greet them the instant they returned to Orchard Street. Jeff ran into the backyard to play with the dog, and Cole walked Robin to her door. He accepted her offer of coffee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably going to be leaving soon for my property,\u201d he said, watching her closely. He sat down at the table, his hands cupping the mug as though to warm them. \u201cWill you be all right?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded. She walked over and stood beside him and pressed a hand to his strong jaw. \u201cI realize you delayed going up there today because of Jeff and his baseball game. We\u2019re both grateful.\u201d</p> <p>Cole placed his hand over hers and harshly expelled his breath. \u201cI feel responsible for what you went through there on the pier. I should never have said what I did. I\u2019m sorry, Robin, it wasn\u2019t any of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only said what I needed to hear.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIf I did, it was because of what happened to me in Seattle. It\u2019s quite a coincidence that both of us would come to grips with our pain while standing on a pier\u2014me in Seattle, you here in San Francisco. I went home with this incredible sense of release. For the first time since Bobby and Jennifer\u2019s deaths, I surrendered my grief. In a way it was as though I reached up and God reached down and together we came to an understanding.\u201d</p><p>That so completely described what Robin had been feeling that for a long moment she couldn\u2019t say anything. What Cole had said earlier about carrying the pain, dragging it everywhere, was right on the mark, too. He understood; he\u2019d done the same thing himself. A surge of love swelled within her.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to hear this,\u201d he was saying. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t mean to pressure you. But once I returned from Seattle and realized I was falling in love with you I started thinking about having another baby.\u201d He hesitated and took a gulp of his coffee. Then he stood up abruptly, nearly knocking the chair backward. \u201cI\u2019d better go before I say or do something else I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Robin followed him into the entryway, not wanting him to leave, but not quite ready to give him what he needed.</p><p>He paused at the screen door and his eyes immediately found hers. He couldn\u2019t seem to keep himself from touching her, brushing an auburn curl from her cheek. His knuckles grazed her skin lightly, and Robin\u2019s eyes closed of their own accord at the sensation that shot through her. Her heart was full, and she seemed to have all the answers now\u2014except to the one question that was the most important in her life. And Jeff\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you sometime next week,\u201d Cole said roughly, pulling his hand away. Without another word, he walked out the door, pausing at the top of the porch steps.</p><p>He called for his dog and in response both Blackie and Jeff came running.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving, are you?\u201d Jeff asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking Blackie for the rest of the weekend. You think you can get along without him till Monday, sport?\u201d</p> <p>Jeff shrugged and stuck his fingers in the hip pockets of his blue jeans. \u201cI suppose. Where are you taking him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my property.\u201d Cole didn\u2019t turn toward Robin. It was as if he had to ignore her in order to walk away from her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah!\u201d Jeff said enthusiastically. \u201cI remember you said something about it once. You\u2019re building a house, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemodelling one. My grandfather lived there as a boy and he left it to me, only it\u2019s been a lot of years since anyone\u2019s cared for that old house properly and there\u2019s plenty of work that needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work for you,\u201d Jeff piped up eagerly. He made a fist and flexed his arm, revealing the meager muscles. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t look like much, but I\u2019m strong. Ask anyone.\u201d</p><p>Cole tested Jeff\u2019s muscles, pretending to be impressed. \u201cYes, I can tell you\u2019re strong, and I\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t ask for a harder worker.\u201d Jeff beamed until Cole added regretfully, \u201cI\u2019ll take you up there another time, sport.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s face fell.</p><p>Before she even realized what she was doing, Robin moved onto the porch. \u201cCole.\u201d</p> <p>He turned to face her, but the movement seemed reluctant.</p><p>Perhaps it was because she didn\u2019t want to be separated from him any more than he wanted to be away from her. Perhaps it was the thought of Jeff\u2019s disappointment when he\u2019d already had so many other disappointments in his life. Perhaps it was this newborn sense of freedom she was just beginning to experience.</p><p>She stepped toward Cole. \u201cCould Jeff and I go up to the property with you?\u201d</p><p>Jeff didn\u2019t wait for Cole to answer before leaping excitedly into the air. \u201cHey, Mom, that\u2019s a great idea! Really great. Can we, Cole? Blackie and I can help you, and Mom can ... Well, she can do things like make us some grub and bring us lemonade and other stuff women do when their men are working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you both know I pound a mean hammer,\u201d Robin felt obliged to inform them. If she was going to Cole\u2019s farm, she fully intended to do her share.</p><p>Cole looked perplexed for a moment, as if he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard her correctly. \u201cI\u2019d love to have you come\u2014if you\u2019re sure that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>Robin just nodded. All she knew was that she couldn\u2019t bear to be separated from him any longer.</p><p>\u201cBe warned\u2014the house is only half done. The plumbing isn\u2019t in yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll manage, won\u2019t we, Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeff said eagerly. \u201cAnyway, boys got it easy.\u201d</p><p>Cole laughed. \u201cHow long will it take you to pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready now, aren\u2019t we, Blackie?\u201d Jeff almost jitterbugged across the front lawn in his enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes to throw some things together,\u201d Robin said, grinning. Jeff was smiling, too, from ear to ear, as he dashed past her into the house and up the stairs.</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes held Robin\u2019s in silent communication\u2014until Jeff came bursting out of the house, dragging his sheets and quilt with him, straight from his bed.</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she cried, aghast, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took everything off my bed. I can go without plumbing, but I need my sleep.\u201d He piled the bedding at their feet. \u201cYou two can go back to looking at each other. I\u2019ll get everything else we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d Robin groaned, casting Cole an apologetic glance. \u201cI\u2019ll pack my own things, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to get your sheets, too?\u201d he called from inside the house.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She scooped up the bedding and hurried into the house, taking the stairs two at a time. She discovered Jeff sitting on the edge of her bed, his expression pensive.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to marry Cole?\u201d her son asked.</p><p>At the unexpectedness of the question, Robin\u2019s heart flew to her throat, then slid back into place. Briefly she wondered if Cole had brought up the subject with her son, but instinctively knew he hadn\u2019t. \u201cW-what makes you ask that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cLots of things. Every time I turn around you two are staring at each other. Either that or kissing. I try to pretend I don\u2019t notice, but it\u2019s getting as bad as some of those movies you like. And when you were crying on the pier, I saw something. Cole had his arms around you and he was looking real sad. Like ... like he wished he could do the crying for you. It\u2019s the same look Grandpa sometimes gives Grandma when he figures out that she\u2019s upset, and she doesn\u2019t even have to talk. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Robin said, casually walking over to her dresser drawer and taking out a couple of old sweatshirts. \u201cAnd what would you think if I said I was considering marrying Cole?\u201d</p><p>Robin expected shouts of glee and wild shrieks, but instead her son crossed his arms over his chest and moved his mouth in odd ways, stretching it to one side and then the other. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She folded and refolded one of the sweatshirts, her heart pounding in anticipation. \u201cIt would mean a lot of changes for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many other people are involved in this?\u201d</p><p>Robin hesitated, not understanding Jeff\u2019s concern. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I get an extra set of grandparents in this deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ... probably. I haven\u2019t talked to Cole about that yet, but I assume so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means extra gifts on my birthday and at Christmas. I say we should go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeffrey Leonard Masterson, you shock me!\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s how a kid thinks.\u201d</p><p>Robin shook her head in dismay at her son\u2019s suddenly materialistic attitude toward her possible marriage. She was still frowning as she stepped outside.</p><p>Cole was in his garage, loading up the trunk of his SUV when Robin joined him. She handed him one small suitcase and a bag of groceries she\u2019d packed at the last minute.</p><p>Cole stowed them away, carefully avoiding her eyes. \u201cI guess you said something to Jeff about us?\u201d She could hear amusement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYes. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brought down a paper bag full of clothes and asked what kind of presents he could expect from my parents at Christmas. He also asked if there were any aunts or uncles in the deal.\u201d Robin\u2019s embarrassment must have showed, because Cole started chuckling.</p><p>\u201cThat boy\u2019s got a mercenary streak in him I knew nothing about,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Cole was still grinning. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, drawing an unsteady breath, eager for this adventure to begin. Jeff and Blackie were already in the backseat when Robin slipped into the front to wait for Cole.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to sing camp songs?\u201d Jeff asked, leaning forward. He didn\u2019t wait for a response, but immediately launched into the timeless ditty about bottles of beer on the wall. He sang ninety-nine verses of that, then performed a series of other songs until they left the freeway and wound up on a narrow country road with almost no traffic.</p><p>Jeff had tired of singing by then. \u201cKnock knock,\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Robin said, falling in with his game.</p><p>\u201cEisenhower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEisenhower who?\u201d</p><p>Jeff snickered. \u201cEisenhower late, how about you?\u201d With that, the ten-year-old broke into belly-gripping guffaws, as if he should be receiving awards for his ability to tell jokes.</p><p>Cole\u2019s mouth was twitching and Robin had to admit she was amused, too.</p><p>\u201cThe turnoff for the ranch is about a mile up the road,\u201d Cole explained. \u201cNow remember, this is going to be a lot like camping. It\u2019s still pretty primitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d Robin said, smiling at him.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Cole slowed, about to turn down the long driveway. It was then that Robin saw the sign. Her heart jumped into her throat and her hands started to shake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d she screamed. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>Cole slammed on the brakes, catapulting them forward. \u201cRobin, what is it?\u201d</p><p>Robin threw open the front door and leapt out of the car, running to the middle of the road. She stared at the one word on the sign even as the tears filled her eyes.</p><p>Cole\u2019s farm was named Paradise.</p> <p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cRobin, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Cole said for the third time, his dark eyes worried.</p><p>\u201cI bet my allowance she\u2019s crying again,\u201d Jeff muttered, poking his head out the side window. \u201cSomething weird\u2019s going on with my mother. She\u2019s been acting goofy all day. Why do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d Cole said as he continued to study Robin.</p><p>For her part, Robin couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the sign. Jeff was right about her crying; the tears streamed unrestrained down her face. But these were tears of joy. Tears of gratitude. Tears of acknowledgment. It was exactly as Cole had described. She\u2019d reached up and God had reached down and together they\u2019d come to an understanding. She\u2019d finally resolved her dilemma.</p> <p>Unable to stop herself, Robin hurled her arms around Cole\u2019s neck. Her hands roamed his face. His wonderful, wonderful face.</p><p>Because her eyes were blurred with emotion, she couldn\u2019t accurately read Cole\u2019s expression, but it didn\u2019t matter. Her heart spilled over with love for him.</p><p>\u201cRobin ... \u201c</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him finish, but began spreading a long series of kisses across his face, starting with his eyelids. \u201cI love you, I love you,\u201d she repeated between kisses, moving from his cheek to his nose and downward.</p><p>Cole put his arms around her waist and pulled her closer. Robin was half-aware of the car door slamming and Jeff marching up the road to join them.</p><p>\u201cAre you two getting all mushy on me again?\u201d</p> <p>Robin barely heard her son. Her mouth had unerringly found Cole\u2019s.</p><p>The unexpected sharp sound of a hand clap brought her out of her dream world. The kiss ended, and her eyes immediately went to Jeff, who was looking very much like a pint-size adult. His face and eyes were stern.</p><p>\u201cDo the two of you know where you\u2019re standing?\u201d Jeff demanded as though he\u2019d recently been hired by the state police to make sure this type of thing didn\u2019t happen. \u201cThere are proper places to kiss, but the middle of the road isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Cole said, his eyes devouring Robin. He clearly didn\u2019t want to release her and did so with a reluctance that tugged at her heart.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Jeff said, taking his mother by the hand and leading her back to the car. He paused in front of the door and frowned. \u201cMaybe she has a fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Cole said, grasping her hand, \u201ccan you explain now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the sign\u2014Paradise. Tell me about it. Tell me why your grandfather named his place Paradise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Cole said, puzzled. \u201cHe lived here his whole life and always said this land was all he\u2019d ever needed. From what I remember, he once told me he thought of this place as the Garden of Eden. I can only assume that\u2019s why he named it Paradise.\u201d</p> <p>Robin nodded, unsurprised by his explanation. \u201cWhen Lenny and I were first married, we talked ... we dreamed about someday buying some land and raising animals. Enough land for Jeff to have a pony and for me to have a huge garden. We decided this land would be our own piece of heaven on earth and ... from that we came up with the idea of naming it Paradise.\u201d</p><p>Cole shook his head slowly, and she could tell he didn\u2019t completely understand.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon, when I was standing on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, you suggested I talk over my feelings about our getting married with Lenny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I suggested,\u201d Cole reminded her, \u201cwas that you imagine what he\u2019d say to advise you. I certainly didn\u2019t expect you to really communicate with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this won\u2019t make any sense to you, but I\u2019ve talked to Lenny lots of times over the years. This afternoon, what hit me so hard was the fact that Lenny would never answer me. That realization was what finally forced me to deal with the pain. To forgive Lenny for dying.\u201d</p><p>Jeff was looking at her in confusion, his mouth open and eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cHere you were wanting to marry me and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I had trouble believing your proposal was prompted by anything more than the desire to replace the family you\u2019d lost. I do love you, and I desperately wanted to believe you loved me\u2014and Jeff. But I wasn\u2019t sure ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded enthusiastically. \u201cYes. With all my heart, I\u2019m confident that marrying you would be the right thing for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to marry Cole!\u201d Jeff cried. \u201cGood grief, all you had to do was ask me and I would\u2019ve told you. We belong together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do, don\u2019t we?\u201d Robin whispered. \u201cCole,\u201d she said, taking both his hands with her own. \u201cI\u2019d consider it a very great honor to become your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff?\u201d Cole said, tearing his eyes away from Robin.</p><p>The boy\u2019s face shone and his eyes sparkled. \u201cI\u2019d consider it a very great honor to become your son.\u201d</p><p>Cole brushed his lips across Robin\u2019s and then reached for Jeff, hauling him into his arms and squeezing him tight. Blackie started barking then, wanting out of the car. Robin quickly moved to open the passenger door, and the black Lab leapt out. She crouched down and wrapped her arms around his thick neck, hugging him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a whole family now, Blackie,\u201d she said happily.</p><p>Two hours later, just at dusk, Robin was standing in the middle of the yard. She\u2019d loved everything about Paradise, just as she\u2019d known she would. The house and property were nothing like the place she and Lenny had dreamed about, but she hadn\u2019t expected them to be. The four-bedroom house was much larger than anything they\u2019d ever hoped to own. The land was covered with Ponderosa pine, and the rocky ground was more suitable to grazing a few sheep or cattle than planting crops.</p><p>Cole was showing Jeff the barn, and Robin had intended to join them, but the evening was redolent with a sweet-smelling breeze and she\u2019d stopped to breathe in the fresh cool air. She folded her arms and stood there, smiling into the clear sky. A multitude of twinkling stars were just beginning to reveal themselves.</p><p>Cole walked quietly up behind her, and slipped his arms around her waist, pulling her against him. \u201cHave I told you how much I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the last fifteen minutes? No, you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen allow me to correct that situation.\u201d He nibbled the back of her neck gently. \u201cI love you to distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He sighed then and whispered hoarsely, \u201cIt was a difficult decision to marry me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Robin agreed with a nod.</p><p>\u201cHad I given you so many reasons to doubt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly, turning in his arms. She pressed her palms against his jaw. \u201cI had to be sure in my heart that you weren\u2019t trying to replace the son you\u2019d lost with Jeff. And I had to be equally certain you loved me for myself and not because I was Jeff\u2019s mother and we came as a package deal.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head decisively. \u201cJeff\u2019s a great kid, don\u2019t get me wrong, but there\u2019s never been any question in my mind about how I felt. The first time we met, you hit me square between the eyes. I didn\u2019t mean to fall in love again. I didn\u2019t even want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I did, either,\u201d Robin confessed.</p><p>\u201cPast experience taught us both that loving someone only causes pain. I loved Jennifer, but I could never make her happy. When we divorced I accepted my role in the breakup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she had a drinking problem, Cole. You can\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, not entirely, but I accept a portion of the blame for what went wrong. It tore me apart to see Bobby caught in the middle, and in an effort to minimize the pain I didn\u2019t fight for custody. He was an innocent victim of the divorce, and I didn\u2019t want him to suffer any further distress. I was willing to do anything I could to spare him. Later, when I realized how serious Jennifer\u2019s problem with alcohol had become, I tried to obtain custody, but before I could get the courts to move on it, the accident happened. Afterward, I was left facing the guilt of having waited too long.</p><p>\u201cThe thought of ever marrying again, having children again, terrified me. I couldn\u2019t imagine making myself vulnerable a second time.\u201d He paused, and a slow, gentle smile spread across his face, smoothing away the tension. \u201cAll of that changed when I met you. It was as if life was offering me another chance. And I knew I had to grab hold of it with both hands or live with regret forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Jeff said as he dashed into the yard. \u201cAre you two at it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking,\u201d Robin explained.</p><p>\u201cYour mouths are too close together for talking.\u201d He strolled past them, Blackie trotting at his side. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you thought about making me anything to eat, did you, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made sandwiches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Are there enough for Blackie to have one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. There\u2019s juice and some corn chips in the kitchen, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Jeff repeated, hurrying into the house.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Robin asked Cole.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he stated emphatically, \u201cbut my appetite doesn\u2019t seem to be for food. How long will you keep me waiting to make you my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to call my parents and my brother so we can arrange everything. It\u2019s important to me that we have a church wedding. It doesn\u2019t have to be fancy, but I\u2019d like to invite a handful of good friends and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make the arrangements? I\u2019m not sure. Three, possibly four months to do it properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne month,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, one month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you exactly thirty days to arrange whatever you want, but that\u2019s as long as I\u2019m willing to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole\u2014\u201d</p><p>He swept her into his arms then and his mouth claimed hers in a fury of desire. Robin found herself trembling and she clutched his shirt, her fingers bunching the material as she strove to regain her equilibrium.</p><p>\u201cCole ...\u201d She felt chilled and feverish at the same time. Needy, yet wealthy beyond her wildest dreams.</p><p>\u201cOne month?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cOne month,\u201d she agreed, pressing her face against his broad warm chest. They\u2019d both loved, profoundly, and lost what they\u2019d valued most. For years, in their own ways, they\u2019d sealed themselves off from others, because no one else could understand their pain. Then they\u2019d discovered each other, and nothing would ever be the same again. Their love was the mature love that came when one had suffered and lost and been left to rebuild a shattered life. A love that was stronger than either could have hoped for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cDo you see what I was telling you?\u201d Jeff muttered to Blackie, sitting on the back porch steps. \u201cI suppose we\u2019re going to have to put up with this for a while.\u201d</p><p>Blackie munched on a corn chip, apparently more interested in sharing Jeff\u2019s meal than listening to his comments.</p><p>\u201cI can deal with it, if you can,\u201d Jeff continued. \u201cI suspect I\u2019ll be getting at least one brother out of this deal, and if we\u2019re lucky maybe two. A sister would be all right, too, I guess\u2014\u201d he sighed deeply \u201c\u2014but I\u2019ll have to think about that.

It\u2019s gonna be Father\u2019s Day soon. My very first. And I\u2019ve already got a card picked out. It\u2019s got a picture of a father, a mother and a boy with a baseball cap. And there\u2019s a dog on it that looks just like you!\u201d</p>   </body></html>"]
