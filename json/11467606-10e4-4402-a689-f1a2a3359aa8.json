The thousands of errands didn't go away. The thousands of obligations felt like they had doubled. Nothing was ever going to be small again. This wasn\u2019t the plan, not that there had ever been one.</p><p>I sighed and turned around. \"Mitch, clean it up for her,\" I said trying not to be angry. She was five and my temper was short fused.</p> <p>He gave me the look his father always gave and rolled his eyes, \"With what?\" The shitty-tween attitude was the icing on the cake of doom, that I was currently being force-fed.</p><p>The traffic slowed, giving me a chance to reach around in my yoga bag for the sweaty towel, I still had not taken out of the van. I flung it over the seat at him.</p><p>\"Jules, no spilling. Mommy can't stop.\" I could, but I was scared of what would happen if I stopped the van and thought, for even a second. Stopping had been bad, thinking had been worse.</p><p>She smiled her bright face and nodded, \"Uhmkay.\" It was more of a sound and less of a word, but she was five and sounds were still huge for her.</p><p>Her bright-blue eyes, and the way she looked up at me through her lashes, the way he used to, brought it on. The tightening of the chest was first. The tears were unstoppable. The minivan didn\u2019t feel as big as it actually was. I was sure it was closing in on me.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t loved me. That also hadn\u2019t ever been part of the plan. I knew we had taken a risk getting married, but the fact he hadn\u2019t loved me, never crossed my mind.</p><p>My body pulled forward, as the need to rock filled me.</p><p>My broken heart wouldn\u2019t stay hidden much longer; it wouldn\u2019t let me be okay in front of them. It forced its way, bursting tears from me and ripping at my chest. A sob slipped from my pressed lips. Everything felt like an avalanche of bad things, and all I could do was watch, as they rolled down the hill and buried me.</p><p>I made the mistake I feared making. I stopped moving. I swerved the van into a motel parking lot on the side of the road and collapsed into the steering wheel. The moving van was keeping my mind moving.</p><p>No sounds escaped my lips. The tears blinded me; at least the van was stopped.</p><p>I heaved, but managed to hold back the noises. Slight whimpers slipped past the hold I had, that trembled like a twig about to snap.</p> <p>\"Mommy, you said you couldn\u2019t stop,\" her squeaky voice broke the silence.</p><p>I moaned slightly as I pressed the button for the music. Philip Philips sang loud and clear, filling the van with fun and fast music.</p><p>I shook for the second I needed and wiped my face. Mitch never looked up from his iPod and Julie colored on her tray, nodding her head to the music. I rocked, ever so slightly.</p><p>I was struggling to get some semblance of control as my body fought for gasps of air. I wiped my face clean and agreed with my brain\u2019s demand of alcohol. I needed a drink.</p><p>I needed so many things... too many.</p><p>I drove back toward the road in silence. The song ended and when a new one came on, I braved a glance at them. Mitch's bright-blue eyes caught mine. He frowned, but I shook my head and smiled at him. Nothing could hide the breakdown, I was about to have. Nothing would make any of it better. I just needed to be alone and let the dam break.</p><p>He had cheated our family, and instead of facing the music like a man, he had died. He didn\u2019t even have the consideration to let me find out, the way I deserved. He had made me the object of gossip. He had made me a fool.</p><p>The funeral home looked exactly how it should. I drove into the parking lot and looked back at Mitch, \"Be right back, okay?\"</p> <p>He nodded. I locked the van and handed him my cell phone. My parenting skills were slowly diminishing. They too, were being smothered by the avalanche of bad things.</p><p>I walked up to the funeral home door where a man with dark hair and dull eyes answered the door, \"Mrs. Evans, I presume?\"</p><p>I nodded. He glanced back at the kids in the van and smiled. It didn't improve the lifelessness in his dark stare, \"They are more than welcome to come in.\"</p><p>I shook my head and walked past him, \"Do you have an office that I can sit in a window and watch them?\"</p><p>He held a hand out, \"Of course we do. This way.\" I walked the way he was pointing and turned to the right, past the doorway.</p><p>He opened the door to an office just past the main area with the pews and podium. I walked in and sat in a small wooden chair. From the window, I could watch my minivan. This wasn\u2019t going to be a habit. I was going to be a better parent than that. Once I buried him and he was gone and I crawled out from under the rubble, I would try harder to be better.</p><p>\"I'm so sorry about your husband,\" he said pleasantly, as he sat in the chair across from me. His way of speaking made me uncomfortable; how many times a day did he have cause for that sentence? How many apologies did he hand out? If he had known about the type of husband I had had, would he still offer condolences, or would I be getting the glass of wine I wanted?</p><p>\"How are they taking it?\" he glanced over his shoulder at the silver van.</p><p>I shook my head blankly, \"They're sad, but it\u2019s just regular sad.\" It was true. They were no sadder than they would have been, if it had been Ralph, our cat. James had always worked away a lot. It wasn\u2019t anything new for them. It made me sadder they accepted it so easily. In the eight weeks since we had learned of his death, they had completed all of their stages of grief. I had to repeat all of mine, when I had found out about the other things.</p><p>I had been the grieving widow for a few days and then the angry ex-wife. Now I was somewhere in the middle, making me a terrible combination of both.</p><p>He nodded, \"Of course they are. How old are they?\"</p><p>I answered him. I didn\u2019t want to, but my mouth wanted to move. I wanted someone to know about my sadness. \"Ten and five. He was having an affair.\" There they were... those words. They slipped out before I could stop them.</p><p>His eyes lifted but he didn\u2019t miss a beat, \"I'm so sorry. That\u2019s a tragedy to lose a father so young.\"</p><p>I hated that word. Lose. I didn\u2019t lose him. They didn\u2019t lose him. He wasn\u2019t lost, he was dead and so was I.</p><p>I would never be whole again. James and the kids had been my everything, because I made them that way. I believed his lies and drank the Kool-Aid, and not even the funeral director would pay attention to the pain that I had laid out for him so clearly. He moved past it, like he didn\u2019t hear it, but we both still felt it there in the air where I had left it. James was having an affair and no one cared.</p><p>\u201cThe kids bounce back faster than we do,\u201d he said softly, letting that be his comment on the subject.</p><p>But I was having a sickeningly hard time, making my kids be my everything or the focus. Their pain had somehow taken a serious backseat to the betrayal, I had let overcome me.</p><p>Being a mom used to be the easy part, but my pity and shame had gotten bigger than I could handle. They had joined the avalanche and I was buried.</p><p>\"Do you have any questions?\" he asked.</p><p>I snapped back, \"Costs mostly.\" I felt hollow and dead.</p><p>Somehow the director of the funeral home was calming with his general lack of personality. He made me numb, as if I were dead inside like him. His dark hair had no sheen and his dark eyes were lifeless. He was surrounded by so much death that he actually seemed dead. He was a vacuum that pulled all of my emotions away, leaving us both hollow shells.</p><p>He clasped his hands, \"Of course. Well, the military covers some of the funeral costs for a man like him, but the remaining balance will be yours. The VA only covers about three hundred dollars of our bill for a person not on active duty, at the time of death. The remaining few thousand will have to be covered by you.\" He didn't sugarcoat it. I didn't mind that. I think I preferred the fact he was dead inside too.</p><p>\"Can I write you a cheque?\" I asked calmly.</p><p>He nodded and put his cold pale hands on his cherry-wood desk, \"Of course. The service is planned for Sunday, still?\"</p><p>I nodded and shivered and fought the dark places my brain wanted to go, \u201cIt is. They finally cleared the body.\u201d The military had been slow to transport him home and even slower to release his remains.</p><p>He slid a document to me and passed me a pen. I took it and signed where the red lines were. My fingers shook, making my name look different than it ever had. It wasn\u2019t my name, not really. It was the name of a lady who was married to a guy named James Evans. A man who loved his family, worked hard, and made his wife feel like she was safe.</p><p>That lady was gone and I was left in her stead. I didn\u2019t know what my next move was, but the safety was gone, and the love was entirely based on his being with me. The love and warmth left with him.</p><p>I was stuck living behind the wall of bullshit he had built around us. The wall I never bothered to try to climb and see the world for what it really was.</p><p>I choked out a sob and stood up quickly, \"Thank you.\" I scribbled on a cheque and left it on the desk. I turned and ran to the van, clicking the unlock button like it was broken.</p><p>Inside the van, I wanted to lose it. I wanted to let myself slip into it, but they were watching me. I wiped my face and smiled, \"MacDonald's?\"</p><p>Mitch wrinkled his nose and shook his head, \"Grandma took us there yesterday. Can you just make eggs like Dad used to, with the hole in the bread?\"</p><p>My heart broke and my lip quivered as the tears flooded my face. The sounds coming from me were evidence of the struggle I was facing. I nodded, \"Yeah,\" and started the van.</p><p>Julie started to cry, \"Mommy. Mommy.\" She sobbed with me, wiggling in her seat. She always cried when I did. Mitch wiped his eyes and looked down. I unbuckled my seatbelt and jumped from the van. I opened the sliding door with a savage jerk and ripped her from the chair, smothering her with my love, trying not to get any of my self-pity on her. The smell of raspberry shampoo in her golden curls seeped into my bones. I sobbed into her neck and waved at Mitch to come to me. He climbed forward. I grabbed his arm and dragged him to me. I wrapped myself around them as much as I could. I needed to shield them. They didn\u2019t deserve the fate they got, and they didn\u2019t need to know what all was in the package deal. They didn\u2019t need to know about the wall of bullshit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The heaving, yet silent cries tearing from me, were painful. They made a sickening ache inside of me. It was like they were bouncing around in the hollowed walls that were once my chest.</p><p>My head and neck were soaked from their tears as wails of the word \"Mommy\" filled my dark hair.</p><p>We moved like an ocean of misery, rocking and swaying into each other, like we rode painful torrents of heartache. The blinding pain inside of me would never go away. Betrayal was a terrible feeling; it overshadowed the grief tenfold.</p> <p>\"I love you, babies,\" I whispered when I ran out of tears.</p><p>\"I love you too. Can we go home and have eggs?\" Jules asked and wiped her little chubby cheeks. She was so matter-of-fact. I laughed and wiped my face. I could at least be grateful, their pain was never going to be as bad as mine was. I would guarantee they would be spared the details.</p><p>We sniffled and smiled and tried to be strong the whole ride home. I parked the van in the driveway and looked at my house. It was nice\u2014fancy even. We lived a good life. I was grateful at least all of that would still be there... our life that we built together. We were two crazy military intelligence officers who fell in love and got pregnant and then married. We were happy against all of the odds that everyone believed would destroy our marriage. No one believed I could be capable of being a housewife.</p><p>We had been cocky in our ability to make a marriage out of nothing; it had been easy.</p><p>Of course, that was because it was a fa\u00e7ade.</p> <p>His smile was gone forever, but it still broke my heart every time I saw it in my mind. The fake him with the fake smile would have to live on in our children. My heart was no longer going to allow him to take up space.</p><p>I had to shut him out of it. I had to let him and his filth die together.</p><p>I climbed out of the van and looked at the ringette and hockey gear against the other door. How would I afford it all? The money from the insurance was going to have to last the year until Jules started school full-time and then the rest would have to go to their schooling.</p><p>I stared at the gear and shook my head. Baseball, soccer, dancing, skating, ringette, swimming and hockey. Two kids who played two sports a season. It never felt like too much before, but that was before I needed time scheduled for my daily dose of self-pity and a nap. I closed the van and added it to the list of shit I still didn\u2019t have a plan for, which was everything. I wasn\u2019t going to make it past his funeral, I was sure of that.</p><p>My mom opened the door and smiled at me. She hugged Jules and rubbed Mitch's head. She was my godsend. I wished Dad were there for the second I had to watch them embracing. Her eyes were sweet and kind, soft brown and gentle, but they looked worried. She nodded at me, \"There is a man in the office. A Mr. Wilkes. He was James' attorney.\"</p><p>I swallowed and cringed inwardly. I didn\u2019t want to see anyone. I wanted a hot bath and a glass of red and to be left with my tears and my plans.</p> <p>\"I don't know a Mr. Wilkes,\" I said softly.</p><p>\"Well, he\u2019s in the office. I'll make them some supper.\" She pulled the kids in the house and smiled at me.</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I called after her.</p><p>She laughed and walked away, \"Worry about the important stuff, Evie.\" She walked into the kitchen and started making noise. The kid\u2019s spoke to her about their day, she made things normal.</p><p>I placed my coat down and walked down the hall to the office. I swallowed and opened the door to the study. An older man with glasses and a wrinkled face put his fingers to his lips, like he was pretending to scratch, \"Mrs. Evans, it's so nice to see you again.\"</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand, but I went along with it and nodded, \"Yes. How are you?\" The question felt forced and awkward. I hadn\u2019t played this game in a long time, and just the thought of it made my insides ache.</p><p>He smiled gently and placed a package in my hands. He leaned in and whispered softly, \"Meet me outside in five minutes. We can take a walk. Don't bring the package. Leave it in here.\"</p><p>My stomach sunk.</p> <p>He pulled back and spoke in a loud voice, \"Everything you need is in the package; the instructions are there. Everything is explained. Have a nice evening.\" He nodded and walked from the room. He was the first person not to tell me he was sorry for my loss.</p><p>He closed the door and I took a deep breath. I looked around the room and wondered what he was whispering for, who he was, and what on earth I was holding? Was I being brought back in? Could they do that? Could I do it? It would solve my money issues, but I needed to be a mom for my children.</p><p>I sighed and sat in the chair behind me; the government could do anything they wanted.</p><p>His whispering and telling me not to bring the envelope, made me wonder if it was bugged. I could only assume if it was bugged, I was being brought back in.</p><p>I felt sickness rolling around inside of me, as I slid my finger along the taped edge and braced myself for it.</p><p>I stared down into the huge envelope. It contained three small things; a phone, a Visa card, and a smaller envelope. The name on the Visa was an old name I had used once in Bangladesh, on a mission.</p><p>My world spun. I felt as if I were outside of myself looking in. I stared at the name so long, my eyes fuzzed out on the letter. Macy Green...she was a dead travel agent.</p><p>The door opened, making me jump up as I placed the envelope on the shelf next to me.</p><p>\"You want dinner too?\" Mom asked, giving me a weird smile. She looked around the room.</p><p>I shook my head and walked past her, \"I need some air.\" I walked down the hall and grabbed my coat. I pulled it on and looked back at her, \"Be right back.\"</p><p>She tilted her head and watched me for a second, before her kind look returned. She knew the routine. I could see it in her eyes. She had played this game for a long time too.</p><p>I leaned in and kissed her cheek, \"Thanks.\" What I didn\u2019t say was thanks for not asking and not needing to know. She never did, even when it had been my dad with the secrets and lies. She smiled and pretended everything was fine. She trusted. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, which parent had been right. The blind one who smiled through it all, or the one building the wall of bullshit. Having been on both sides, I preferred to know what I was facing.</p><p>Her hands wrapped around my head, squeezing and holding me there, with a tremble. She whispered, \"Hurry back. I'll keep a plate warm for you.\"</p><p>I pulled back and walked through the front door. Mr. Wilkes waited across the street.</p><p>Dressed in a trench coat and dark slacks, he looked like a lawyer, but I didn\u2019t know what to expect from him. He could be one of them.</p><p>My arms crept across my body, wrapping around me before I could even stop myself. I was holding myself together. I was vulnerable. I didn\u2019t need to hide it; he already knew it, if he had been watching me.</p><p>\"You\u2019re in a situation,\" his bold words stunned me.</p><p>I stopped and watched his face for a sign of anger or violence. I would have to run, I was pretty sure I couldn\u2019t fight anymore.</p><p>He waited for me to hear his words and process them before he continued, \"I'm not sure what your husband did for a living, beyond his day job. I'm not sure what you know, but I am sure you're in a terrible bind.\" He started walking away from me but continued talking as he walked, \"He has left you a rather large pile to clean up.\"</p><p>I jogged and caught up, \"What do you mean?\" Am I not being brought back in?</p><p>He shook his head, \"I can't say, but I do know that there is a man who requested that package be delivered to you. Your husband owed him everything.\"</p><p>I swallowed hard and tried to imagine how that was possible. Had he been gambling? After the other deeds I had learned about, gambling seemed like a rather small thing.</p><p>He looked at me with emotions filling his stare, \"The man who now owns you...is trouble.\" He looked around us, nervously.</p><p>I scowled, \"No one owns me, Mr. Wilkes.\"</p><p>He ignored me and continued, \"He is the worst of the worst. He owns your house, your van, your life. He has information on you, crucial information. He can make it look like you have done things. I have seen it.\"</p><p>I stopped walking. The words wouldn\u2019t sink in, I wouldn\u2019t let them. I didn\u2019t have any responses. I was already over my head in the debris my marriage had created.</p><p>He glanced back at me casually, \"Do you understand me?\"</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>He looked at my neighbor's houses and turned around, \"Your husband did something. I don\u2019t know what. But the man who sent that package, is the one who now owns your life. You're alive because he says it's okay for you to be alive.\" He looked wicked in the gloomy, dim light of dusk, as it fell upon my lush and rich neighborhood. It felt clandestine\u2014something I had not felt in a long time.</p><p>I frowned, \"What?\" Of course, I had heard of it. People disappearing because of the intel they had or being tried as traitors for crimes we all knew they hadn\u2019t committed. It was like the military\u2019s version of a ghost story. \"Is the man military?\" I asked. I could be tried as a traitor for the things I had done before.</p><p>He nodded, \"I would imagine something along those lines, or drugs, or weaponry. I am guessing, but I'm just a lawyer and a messenger.\" His words remained cold, but his eyes warmed to me. He took a step forward and put his hands on my arms. He gripped and looked into my eyes deeply, \"You are in danger. Your husband is dead and his debt is now yours. Do you understand me?\"</p><p>My military training slowly crept back in. I nodded, like a good soldier.</p><p>He smiled, but I could see the panic in his eyes, \"You have tonight to run. Take your kids and your mother and run. Be fast and silent and find a new life. You know how to do it. You know how to disappear. As of Sunday, they're coming for you. You will be contacted either by that phone or by messenger at your dead husband's funeral.\"</p><p>I took a step back, \"What am I going to do?\" My heart was in my throat.</p><p>He shook his head and I watched him shut the emotion off, \"I wanted to warn you. I knew your father. He was a good man and because of him, I wanted you to have the chance to run. I know very little of the details. What I do know is, if you get wrapped up in this, it will be bad for you. You and your kids and your dear mother.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The momma bear anger lashed out. I shoved him back, \"You leave my fucking kids out of this. You tell your boss to go fuck himself. Whatever James did, he did on his own. I had no hand in it.\"</p><p>He put his hands in the air, \"I am the messenger, I didn\u2019t have to warn you. I wanted to warn you. You have to run, Mrs. Evans. Run and never look back.\"</p><p>I looked down at my feet, still keeping my eyes on him and shook my head, \"You have to be mistaken. You have to be at the wrong house. My husband may have been a lot of things, but he wouldn\u2019t endanger his children.\"</p> <p>The emotion crept back into his eyes, \"He obviously didn\u2019t think he had a choice, and I think if you stay, you'll see that you don\u2019t either. Knowing my employers, James did what he did to keep you and the kids safe.\"</p><p>I scowled and walked back toward my house, \"He died.\" It was bullshit, somehow it had to be.</p><p>He called after me, \"He did. His usefulness must have run out.\" He snatched my hand lightning fast and pulled me back to him, \"No matter what, if you stay, don't let your usefulness run out.\"</p><p>I looked at the severity in his eyes and jerked my hand free. I jogged back to my driveway. I turned and watched him climb into his Saab and drive away. The empty cold inside of me grew as I wondered what the fuck had just happened, and what the even-bigger fuck James had done to me? Was I really that stupid? Had I really been that blind?</p><p>Chapter Two - The Con job</p> <p>The phone rang from inside of the package as I sat on the bed and stared at his pillow. I wanted to burn the damned pillow in the outdoor fireplace, but I was scared of the smell and the possibility it would get out of control and burn the house to the ground. Ideas flashed through my head as I wondered if we could fake our deaths? I knew how, but I needed documents and passports and things I didn\u2019t even know where to get anymore.</p><p>I looked at my Lulu yoga pants crumpled on the floor in a pile, next to my PTA binder and laughed. Who was I kidding? I hadn\u2019t worked in too long to remember how to do any of it. I grabbed his pillow and threw it across the room. The smell of him wafted in the air. I gagged but it turned into a sob. The ringing of the phone in the package never seemed to stop. It was trying to drive me insane.</p><p>We had been partners once. How could he have kept secrets so serious that they endangered his kids and me? I wondered if the bad man knew about the mistresses? Did they know he had affairs? Were they tormenting those women too or just me?</p><p>I racked my brain to try to remember a moment from when James spoke of work to me. I needed to try to remember if any of it seemed out of place and would trigger a work memory.</p><p>There was nothing. He had kept his work away from the house. I assumed, out of respect for me, the stay-at-home mom who had given up her dreams of being an intelligence officer. I could see that was not the case. Had he talked to me about the cases he was on, perhaps I would have seen the discrepancies in what he was doing. Then I would have known he was corrupt.</p><p>The fear grew as I watched the package shudder with the vibration of the ringing phone.</p> <p>I mentally slapped myself. There was a very strong possibility this was a con. I could be about to be ripped off by hackers. I needed to go to the police like any civilian.</p><p>I wasn't an idiot; I wasn't born yesterday. I was a strong ex-military, mother of two. Those traits were far more important than the fact I was now a widow or a cuckolded fool. Could women be cuckolded? It didn\u2019t matter\u2014the result was the same.</p><p>I lay on my side of the bed and planned my next move. If I didn\u2019t answer the constantly-ringing phone, I could pretend it hadn\u2019t happened for the next little bit, while I planned. I wasn\u2019t going to be the victim of a con artist, set on stealing from lonely widows. Before I could go to the police, I needed to know what I was dealing with. The military was amazing at creating the outcome they desired. If it was a prank, they were messing with the wrong widow. But then again, how did they know about Macy Green? I yawned and all the fight in me slipped away. The tired depression crept back in. I fell asleep with my face in my pillow and denial tucking me in.</p><p>I woke to Jules crawling around on the bed, poking me.</p><p>\"What's this?\" she asked. \"Mommy.\" She shook me.</p><p>I opened one crusty eye and noticed the phone in her hand. She held it to her face.</p><p>\"Helloooooooo,\" she spoke into it exaggeratedly.</p><p>I sat up, swaying from the dizziness of the sudden wake up and shook my head, snatching the phone from her hands, \"NO!\" I shouted. I looked at the screen and jumped when I saw a face.</p> <p>A young man's face.</p><p>He smiled pleasantly, \"Hi.\"</p><p>I panicked and wildly tapped at the red button on the bottom of the screen. I dropped the phone in my lap. The face... did I know it? Did I know him? He looked young and seemed polite even. Maybe it was a number she accidentally dialed. She had FaceTime on her iPad. She had done it before with my mom and James when he was off on mission.</p><p>I lifted my face from the phone to see her eyes getting red. Her eyes watered but she refused to cry, like I always did when I was her age. The closer I got to forty, the more likely I was to cry at even a commercial.</p><p>I pulled her in, \"Sorry, Jules. It's not my phone. You can't touch it.\"</p><p>I needed to get the phone to the police. I needed to report the whole thing, before they conned another woman who would buy the whole bullshit. But first, I needed to know if pounds of coke would be found in my underwear drawer, because I didn\u2019t play ball. If they knew about Macy Green, they must have known about the things I\u2019d done. If they could hack the system well enough to find out about my alias, then they could hack it for the other things and frame me.</p><p>The house phone rang. I almost shouted not to answer it, but Mitch walked into my room, looking sleepy and tossed the phone at me. He turned and walked back out, no doubt going back to bed.</p><p>I grabbed the phone and looked at the number before answering, \"Hi, Mom,\" I sighed with relief.</p><p>\"Honey, I had to leave early this morning, but I wanted to tell you, that nice lady from the flower place called this morning. She said that the cheque you gave her bounced.\" She sounded confused. I would have been too, had I not spent the morning stressing about a certain con job. They had already stolen my money.</p><p>But then a terrifying thought flashed through me\u2014what if it was real, and it was one of two scenarios? One, being my husband, who had not only had affairs on me, but also must have betrayed someone high up, who was bent on getting revenge. Or two\u2014he actually sold secrets. Either way, I was screwed.</p><p>My eyes flickered on our daughter on my bed. I couldn\u2019t lose it yet. I had to remain calm. I sighed like I was inconvenienced and muttered, \"Can you stop by and give her some cash? I'll pay you back.\"</p><p>I heard traffic in the background of her cell phone, \"Sure, sweetie. Are you okay?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I must have used old cheques or something. I don\u2019t know where anything is. You know James did everything like that.\" I was kicking myself as I spoke; how could I have let him have all the power? How could I have trusted that man with everything? How could he leave me with all this to contend with?</p><p>\"Sure thing. You have some catching up to do then I guess, huh?\" Her tone was the mom-tone that still had not accepted the fact I was an adult. Not that my life looked that way. It looked like children were running it. I had more faith in Jules and Mitch, than their father.</p><p>I covered my eyes and held my face tightly, as I clicked the phone off and slumped.</p><p>\"Who was it?\" Jules asked in her squeaky voice. I lifted my face and smiled, \"Grandma.\"</p><p>She climbed off the bed and ran out of the room. I heard her playing with Monster High dolls, as I fell back to sleep. Denial still felt better than coping.</p><p>I woke to a strange sensation. The room was dark, which meant the day was gone. I wasn\u2019t certain what my kids had been doing for most of it\u2014okay all of it. I blinked up at the ceiling. Something vibrated under me. I fished the moving thing out from under my butt, when it vibrated again. I turned it in my hands only to see the same face staring at me. I must have pressed accept to the FaceTime call as I grabbed it.</p><p>His voice was pleasant, \"You look lovely, Mrs. Evans, those pajamas are becoming on you. You must meet Mr. Cooper in an hour at the Ritz, in the Boston Harbor hotel district. I'll meet you in the lobby.\" The handsome young face was gone instantly.</p><p>My fingers shook as cold sweat covered me. I picked my cell phone up from the bedside table and dialed my mom's cell. Instead of ringing, an automated message spoke, \"Nine-ten-three-two\u2014we are sorry but your phone is not activated. Please call to speak to a representative.\"</p><p>I pressed the phone off and looked at it. My phone wasn\u2019t active. Chills ran up my spine. Chills caused by memories of taking away people's rights. I had done all of this before to other people. I grabbed the house phone from my bed and pressed it on. A busy signal rang through it.</p><p>I scrambled from the bed, throwing on a pair of yoga pants and a sweater. I pulled my hair back into a ponytail and ran from the room pulling on my socks.</p><p>\"Mitch?\" I called. \"Mitch, Jules?\"</p><p>My stomach dropped.</p><p>I ran down the stairs screaming, \"MITCH!\" Oh my God, my kids were gone.</p><p>\"Mom?\" he called from the kitchen. I stumbled in seeing him with a spaghetti noodle across his lips like a mustache and Jules trying to make one with the noodle in her hand. She sat on the counter next to my mom who was stirring a pot.</p><p>I took a breath, clutching my chest.</p><p>All three wore the same confused face.</p><p>I stammered, \"Uhm...I-I gave the wrong cheques to everyone. I have to run out and give cash to people.\"</p><p>My mom gave me a look. I shook my head. She sighed and turned back to the pasta. She knew the look on my face. She knew the tone of a well-laid lie.</p><p>\"Sorry!\" I yelled and ran for the garage. I shoved my feet in sneakers, jumped in James' car, and hit the garage door opener. I clutched the phone in my hand and backed out like a madwoman.</p><p>\"Mr. Cooper?\" I muttered while drumming on the steering wheel. The name meant nothing to me, \"Who is Mr. Cooper?\" I got out onto the 90 and was just passing Auburndale, when I realized how similar it all felt. I had done a job just like this one. I knew there was still a distinct possibility I was being conned, but I was doubting it more with every mile I drove. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I decided to try something and looked at the phone. I picked it up and dialed 9-1-1 with it. Instantly, the young man's face was there, smiling at me on the FaceTime again, \"Hi,\" he said.</p><p>I frowned, trying to see behind him in the picture, \"What do you want?\"</p><p>He shook his head, \"Just for you to survive all this and not make the same mistake your husband made. You're of use to him alive for now, but you need to remember, that he doesn\u2019t care if your sweet old mom takes care of the kids for the rest of their lives.\"</p> <p>I gulped, \"Why are you doing this to me?\" My throat was almost frozen. I felt sickened.</p><p>He shook his head again, \"I don\u2019t know. It isn\u2019t me. I'm just the receptionist of sorts.\"</p><p>His blue eyes would be burned into my mind forever.</p><p>\"Are you hackers?\" I asked.</p><p>He laughed, \"I guess, sort of. Look, just do as he asks. He doesn\u2019t do well with insubordination.\"</p> <p>Rage filled me, \"You aren\u2019t even old enough to spell that word, you little shit.\" My spit hit the screen. He gave me a perplexed look and then he was gone, again. Annoying little dick.</p><p>I screamed and threw the phone.</p><p>I could drive back and get my kids, but where would I go with no money and no house. My mom's old-age pension and Dad's retirement was great, but it wasn\u2019t going to get us all by. Especially, not if we were trying to live off grid and be on the run from the government, trying to control every facet of my life.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want that. The life we led was something I didn\u2019t want to give up. My kids went to the best schools in Weston. The community was amazing. How could I remove them from everything they knew, after everything they'd been through? I could run, but what kind of life was that??</p><p>My brain whispered that it was better than death.</p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror and shook my head. How had I bought it all? How had I believed all the lies? I was starting to feel like a broken record.</p> <p>I gripped the steering wheel, as angry tears streamed down my cheeks. I wiped them away and parked a couple blocks from the hotel. I needed the air before I had to face Mr. Cooper.</p><p>I strolled up in the damp air of the post-rain evening. The bellhop greeted me with a quizzical brow.</p><p>\"Good evening, ma'am.\" He opened the door for me. I smirked at his Boston accent. It always reminded me of Matt Damon.</p><p>I entered the lobby and was instantly greeted by the young man I had just raged at on the phone. He walked to me and grinned, \"Floor 23, suite 2304.\" He walked past me like he hadn\u2019t meant to speak to me at all, like the kids downtown who offered drugs in muttered words.</p><p>I paused and watched, surely covered in confusion, as he left the building. Swallowing my nerves, I turned back to the lobby. It was busy, bustling and moving with people who had no clue about the things happening in front of them. I was being victimized within reach of each of them.</p><p>Surely, I could just reach out and touch one of them to explain. Maybe I could cry, I was on the verge of tears again anyway. One of them would help me, would they not?</p><p>In the moment I felt like doing it, a woman walked up to me with a patronizing look on her face, \"Are you lost?\" she asked.</p><p>I opened my mouth but nothing came out. The fears of what would happen to my aging mother and two children flashed through my mind. There wouldn\u2019t even be enough money to bury me, if everything was really in his name.</p> <p>I shook my head and walked past her, \"Just thought I forgot something.\"</p><p>She nodded and smiled and I wanted to slap the look off her face. It wasn\u2019t a rational response, but I didn\u2019t think I had any of those left. There was a me that no one had seen in a long time, and I was terrified she would find her way out of me, like a demon.</p><p>The elevator doors opened to the bellhop inside smiling at me, \"What floor?\"</p><p>I closed my eyes and stepped inside of the large space, \"Twenty-three.\"</p><p>He nodded, \"You having a lovely evening?\"</p><p>The doors closed, sealing my fate. I looked at my reflection in the shiny doors and nodded my head, like a good soldier, \"Very lovely.\"</p><p>He smiled back at me, \"Excellent.\"</p><p>I had a hard time recognizing the face in the shiny metal. I didn\u2019t know her anymore. The dead lifeless look in her eyes was one I had tried to forget about.</p><p>The elevator landed smoothly. When I stepped off, I felt a rush of fear and regret. I glanced back at the man inside.</p><p>He looked up from the buttons and frowned, \"You alright?\"</p><p>I swallowed the bile in the back of my throat down and nodded, \"Have a nice night,\" I muttered.</p><p>The stricken look on my face must have shocked him. He didn\u2019t reply. He looked like he wanted to stop the doors from closing but he didn\u2019t. I could have reached out for him, and he might have offered me help, but what could he do? What could I do?</p><p>I was frozen, staring at the doors and the distorted face of the girl in the brushed-metal door. My breath had frozen somewhere in my chest, trapped by the pounding heartbeat and terror of the unknown.</p><p>My legs and arms started to feel numb.</p><p>The phone vibrated in my pocket, startling me. I jumped and turned. Pulling the phone out, I looked at the number calling but didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>I tapped the green button and held it to my ear, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\"I put some money in the meter for you, before I realized it's nighttime and the parking was free,\" the voice of the young man rang into the phone.</p><p>I clicked the phone off and walked down the corridor.</p><p>He was at my vehicle. He could tamper with the brakes or steering. He could plant a bomb. Is that what happened to James? Did they damage his rental car, killing him? Or did they just kill him, and send those poor men dressed in uniform to my door, to lie to me about how it happened?</p><p>When had I become so trusting, that I never even suspected it was a job and not a regular death.</p><p>Feelings mixed with fears inside of me, leaving me with sensations even James' death hadn't made me feel. The sickening feeling of being trapped and lost overwhelmed me. It was almost kindred to the feeling of finding out he was fucking everything that moved, on the PTA. Well\u2014at least the two I knew about.</p><p>The suite number was directly ahead of me. I took deep breaths to stop the feeling that I would be sick any second. Maybe it would be nothing, just some intel on something I could get quickly. I nodded to myself, but laughed inside. Nothing was ever easy with them and besides, what Intel experience did I have left? It had been ten years since I had worked at all, and James had been very good at keeping the top-secret security clearance information to himself.</p><p>I licked my lips, nodding to myself. The least I could do, was hear them out.</p><p>But no matter what they had to say, I had to protect my children. They could still be little hacker shits who wanted to steal my identity. I would finish the funeral arrangements and let them have it. Evie Evans was never a great identity anyway.</p><p>I knocked once, softly. I didn't have the strength for anything else.</p><p>The door opened, swinging slowly. My breath was lodged in my throat. I held it as I stepped into the dimly-lit suite. The back of a man in a dress shirt and slacks walked away from me. He opened the door and turned his back on me? Bizarre? Maybe I knew him.</p><p>He had short, dark hair that was styled in a military cut, only slightly longer. That didn\u2019t sit well with me. His broad shoulders and thick arms looked the part.</p><p>Seeing him made me wish it were just hackers.</p><p>\"Close the door,\u201d his deep voice commanded, not in a bark but more of an arrogant tone. It struck a nerve with me.</p><p>He was military.</p><p>He could whisper it and my old, long-buried, soldier self would obey.</p><p>I closed the door and pressed my back against it. From the darkness of the long corridor I could see a fair amount of the suite. It had a view of the dark night and the city lights. He disappeared around a corner.</p><p>\"Come in here, Evie,\" he spoke my first name like I was a child, confirming my fears that he was military. I would bet a limb on it. I gripped the handle of the door and wondered how long it would take him to catch me. His long, strong body would be able to beat me in a foot race, but if I had the advantage of a head start... maybe... no. I was a distance runner not a sprinter. His thick legs said sprinter.</p><p>I swallowed and let go of the cold, metal handle, letting the door close and seal my fate. My steps felt thick and hindered by the nerves and fear dumping hormones into my body. Adrenaline, then cortisol, and finally noradrenalin. I was walking with concrete boots, by the time I got moving.</p><p>I crept along, unprepared for what I would find, when his deep voice spoke again from around the corner, \"I guess we should get right to it then. Your grades in high school were quite good. Your first four years of service were exemplary, getting you into Fort Huachuca easily, after BT and the mandatory four years. You went through the paces and ended up in CI. Your higher-ups had no issues with you in Counter Intelligence, and even recommended you for promotions, which you declined and retired, exactly at the eight-year mark. Sound right?\"</p><p>A memory attached itself to every single word he said: happy times, hard struggles, James courting me and getting me pregnant, me quitting for the sake of the baby. I entered the room, catching a look on his face in the far corner, where he sat drinking an amber liquid from a rock glass.</p><p>His face was incredible looking\u2014young, but incredible. I took a breath when I saw the cold look in his eyes and tensed face.</p><p>He was military. Cold steel-blue eyes, square jaw, strong nose, long thick neck, arrogant look on his tanned face. He was military and there was no doubt. That meant I was screwed.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, \"Well?\"</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He pointed at a chair, \"Have a seat.\" It wasn't a question. I walked to the chair and sat on pins and needles.</p><p>He sat back, taking me in. A grin crept across his lips. That arrogant smile was part of the kit when you started in CI. He was Intelligence. He was like me.</p><p>\"Do you have any idea what your husband has been doing the last ten years, while you were having kids and driving them to play dates?\" His tone mocked me. I shook my head and looked down. He drank the last of the liquid and stood. He walked to the bar set up in the corner by the window and nodded his head, \"James was good at keeping secrets. That was about his only redeeming quality.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was confused. I wanted to defend James and say he was an amazing father, incredible husband, and kind soul. But I assumed we both knew the truth of all of it.</p><p>\"James worked for Counter Intelligence. He failed at what he was asked to do. You will have to take it over. You have been named in the intel we have.\" I could hear the liquid pouring as he spoke the simplest, and yet most complicated words, I'd ever heard.</p><p>I lifted my eyes, \"Named? What?\" It came out before I had a chance at articulating my confusion.</p> <p>He turned with two drinks. He placed one on the coffee table across from me and sat again, \"You only had eight years service, when you went on maternity leave?\"</p><p>Did he just make finger quotations when he said maternity leave?</p><p>He grinned at the look on my face, \"So that makes me senior officer here. I think if you want to get snarky, you can add a Sir to the end of that question.\"</p><p>I felt a homicidal look creep across my face.</p><p>He shrugged it off, \"Or Cooper. When you get to know me better, you can call me Coop.\" He winked. It was the first playful thing I had seen. It disturbed me, considering we just finished the conversation where he put the finger quotations up for maternity leave, like it wasn't a legit reason to quit.</p> <p>I reached for the glass. Holding it made me feel better, like it grounded me. I sipped the scotch. I hadn\u2019t drunk anything but red wine since I'd joined the mommy brigade. They had rules and liking red wine was one of them. I always assumed it was because Dr. Oz had mentioned it a few times. Those women were nuts for Dr. Oz. He could say smearing your own spit across your forehead was a way to stop cancer and they'd do it.</p><p>The scotch burned my throat, but I chugged the whole glass back like I was a sorority girl and placed it back down. He watched me with a half grin. The fact he was still a child himself, made me feel better. He hadn\u2019t killed my husband, it had been an accident, and this was an act to try to bully me back to work. I could handle a whippersnapper like him.</p><p>I cleared my throat and started, \"I am flattered you think I have retained even an ounce of the training I had before. I haven\u2019t, but thank you. That actually made my day. You ruined the rest of it, of course, by bouncing all my cheques and freezing everything. You've terrified me by making me think I had hackers trying to steal my life.\" I took a breath, \"Sweet God. I don\u2019t understand why on earth you would want someone like me to help you. I'm under-qualified, under-trained, completely in the dark about the technological advances you've made in the decade I've been off, and I'm really busy as a mom...\"</p><p>\"Stop!\" he cut me off. My mouth hung open as he shook his head, \"Seriously\u2014I didn\u2019t sign up for this shit. It wasn\u2019t us freezing accounts. Your name came up in Intel. I'm here to handle you, that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t want to hear about your bake sales and shit.\"</p><p>I closed my mouth and watched his face change. The playful face and cocky grin were gone. He was back to being senior officer in the room. \"James and the man you'll have to get close to, did this to you. We need your help to fix it, but that wasn\u2019t us. You need it fixed as much as we do.\"</p><p>Heat crept up my face; I hated the way he controlled the conversation.</p> <p>I frowned, \"That lawyer...\"</p><p>He laughed cutting me off again, \"Wasn\u2019t working for us. We jacked the phone they were bringing you, that\u2019s all. You think we want you in our employment, no offense, but you're right. You're under-qualified, out of shape, outdated like the suits in the offices, and frankly, you don\u2019t seem like you take things seriously. Having to handle you is going to be a fucking nightmare. You'll be expecting to still act like a civi, and I'll have to swoop in and stop everyone from killing you, every minute of the day. Do you even remember any of your training? You are in over your head, but I'm being told this is how it is. I get your dad was a hero, but seriously sweetheart, you are out of your league.\"</p><p>I snapped, \"You little shit, I am not out of shape. I ran a marathon three months ago. I ran the Boston Marathon and I got a good time. I...\"</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings.\u201d He laughed bitterly, discounting my obvious accomplishments, \"But for the job I'm asking you to do, you're outdated. But, we're stuck with you, as much as you're stuck with us. The man your husband double-crossed this country for, killed him. He thinks you know things. The intel is that you're up on the roster as the next piece in his puzzle. He owns you. Are you ready for this?\"</p><p>I laughed, \"I don\u2019t know anything.\"</p><p>He shook his head, \"As far as my pay grade goes, you have a piece of the puzzle.\"</p><p>I looked at the glass and shook my head. I stood and walked to the bar and poured another glass, drinking it back fast. \"No. I don\u2019t know anything. He never told me anything. I want protection and to be moved out of the country.\"</p><p>He sighed, \"The higher-ups don\u2019t want you to hide; they want you to play ball. We've had your house bugged for a few months. We know James never told you anything. We have been watching you.\" I could hear his footsteps behind me. Suddenly his body was directly behind mine, towering over me. He bent and whispered in my ear softly, \"Let me just start by saying, you sing beautifully in the shower.\"</p> <p>My eyes bugged open. He poured another drink for us both and carried them back to the table, \"This is the plan. You will take the phone call from the man planning on calling you or meeting with you. We will reinstate your wages, at your husband's current salary, and put it in a new account that we will have opened for you. Hopefully, he won\u2019t know and you\u2019ll be able to continue paying your bills. You will help us to find out what the man wants with you and what your husband told him.\" He sat down and sipped. I clutched the bar, taking deep breaths.</p><p>I turned and walked back to the chair, \"What if I can't? What if they just want to kill me too? I can\u2019t leave my kids orphaned. You have to get them out.\"</p><p>He watched me, \"I think you're a better actress than you give yourself credit for. Act like you might have a secret or two.\"</p><p>His tone told me it was a cheap shot for sure, I just didn\u2019t know what for. I clenched my jaw and picked up the glass again, \"Why are you my handler? Shouldn\u2019t someone with a little experience and age be my handler?\" I could play mean too. My philandering husband died two months ago\u2014I deserved to be downright bitchy.</p><p>He laughed after a moment. It boomed like a shot in the air. He pointed at me, \"You're pissed that I called you old. I get it.\"</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, \"No. It's that you're still a Boy Scout. This is my life we're talking about and you've told me nothing. I have no details. And maybe I want to be handled by a man.\" The scotch was hitting me. The liquid courage was saying things, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to say.</p><p>He smirked, \"I'm man enough to handle you, I can assure you.\" His cold eyes hardened, \"I\u2019ve got this, trust me. You just try not to fuck up your part.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cHave we met before? Have I offended you prior to this meeting? I\u2019m having the rug pulled out from under me and you\u2019re acting like a dick.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last few months on constant detail, watching you and your family. It feels like we\u2019ve met a thousand times.\u201d Before I could ask anything else, he lifted a cell phone from the couch and dialed. He held it out.</p><p>\"Good evening, Sir.\"</p><p>\"Is she there?\" The voice on the other end spoke and I knew it instantly. My stomach clenched as Coop nodded and turned the phone, \"She is.\"</p><p>An older man, who I recognized, smiled at me, \"Evie, I am so sorry about James.\" I hated FaceTime, I realized that right then.</p><p>I smiled politely, \"Thank you, Commander.\" I felt sick seeing his withered face. God, I was getting old.</p><p>He smiled, \"You know we need you, right?\"</p><p>I nodded once. What else was I going to say? He was the commander in charge of the CI unit, I was part of. He was it.</p><p>\"That\u2019s a good girl, your father would be proud of you. Coop will get you outfitted and ready. Our Intel says they\u2019ll be calling you tomorrow or contacting you at the funeral. We need to know we can count on you to help fix the situations your husband left us all with.\" He nodded and then Coop turned the phone back around. \"You know your orders!\" he barked at Coop, who pressed a button and put the phone down.</p><p>I started to laugh, possibly from the scotch and possibly from the ridiculousness of it all. I shook my head and covered my eyes. I understood the threat in the call. If I didn\u2019t play ball, they would make sure I fried for his crimes, somehow. The phone call was to ensure I would play ball. I knew it and so did they. I would be guilty of co-conspiring to commit terrorism or God only knew what.</p><p>I wondered if they'd already put some coke in my underwear drawer; I could go for a hit.</p><p>Tears threatened when I put it all together in a big pile and looked at it. The information, the death, the possibility of working again, all of it. The pile was too big to handle. It was too much to take on.</p><p>I stood from the chair and bolted for the door.</p><p>Coop moved fast, and as I opened the door, he slammed it shut. He pressed himself against me, shoving me into the door. He wrapped his arms around me, as I cried into my hands.</p><p>Chapter Three - The possible end of me</p><p>We were silent during the drive home, maybe because he held me when I cried, and it was awkward as ass. I was hoping it was more that he really didn\u2019t talk much, unless it was to mock me. Then he seemed like he had tons to say.</p><p>I glanced at him, \"You drank as much as me. You shouldn\u2019t be driving either.\"</p><p>He grinned, \"You sound like my mother.\"</p><p>My eyes narrowed, \"Well, maybe that\u2019s because I'm almost old enough to be your mother.\"</p><p>He laughed, \"You're thirty six, I'm twenty-eight.\"</p><p>I frowned, \"You look like twenty-two, tops.\"</p><p>He nodded, \"Yup. It\u2019s good for what I do. I've been doing this a lot longer than you.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked back out the window, \"You still shouldn\u2019t be driving.\"</p><p>His tone changed, \"I got this. Don\u2019t worry about me. Worry about your kids.\"</p><p>My head snapped back, \"What is that supposed to mean?\"</p> <p>He took the exit for Weston, driving far too fast, \"It means you need to do this the best you can. I'll be here for you, but all I can do is hope you have the training you\u2019ll need for this. The number one skill of any CI officer is belief. You need to believe. \u2018Cause if you don\u2019t, they won't either. Now take this package inside, go over it and then burn it.\" He pulled the cab onto my street and parked in my driveway with a jerk.</p><p>\"You drive too fast,\" I snarled and snatched the package. I jumped out of the car and slammed the door. I ran for my front door, not stealthy like at all.</p><p>The house was dark and silent. I slumped when I closed the front door and pressed my back into it. It was too much. It was all too much. I turned the locks and tried to find my peace again.</p><p>I could still smell the lingering odor of the spaghetti my mom had made the kids for dinner. I looked up the stairs to where my children were sleeping and made a mental note to change all the locks. Mom and the kids would be on mandatory lockdown.</p><p>I had no clue how to protect them. I had never been an agent with a family.</p> <p>\"Fuck!\" I whispered into the quiet of the foyer. Looking around, I wondered where they were, the bugs and the cameras?</p><p>I grabbed the package and stormed into the powder room, I would hope they hadn\u2019t bugged the bathrooms.</p><p>But what if they had?</p><p>Oh my God, were these people watching my kids shower and use the bathroom?</p><p>My stomach sunk farther. Frantically, I rifled the bathroom. When I pulled the fan cover off I found it. A small bug. I ripped it off and tossed it in the toilet. I stuck my hand up farther and found the second one. There was always a decoy. I flushed both and sat down on the lid. I wanted to cry. I wanted it more than I wanted anything, but the tears I had shed in the hotel room had taken all my sadness.</p><p>My fingers didn\u2019t tremble when I opened the manila envelope. Nothing inside of me was the same as it was when I left the house. In the place of the pain and self-pity, was resentment and a dirty dose of fury.</p> <p>I shook my head and pulled out the folder, \"How could you, James?\" I muttered to the folder, \"How could you do this to me and the kids?\"</p><p>The dark-brown folder had one word on the front of it, \"Burrow\" I didn\u2019t know what it meant but I assumed it was something to do with him being a mole. A double agent. How could he? I closed my eyes and repeated the word burrow but it didn\u2019t trigger anything.</p><p>I twirled the locket on my neck, trying desperately to recall even one thing. The locket made me ashamed. My father had given it to me for my graduation from CI training. He had been commander in charge at the time. He had begged me not to become a CI agent, but when I had ignored him and done amazingly at training he had to be proud. He begged me not to date James when we were discovered. I never understood his hate for him.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, if my dad had seen the man he would become?</p><p>I took a breath and wished I had some red wine to drink as I flipped it open. At first, it was pictures, surveillance photos of buildings I had never seen. No different than what I had looked at a million times in my short career as a CI agent.</p><p>I flipped past them, trying to commit them to memory.</p><p>Unfortunately, the shows my kids watched everyday had fried my brain somewhat. Well, kids\u2019 shows and the many hours I may or may not have spent playing Skyrim. I believed in testing a product before I let my ten-year-old play it. Damn those game makers. They were good. That damned game was addicting, once I got used to the Xbox controls.</p><p>My to-do list was balanced in there somewhere, along with the heartbreak that my kids\u2019 dad was an idiot. There was no room for surveillance photos.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, needing to be the person I once was. I opened them and started to look at the pictures again. Warehouses maybe, factories, trucks parked outside, men walking the yards without guns. The pictures were like looking in over the industrial section of any city. I couldn\u2019t even say what country it was. Nothing stood out.</p><p>The next pictures were of a man, I thought maybe I knew. The next one was of James and the same man. The man looked to be close to James' age. The black and white photo showed him to be handsome, dark haired, and serious looking.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t keeping my attention. I needed a snack. I put the papers down and went to the kitchen. I picked my underwear out of my butt, where it got lodged from sitting on the lid to the toilet and then looked around.</p><p>\"Shit,\" I whispered.</p><p>Coop, or someone, was no doubt watching that. I snarled and opened the freezer. I should have grabbed the plate of food, Mom would have in the fridge for me. Instead, I grabbed the caramel pecan ice cream and a spoon. I raised it like I was toasting whoever was watching me. Fuck Coop and his out of shape comment. He was probably disgusted at the thought of a girl eating ice cream from a container.</p><p>I carried it back to the washroom to look at the files again.</p><p>Sitting back on the toilet, I spread the photos out on the floor, after I went over each one. The first one was of James and the man talking outside of the warehouse. I knew the man. It was driving me insane where I knew him from, so I blanked my mind, but flashes of Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends filled it. I loved that show.</p><p>I sighed and grabbed the notes.</p><p>\"Officer Hammond believes Officer Evans to be compromised and possibly committing traitorous acts against the flag.\"</p><p>I reread the sentence and swallowed the lump of cold ice cream. I clenched my face and neck, as a throat burn started from not chewing the ice cream and taking in too large a bite. It happened when I watched Vampire Diaries too. Damn those Original Vampires and their sexiness, they gave me brain freeze and throat burn every time.</p><p>The next page was dates. I saw some I recognized as dates he was out of town for work. Others were hockey tournaments and other such competitions for our kids. Some of them, I recalled James being at.</p><p>Lastly, was an iPod. I pressed the on button on the top and instantly the screen went to a video. I pressed play.</p><p>It was James being filmed from a short distance at night. He stood in a dark corner with someone who I couldn\u2019t see, but I could tell it was a woman.</p><p>\"You think if I had any other choice, I would have let this happen?\" he asked the lady.</p><p>She put her hands on his jacket, on his chest. I placed the ice cream on the counter and dragged the video back. I watched her hands touch down on his jacket. It was an intimate touch.</p><p>My stomach turned, but I forced myself to watch the rest. I was actually being given footage of one of his said infidelities. They knew? They knew and they let me watch the video?</p><p>\"Heartless bastards,\" I muttered and looked back at the video.</p><p>The lady spoke plainly, \"I just want you to be safe. They know about the Burrow, she knows for sure. There's no way Evie...\" I knew her voice.</p><p>\"Shhhhh,\" he said and looked around.</p><p>My guts burned. Why was my name being mentioned? I knew her voice? Where from?</p><p>\"James, they know about Evie...\" she whispered, just as the camera lost her voice.</p><p>I gagged. Of course I knew that voice and the way it whispered my name. It belonged to my best friend in the world. My best friend, who I believed to be on mission and unable to be at my side, as I learned my husband was dead. I waited on pins and needles for the camera to catch her face. If it was her, I was going to have a heart attack.</p><p>He grabbed her arms, \"I told you not to say that. You don\u2019t know who's following us. Just stay out of this and stick to the plan. Meet me in Holland in a week. I have to break this to Evie and the kids. I know she knows, or at least, suspects something. She knows this is coming.\"</p><p>My mouth dropped open. I didn\u2019t, in fact, know. I never suspected.</p><p>\"I hate that she's going to get hurt.\" She rubbed her hands up and down the front of his body, making mine numb. I felt my lower lip creep out. I was actively praying it wasn\u2019t her.</p><p>His voice turned soft, \"Melanie, I want to be with you. The kids are old enough. It's our turn. Me and you, baby.\"</p><p>My mouth was completely dry, except for the sour taste in my cheeks. I dropped the iPod to the tile floor. My hands covered my mouth, \"Fuck.\" Silent tears streamed my cheeks.</p><p>Melanie... Melanie, who sat on the toilet nervously watching me check the pregnancy test. Melanie, the bridesmaid at my wedding. Melanie, who held my hand when I gave birth. Melanie, who I had prayed would get my dozens of desperate emails from the last two months.</p><p>She was my best army friend. We had done basic together and Fort Huachuca. We had entered CI together. A million images flashed in my mind. He was fucking her too? The PTA moms weren\u2019t enough? He had to take the only thing that was mine\u2014she was mine.</p><p>The video was still playing but I couldn\u2019t hear anymore. I got up and left the bathroom abruptly.</p><p>I needed to be away from the papers.</p><p>I paced the hallway. My breath came in rough spurts and panicked half breaths.</p><p>I burped the ice cream. It started to creep up my throat. I sat on the stairs; my tears wanted to come but the ice cream was blocking them.</p><p>I gagged and ran upstairs to my bathroom, bursting through the door, and running for my toilet. I couldn\u2019t go back into the bathroom downstairs, not yet.</p><p>I bent over the toilet and gagged for a second before the scotch and ice cream started to flow. My guts retched and my heart broke. Not from his betrayal but from hers. Him, I had started to come to terms with. Hers might kill me.</p><p>I finished throwing up and flushed repeatedly. I curled up on the cool floor and pressed my face to the tiles. My silent cries turned to blasting sobs. I let loose the horrors and the pain. I let loose the millions of things I hadn\u2019t let myself see. The dam broke and I let the avalanche smother me completely.</p><p>Images of things I had not wanted to see, ran like a movie behind my eyes until the movie ended and my eyes went black. But even as I passed out in the bathroom, I dreamt of things I didn\u2019t want to see. His hand grazing her thigh, the two of them sneaking off during our wedding, the way he always insisted I invite her along. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I woke to the sound of a man's voice.</p><p>\"James?\" I stirred and wiped the drool from my face.</p><p>\"No. Come here.\"</p> <p>I blinked and saw Coop standing in the doorway. I blinked again and wondered if I was hallucinating.</p><p>He had on a hoodie and sweats. I jumped when I realized he was truly there and banged my head on the toilet.</p><p>He winced and stepped to me. He lifted me off the floor, \"You don\u2019t follow orders very well, Evans.\" He carried me from the bathroom and laid me on my bed, shaking his head, \"And your breath stinks.\"</p><p>I started to cry again, rubbing my head. I stammered, \"H-h-how could you let-let-let me watch that-that? She was my best friend,\" I heaved. I wanted so badly for it to be his fault.</p><p>He walked to the bathroom and turned the tap on. He came back in with a glass of water, \"We saw you find the other evidence. You knew he was a cheater. You've known for a while.\"</p> <p>I slapped at him wildly, \"Did you plant the other evidence so I would find it? Did you?\"</p><p>Even in the darkness of my room, I could see the cruelty in his eyes. \"Evie, you have hours. I'm not kidding\u2014hours. They are going to come for you or send word about the meeting. You need to remember who you are and shut off the parent act.\" The words echoed in my mind.</p><p>I curled into myself and shook my head when he offered me the water. \"She was in my wedding. She was with me when I found out I was pregnant. Her desperately, sad face makes sense now. I thought she was sad \u2018cause she knew I would leave the army if I had a kid. Fuck, I didn\u2019t know. I'm such an idiot. I didn\u2019t know, all this time. The PTA moms and Mel. I\u2019m so stupid. I thought he was the lucky one. I was the better catch,\" I snorted, \"How fucking arrogant is that?\"</p><p>He sat on the end of the bed, the weight of him made me rock back a bit. \"You are the catch. He's a dumbass. Luce always called him a douche nozzle. None of us liked him, not even Jack. That takes talent. Jack likes everyone.\"</p><p>I laugh/cried; I didn\u2019t even want to know how that was an insult. I'd seen douche nozzles. They didn\u2019t seem offensive. I ignored my rambling brain and whispered, \"What did the file say? How long?\"</p><p>He knew what I meant. I knew he would. He sighed, \"Does it matter?\"</p> <p>I nodded, \"Yeah, it does.\"</p><p>He looked down, \"The whole time. He played you and her hardcore, apparently. He was found out and told to break things off with you both or he would be dishonorably discharged for fraternization. He told the commander you were pregnant.\"</p><p>I gasped, \"My father was the commander then!\"</p><p>\"The file says it was recommended he do the right thing. I am assuming that was your father's recommendation.\" His voice was cold and hollow. It made the news easier to take somehow. I remembered the look in my father\u2019s eyes, when we told him we were pregnant and getting married.</p><p>\"So he married me and screwed her for a decade, and our whole marriage was a lie? A lie my own dad knew about? What the hell?\"</p><p>He sighed, \"Yeah.\"</p><p>I closed my eyes and nodded. I got up from the bed, but he grabbed my hand when I walked past.</p><p>\"You need sleep.\" He pulled me back toward the bed, ignoring the fact I was pulling back.</p> <p>I pointed towards the door. \"I need to get the papers and video. I left it all downstairs.\"</p><p>He shook his head, \"No. I told you that you don\u2019t follow orders. I already got rid of it all. I took a huge risk coming here. I told you to burn it, not leave it next to the chunky monkey you were eating right from the container. That was a disturbing sight.\"</p><p>I bit my lip and fought the chuckle that slipped out, \"You're a dick.\"</p><p>He pulled me onto the bed, \"I know. I get that a lot. So do you want me to just tell it all to you? That was my idea from the beginning, but the commander thought you would want to be alone when you heard the sordid story.\"</p><p>I pulled away from him and crawled into the covers. When I was comfy, he looked down at the floor and started talking quietly, \"When you were in, did you ever work on a file pertaining to a man named Gustavo Servario?\"</p><p>The light bulb came on. I smacked my forehead, \"That was him in the pictures. Damn... Servario filled out his khakis. Yeah, I remember him well. He was a young, cocky little shit. His mom was Italian and his dad was an Italian-Serbian arms dealer who owned a shipping company as a front. They were sort of a small-fry operation.\"</p><p>He looked back, \"Wow, that came back fast.\"</p><p>I laughed bitterly, \"Bad things stay with me.\"</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, \"I'll remember that. Anyway, the small-fry operation lasted a little while, but when his old man died, he took over. Everything changed then.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cYeah, I worked his files then. It was 9/11 and he was a gunrunner, so we kept a close eye on him. We knew then, he would outgrow his dad. He was smart and savage.\u201d</p><p>Coop shrugged, \u201cWell, after that he went underground. Then we heard he was not only running arms, but he was also dipping into prostitution and drugs. We could handle those things, stop him here and there, make it look like we were putting in an effort. The orders were to let him run it, and if he slipped up, and got carried away, to slap his wrists.\"</p><p>I shook my head at how much it hadn\u2019t changed. We didn't want to stop them and end the wars; we wanted the appearance of trying. Funding was dependent upon supply and demand. No demand, no supply.</p><p>He shrugged and continued talking, \"We kept an eye on him until three years ago. Then, things changed again. He got harder to trace and then he would pop up somewhere. It was like he was putting himself in our way, trying to be noticed.\"</p><p>\"Diversion,\" I said softly.</p><p>He looked back at me: our eyes met in the dark, \"Exactly.\" I noticed the way the light hit his lips when he pursed them, \"He was toying with us. We sent James in, not as a spy obviously, but as a rogue informant. Trying to create misinformation amongst his people. We wanted to see how his line of command went and how he reacted to the lies we created. We wanted to know, who we could get to. We think it was then, that James went rogue for real.\"</p><p>\"Not to sound disinterested, but when the hell do I come into the picture?\"</p><p>He chuckled, \"The video you saw, we were watching him, and we caught that transmissions between him and Melanie Ashcroft. It was dumb luck...\"</p><p>I cut him off, \"Bullshit. You knew he was cheating, and you kept close to blackmail him if you had to. You were building a file against him.\"</p><p>His lips curled, \"In the yoga pants, it's easy to forget you used to play this game. We had more than enough to charge him and ruin his life, but then we caught wind of him and Servario talking about the Burrow. Then again with Melanie; you heard it there on that video. It was taken only a couple weeks before he died. We don't know what the Burrow is, and we don\u2019t know where it is. We think Servario believed that James had it or had access to it, through you...\"</p><p>I cut him off again, \"Why would he kill James, if he believed him to have it? Who does that? Who kills the man with the answers?\"</p><p>He sighed again, \"We think it was you he was after. Kill James and get control of your whole life. Then he could make you his pawn and make you give him the Burrow. All I know is, we didn\u2019t kill James, and the only actual proof we have of you being mentioned, is that video. I said it wasn\u2019t enough to bring you back in. I honestly think, he might have suspected us watching him and made the video to lead us off the tracks, or to bring you in. But higher-ups feel like you have the answer, and they\u2019re willing to gamble with you.\"</p><p>I sat up fast, ignoring everything he had said, \"What? Wait... If he died in the line of duty, I'm not paying for the whole funeral.\" I felt outraged. I didn\u2019t even want to go to the damned thing anymore. I was angry on a whole other level of angry. I covered my eyes and massaged my temples.</p><p>He started to laugh, \u201cDid you hear the rest of what I said?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \"I\u2019ve never heard him or anyone mention the whole Burrow thing. I think it might be some bullshit he was doing, \u2018cause he knew you were on to him. Where the hell is Melanie? I was told she was on mission. Why haven\u2019t you all brought her in? James is probably still alive and with her. Burned-out bodies in cars tend to be someone we found along the way to replace us, when we fake our deaths. Typical cover-up.\"</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, if they never suspected James dead at all. But they had no problem letting my kids think it.</p><p>I looked up at him, feeling the years of abilities and skills finding their way back to me. Granted they had to crawl through layers of bake sales and fuckerwear parties. I made a duckface and processed the fact, I should have bought a dildo at that last one I went to; it had been almost half a year since I'd been laid.</p><p>I mentally slapped myself. I was losing my mind.</p><p>I started to giggle.</p><p>I gathered myself and wiped my face of the tears I hadn't realized I was crying, \"What a night.\"</p><p>The awkward silence was broken by his voice, but it was softer than before, \"More like two months. I'm sorry this is all happening to you.\"</p><p>I nodded, \"Me too. I feel bad for Melanie. Her heart must be broken. Will you be bringing her in? You never answered me.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, \"If it was really him in the car, then she was in there with him. It was a bomb.\"</p><p>I was frozen again; she had been one of my best friends in the whole world. I wouldn\u2019t let her be dead in my mind. It was easy to suspect her of faking her death with James, after seeing the video. If she had actually died, I wasn\u2019t sure I would recover from it. I muttered emptily, \"What evidence do you all have, that it was actually them in the car? I'm assuming the bullshit I was fed from the two men who notified me of his death wasn\u2019t real?\"</p><p>He crossed his arms, \"The notification wasn\u2019t staged, but what we told you wasn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>I pointed at him, \u201cI mean it\u2014I\u2019m not paying for that bastard\u2019s funeral.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ll tell the commander. The car bomb was real though. We have her rings and some dental. Him\u2014we have the wedding band you were given back. The bomb was a type that uses chemicals to damage and erode the remains.\"</p><p>I frowned, \"And that doesn\u2019t say set-up to you?\"</p><p>He shook his head, \"We had eyes on them. They were in the car. This isn\u2019t Mission Impossible, Evie.\"</p> <p>I let the words all sink in and shook my head, \"I don\u2019t know why, but her possible death hurts more than his.\"</p><p>\"Bros before hos.\"</p><p>I frowned as tears streamed down my cheeks, \"What?\"</p><p>He looked confused, \"You know that old saying \u2018bros before hos\u2019? She was your bro and James was like your ho.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \"Oh my God, you are so twenty. That's not an old saying. I was a teenager when Snoop Dog made that up. Jesus.\"</p> <p>He chuckled and stood up, \"I know who Snoop Dog is. Jeesh, I told you I'm twenty-eight. I just mean she was bigger in your heart, even if it didn\u2019t feel like it, \u2018cause she was your friend, not your lover. She was never blinded by love; she just wanted to be your friend. Are you going to be okay?\"</p><p>I nodded and wiped my face again. It was a lie, I didn\u2019t think I would ever be okay. He walked to the bedroom door, it was then that it dawned on me how weird the whole thing was. He was standing in my dark bedroom, staring back at me. I didn\u2019t know him and I didn\u2019t like to cry in front of people I did know. I cleared my throat, \"So, I guess we meet with Servario tomorrow then?\"</p><p>He nodded, \"We think so. Our intel on his movements is bad. We don\u2019t have much to go on. He's been playing us for a while. That lawyer was our first real break. We traced your deeds and paperwork back to him, through about a dozen other lawyers and a bunch of fake companies. The video of James mentioning you to Melanie, and the one of him and Servario, and the paperwork we have from the lawyer, are all the things connecting you to all this. Upstairs feels like it\u2019s enough to bring you back in.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cI can\u2019t believe, they would sell me down the river for so little. What the fuck is this Burrow?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, \u201cNo clue, but Servario froze everything so he could control you and make you need him. He did all that for a reason. The thing can\u2019t be that little, if the government and a huge arms dealer both want it. He needs you for something.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip and thought for a second, \u201cI don\u2019t like going in blind.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded again, \u201cI know. We made sure the phone you got was one we could control, if you press 9-1-1, we can get to you. Servario may call, he may show up, we don\u2019t actually know.\u201d</p><p>\"Useful!\u201d I rolled my eyes, \u201cI love that I'm being risked out like this. Do I know about him and James and about The Burrow?\"</p><p>He shook his head, \"No. Play dumb for now.\"</p><p>My stomach clenched, \"That won\u2019t be hard. Will I be in danger? Should I get a gun?\"</p><p>He laughed, \"No. When was the last time you fired a gun?\"</p><p>I shrugged, \"I don\u2019t know, a long time ago. Will you be there?\"</p><p>He smirked, \"I've been there all along.\"</p><p>I nodded and tried ignore the super-creepy feeling I got from the comment, \"Okay.... Just turn my cell phone and house phones back on...okay? I need to be able to reach my kids if I\u2019m out and they need to be able to call out, if there\u2019s an emergency.\"</p> <p>He nodded and grinned, \"Night, Evie.\" He left and closed the door. I didn\u2019t go to sleep. I waited for him to leave, or at least gave him long enough to be gone. Then I got up and started to debug my house. It helped me process the fact, I would never get to be me again.</p><p>Chapter Four - Goodbyes aren't nearly as bad, when you hate the deceased</p><p>To say I was pissed would be a HUGE understatement. It would be like saying Bostonians enjoyed the odd game of baseball or hockey.</p><p>James\u2019 service was lovely, but I couldn\u2019t cry\u2014not even for my two, desperately-sad children. His parents hugged and kissed me, all the while telling me how much he loved his children and me. If I had to listen to his mother go on about the flower arrangements, or how the army was being so good to us, for one more minute, I figured I would kill someone. The more time I spent celebrating my husband's life, the more forward I was looking to meeting the infamous Mr. Servario and getting the shitshow James had left me, over with.</p><p>I wanted to be sick. I wanted to spoil the sweet, knight-in-shining-armor-bullshit appearance, James had managed to maintain. He was a real gem of a husband, all the while, fucking my best friend and the PTA bitches. I only knew he\u2019d fucked two in the group of them, but there were several floating about the funeral, all crying. They smiled and pretended to be sad for my kids. It was a bit disgusting.</p><p>Every time I glanced at Mitch, I felt a sickening fury. His birth was a lie. Our marriage was a mistake. I was the girl James had accidentally gotten knocked up. The girl James wouldn\u2019t have picked, had he had the choice. James, who was more than likely still alive and hiding out with his mistress, my best friend. Meanwhile, I would be going into a deep cover op and risking my life to keep his kids safe. I could have chewed my nails and spit bullets.</p><p>I glanced around the room, looking for the one man who would not fit into the party. The one man who was now in my life, because of my asshole husband who had apparently, burned to death in a car. God help him, if I ever found him alive and well.</p><p>What I saw around the room, broke my heart further. Jules was clung onto my mom; her sweet blue eyes were filled with tears, real tears. Crocodile tears, as James always called them. They seemed so big compared to her tiny face.</p><p>Next to her sat Mitch, looking stunned. I could tell he felt lost, like he might flee any second.</p><p>It all made me sick. My babies were crushed, James\u2019 parents were devastated, and my mother was saddened by the loss, of yet another husband, in the family.</p><p>I excused myself from the people I was standing next to, who I wasn\u2019t listening to anyway, and walked to the ladies\u2019 room.</p><p>My breath was getting caught in my chest again. I leaned on the sink and took huge deep inhales. Looking up at my reflection, made me grimace. I was worried about the girl in the mirror. Her dark hair was greasy, at least it looked shiny in the tight bun. Her green eyes were flat and dull. No sparkle, no life lived in there. Her lips were cracked and she had a cold sore on the corner of her mouth. Her eyebrows had weeks of plucking to be done and her olive skin was blotchy. She was gaunt and sort of gray in the places that weren\u2019t reddened. It was not the face of a woman who was going to win the confidence of an arms dealer. Those guys always hung with the blonde girls who had perfect bikini bodies and stylish sunglasses.</p><p>I looked at my tired-looking body and sighed. No wonder James was fucking Mel. I would have fucked her too. There was no scar from having his kids marring her stomach and her tits didn\u2019t sag slightly from breastfeeding. She was fit and looked the way she always had. I was different though, my body was different. I imagined he liked the changes because they were associated with his children.</p><p>A sob tore from my lips as my momma-bear brain switched on. I wouldn\u2019t let myself feel shame for the way I had changed. I had born children to that bastard. Well, now they were my kids\u2014screw him. They were all mine. He could rot in Hell or Prague or Holland or wherever the hell he was, with the best friend I apparently never had.</p><p>My anger died when I caught a glimpse of the pain on my face.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want them in Hell. I wanted them there with me. Even if it meant they were together and I was alone. It was better than really being alone, like I was. My nerves started to pick up, as the fears and stress started to become real. I wanted to do what all widows did, crawl into my bed and wait for a year to pass, before I had to function again.</p><p>I left the sink and opened the door to the bathroom, but the back of a black suit was barring the way.</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" I muttered.</p><p>He slipped a card over his shoulder without looking back at me or turning at all. My stomach dropped. I took the card and looked at it.</p><p>\"6 p.m. Presidential suite.\"</p><p>The card was for the Hilton downtown, in the financial district.</p><p>I frowned and looked up. The man was holding a fifty-dollar bill over his shoulder. I took it. \"For the valet,\" he muttered and walked away from me.</p><p>He disappeared into the crowd of people wearing black.</p><p>I looked down at the fifty and the card. I wished Coop were with me. That was a bad sign. He was right, I was in over my head.</p><p>I slipped the cash and the card in my clutch and wiped my eyes, before walking back out into the wake.</p><p>My mom came up to me, smiling weakly, \"I'm taking these guys home.\"</p><p>I swallowed and looked around the room. \"I think they need some time away. You up for a road trip?\"</p><p>Mom frowned, \"What? Honey. We can't run away from our problems.\"</p><p>I shook my head. \"It isn\u2019t ours, but we may need to run anyway. We'll talk about this at home.\" I had so many things to tell her. Things that weren\u2019t going to be easy. I had found forty-eight bugging devices and cameras in the house and garage. I figured Coop would be there with a team reinstalling them all.</p><p>My nerves were shot and when I looked at the picture of James at the memorial table, I felt worse. Worse because I wished he were there to solve this for me.</p><p>A hand reached out for mine, \"I'm so sorry, Evie.\"</p><p>I looked up to see our neighbor from across the way, Jeff. I smiled and let him embrace me. He held me tight, \"If you need anything\u2014anything at all, just call.\"</p><p>I pulled back and nodded, \"Thanks, Jeff.\" His wife Megan walked up and smiled compassionately.</p><p>\"Honey, I am so sorry. James was the best.\" She looked distraught as she covered her face and started to cry again, \"I...just...am so sorry.\"</p><p>I noticed the way Jeff's face tightened. He looked at me and smiled weakly, \"She's been really broken up about it.\"</p><p>I nodded, \"Of course. I better circulate.\" I turned and walked away. I didn\u2019t circulate. I ran for the exit. I was going to be sick if I saw one more, teary-eyed woman. I was either becoming that jealous psycho widow/ex-wife, or I was actually accurate in my assumption he was also fucking our neighbor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I drove home in a near coma. I was so out of it by the time I got in the front door, I couldn\u2019t see straight. I slipped up the stairs and flopped on my bed. His scent wafted up into the air from his pillow. I grabbed it and threw it across the room.</p><p>\"Easy tiger.\"</p><p>I jumped seeing Coop standing where I threw the pillow.</p> <p>\"What are you doing here?\" I asked looking around.</p><p>He put a finger to his lips. Jules came running into the room and jumped on the bed. She curled into me and cried. Mitch wasn\u2019t far behind her. He wrapped himself around us and joined in on the crying.</p><p>It broke everything inside of me. Their suffering wasn\u2019t a random accident. It was the recklessness of a philandering father. A man I would let die, even if it meant I was in danger. No matter what, they would always believe the lies. I was selling my soul to the devil to ensure it.</p><p>I held my children to me and forgot we had an audience, until my mom came in. She stood in the doorway and smiled, \"Fresh cookies on the rack downstairs cooling.\"</p><p>I kissed Mitch on the cheek and smiled, \"Go on.\" He wiped his face and shoved his ball cap down, then he stalked past his grandma like a tough guy. Jules was asleep. I nudged her, \"Cookies.\"</p> <p>She didn\u2019t stir. I lifted her off the bed and carried her to her room.</p><p>When I came back in, I climbed on the bed and smiled at my mom, \"Thanks for making those.\"</p><p>She shook her head, \"No. No thank-you needed. This is what family does, when one of theirs is hurting.\"</p><p>I nodded, \"You always were a good mom. You're an even better grandma.\"</p><p>She laughed and sat on the bed. I glanced around, looking for Coop but he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\"That\u2019s the payment for suffering through having kids. You get grandkids,\" she beamed.</p> <p>I rolled my eyes, \"Me and sis were easy.\"</p><p>She folded her arms around her and grinned, \"I never said you weren\u2019t. But you were kids. Kids are kids.\"</p><p>I put a hand on hers and saw the resemblance. We had the same hands. I had hers. I squeezed, \"I need you to leave town.\"</p><p>She shook her head, \"No, the kids need stability.\"</p><p>I pressed my lips together and took a deep breath, \"They need to survive something I'm about to tell you, that you may never speak of to anyone. I am telling you, not only so you are prepared to run and raise them on your own, but so you understand what I'm doing.\"</p><p>She squeezed my hand back, \"Evie honey, you're scaring me.\"</p><p>I looked into her green eyes and nodded, \"You should be scared. James did some bad things. He betrayed the country. He sold secrets. He was a rogue agent.\"</p><p>She shook her head, but I could see the truths making their way into her mind. Her eyes showed the doubts she was having and the uncertainty of her headshake.</p> <p>I whispered, \"A bad man owns everything of mine. My home, my van, my car, my bank accounts, everything has been transferred into the ownership of this bad man. I have nothing. CI has basically told me, I will help or I will fry for the things James did. I have to help fix James' mistake. It's the only way to get the danger out of our lives and get what's rightfully ours back.\"</p><p>Her face changed and I didn\u2019t know the look she was giving me. She looked around oddly, and whispered so silently, I barely caught her word, \"Evie, we can run. We can take the kids. I have a little nest egg your father put aside, for just a moment like this one. I know a place.\" She looked frightened, as silent tears slipped down her pale cheeks,</p><p>I shook my head and cut her off, \"No. They'll find me. They'll hurt the kids or you. They know all about all of us. There is no way.\"</p><p>Ideas flew through her mind; I could see them rolling by like clouds in the sky. She twitched and shook her head, \"We can go to the FBI.\"</p><p>I laughed, \"James hasn\u2019t broken a law they govern. As far as they\u2019re concerned, he\u2019s dead. CI is going to take the three of you and go pick up Sissy, and take you somewhere. Somewhere safe. I won't help them if they don\u2019t do this. I want you safe until this is over.\" My voice cracked, \"You keep my babies safe.\"</p><p>She pulled her hand away, \"God damned him. What was he thinking?\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"He was leaving me for Mel. It never was me he wanted. He got me pregnant. I just never knew. Dad told him to do the right thing.\"</p><p>Her hands flew to her eyes, \u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>I gave her a look, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She sniffled and shook her head, \u201cYou know that for certain?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>She sobbed and shook her dark head. I crawled to her and wrapped my arms around her.</p><p>\"You can't do this to them. You can't abandon them.\"</p><p>I pulled her back and smiled, \"I'm not. I'm giving them the only person I trust in the whole world to keep them safe.\" I looked to the side of the room and spoke softly, \"You can come out, Coop.\"</p><p>He stepped from the walk-in closet with a savage look on his face, until my mom lifted hers. Instantly, the clouds from his face were gone and he smiled at her. It wasn\u2019t his cocky smile either. It was sweet. I could see just how handsome he was with it.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" she asked him. She sounded terrified.</p><p>His eyes darted at me, \"Everything she said was true. James was a bad man and has put the country in danger. My name is William Cooper. I'm in the section of the government where Evie and your late husband used to work. We need her to come back to work and help us.\"</p><p>Mom looked at me and shook her head, \"Will she be in danger?\"</p><p>I bit my lip and looked down. I didn\u2019t want her to see the face I was making, she could read my face too easily.</p><p>Coop smiled and shook his head, \"No. I'm very good at my job, ma'am. I will keep your daughter completely safe.\" He offered her his hand, \"You have my word.\"</p><p>I rolled my eyes. He was nine years old for God's sake; what word did he have to give? Mom ate it up though. She smiled and eventually got up off the bed.</p><p>I looked at Coop and nodded but spoke to my mother, \"Can you go tell the kids they get to go on a fun trip and I'll make arrangements here with him.\"</p><p>She looked at us both and then walked from the room. She wasn't happy and I didn\u2019t blame her. I would kill Jules myself, if she ever said something like that to me.</p><p>She closed the door and instantly Coop lashed at me. He grabbed my arms, \"What are you doing?\" He shook me. I jerked free and shoved him back, \"You aren\u2019t keeping them here as fucking bait. So you can play ball with me or I walk. I will go to jail for whatever the hell James did, just to see them safe.\"</p><p>He paced across the carpet for a minute and then picked up his phone. He dialed and held it to his ear.</p><p>He shot me a dirty look as he spoke \u201cI need an evac and I need it now.\u201d</p><p>He hated whatever they said to him next; the look he gave me was absolute fury, \"You tell anyone I\u2019ve called you and that weekend I may or may not have footage, goes live.\" He ran his hands over his short, dark-blond hair and then looked back at me, pointing as they talked in his ear. He mouthed the words, \"You are a pain in my ass.\"</p><p>I rolled my eyes and crossed my arms.</p><p>He continued, \"No, she wants the family evac'd. She wants them out now... tonight. No. She wants them in a safe house... out of country. I\u2019m thinking Canada, or even Alaska. Find a fishing lodge, or something the kids can have fun at, and they can blend. Something where we can post people and make them look like part of the resort. I want this to be handled by Martin's team.\" He paced, still holding his hand on the top of his head.</p><p>My frantic eyes searched him for signs of body language. In the tiny space between his t-shirt and jeans I could see his stomach. I wasn\u2019t certain if the tattoo on his side, which dipped into his pants, suited him or not. It was sexy and fun looking, whereas he seemed like an asshole most of the time. His face was a storm of repressed fury. He reminded me of my dad a bit.</p><p>He snapped a finger in front of my face when he caught me looking him over, and continued to speak into the phone quietly, \"I want the jet ready and directions to be disclosed in the air like with the MacLean case. The pilots will be at the resort with them the entire time. No leaks this time. Make sure it\u2019s some place we own, sheriffs and whatnot as employees. Don\u2019t even mess with me, Mickey. I got your wife on speed dial. Yeah, fuck you too. See ya, man.\"</p><p>I frowned and mouthed, \"This time.\"</p><p>He shook his head at me and snarled. I glared back.</p><p>\"Done.\" He tapped the off and pointed at me, \"Don't fuck with me. I run this show; I tell you how it goes. No more stunts.\"</p><p>I swallowed and looked away, seeing the anger on his face I decided then that he didn\u2019t suit the tattoo. Cute and flirty Coop was not consistent enough to suit the sexy tat.</p><p>He leaned into my face and shouted, \"I mean it, Evie!\" His nostrils flared when he was angry.</p><p>I flinched at his rage. He softened when he saw my face, \"What time did the card say?\"</p><p>I felt a strong desire to kick him in the face. I hadn't been yelled at like that, since I was in basic training. I looked down at the floor and took a breath.</p><p>He dropped to his knees in front of me, \"I shouldn\u2019t have yelled,\" he brushed it off.</p><p>I scowled at him, \"You're single aren't you?\"</p><p>He chuckled, but it wasn't friendly, it was sort of bitter. \"You're not really my type. I get the whole cougar thing is huge, but I'm not into it. I like it when I'm on top and all you forty-types always want to steer.\"</p><p>My hand flew at him, he caught it and gave me an outraged look, \"What was that for?\"</p><p>I yanked my hand from him, \"I'm not a cougar! I'm not forty! I wasn\u2019t hitting on you, you moron, I was mocking you!\" I got off the bed and walked out of the room looking back at him with daggers.</p><p>\"Little bastard,\" I muttered and stomped down the stairs.</p><p>Chapter Five - From Ma'am to Madam</p><p>Kissing my kids goodbye wasn't painful, it was too much pain to only measure with human emotions and words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A thousand times I wanted to jump into the van in the garage.</p><p>A thousand times I wanted to hold them to me and beg the men getting into the van with them to take me too.</p><p>A thousand times a bad thought filled my mind, and all I saw were horrid images of my vulnerable babies.</p> <p>Mom kissed me and shook her head, \"Be strong, safe and fast.\" She kissed the tip of my nose. My eyes watered. It was what she always said to my dad when he left. My mom was a military wife. She knew, at any given time, my dad's work could make her life painful. She knew it, all too well. She loved it when he got too high to go on mission anymore.</p><p>I looked into the van and crossed my arms. Thankfully, my kids were confused enough that they didn\u2019t ask too many questions. I had already explained that it was a military thing for the men to ride with them, as an honor to their fallen father. They did it for every fallen family.</p><p>I took both their hands in mine and spoke softly, \u201cDaddy had it in his will that we were all to take a vacation, if he ever died. He didn\u2019t want us to be sad or heartbroken. He wanted us to be happy and remember him. We are going to take that vacation, like he made in his last dying wish. Grandma is going to go ahead with you and I\u2019m going to stay behind and deal with the rest of his stuff. I love you both.\u201d</p><p>Mitch shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>I gave him my look for \u2018I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass\u2019. \u201cMitch, this is your father\u2019s dying wish. We have no choice but to respect it.\u201d</p> <p>He cocked an eyebrow at me, making me snap, \u201cBehave for Grandma or I burn the electronics.\u201d</p><p>Mom climbed into the driver's seat of the minivan. A man got into the passenger side and laid the seat back. My kids were put in the middle seats with men on either side on the floor and two men lying in the back. How they had all made it into the house from the backyard, was disturbing. Had my neighbors really not noticed the military combing through the backyards in broad daylight?</p><p>I glanced over at Coop, ruffling the hair on Mitch's head and joking with him. I wanted to tell him to stop, but it was sweet to see Mitch laughing and trying to be a man in front of him.</p><p>I stepped away from the van and blew them kisses as the doors closed. Coop closed the last of the minivan doors and walked to me.</p><p>He wrapped himself around me, helping me inside of the house and closing the door. I pressed my face to the cold metal and cried against it. He didn\u2019t try to comfort me, thankfully.</p><p>I dropped to my knees and sobbed, \"T-t-t-they only finished their father's memorial hours ago. I've m-m-made a mistake,\" I wailed.</p> <p>I curled up at the door, keeping my fingers on the cold metal of it.</p><p>I heard him close to me and opened one puffy eye to see him carrying things from my kitchen.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" My tone was edgy.</p><p>\"Get up, Evie,\" he answered back with a tone of his own.</p><p>I turned to tell him to kiss my old, saggy ass, but I was stopped by what I saw. I started to laugh.</p><p>\"You are so twenty-years old. You can say twenty-eight, but I know,\" I whispered as I sat up, shaking my head and licking my wrist. I snorted as I gave it to him. He shook the salt on it and handed me the shot. He did the same on his wrist and held his shot out, \"To your mom and kids arriving safe and staying that way.\"</p><p>I muttered, \"Cheers.\"</p><p>He clanked our shot classes together and gave me a mischievous look.</p> <p>\"Stop trying to be nice to me. I have seen the real you,\" I snarled and licked the salt the same time as him. I shot back the tequila and grabbed a lemon from the plate. I sucked the juice as he did. He reached over and wrapped his empty hand around mine, holding the empty shot glass, \"I am nice.\"</p><p>I gulped.</p><p>The lonely corner we sat in, with our shots and lemons, seemed darker suddenly, matching the gloomy day outside. He took my glass from my fingers and poured us each another shot, and passed me the glass back. I licked my wrist and held it out for him to pour more salt on.</p><p>He held his drink up again, \"To James, may he rest in peace.\" His eyes twinkled. I grinned and nodded, \"And Mel. May they be at rest together, happily.\"</p><p>He half smirked, lifting only his upper lip on only the right side. He licked his lips and I tried not to notice how plump they were. Or how he had the subtlest cleft in his chin. Or the way his pulse beat rhythmically in his thick neck. It was like neck porn. I licked my wrist and sucked back the drink. I grabbed the lemon and sucked, all while watching the neck porn.</p><p>I needed a nap and to be away from him. He was jailbait and he called me a cougar, and I was an emotional wreck who was about to make a poor choice out of grief. I jumped up and shook my head from the two shots.</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I walked past him and up the stairs.</p><p>\"No prob,\" he muttered.</p><p>I curled up in my bed and slept, until he woke me with a shout from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>I jumped up and pulled on a casual outfit. I didn\u2019t even look at myself. When I met him at the door, he gave me a disapproving once over.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow, \u201cIs that really what you want to wear?\u201d</p><p>I growled, \u201cI\u2019m a grieving widow, ass.\u201d</p><p>He put his hands up in the air, \"Alright fine; let\u2019s sort this out then. I'm your cabby. Meet you out front in two.\" He nodded all snarly again and vanished. I looked at the foyer and crossed my arms around myself.</p><p>How had it all happened? How had it gone so wrong? How could James die, or even worse, fake his own death and abandon us?</p><p>I waited the two minutes and walked out the front door.</p><p>He sat in the same cab as the night before. I climbed in and looked down.</p><p>He spoke as he backed up, not looking at me, \"He's going to talk to you and ask you questions, and you are going to have to seem like a devastated widow who knows shit all.\" He drove like a maniac and dropped me off at the lobby without saying much, \"Be safe. I'm nearby, okay?\"</p><p>\"No last advice?\" I gulped.</p><p>He shook his head, \"Say yes to everything.\"</p><p>I scowled at him and closed the door. What was the everything?</p><p>\"Good evening, ma'am,\" the bellhop said and opened the door. I looked up and walked across the lobby, wondering how many hotels I would be entering if this continued. They would start thinking I was a nearly middle-aged hooker, if I kept coming back and visiting hotel rooms. I glanced at myself in the mirror I passed and felt a little better. At least I didn\u2019t look nearly middle aged or like any hooker I'd ever seen. Whose fantasy was to have their mom show up in their hotel? Maybe I could nag them to pick up their clothes and wash their faces.</p><p>The bellboy was a young man with an infectious smile. He nodded at me as the elevator opened, \"What floor?\"</p><p>I smiled back, ignoring the fire in my stomach and stepped inside, \"The presidential suite please.\"</p><p>He gave me the up-down and smirk, \"Yes, Ma'am.\" I could have pulled off my sports bra and choked his little ass.</p><p>I sighed, partly because everyone had been calling me Ma'am lately, and partly because, I knew I would never get my sports bra off fast enough. The thing was a death trap.</p><p>The elevator stopped on the top floor.</p><p>As I stepped off, he said, \"Have a nice night, ma'am,\" and pressed a button. I glanced back at the shit-eating grin on his face and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Had he had a mocking tone?</p><p>Was he laughing at the fact the guy opening the door was getting a mom hooker? He was probably used to seeing three girls in miniskirts with red lips and syphilis entering the presidential suite.</p><p>I looked at the single, white door in the hall. The suite must have been nearly the entire floor. I pushed down my fears and walked to the door. The fact I'd already done this routine was making it less scary, like I had wasted the real fear on the practice run when I met Coop. I didn\u2019t feel as scared as I should have been.</p><p>My hands didn\u2019t shake. My stomach burned but never cramped.</p><p>I placed my fist up to knock, but the door opened.</p><p>\"You're late.\" The man from the photos with James scowled at me. He looked so much better in person.</p><p>I winced, while trying to smile, \"Sorry. The taxi was late.\"</p><p>\u201cI gave you valet money for a reason.\u201d</p><p>I stammered, \u201cUhm...I was too tired to drive.\u201d</p><p>He watched me for a second, before letting me in. His short, dark hair was thick and styled nicely. He looked my age but his face was actually tanned, so his skin was aged, but only slightly more. His hazel eyes had a greenish tint to them, but were mostly brown. I could imagine them getting quite dark if he were angry. He was tall, much taller than me in all my five-foot-four glory. He had to be at least six foot three.</p><p>He smiled and made slight dimples in his cheeks, \"Please, come in. My name is Gustavo Servario.\" His smile was hypnotic and calming. This... this was the man threatening my life and children?? I was having a terrible time believing it possible or seeing him as threatening. My nerves were barely registering or just refused to participate on account of the handsome man.</p><p>I could feel awkward nervousness making attempts to take over. He was sophisticated and smooth and handsome, beyond what I had expected. I had only ever seen surveillance of him. Up close, he made me breathe irregularly. I regretted my choice of yoga pants, a three-quarter sleeve sweater and sneakers.</p><p>I entered the suite, nearly jumping when he placed his hand on the small of my back. He chuckled, \"You'll need to get used to that feel, my dear.\"</p><p>My stomach dropped, the charming dimply smile couldn\u2019t even rescue me from the panic of my nerves showing up all at once.</p><p>I would need to get used to that touch? He was planning on touching me? What did that mean?</p><p>He guided me into the living room and put a hand out, \"Sit.\"</p><p>I gripped my clutch and sat in one of the fancy cream and yellow chairs. The room was lovely.</p><p>He picked up two champagne flutes and brought one to me. Were we celebrating my husband\u2019s fake death or his taking over of my life and forcing me to hide my children?</p><p>I took the delicate stemware in my suddenly-shaking hand and forced my nerves down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"What do you know of your husband\u2019s dealings with me?\" he asked as he sat.</p><p>I frowned, \"Nothing.\" I noticed everything about him. I couldn\u2019t help it. He was big\u2014over two hundred pounds, but at the same time, graceful. His greenish-grey slacks fit him perfectly. He filled them out as if they were made to be his. His cream-colored dress shirt was open, like he had just taken his tie off and was about to relax for the evening. He was thick and fit for our age. The closer men got to forty, the less likely they were able to tie their own shoes. But not him, he was strong. It made the feelings of fear and panic worse. There would be no escaping him. He could snap my neck in a heartbeat. The flute looked ridiculous in his huge hands.</p><p>Every observation I made of him, linked itself to a dirty thought. I\u2019d been reading too many naughty books. But I had to give it to him, he had aged nicely, more than nicely. I couldn\u2019t shake the bratty boy he had been, when I was watching him at twenty-three.</p> <p>He sighed and watched me checking him out. I blushed as he smiled, \"You seem afraid of me, Ms. Evans.\"</p><p>I tried to nod, but it was more like a twitch. I steadied my hands and brought the flute to my lips. The champagne was perfection.</p><p>\"Is it alright?\" he asked.</p><p>I nodded, \"It is. Thank you.\" The awkwardness of it all was bizarre. I was living like it didn\u2019t matter my children were being flown into hiding. Guilt trickled down my throat with the next nervous sip.</p><p>He licked his lips and smiled softly, \"I'm sorry if I seem distracted, you're a very beautiful woman.\"</p> <p>I wanted to giggle nervously but I forced a frown, \"You murdered my husband.\" The words came out, before I could stop them. He was making me uncomfortable, and acting like a grieving widow was harder than it looked.</p><p>He laughed, \"Did I?\" He all but confirmed my suspicions with his statement, and his amused sparkly eyes.</p><p>I shook my head, \"I don\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t you?\"</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he brought the drink to his lips and sipped. He shook his head and chuckled, like he was laughing at something I didn\u2019t know. Like there were jokes in the air that I couldn't see, well at least he didn\u2019t know I saw them.</p><p>My hands were shaking harder. I gripped the flute firm enough that I figured it would shatter. I lifted it and drank the champagne in one long gulp.</p><p>His eyes widened.</p> <p>He stood and walked to the bar in the far comer. He grabbed the bottle from the ice bucket and brought it to me. He took my hand in his and lifted the flute with my hand. The warm strength of his grip, felt like it was burning mine.</p><p>\"Your hands are cold. You need to calm down. Stress is very hard on women. It ages you.\" He poured the glass but paused before letting go of my hand. He ran his fingers up my empty ring finger, \"Over the marriage so quickly?\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"I get dry skin.\" It wasn\u2019t a lie but my voice broke slightly under his scrutinizing stare. It felt like a hot lamp.</p><p>His eyes flashed, \"You know about his infidelity, don't you?\" He sat down.</p><p>Jesus, did everyone know?</p><p>Was I honestly the last person to know?</p><p>Taking a breath, I spoke softly, \"I know. I found out the other day. A friend was in town and felt like I deserved to know after all these years.\" I was panicking. If he had been watching me, he would know it was lies.</p><p>He filled his own glass and put the bottle back. He sat again, watching me.</p> <p>I sipped the champagne.</p><p>\"Do you know anything else?\" His eyes were like lie detectors.</p><p>I focused on the fact, I was terrified of him and shook my head.</p><p>\"You seemed edgy.\" His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\"I am. You're scaring the shit out of me. I don\u2019t even know if James was ever my husband, for real. He was fucking everything he could get on top of, except me. Which now I'm sort of grateful. I don\u2019t know you and we're having a very private conversation. Not to mention, you killed James and Mel, and sent a lawyer to my house to tell me you've taken everything from me.\" My voice wavered. The champagne was just doing all the talking.</p><p>He put a hand out, \"Don\u2019t cry. He isn\u2019t worth a single tear.\" When he said the word tear, I caught the slight accent he hid. He continued quickly, \"James was a bad man. He doesn't deserve a single tear from your beautiful eyes. You deserve someone who would cherish you and respect you, and make you more important than everything in the world.\" He paused and drank. Like he was stopping himself from the awkward moment. We were both just saying random things.</p><p>I pulled at my sweater and looked around, was it getting hotter?</p><p>He whispered, \"You deserve a love like no other person has ever had.\"</p><p>It was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to me. An arms dealer had given me the best compliment, I had ever had. Just great.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" I said quietly. I was getting confused as to why I was there. I hoped it was the champagne, tequila, and general lack of food that was making me dizzy, and not the fact he was beautiful and I was desperately emotional.</p><p>He shook his head, \"No, it was the truth. You're a special woman. You deserve a special man.\"</p><p>His words were making me uncomfortable. I glanced over at the bottle we were drinking from, to see how much was missing, and realized there was an empty bottle next to it. He got drunk before meeting me and was hitting on me.</p><p>That was special. I would bet he was even using his best lines on me.</p><p>I wondered if all the spies had experiences like that, or if I was just that lucky? The word spy made my palms sweat.</p><p>\"Getting back to the reasons you are anxious. I haven\u2019t taken anything from you, Ms. Evans.\" He sipped the flute.</p><p>I cocked an eyebrow, \"Call me Evie please, and yes, you have. You have everything of mine frozen.\"</p><p>He pointed at me with the hand holding the drink, \"Ah, but that\u2019s not the same thing, is it? You have something of mine and I'm going to have everything of yours, until I get it back.\" The way he said everything, and lifted one corner of his mouth, made me cringe inwardly.</p><p>My chest rose and fell faster, as I processed all his words and the comfort with which he spoke them. Could he force me to give him everything? Coop had told me to say yes to it all. Surely, he didn\u2019t mean everything.</p><p>He put a hand out and waved me off, \"We can negotiate what everything is later. For now, I want to give you what I like to refer to as my test run.\"</p><p>I swallowed the champagne in my mouth. It felt as if it curdled in my throat.</p><p>He grinned leaning forward and slid a white envelope across the table to me, \"I will let you peruse this, whilst I attend to something in the other room.\" He said whilst like a foreigner and left the room.</p><p>I gulped back my drink and placed the flute down. The white envelope felt weird when I picked it up, like Mission Impossible combined with True Lies. I watched too much TV, while glorifying my \u2018good old days\u2019 in CI.</p><p>I opened it and looked inside\u2014a room key for the Bellagio and a picture of a man with a chubby face and huge lips. He was in his sixties maybe and greasy looking. He was wearing a white suit in the picture.</p><p>\"Ew,\" I whispered and examined the white suit. Beyond Don Johnson, no one ever rocked that bad boy.</p><p>There was nothing else in the envelope. I tapped my fingers against it and processed the whole thing.</p><p>It could be a hit...please God, no.</p><p>It could be a trace, please God, yes.</p><p>It could be stealing something, please God, let it be the trace.</p><p>I frowned and looked back at the room, he had walked into. I stood up, placing the envelope down and walked to the other room where the lights were off and the curtains drawn.</p><p>\"Mr. Servario?\" I spoke softly. My mommy/spy/widow senses told me to run. When I turned to, it was too late. He had been behind the door and closed it as I turned around.</p><p>In the dim lights coming from the alarm clock, I could see the serious look on his face.</p><p>\"I understand you were once in Intelligence,\" he spoke softly, taking a step towards me.</p><p>I swallowed and took one back, \"I barely finished training,\" I lied.</p><p>He smiled, \"Let\u2019s not lie to each other, Ms. Evans.\"</p><p>My fingers balled into fists as I whispered, \"I told you, call me Evie,\" and took another step back.</p><p>He reached for my hand, \"I think you were good at your job. You were good at it, and your quitting to be a mother was a tragedy.\"</p><p>Ouch. Maybe, he too would throw up the maternity leave quotation marks and my week would be complete.</p><p>My legs backed into something. I hadn\u2019t looked around the room. I didn\u2019t know where I was\u2014rookie mistake.</p><p>He stepped too close to me, pressing our chests together, and towered over me. \"I need you to do something for me, Evie,\" he whispered my name. It sounded deliciously frightening on his lips. He bent this face close to mine. So close, I could smell the champagne coming off his breath, as he whispered again, \"I need you to kill the man in that picture.\"</p><p>My stomach dropped.</p><p>I shook my head, \"I've never had to kill anyone. That wasn't my job.\"</p><p>He was so close, we were nearly kissing. He ran his finger down my cheek and whispered again, \"But you will kill him.\" He didn\u2019t have to threaten me, that was implied.</p><p>I parted my lips to speak again, but he delicately brushed his thumb across my lower lip. \"It's non-negotiable. It's that or we have no deal.\" He closed the tiny distance between our faces and replaced his thumb with his mouth. He sucked my bottom lip gently, before kissing me once. My breath left my mouth in spurts, as he pulled away.</p><p>I closed my eyes and let the millions of emotions flood me, until air rushed between us and he stepped back. \"The flight to Las Vegas leaves in two hours.\" He turned and left the room. \"You will be outfitted on the plane.\"</p><p>I followed him back into the light, completely stunned by the fact he had made me want the kiss. I was losing my mind. I needed to switch back to red wine, no wonder the women I knew all drank it. Champagne and tequila were making me a giant ho.</p><p>He walked to the front door and opened it but stood in the way, with his back to me. \"If you pass this, I will give you back your life.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I frowned, \"So I do that and I\u2019m free?\" I was confused. I thought he too wanted the Burrow thing. I was clearly in over my head, like Coop had said.</p><p>He glanced back at me wickedly, \"No. I will own you, I won't need those other things.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"You\u2019ve preyed upon my circumstances. You already do own me.\" The sickening truth of it all was killing me inside. He owned me. He kissed me. I had wanted it. The way he had uttered the threat with such confidence was disturbing, and yet, I had wanted it.</p> <p>He smiled, but it was bitter and harsh, \"Then I guess we won't have any issues.\" He stepped out of the doorway and let me pass. As I walked by him, he grabbed my arm and held me to the side of him. The heat of his body was intense and yet inviting. I wanted that kind of warmth to cover me. I hated myself for the thought, as it passed through my brain.</p><p>His breath was irregular, like he wanted to say something or do something, but he didn\u2019t. He left it as another awkward moment between us... us perfect strangers. Perfect strangers who acted like old lovers, but without reason.</p><p>He released me and stepped back inside. I noticed, as I walked to the elevator, the men standing in the long hallway. Had they been there when I arrived? My skills needed honing.</p><p>I was obviously out of my league.</p><p>I pressed the elevator button and waited.</p> <p>The door behind me opened again. Panic filled me when I heard him cross the hallway towards me. I didn\u2019t look back, I just waited for whatever thing, he was going to do next. He grabbed my arm, spinning me around. He passed me the white envelope but continued to grip my arm for a moment. His eyes sparkled with something, trouble and temptation maybe.</p><p>He smirked and let me go. He walked back to the room and closed the door, as the elevator arrived.</p><p>\"Ma'am.\"</p><p>I turned to see the bellhop. I blushed and stepped inside.</p><p>I pressed my back against the wall of the elevator, and waited for him to call me ma'am once more. I would clip him in the ear with the envelope.</p><p>I struggled to breathe until the elevator stopped on the main floor. I walked across the lobby and tried not to feel like a whore, or have a panic attack.</p> <p>Coop was sitting outside in the valet parking with the cab. I climbed in and noticed it wasn\u2019t him, as I closed the door. It was a lady. I had gotten in the wrong cab.</p><p>She was young, not quite thirty, and maybe a little bit butch. She grinned back at me, \"Hey, where to?\" and winked.</p><p>I shook my head, \"What? Uhm, Jericho drive in Weston.\"</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to think or do. I didn\u2019t have the money to pay for the cab. I would have to get the Visa from the other envelope and pay with that.</p><p>She drove for a block and then pulled into a car wash. \"Mind if I wash the car quick? Hit a bird.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"No, of course not.\"</p><p>She winked again, \"Supa.\" It was super, but she said it like a true Bostonian. Was she a real cabbie? I was about to relax, when she held up a piece of paper as we got into the car wash. I read the writing and pulled out the white envelope and passed it to her.</p><p>She fished through it and then held up a small, round battery-looking object. She opened the window a bit and tossed it out into the water. She paused a second and then fired the white envelope out the window.</p> <p>\"Hey!\" I said.</p><p>She laughed, \"The first one was the decoy. There was one actually pasted into the envelope seams. They're getting sneakier.\"</p><p>I smiled, \"Oh well, they\u2019ve come a long way in the last few years, I guess.\"</p><p>She rolled her dark-brown eyes, \"I'm Luce.\"</p><p>\"Evie.\"</p><p>She nodded, \"I know. I knew your husband.\"</p><p>I scoffed, \"Yeah, apparently everyone did.\"</p><p>\"Yeah I didn\u2019t know him like that,\" she laughed and handed me back the picture and the room key.</p><p>I folded the picture and keycard and put them in my purse.</p><p>In between the water and soap cycle, the car door opened. Coop jumped in and slammed the door. He shook his head and pulled off the wet coat he was wearing.</p><p>\"That was fun.\" he smirked at me.</p><p>\"What are you doing? You should have told me, I was getting a different cabbie. Did you hide in the carwash all this time?\" I asked looking around the car wash.</p><p>\"No. Can't always get the same driver. Duh.\" He leaned forward and slapped Luce on the arm, \"You get the bugs out?\"</p><p>She stared back at him with a deadly stare. Her body looked thicker than mine, how an agent should look. I bet she could bench press me. I looked at my feeble arms and remembered how they used to look. I used to be beefier. Yoga was relaxing, but I wasn\u2019t building any bulk in those classes.</p><p>Coop turned and smirked, \"How was it?\"</p><p>I frowned, \"I can't do it. I'm going to have to run for it.\"</p><p>He frowned back, \"What? Did he hurt you?\"</p><p>I laughed, and tried not to think about the thing he did do to me. I shook my head, \"No. He was a perfect gentleman,\" I lied.</p><p>Luce looked back and smirked, \"He's hot, like what-the-hell hot. I\u2019d let him hurt me for an hour or two. Shit, I might hurt him.\"</p><p>I continued laughing and tried to cover my blush, \"Yeah, uhm\u2014wow. When did arms dealers stop looking like Boris Yeltsin or Bin Laden? I actually remember when George Bush Junior was the hot guy in amongst the dictators and presidents.\"</p><p>She laughed with me, but Coop frowned, \"He's a murderer.\"</p><p>I nodded, \"I got the impression he didn\u2019t think Mel and James were dead. Of course, there is also the fact, he asked me to murder a fat guy in a clich\u00e9, gangster white suit.\"</p><p>Luce winced, \"No one looks hot in a white suit. Not since Miami Vice.\"</p><p>I pointed at her, \"True story.\"</p><p>We were instant friends. I liked it.</p><p>Coop looked confused. I liked that too.</p><p>The wash ended, forcing Coop to slink back in the seat. He ducked down quickly when Luce started the car and drove out.</p><p>\"I can't kill that man,\" I muttered, not wanting Luce to hear I was all bark and no bite.</p><p>He nodded, \"I know, and yet, you have to.\" His eyes twinkled. The steely blue was gone and in its stead was a sarcastic brightness.</p><p>I felt my eye twitch with nerves, \"You're getting off on this, aren\u2019t you?\"</p><p>He nodded and snickered, it was a real snicker like a kid would do. \"I am. You are well known as a former female counter Intel agent. It's fun to see you freak out and not know what the hell to do.\"</p><p>Luce turned back as she drove out of the city, \"It's true. I am honored to be working with you. It's good to have you back.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"No. Not back. I'm not working again.\"</p><p>She gave me a look in the rearview, \"You sure about that.\"</p><p>I sighed, defeated, \"No.\"</p><p>Coop put his hand on mine and squeezed, \"I\u2019ve got this. Trust me okay?\"</p><p>Looking into his eyes, I could see it was back. The flash of light and funny was gone. His eyes were almost gray, they were so icy.</p><p>I did trust him. I didn\u2019t know why, but I did. Maybe because, he was mean enough to be capable.</p><p>When Luce dropped me off, Coop whispered, \"See you in five.\"</p><p>I gulped and got out, \"Thanks for the ride.\"</p><p>She nodded, \"No worries. See you soon. Vegas baby!!\"</p><p>I closed the door and walked up to the house. My house, that for the first time, I was scared of. I didn\u2019t know what would be waiting in the house for me. A small part of me wished it were my kids and my mom waiting for me. I would have even taken James, greeting me at the front door. He was the devil, I knew.</p><p>Instead, it was dimly lit from the setting sun and frightening. My home felt as fake as everything else. My life was a mess and the road to fixing it seemed outlandish, even to an ex-Intel agent.</p><p>I was standing in the middle of the foyer, terrified to enter the rest of the house and be alone in it, when Coop came through the kitchen. He walked across the rooms, making no noise.</p><p>Seeing his silhouette in the shadows of the house, made me feel better\u2014less alone in the world. He whispered, \"You need to get ready.\"</p><p>I whispered back, \"I know.\" But I didn\u2019t know why we were whispering. I had debugged everything, hadn\u2019t I?</p><p>Chapter Six - The Mile-High Club</p><p>I scrubbed, shaved, used a loofah on everything, and then got out the tools for the plucking and primping. I didn\u2019t know the last time I'd done it and I didn\u2019t want to admit, why I was doing it. Instead, I told myself it was like shedding the skin of the old me. The me that bought all of James' lines.</p><p>I frowned when I thought about the fact, I was again thinking not-holy thoughts about the arms dealer who had made me want him.</p><p>I needed to focus on the mean cougar comment from the little shit downstairs. That was a libido killer if anything was.</p><p>I wiped the mirror dry and looked at my naked reflection. I looked good...pretty good. Okay, not nineteen good or however old Coop really was. Between him and James, I was feeling fairly hideous. James had me doubting my self-esteem and Coop had me doubting my wiles. Servario on the other hand, was making me feel pretty and sexy. In fact, he made me think things I only thought about when I was alone with a one-handed read.</p><p>I leaned into the mirror and whispered, \"Your kids and your mother need you. This isn\u2019t about revenge sex. You have more self-respect than to let a man have you and not love you. Try to remember that.\u201d</p><p>My libido had gone a long time without any loving and was prepared to wrestle over the matter. It made comments fly through my brain like, 'sex is not love' and 'sometimes a little loving can help you get past things or clear your head'.</p><p>I was already justifying dry humping a criminal and possibly enjoying every second of it. His thick arms and sexy lips made me think there was no \u2018possibly\u2018\u2014I was going to enjoy it. I was going to savor it, like it would be the last time. Of course with him, there was a huge chance it might be the last time. Not to mention, I clearly wasn\u2019t great at it, James had fucked everything that moved for a reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grinned at myself like a Cheshire cat, \"Who better than to learn dirty shit from, than a bad man who I would end up killing anyway?\"</p><p>I was letting my vagina do all the talking. I turned on the cold water and splashed it on my face and then pointed at my dripping face in the mirror, \"Stop.\"</p><p>I distracted myself with the routine I used to do when getting ready, before marriage and yoga pants.</p> <p>I put on body cream and deodorant and then styled my hair and straightened it. I ran my finger through the long, dark silk, it almost felt as good as it had when I was young.</p><p>I put on makeup and stepped back, looking down at my wedding ring and grimaced. I must have put it on subconsciously, again. I had been doing it for weeks. I pulled it off and put it in the drawer to prevent that same mistake. I would save it and give it to Jules when she got older, as long as she never found out the truth about her father. If she did, she might not want the damned thing.</p><p>I felt the need for a dirty, big cry poking around inside of me. I could probably save that for after I murdered the fat guy; I was going to need something then anyway.</p><p>I looked at myself appraisingly, I could do it. I could kill the fat man to save my kids. He was probably a bad man anyway. Nothing mattered but my kids\u2019 safety. The whole point was that we would get through this, no matter what I had to do.</p><p>I left the bathroom naked and crossed to my closet, where I picked out some matching panties and bra. I slipped on a knee-length skirt and a pale pink blouse. I finished with ballet flats and walked out. I looked at myself in the mirror and nodded. I looked pretty but innocent. I had gotten the outfit at Target and hadn\u2019t yet been able to wear it. It was a sensible choice; the flats would guarantee I could run and the blouse was baggy, in case I needed to bring a gun and have it tucked in my back.</p> <p>Yay, all the old thoughts and all the old actions were fitting back nicely in my brain.</p><p>\"You look pretty.\"</p><p>I jumped, \"Stop doing that.\"</p><p>Coop grinned from the bed and watched me.</p><p>I scowled, \"And get off my bed.\"</p><p>He laughed, \"I came to tell you it was time to go and you streak across the room naked\u2014and looking good by the way. I might take back that cougar comment, if I thought it might do me any good.\"</p> <p>My face flushed, \"You can\u2019t take back cougar. That\u2019s permanent damage.\" I turned and walked out of the room, forcing myself to chant cougar cougar cougar. I didn\u2019t need to add young, hot agent to my list of things that triggered my instability and raging hormones. The adrenaline was getting to me. It was how James and I had hooked up in the first place. I had a thing for the thrill and the sex afterward.</p><p>I made it to the bottom stair before he was there. He grabbed my hand and spun me, \"I'm sorry. I didn\u2019t know that you didn\u2019t know you were a cougar.\"</p><p>I gasped and dragged my hand away from him, \"Cougars are forty. Forty and up.\"</p><p>He raised his eyebrows and then nodded, \"Okay.\"</p><p>I felt the disgust creep across my face.</p><p>\"You\u2019re beautiful. You deserved so much better than you got in life.\" He sounded sincere. Of course he also sounded like I had one foot in the grave, no doubt because I was thirty-six. I was nearly retirement age, apparently. My eyes wandered the house briefly, terrified someone was watching us.</p><p>\"How long have you been watching me?\" I asked, starting to feel a bit weird.</p><p>He shrugged, \"A while. We weren\u2019t watching you though. We were watching him.\"</p> <p>\"Did you watch my kids in the bathroom and shit?\"</p><p>He looked horrified, \"What? That\u2019s disgusting. What's wrong with you? No. No one watched the kids at all. Bathrooms and bedrooms had listening devices only. We aren\u2019t perverts.\"</p><p>I put my hands on my hips, \"I want whatever shit is still here, out of this house. No more bugs and cameras.\" I knew I had found most of them, but I didn\u2019t want to chance that I might have missed some.</p><p>He closed his eyes and sighed, \"You are so aggravating. I'm not even having this conversation.\" He turned and walked away.</p><p>I glanced at the clock and took a breath. \"It's time to go,\" I said.</p><p>He came back in, \"Do you know who the fat man is? He's a brother to an arms dealer in Havana. Dangerous family.\"</p><p>I shoot him a look, \"You went thorough my purse?\"</p><p>He shrugged, \"You didn\u2019t give it to me and I needed to see it, and you were in the shower. You took forever in there.\"</p><p>I shoved him but he grabbed my hands and dragged me into the broom closet beside him. In the dark he cupped my cheeks, pressing his face against mine. His lips were softer than I had imagined they would be. His hands left my cheeks and grabbed at me, pulling me into him. I didn\u2019t fight it. It was the best kiss I'd ever had. I let him wrap around me, cupping my ass. Our lips glided against each other, from the gloss that lubed our kiss.</p><p>He sucked my lip in and nibbled it. I moaned into the kiss, as it got deeper. His tongue slipped against mine, caressing it. I sucked it, rubbing my body against his. My hands clawed at his chest like a real cougar would. I stopped kissing and listened to my screaming brain. One half was chanting cougar and the other half was already taking my blouse off.</p><p>I stepped back and pressed my back against the door. I felt around in the dark for the knob. I caught my breath, \u201cAre you insane? You\u2019ve insulted me like eight different ways since we met.\u201d</p><p>\"You need to be prepared for something like this.\u201d He took a step closer, \u201cEvie, we need to talk about the things that might happen,\" he whispered.</p><p>I shook my head, \"Oh...uhm...no.\" I opened the door and turned running up the stairs.</p><p>\"Evie, wait.\" He ran after me, but I slammed the bedroom door, locking it and running to bathroom. I closed the door and locked it. He was in the bedroom and banging on the bathroom door, by the time I turned the bathroom lock.</p><p>\"We need to talk, not here,\" he spoke softly into the crack between the frame and door. Clearly all the listening devices were not gone. That wasn\u2019t even counting the ones Servario might have in the house.</p><p>I looked at my smeared makeup and sighed. I glanced back at the door vibrating from his pounding on it and shook my head, \"No. That was wrong on a whole variety of levels. Firstly, I'm apparently a million years older than you. Secondly, you called me a cougar. Thirdly, my husband might have died two months ago, or he might have just run off with his mistress. Either way, he has abandoned me. Lastly, his funeral was today, as was the first meeting with a man who is blackmailing me to murder someone.\" My hands were waving about like a maniac. I wiped my face clean and started reapplying the makeup.</p><p>\"Evie, we need to talk about things for the mission.\" He sounded sweet. I wanted to open the door.</p><p>I looked at the blush covering my entire face, and the clock that said quarter past nine, and sighed, \"I don\u2019t want to talk about this. I'm emotional and this is wrong. I need to get Vegas over with.\" I knew I was rebounding on him from the rejection of my entire marriage being a lie and my being a moronic idiot, who was attracted to an arms dealer. Coop was the safer bet of the two men. And I was not even touching on the fact, I was about to become a spy and a murderer, or that my family was being flown to safety.</p><p>I ran the brush through my hair again and looked at the finished product. I was respectable again.</p><p>I readjusted my boobs, \u2018cause they were not nineteen anymore either. At thirty-six, sometimes they got a little excited about what we were doing, and ended up out of my shirt. I was pretty sure they tried to jump in Coops face at one point. I touched the door and tried to swallow some of the humiliation I was feeling.</p><p>I opened the door and jumped back. He was standing in the doorway with his hands on either side of the doorframe, trapping me in the bathroom.</p><p>\"We have half an hour before I leave and it's for sure a thirty minute drive,\" I said into his chest. I didn\u2019t look up into his eyes.</p><p>He loomed over me, not budging. \"Can we talk?\"</p><p>I shook my head and tried really hard to stare at his t-shirt.</p><p>He tilted my chin and I burst into laughter.</p><p>He frowned, \"What?\"</p><p>I turned back and grabbed a tissue. I wiped the smears of makeup off his skin. His eyes were cold again and his voice a whisper, \"We need to talk about that kiss, but not here.\"</p><p>I laughed, \"It was just a kiss. I think you've kissed a lot of girls, Coop. You're pretty good at it.\"</p><p>He smirked and arched his eyebrows. His eyes were suddenly sexy and not cold at all. I rolled mine and pressed on his thick chest.</p><p>\"You called me a cougar,\" I muttered.</p><p>\"Grudge holder,\" he mumbled, mocking me.</p><p>I ignored him and walked out to the garage and got into the car, starting it as he jumped in the passenger side and laid the seat back.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" I asked, as I backed out of the garage.</p><p>\"Making sure you arrive safely.\" he grinned.</p><p>I sighed and backed out. I looked at the clock and glared, \"Great, now I'm going to be late.\"</p><p>\"Drive fast.\"</p><p>I grumbled under my breath and punched the gas pedal. I knew how to drive. I learned on a racetrack like everyone else. I just hadn\u2019t done it in a long time.</p><p>\"So are you scared?\" he asked.</p><p>I shot him a confused look, \"What is your deal? Are you bipolar? You were a dick to me and then you're kissing me, and now you're being sweet\u2014why?\"</p><p>He laughed, \"I'm not bipolar. I'm just trying to mess with you. Get you back on your toes. The kiss wasn\u2019t just me seeing you naked and wanting to kiss you. It was also a way to catch you off guard. You need to remember that training, wherever any of this goes. If fat man kisses you, he's going to be pissed if you freeze up like that. You're no doubt going in as a hooker.\"</p><p>I felt the horror in the truth and the fact I liked the kiss.</p><p>He continued, \"You gotta be casual. You\u2019re going to have to convince him you're something special. You're a bit old for a hooker. Most guys who want hookers are leaning more toward that barely-legal thing.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shot him a glare.</p><p>He put his hands up, \"What? It's the truth.\"</p><p>\"You're an asshole. I don\u2019t look thirty-six, and even if I did, that\u2019s not old.\" My palms started to sweat. I shuddered and looked around, anywhere but at him. I was ready to strangle him, but I was doing forty over the speed limit. I needed to focus.</p> <p>He laughed, \"I'm not an asshole.\"</p><p>I snorted.</p><p>\"Okay, I am an asshole, but I am really trying to make you better at this. You've been hibernating for a long time. I seriously have a bad feeling about this whole thing.\" His voice changed when he spoke again, \"You\u2019re sexy for thirty-six and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s old. I was messing with you. Trying to get you feisty. Trying to get your blood boiling. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to be able to do this, Evie.\"</p><p>I scowled, \"Well head-gaming teenager, I don\u2019t get feisty with the old hot and cold, for one. I get shut down and less confident. Not to mention, I am a pretend widow, this is new to me. I've been with the same person for a long time. I'm not playing this game with you. I'm here to save my kids and the last time I checked, you need me. I am fine running with my kids.\"</p><p>I felt something and looked down. His hand was hovering above my thigh. \u201cLiar.\u201d He chuckled.</p> <p>I shook my head, \"Coop, I'm not kidding around. I\u2019m not interested in playing games with you.\"</p><p>He laughed and trailed his fingers up my leg, lifting my skirt, \"What if the old fat guy touches your thigh like this.\"</p><p>Tingles covered my leg. I nervously laughed and pressed the pedal to the floor. The car shot ahead.</p><p>He chuckled but didn\u2019t take away his hand. Instead, he grabbed a handful of my inner thigh. I jerked.</p><p>\"Wrong response, Evie.\"</p><p>I bit my lip and forced myself to relax again.</p> <p>My chest was rising and falling rapidly.</p><p>His fingers were scorching against my thigh. The way he grabbed was rough and not expected, after how lightly he traced his fingers.</p><p>\"How do you kill him?\"</p><p>I was lost. My brain wouldn\u2019t turn on. All the blood in my body was sitting in my tingling and pulsating underwear.</p><p>\"Evie, how do you kill him?\" he asked again and let one of his fingers brush against my panties. I almost took the car off the road. I swerved and shouted simultaneously, \"I DON'T KNOW! I DON\u2019T KNOW! STOP! JUST STOP!\"</p><p>He ran his finger across my panties once more and then pulled his hand away. \"You just blew the whole mission.\"</p><p>I almost told him it wasn\u2019t the only thing I almost blew. Fuck.</p><p>I was panting and feeling like an idiot, when I pulled the car over to the side of the road and parked. I turned and face him. He sat up and scowled, \"We need to get there.\" I could hear the mocking tone.</p> <p>I was trying to get my breathing and heartbeat under control. I wanted to kill him. He was toying with me.</p><p>I felt burning tears creeping into my eyes; there was a ton of rejection inside of me that had been brewing. I hadn\u2019t let it out yet. I hadn\u2019t let myself feel the fury and the shame of my husband never actually wanting me. The playful head games of the boy in front of me were what was going to break me. Not the ten-year marriage. Not the friendship I thought I had with Mel. No, it would be a boy rubbing my underwear.</p><p>I refused for it to be the straw that broke the camel's back. I took a deep breath and pulled the car back on the road.</p><p>\"I will kill him, how the fuck I am told to. I will do whatever the fuck Servario asks me to do. You will keep your hands to yourself. I am not a teenage sorority girl. I am not playing your games.\" I looked at him severely, like his mother would and shouted, \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME, COOP?\"</p><p>He licked his lips and nodded, \"You\u2019re hot when you're pissed. This is a good look for you. Try to maintain this the whole time, okay?\"</p><p>My nostrils flared as I looked back at the road. I was going to have to kill him when I finished with the fat man. That was a given.</p><p>I parked in the parking lot and grabbed my small purse. I had brought nothing else.</p><p>I was about to close the door when he smiled at me and spoke, \"The code for evac is floor 17, room 723. Dial 9-1-1 and tell that to Jack and I will meet you out front of the hotel, and we run for it. See you in Vegas.\"</p><p>I snarled and slammed the door.</p><p>The parking lot was dark. I couldn't help but wonder, how alone I really was. I entered the airport and immediately started to look around. Would they come for me? Would they give me plane tickets? They had frozen my accounts so buying tickets would be hard, unless I used the Visa from the envelope. I had that in my clutch but if I used it, how would it look? I grumbled and looked around. My paychecks from the government hadn\u2019t exactly kicked in yet. I knew, well enough, how missions worked. I never paid for anything with my own money or my own credit. We only ever used untraceable currency, cash. Of course the problem with not being a real agent anymore, was that I didn\u2019t have any cash.</p><p>A woman in a beige dress suit walked up to me. She had sandy-colored hair and bright-red lips. She looked about my age, if not older. She was tall and thin with very high heels. I wondered if her back hurt in them.</p><p>\"Evie, it's so wonderful to see you.\" she beamed.</p><p>I frowned and then smiled back, \"Of course it is. How are you?\"</p><p>She embraced me and slipped something in my pocket.</p><p>\"Say hello to James and the kids for me,\" she muttered and walked off. Her words stung but she smelled nice, like expensive French perfume. I tried to focus on that more than anything.</p><p>\"I will,\" I called after her. I slipped over to the woman's washroom, not checking my pocket until I was in a stall, with the door closed.</p><p>The thing in my pocket was a ticket and ID and a piece of paper with a gate number. I crumpled the paper and flushed it.</p><p>I walked to the sink and gave myself a once over. I didn't look convincing as a hooker. I was definitely more mom than prostitute.</p><p>Leaving the bathroom, I noticed Coop. He was across the way, watching me from a payphone stall for a hotel.</p><p>I scanned by him and walked on. I passed through the security and walked through the domestic gates, until I got to the door I was meant to go through.</p><p>\"Let me get that for you,\" a man's voice spoke suddenly.</p><p>I turned to see Servario's guard from the hallway in the hotel.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" I muttered and walked down the hall with him.</p><p>\"You seemed a bit lost,\" he said, still keeping his voice low.</p><p>\"I was.\"</p><p>\"The plane is just ahead.\" He pointed and walked a bit faster than I did. He was meaty, they always were. It was such a clich\u00e9. Dark hair, olive skin, beefy bodies. They never just got a skinny, pasty guy named Steve to do their dirty work. It was always the one guy I would pick out of a crowd as a possible mercenary.</p><p>\"What's your name?\" I asked, mostly because I wanted to see if he really was a mercenary.</p><p>He glanced back at me, flashing me dark eyes and thick lashes. He even had a scar on his left cheek, \"Steve.\"</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>He frowned, \"What?\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"Nothing. Where you from, Steve?\"</p><p>He grumbled, \"Wisconsin. Where you from, Evie?\"</p><p>I laughed and pulled the ticket and ID out, \"Today I am from Seattle. Are you ex-military?\" I asked, certain that had to be it. He reached over and grabbed the fake ticket and ID from my hand.</p><p>He shook his head, \"No. I worked as an English teacher in Taiwan before I got this job.\"</p><p>My jaw dropped, \"You did not. You're from somewhere like Belarus and you are named Serge, and you worked as a mercenary. Stop the lying.\"</p><p>He laughed, \"I don\u2019t know what that means. I met Servario in Macau. I lost a ton of money to him at the poker table. He offered me a job, instead of killing me. I was on the wrestling team and shit, so I took the job. Better money than teaching little brats English.\"</p><p>I pointed, \u201cWhat about the scar on your cheek? Bullet graze from saving Servario\u2019s life in Monaco?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a horrified look, \u201cNo, dog attack when I was eight. Thanks for bringing it up.\u201d</p><p>It was unbelievable. Steve, the teacher from Wisconsin who was scarred from a childhood horror? Wow.</p><p>I sighed, \"Does your mom know what you do?\"</p><p>He looked at me funny, \"What do I do? I travel and keep Servario safe. He had me trained with VIP Special Forces in France. I haven\u2019t actually had to do anything.\"</p><p>He was chatty for a gorilla. I kind of liked him.</p><p>\"Do you knit too?\" I mocked.</p><p>He gave me a sideways glance, \"Just \u2018cause I haven\u2019t had to do shit, doesn\u2019t mean I won't. Are you going to be trouble, Evie?\"</p><p>I smiled, \"Oh yeah, Steve. Tons.\"</p><p>He grinned, \"You do sort of look like my eighth-grade teacher, Mrs. Sanderson. All sweet and kind. You probably have fresh-baked cookies at home.\"</p><p>I scowled, \"I do but, please don't call me old, Steve. I'm having a rough week with that one. I\u2019ve counted at least twenty ma\u2019am\u2019s in one week.\"</p><p>He sighed, \"I'd say you're just having a rough couple months. But don\u2019t worry \u2018cause Mrs. Sanderson was hot and she was young.\"</p><p>\u201cGod bless you.\u201d I laughed as he opened the door at the end of the long corridor and held it for me. I walked past him and looked at the jet in front of us. \"Wow.\" It was beautiful. Long and white and sleek.</p><p>A lady in a uniform stood at the bottom of the stairs, smiling at me like a normal attendant. I knew she probably wasn\u2019t normal.</p><p>I walked to her smiling.</p><p>\"Welcome aboard.\" She was pretty\u2014fake, but pretty.</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I said and climbed up the stairs. The jet made it real. Steve climbed aboard after me and pointed to the back, \"Go get comfy.\u201d</p><p>I looked around, wanting to whistle. The jet had its own pods in a row in the back and a few rows of seats. It was the opposite of a normal plane. I walked to a pod and sat. I fastened my seatbelt and folded the bed back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a laptop desk in the front of the pod and a flat screen. It was all very fancy.</p><p>I curled into the duvet that was there and laid my head on the pillow. I was beat, there was no doubt, but I wasn\u2019t sure if I would be able sleep.</p><p>I closed my eyes but the sounds around me made me nervous. I opened them to see Servario sitting across from me grinning.</p> <p>I sat up quickly, \"Oh. I didn\u2019t know you were here.\"</p><p>He frowned, \"It's my plane.\"</p><p>I nodded, \"I know. I just don\u2019t get why you would give me the piece of paper and the room key, if you were going to be on the plane.\"</p><p>He shrugged, \"I needed you to get acquainted with the idea. I know you've never killed anyone before.\"</p><p>I sighed and lay back on the bed, \u201cDid you custom build this rig? Why are the good seats at the back?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t look up from his laptop, \u201cBest chances of survival are in the back of the plane. The rich always die when it crashes.\u201d</p><p>I hated talking about crashing, right before flying.</p><p>\"Where are your kids, Evie?\" he spoke without looking at me.</p><p>I shook my head, \"I don\u2019t know. I told my mom to drive and not come back, until I told her it was safe.\"</p><p>He sighed, \"That was smart. How will you reach them since her cell phone is still at the house, and the kids don\u2019t have anything plugged into the Internet?\"</p><p>I hated that he had checked that. I hated that he knew my kids existed at all. \"I gave her a pay-as-you-go cell phone. I am the only one with the number. I'll call when it's safe.\" The lies came fast.</p> <p>He glanced at me with a grin on his lips, \"You think it will be safe one day?\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"I don\u2019t know. I won't have them live a half life here with me.\"</p><p>He nodded, \"You're a very good mother.\"</p><p>I hated that he was nice to me. He nodded at the flight attendant. She came right over and smiled at me, \"I'm Roxy. Can I get you a drink?\" Of course she was a Roxy, foxy Roxy.</p><p>\"Red wine?\" I asked.</p><p>She batted her long lashes and listed the wines, \"Cab, merlot, pinot, blends, countries, we have it all. You have a favorite?\"</p><p>I open my mouth but Servario spoke before I could, \"She likes something called Apothic. You'll find some back there. I'll have a glass of the same.\"</p><p>My cheeks flushed, \"You drink Apothic?\" I ignored the fact he knew what I drank.</p> <p>He shrugged, \"I drink whatever. I'm not picky when it comes to red wine. I like most. Vodka and tequila though, very picky.\"</p><p>I sat my bed back up into a seat and snuggled into it. She delivered our glasses of wine and smiled when she told us about dinner. \"We are starting with French onion soup, then having a side of lyonnaise, and for the main we are having steak b\u00e9arnaise with sweet potato straws, and finishing with chocolate mousse for dessert.\"</p><p>He nodded, as if she told us which sandwiches were available from the vending machine, \"Sounds good.\"</p><p>\"Soup before takeoff?\" she asked.</p><p>He gave her a thumbs up without looking at her or thanking her for the wine.</p><p>I smiled at her, \"Thank you. For everything.\"</p><p>She smiled before she walked away.</p><p>I could smell the food as soon as she was gone. The soup wafted through the jet.</p><p>I sipped the wine and sighed. It was divine. It needed a little more air, but it was still the nectar of the gods.</p><p>\"Have you eaten much lately?\" he asked still looking at his computer.</p><p>I sipped, \"No. Mostly alcohol and coffee. I had something yesterday, I don\u2019t recall what it was.\"</p><p>He looked at me and shook his head, \"You're skinny and need to build back your muscles. You were in much better shape when I saw you working last.\"</p><p>I scowled and sipped the wine, \u201cYou watched me then? You knew I was CI?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at me but I saw his lip lift into a half grin. He ignored my question when he spoke, \"It's an easier life as a house wife; I suppose that was why you quit.\"</p><p>My jaw dropped but I saw the grin grow across his face. \"Not even funny.\"</p><p>He looked at me and laughed honestly, flashing his dimples, \"It seems like wretched work. You could have kept your job. You were good at it. We worried about you and your abilities, the entire time you worked. Everyone knew, one day you would be a great spy like your father. For what I was giving your husband, you could easily have afforded a nanny and a maid. \"</p><p>I scoffed and forced myself not to think about my dad or how great I might have been, \"It wasn't that great of money.\"</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow and looked back at the computer. He typed for a moment and then turned the screen to me, \"This is your husband\u2019s payroll bank account with me.\"</p><p>When I saw the seventh number in the balance column, I pressed my eyes shut tight for a moment. When I opened them again, I looked harder at the number. \"What the fuck is that?\" I whispered. My voice wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>\"Watch your language,\" he said and turned the screen back to him, \"That is the account, I paid your husband with. You understand what payroll is right?\"</p><p>I felt sick. Sick with rage and betrayal. I was coupon clipping and scrimping and saving like a madwoman to stay at home with my kids, and still have them in all their activities and sports.</p><p>He looked up, \"You can get angry about it later. Right now, the soup is here.\"</p><p>He reached over and flipped down my tray for me. I was frozen. When she placed the bowl in front of me, my body reacted to the smell and sight. I nestled in the chair better to focus my energy around the soup and not the vibrating anger threatening me. The soup smelled divine. The crouton top was covered in crusty cheese.</p><p>I cracked the top and dug my spoon in. The onions were cooked to perfection. They instantly broke up, instead of staying long and stringy. The first sip was unbelievable. \"She's an amazing chef.\" I muttered softly.</p><p>He chuckled, \"She is that. It's why I keep her around.\"</p><p>I rolled my eyes and took another bite, \u201cYeah, has nothing to do with her tight ass, or perfect face, or fabulous body.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me sideways, \u201cI told you to watch your mouth. I understand you\u2019re angry, but you can\u2019t direct it at me. I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>He was right, being rude about Roxy was petty.</p><p>But no matter how hard I pushed it all away, I couldn\u2019t get past the money. \"You know he made me feel like shit for not going back to work. He told me we were going to struggle until I did find a regular wife job, like bank teller. He made me feel like every week was another hard sacrifice for him. Like my house keeping, cooking, baking, and parenting was just a hobby. Sometimes, I drove them to twelve different sports and activities in a week, between them both. I was a chauffeur and slave to all three of them. He made me quit my yearly membership to hot yoga. I had to buy the punch cards and not go all the time.\"</p><p>I dropped the spoon and covered my eyes, \"I am an idiot. I fell for it all. I swore they were just friends. You know, at our wedding they were dancing and she was crying. I thought she was so happy for us. Then later, when I couldn\u2019t find them, either of them, James said his brother was drunk off his ass and he needed him to help him to bed. He said Mel had left; she was being designated driver for people. He tried to make me feel bad for not saying goodbye to her. Arggg!\" I shook my head, fighting the tears and losing the battle.</p><p>When I looked at him, he looked horrified.</p><p>I picked up my spoon and started eating again. \"Well, I'm done being sorry he died. I'm done being the widow of the great fucking James Evans. I hate my name.\" I started to laugh like a madwoman, \"I hate my name. I was Evie Anderson, before I got married. Evie Evans sounds stupid. My name is Evangeline Erica Evans. Three E's. I liked being an Anderson. I liked being in the military. I liked my life, just the way it was. I didn\u2019t want a baby with an asshole either. He wasn\u2019t the only one, who got something he didn\u2019t plan for. But you know the difference? The difference is, that when it happened I was all in. I didn\u2019t just show up, I was there for it all. My son will never know he wasn\u2019t planned and wanted by both of us. Even if James is alive.\"</p><p>I closed my eyes again and took deep breaths. I had spent half an hour on my makeup and he wasn\u2019t ruining that too.</p><p>I opened my glassy eyes and pointed my spoon at the poor, helpless drug and arms dealer in front of me, \"I am going to kill that fat man and I am going to finish this shit. Then I am taking some of that money, and going on the vacation we haven't been able to afford the last ten years, because I wasn\u2019t working.\" I cackled like I was crazed and started eating my soup again.</p><p>I muttered crazily about the sacrifices he made to keep us in the custom of life we were used to. The sports and the activities that cut so deeply into our funding. Now I was on a jet with a bad man, eating the most delicious soup I had ever eaten, and lying to clean up his mess. His mess that got him fake killed, so I could be a single parent.</p><p>I pointed my crazy spoon again, \u201cYou freeze that account, Servario. You make it so he can\u2019t get a dime. That is going to my kids.\u201d</p><p>I would be a rich, single parent who would never have to worry about money again, or stress about the fact, she didn\u2019t have enough to pay all the bills. A single parent with no husband to cheat and shame her to everyone in the world. A single mother who got to have all the say. No more arguing about our differing parenting.</p><p>I sipped my wine and processed it. I nodded, \u201cThis is actually quite good. We will kill the fat man and I will move on.\u201d</p><p>\"You're a very scary little thing,\" he said, as Roxy came back and took our soup bowls.</p><p>\"We are going to start taxiing now,\" she spoke softly and filled our glasses.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" I said again. She gave me a quizzical look.</p><p>I glanced at him, \"You never thank her, that\u2019s really rude. And I'm not scary. I'm a regular woman.\"</p><p>He raised his eyebrows, \"I think not. And I thank her with a very large paycheck. Trust me, she is compensated.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I drank back the wine and watched him, \"You don\u2019t look the way I imagined you would,\" I said softly.</p><p>He gave me a funny look, \"What do you remember about me?\"</p><p>I shook my head to stop from panicking, it was a tactic I had used before, \"I meant as a man who orders people to kill others and does bad things.\" The wine was getting to me.</p> <p>He studied my face as I answered. Seeming satisfied, he nonchalantly spoke, \"How did you think someone like me would look?\"</p><p>\"Like the fat man in the white suit, or Bin Laden, or Rush Limbaugh.\"</p><p>He grimaced, \"The white suit went out with the mullet and Bin Laden wore his beard far too long. If I do a beard it's always groomed and stylish.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"I have never seen you with a beard. You were so baby-faced as a boy.\"</p><p>He was up and out of the chair far faster than I would have imagined him able to move. He undid my seatbelt and dragged me to the back of the plane. He opened a door and dragged me in, slamming the door shut, \"What do you remember of me from before?\"</p> <p>I stuttered, \"I-I-I re-re-remember you from be-be-before, as a k-k-kid. M-m-maybe twenty-five.\"</p><p>He looked into my eyes with scrutinizing severity. He towered over me. I didn\u2019t dare look around the small space. I stayed with him, let him lock my gaze.</p><p>\"You remember me from before?\" he sounded confused.</p><p>\"When I worked\u2014before the kids, I followed you for a time. They always knew you would outgrow your arms dealing, when you took over the company from your father. I knew who you were when we met. I had watched you for a couple years.\" He was killing my wine buzz.</p><p>He licked his lips and lessened his vice-grip hold on me. My skin burned where he touched it. He looked at the welt on my wrist as he let go. He took a deep breath and chuckled. His face was a mixture of relief and confusion. I was a mess. I trembled and tried to back up, but I was against the counter in the bathroom. Why had he pulled me down there? Why had he not roughed me up in front of Steve?</p><p>\"What did I say about lying to me?\" he asked softly.</p> <p>My stomach dropped, \u201cI swear\u2014I never lied. You never asked if I remembered you.\u201d</p><p>His hands trailed up my back, pulling me into him. He cradled me against him. I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. He was insane, that much was clear.</p><p>He released me and reached for the door, but the jet took off. He was thrown against the wall behind him, with me pressed into his chest.</p><p>He smirked at the helpless state of me. His hands roamed my back, eventually cupping my ass and lifting me up into his lips. I pressed on his chest, fighting the whole way but he won out, with the plane pushing me into him and the considerable difference in our strength.</p><p>His mouth owned mine. His hands lifted my skirt, grabbing handfuls of ass cheek, as his tongue slid into my mouth. I felt him harden against my belly. He ground himself against me, rubbing me into him.</p><p>He swung us around and sat on the toilet. My legs draped over his lap, as his mouth roamed my neck. He kissed and sucked, nibbling at my tender skin. His huge hands rotated my pelvis against his, forcing a lap dance out of me.</p><p>His soft lips nipped at my shoulder as he dragged my blouse to the side.</p><p>I shook my head, \"I can't do this.\"</p> <p>He looked up from the buttons on my blouse and shook his head, \"I didn\u2019t ask you for your opinion. I told you I own everything, Evie. Right now that includes your pussy.\"</p><p>I gasped as a feverish heat claimed my entire face. He sucked the air from me with his kiss. It was passionate and demanding.</p><p>He stood up with me in his arms, and placed me on the counter, with the pressure of the plane pushing him into me. He dropped to his knees and lifted my skirt. He pulled my panties to the side and licked hard. I cried out, gripping his head. He pulled at my clit in short, fast sucks and then licked the length of me, sticking his tongue inside.</p><p>I bucked forward but he held me in place. He started the sucking spurts again and I lost the battle. I let go of his head and leaned back into the wall. I let him lick and tongue-fuck me. Every inch of me was on fire, when I felt his finger at the entrance of my pussy. I cried out a second time as he thrust his thick finger inside. I was well lubed from the near orgasmic state I was in. His finger moved with his tongue flicks, sending me over the edge. My body clenched down on him, just as he slid a second finger in. He pumped me with his fingers bringing me to climax.</p><p>I made a sound I'd never heard leave my lips, as even my ass clenched. I felt it in my toes, but before I could even finish it, he was standing between my thighs and sliding his cock head up and down the length of me. He pushed inside, finishing my orgasm with his cock pumping hard.</p><p>He leaned over me; he was all consuming, as he growled down onto me, \"Tell me who owns your pussy, Evie.\"</p><p>I was flabbergasted and dizzy. He ripped open my shirt and tore off my bra. He grabbed behind me, arching my back and flicked his tongue across my nipple, before wrapping his lips around it and sucking hard.</p><p>The strange sound escaped my lips again. He pulled me down and bucked harder. I placed my feet on the wall behind him, so he could get deeper. His balls slapped against me, spanking my ass.</p><p>\"Do I own your pussy?\"</p><p>I nodded, catching a glimpse of his devilish smile through his lashes, as he looked up from my breast.</p><p>\"Do I own you?\"</p><p>I nodded again, \"You own me.\"</p><p>He gripped my hips, jerking me into the wall again. I felt something I had never felt before, a second orgasm. I dug my hands into his hair and dragged his face up to mine. Hungrily, I sucked his lips into mine. I could taste myself on his lips. He kept his pace, feeling my body tightening.</p><p>\"You want that orgasm?\" he broke our kiss and murmured in my ear, as he nipped at my lobe.</p><p>I nodded my sweaty face against his.</p><p>\"What do you say?\"</p><p>\"P-p-please,\" I panted.</p><p>He gathered me up in his arms and spun me again. My back slammed against the wall. I wrapped my legs around him, gripping his huge shoulders. His hands dug into my ass. He fucked me against the wall, harder than I had ever been.</p><p>He bounced me on his cock, spreading his legs to make a plateau for me to rest against. I clawed at his skin, trying desperately to keep at the angle I was at. I came, biting down on his shoulder. He grunted and moaned into my nape. I felt him pulsate and fill me. He jerked his orgasm into the wall and me. His legs twitched. \"God damned,\" he whispered.</p><p>I nodded, \"I think God had a hand in that.\"</p><p>He laughed, but I was serious. There was no way, one man could make me feel like that. Nothing on the planet, had ever made me feel like that. It was a release like I had never had.</p><p>It was better than crying and letting my steam off. I might never cry again, if he could keep that up. I slapped myself mentally, and reminded my filthy brain that I had just let a criminal screw me. I started to giggle when he kissed me softly and helped me stand on my own, pulling his cock from me.</p><p>\"What's funny?\"</p><p>I shook my head and looked down at my underwear on the floor, torn off. I didn\u2019t even recall that moment.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"We just joined the mile-high club.\" I felt the blush, still on my face, redden. Inside however, I was freaking out and screaming.</p><p>What had I just done?</p><p>He brushed off my mile-high comment, \"Oh that.\"</p><p>I bit my lip and knew he had joined the club, long before I ever came along. He was probably the chair of the arms-dealer sector. I tried to straighten my clothes, but I noticed the rip in my skirt and lack of buttons on my blouse. I grabbed the destroyed ends of my very expensive, lace bra and gave him a hostile look. He did his pants up and left the bathroom. He returned seconds later, passing a robe through. \"Just come eat in the robe.\" He closed the door again.</p><p>I scowled, \"I'm not eating dinner in a robe,\" I shouted through the door but he was gone. I picked up my clothes and started to clean up.</p><p>Looking into the mirror, I could swear I didn\u2019t know the girl looking back at me. If I looked too hard I would see me, and then I would have to let in some of the shame I was repressing for having fun, while my kids and mother were on the run.</p><p>Chapter Seven - New you means new shoes</p><p>\"I wish we could put you in something classic. You would make a beautiful widow.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, \u201cHe told you my husband was dead?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, \u201cI overheard him talking about it. Anyway, this is going to look amazing on you.\"</p><p>She passed me a charcoal leather mini skirt and I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, only the movie was going backwards.</p><p>I looked at the label and coughed, \"Silvia Eisele? Is this for real? It must have cost a thousand dollars for this skirt?\"</p><p>She smirked, \"I know, right. He always has the nicest shit.\"</p><p>I scowled, \"Does he bring a lot of women on board?\"</p><p>She shook her head, \"No,\" her eyes were wide, \"I think you're the first. He doesn't bring anyone but Steve\u2014well and me. I live on this damned thing, I swear. Well, and the yacht too. That\u2019s where the ladies come and then they cum. You should hear the dirty shit that\u2019s said in those hallowed halls.\u201d She winked at me. Was she oblivious to the fact, he had just shredded my clothing off in the restroom? Did she think I went in there like Superwoman, but realized after, I had shredded my clothes that my costume was at home?</p><p>She did up a zipper and nattered on, \u201cThe women's clothes are for me. We stop everywhere, so I have clothes for my off time.\"</p><p>I laughed, \"Rough.\"</p><p>She gave me a serious look, \"I am probably going to get cancer from this bloody plane. You know how much radiation flight attendants are exposed to?\"</p><p>I flinched, \"No.\"</p><p>She rolled her eyes, \"A lot.\"</p><p>I looked around the back room for a shower, \"There isn\u2019t a shower in here is there?\" I wanted him off my skin. I wanted him out of me.</p><p>She laughed, \"This isn\u2019t an RV.\"</p><p>I sighed, \"I smell.\"</p><p>She laughed and pointed to the clothes set out, \"Just dress. He wants us back out there in like a minute.\" Her bright, glossy eyes narrowed, \"We don\u2019t make him angry, ever.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. I had sort of assumed that, with the profession he had undertaken. He was a bad man.</p><p>A bad man my vagina crazy loved.</p><p>And I was back to the Pretty Woman analogy.</p> <p>I hiked up the skirt and pulled on the black-lace underwear that shaped around my ass perfectly. I checked the tag and nodded, French, of course. They were probably hundred-dollar underwear.</p><p>Did James buy these for Mel? Did they laugh at me, when they pretended to be at work, but were really spending crazy amounts of money, and living it up with his millions? Did she have millions too? Was I the only idiot who missed the affair, that was suddenly so obvious from every angle I looked at it now?</p><p>I sighed and pulled on the charcoal-leather-pushup bandeau that matched the skirt. I attached the clasp and looked at myself. I looked sexy, my stomach was flat, my legs were long and toned from the running, and my boobs looked hot in the bra. I felt dirty though. It was a bra bought with drugs, guns, and blood money. I looked at myself and remembered what my dad always told me, \"When running an Intel op, you have to remember that you aren\u2019t the person you were when you woke up. You're the person you need to be. You're whatever your country needs you to be, and that is the hard part of the job, Evie. Can you be what they need and not who you want?\"</p><p>I would nod and he would say, \"Because I can tell you, those two or three or four people will never be the same, as the person you want to be. This job can rot you from the inside. You gotta let it hurt for a second and then you gotta turn it off.\"</p><p>In my green eyes, I saw his.</p> <p>I saw the pride he had when I graduated top honors. I saw the way he introduced me. I saw the way he accidentally groomed me for the job when he was raising me.</p><p>I let it hurt for a second and then I turned it off.</p><p>I looked down at the Christian Louboutin ankle-boot pumps and smiled. My back was going to kill me, but I was going to look sexy as hell while in that pain. I styled my hair with mousse, making it look euro trash. I could be receiving a CMA award with that hair. I glued the false lashes on and back-lined them. I fluttered my eyes and balanced it with mascara and steel-gray shadow. I dabbed the Russian Red MAC lipstick across my mouth and slid the gloss on after. Seeing myself like that, I was stunned. I hadn't looked like that in a long time. My brain, the dirty, cheap, fighting, bitch she was, made a snide-asshole comment about that being the reason James had strayed. But I knew, he had been straying from the start and no low self-esteem, was going to convince me otherwise.</p><p>I slipped on the boots, getting my balance before attempting anything else. Then I pulled on the leather halter-top and called to Roxy, who had gone in the other room.</p><p>The curtain pulled back, but the hands that touched my back were not hers. I looked up suddenly in the mirror. He smirked, \"You look like trouble.\" He zipped me up and then slid his arms around me.</p><p>I smiled and tried not to get any Russian Red on my teeth.</p> <p>His hands grabbed my hips, pulling me back into his groin, \"I like your ass at this height.\" He rubbed himself against me again. Was he hard already? My body had a response for that, I may or may not have agreed, but the response was there.</p><p>He moved my huge hair to one side and nestled himself in my neck, \"Odd, I just had you and now I want you again. Maybe it's because I can smell sex on you still.\"</p><p>I blushed, \"I was hoping to take a shower.\" I didn\u2019t want to have that conversation in front of a mirror, while he dry humped me and made me watch.</p><p>He shook his head and never even tried to fight the shit-eating grin that crossed his delicious lips, \"You smell as you should for the job you're about to do.\"</p><p>I shuddered when he spoke into my nape and left a single kiss.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it going to be too late for a hooker to show up at a room?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and kissed me softly, \u201cNo. We gain several hours back and he has the order in for one in the morning. We land just in time.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cBut that\u2019s four in the morning to my body. I\u2019ll be dead on my feet.\u201d</p> <p>He licked my neck, \u201cYou\u2019ll be on your back, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>The fire inside of me tried to lash out at him; I had loads of smart-ass comebacks. I fought them all.</p><p>He winked, \"Your daddy trained you well, Evie,\u201d and spanked my ass as he walked back out of the room.</p><p>My lower lip trembled. I smeared the gloss on one more layer thick, and walked after him. I sat in my perfectly-made up chair. It was like I had never been there. \"Roxy must have OCD.\"</p><p>He laughed, \"She does. Best qualities in a cook and assistant.\"</p><p>I sat and crossed my legs. I loosened up and grabbed my wine. It was the only remnant of my meal. I drank the glass back in a gulp.</p><p>\"So I really have to wear this?\" I looked down and shook my head.</p><p>He laughed, \"We won't ever negotiate on your clothing, ever.\"</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cYeah, whatever. I\u2019m a yoga pants sort of girl. Me and you will be hitting us some Lulu, at some point. You think my ass looks good in this skirt\u2014you should see it in Lululemon yoga pants.\u201d</p><p>He looked confused, \u201cYou are truly an odd woman.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, \u201cNo, you\u2019re just used to being around twenty-year-olds. They lack the I-don\u2019t-give-a-shit attitude that hits when you reach your mid-thirties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could get past that, because everything else has been quite entertaining.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed, \u201cWait until I get a hot flash and scream at you, because you have a sweater on that\u2019s making me hot. I had a hysterectomy when I was thirty, put me directly into menopause. How hot is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite hot if you run about ripping your clothes off, when you get one of those flash things?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \u201cNo. I basically turn red and sweaty and yell a lot. Hot yoga keeps them at bay. Yoga and saunas. I basically need to sweat a lot to stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make you sweat,\u201d he muttered and leaned over closer to me, running his finger down my bare arm, \"Do you realize how odd it is that you believe I had your husband and his lover murdered, and yet, you let me make you cum with my mouth and cock?\"</p><p>He was goading me.</p><p>I smiled, \"He wasn\u2019t really ever my husband, though was he\u2014not really. And I don\u2019t think he or his lover are dead. Besides, the sex was nice.\"</p><p>He arched an eyebrow, \"Both times? I think it was a lot more than nice.\" He adjusted himself and looked up at Steve, \"Go sit up front and tell Roxy we don\u2019t need her till we land.\"</p><p>Steve got up and walked to the front of the jet. He closed a door, leaving us back there alone.</p><p>I looked at him and sneered, \"You've got to be kidding me; what are seventeen?\"</p><p>He shook his head, \"Stand up and shut your mouth, unless I tell you to open it.\"</p><p>My heart started to race. I stood up. He admired me and nodded, \"Turn around.\"</p><p>I glanced at his huge erection and turned around slowly.</p><p>\"Take your panties down, slowly and bend from the waist, no knees.\"</p><p>I was his plaything.</p><p>I winced and trailed my sweaty hands up my thighs, dragging my skirt with them. I looked to the right at the single door stopping everyone from seeing what I was about to do. They were probably taping it. I swallowed my fear and the onion soup threatening to come back up. I looped my fingers in the panties and pulled them down slowly. I bent forward, grateful I had done all my ablutions before I got on the plane. I dragged them right down to the boots, bending all the way. I was about to step out of them when he spoke, \"Don\u2019t move.\"</p><p>I felt the heat from his fingers lingering over my ass cheek. He traced across and down. I lurched forward when he slid his finger inside of my slightly-swollen pussy.</p><p>His other hand came across my ass cheeks hard, \"I said don\u2019t move.\"</p><p>I held my core tight as he pumped his finger in and out like he was bent on torturing me. It was too slow and soft, but still I was mouth breathing into my own knees.</p><p>I started to relax, until I heard him rustling and then felt his body behind mine. His finger pumped hard, making me gasp, before his cock replaced it. He shoved in hard. I cried out, it was too loud for an airplane door to conceal.</p><p>He thrust in a circular motion, all the while holding me bent forward. I thanked God I had gotten addicted to hot yoga. My spine was flexible and able to take the assault.</p><p>\"God, you feel good,\" he muttered, taking long, rhythmic strides.</p><p>He shortened his pumps, like he was using me, enjoying me.</p><p>My brain tried to register the fact, he was using me and I liked it.</p><p>\"I am never letting you go. You are mine, forever. Sweet fucking God,\" he cried out when it felt as if he had reached something of a peak, and then started pumping again. \"You. Get. So. Wet. For. Me. Evie.\"</p><p>He jackhammered me almost, with the angle I was at. His thrusts slapped his balls against me, spanking all the way to my clit. I gripped the seat next to me, moaning into it just as he came. He slowed his thrusts and then stopped suddenly.</p><p>\"You are the hottest piece of ass, I have fucked in a long time.\"</p><p>Blood was rushing to my head. I needed to sit up, but he held me down.</p><p>I felt him touching where his cock was plugging my hole. He dragged the moisture of his semen up to my ass. My eyes bugged when he touched the wrong hole.</p><p>\"That\u2019s never been touched has it?\" he asked, just dipping his finger in the very entrance of my asshole.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\"Hmm, we'll have to remedy that in the near future,\" he slipped the finger in farther. I had dozens of bad thoughts.</p><p>\"Relax. I'm not going any farther, I don\u2019t have the right tools for the job and this is not the position to do it in anyway,\" his voice was soft... satisfied.</p><p>He pulled out his finger and his cock at the same time. He slipped past me and walked to the back of the plane. I leaned on the seat in front of me and tried to catch the sobbing tears in my throat. I hated that he got off and I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Wait, that was the thing that was burning me the most?</p><p>My brain forced the thought of the ass-sex comment to the forefront. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I needed to make that bigger than not having an orgasm.</p><p>Anal was a huge no for me.</p><p>I would kill him, before I let him put his cock in my ass. I had always been a \"Me First\" sort of girl in that area. I told James, if I could do it to him with a dildo, then he was welcome to do it to me afterward. Needless to say, we never had the conversation much.</p> <p>I grabbed a linen napkin, a bottle of water, and kicked off my underwear. I picked them up and walked to the back of the jet for a second sponge bath, and a possible mental breakdown. I wondered if you were allowed to smoke on private planes? Or if Roxy had any for when we landed.</p><p>I was sitting with my legs pulled in, near fetal position, when Roxy came back with a glass of wine.</p><p>I took it, avoiding her eyes.</p><p>\"He's an asshole sometimes. He's a perve and a total bigot. He doesn\u2019t see you as anything but a means to an end. He sleeps with everyone.\" She spoke so quietly I could barely make out the words.</p><p>I glanced up and her, smiling weakly, \"I got that message loud and clear. I\u2019ve known him for a whole day and here we are.\"</p> <p>She looked scared, \"If you get the chance... run.\" She left it at that. I nodded and we spoke things with our eyes.</p><p>She softened instantly and pointed, \"You need to take a seat though. We're in Vegas.\"</p><p>I shuddered again and left the chair in the small change room, to follow her back to my seat.</p><p>He glanced up at me and smirked, \"So, I want you to do two things for me.\"</p><p>Swallowing my pride, I sat and tried not to notice the constant throb in my hundred dollar panties.</p><p>\"Kill him fast, otherwise he's going to be expecting something,\" his voice was calm.</p> <p>I shot him a look. He laughed, \"You know why he's got you coming? The hotel told me he has a standing order, new girl every night.\"</p><p>Coop's words flashed in my mind, \"He won't be expecting someone younger?\" I asked.</p><p>He looked me over, \"He won't be disappointed when you show up looking like that.\" He leaned over to me, \"He doesn\u2019t touch what's mine, so I expect your training better be as sharp as it was. You will pay if he touches anything.\"</p><p>I gulped. He was taking the whole caveman, \u2018you are mine\u2019 thing too far. It was much further than I expected, even from someone like him. I assumed it was a heat of the moment sort of thing. He would get over it when he saw me watch a chick flick with snot running down my face, and Ben and Jerry keeping me company.</p><p>He reached over and ran his hand up my thigh, \"I have a suite in the Bellagio. You will meet me there afterward.\"</p><p>I frowned, \"Alright look, the sex was nice. It was fun. I feel young and adventurous again. Thank you for that. I\u2019m feeling more alive than I have in years. I owe you for that. I feel like I might have compensated you already for it, but we can argue over that later. But you must need to rest at some point. I personally have been married for the last decade. That means sex once a month, and only really on a day where I drank too much wine and read something hot and naughty. Usually a Saturday or a Sunday. To be honest, we haven\u2019t actually had sex in seven months. Looking back, I\u2019m not sure how I missed that as a bad sign for the five months he wasn\u2019t pretending to be dead. But I can\u2019t be having sex every hour on the hour. I\u2019ll need an ice pack for my hoohoo.\"</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow, \"I don\u2019t know what you're talking about. I don\u2019t know what a hoohoo is. Focus. You will come back to the room and I will clean you myself.\"</p><p>Was he goading me again? He had to be kidding. Even David Duchovny didn\u2019t have that much sex in one day. I was going to get a rash if this continued, or at the very least, a bladder infection. Clearly, he hadn\u2019t been reading much Cosmo.</p> <p>He ignored my protests, \"The second thing I need you to do is, take this and write on the mirror in the hotel room.\" He handed me a tube of lipstick. It was Russian Red. He was setting me up. Why the hell was he setting me up?</p><p>I took it and nodded, \"What should I write?\" My stomach was in my throat. It was panicking and plotting an escape, instead of a murder.</p><p>He smirked and tried to dazzle me with his hazel eyes and handsome face, \"Whatever you like.\"</p><p>The room would be bugged, the hotel would be bugged, he would be watching my every move. If he had the manager telling him what the fat man was doing about hooker supplies, he was watching the surveillance cameras.</p><p>I remembered the phone I had in my clutch, the one that if I dialed 9-1-1, I would get the young man. That would get me Coop. I shoved the lipstick in my clutch and snapped it shut. \"How do you want it done?\" I asked.</p><p>He shrugged, \"Make it interesting. Surprise me.\" His smiled turned devilish, \"Thus far, I have to say, I've been very pleasantly surprised by you.\"</p><p>I hated myself in that moment\u2014the me I wanted to be, not the me my country needed me to be.</p><p>All I could think was, that the Burrow had better be something so fucking important the president himself would thank me for finding it, and taking a finger in the ass.</p><p>Chapter Eight - What happens in Vegas... Shit</p><p>I dialed 9-1-1 from the stall of the ladies\u2019 washroom.</p><p>The young man was there instantly.</p><p>\"My, you look spiffy. Where are you going, the CMA awards?\"</p><p>My hands shook, as I nearly cried with joy, \"Bellagio. Bathrooms by the slot machines on the east wall.\" My old ways were slowly coming back. I could tell directions again and notice things.</p><p>\"Coop said he'll be there in a second. Hold tight.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"I don\u2019t have seconds. They're watching the doors, halls, and floors.\"</p><p>He winked, \"We\u2019ve got this.\" And the call ended.</p><p>He was a cheeky little shit. CMA awards, really?</p><p>I heard the door to the bathroom open. I held my breath as footsteps made their way across the shiny floor. I stepped up onto the toilet and waited.</p><p>Dark-brown dress shoes stopped outside the door. My heart was almost leaping from my throat, \"Do we have a secret knock or just whatever?\" His voice was my saving grace. I reached for the lock and turned it. He swung open the door and smiled. His eyes were serious. \"You okay?\"</p><p>I felt the tears coming. I shook my head. I wanted to tell him everything and nothing. I wanted to touch my filthy disgusting face to his soft beautiful face, but I didn\u2019t. I looked down, ashamed.</p><p>\"Did he hurt you?\" his voice was deep and scary.</p><p>I parted my gooey lips but nothing came out.</p><p>Had he hurt me?</p><p>I supposed he had, but he had also made me cum like no man ever had. I closed my lips and shook my head.</p><p>Coop\u2019s huge hand cupped my chin and lifted my face, \"We all do things we're ashamed of for the job. I worked as a gigolo for three months in Sweden, once.\" He fought a grin, \u201cIt was rough.\u201d</p><p>Someone else whispered harshly, \"Speak for yourself. I woulda nailed his ass in every crevice of that airplane and never felt a moment of shame. Did you get some for me?\"</p><p>I laughed when I leaned forward to see Luce. She winked at me.</p><p>I sighed and whispered back, \"The plane ride isn\u2019t the issue; I have to kill the fat man, and write with the lipstick I'm wearing, on a mirror. He\u2019s setting me up.\"</p><p>Coop processed, \"Then what?\"</p><p>I gulped, \"Back to his room upstairs.\"</p><p>His lip twitched as he took it all in. He looked crazed, \u201cHis room?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cHopefully for some sleep.\u201d</p><p>He spoke after a minute, \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with that later. For now, we need the hit to go smooth and look like an accident. The room is gonna be recorded, you know that right?\"</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\"You have to make it look like an accident\u2014smother him while having sex?\" Luce gave me a weak smile.</p><p>I scowled, \"I've been getting molested the whole way from Boston and could have come up with better plans, than whatever you two have right now. What the fuck were you doing on the plane?\"</p><p>Luce grinned, \"I watched a couple movies.\"</p><p>My face dropped. She laughed, \"It was a joke. We have a plan. Just need to sort through the couple variables you\u2019ve added.\"</p><p>I glanced up at Coop, he was still wearing his processing face. He slipped his hand into his pocket and dialed his phone.</p><p>\"Jack, I need two of those potassium chloride pills.\" He put a hand up to his head and closed his eyes, \"There's a table with flowers on it in the hall outside his room. Put the two pills next to the planter, she can wobble in the shoes she's in and pick them up. Write him a prescript for it all and make it look like he's filled it dozens of times, in the last few years. He's fat. He's probably already on it all.\" He hung up the phone and smirked at me, \"Write something kinky on the mirror, before you kill him.\"</p><p>I nodded. We were still planning the death of a man. He must have seen the look in my eyes. He grabbed my arms, \"I wish I could do it for you.\"</p><p>I nodded and let it be enough. It was going to have to be. I walked past him and Luce.</p><p>\"You look sexy as shit, by the way,\" he muttered.</p><p>I looked back and raised my eyebrows, \"So far it's been really fun being the sexy plaything of the arms dealer, who never really killed my fuck-up husband.\"</p><p>His lips curled into a bigger smile, \"Don\u2019t piss me off, Evie. It\u2019s a bad idea.\"</p><p>I rolled my eyes and walked out of the bathroom.</p><p>I tried to look calm but if the cameras saw me, they would see I was on edge. I made my way to the elevators in the hotel. The shoes were ridiculously comfortable. I had no idea. Two grand for shoes actually paid off.</p><p>I stepped into the elevator and inspected myself. I looked like a high-class whore, no doubt. My only saving grace was so did every other girl in Vegas. I blended perfectly. I coifed my hair and walked out of the elevator when I got to the floor. I looked at the wall to see which way the room was. I spotted the table with the flowers and took a deep breath. I could do this. I could be the person they needed. I wobbled and placed my hands on the table. I scooped the pills up and dropped my clutch. I bent to pick it up, flashing my ass for the cameras. Hopefully that\u2019s what they saw. I popped the pills in the clutch as I lifted it. It was fluid, like I had done it a million times. I reached into the clutch again and grabbed the keycard. I swiped the right door and put it back in my purse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took a breath and stepped in.</p><p>The fat man was listening to Frank Sinatra, as if he couldn't be more clich\u00e9 with his white suit.</p><p>He looked up and grinned at me, shaking his jowls. His face was sweaty, even though he wasn\u2019t actually doing anything. He was sweating from existing, like that took work.</p> <p>He looked me up and down, \"You're hot. I'm gonna have to get the name of your company.\" He smiled like he was being sexy as he undid his dress shirt.</p><p>I almost gagged. Instead, I grinned like I was about to backcomb my hair and tell him about saving whales and orphans. In my best Miss America country accent, I smiled and twirled my long, dark hair, \"Why, thank you.\"</p><p>I always had a thing for accents. Whenever I read aloud, it was with a British accent.</p><p>I reached into my clutch and chatted like it was small talk, \"I heard you like it kinda rough, so I was thinking maybe we could do a little spanking first.\"</p><p>He chuckled, \"Oh my God. You're a gift from God. I gotta remember to thank Vince tomorrow. The last girl complained.\" My stomach dropped at those words. At least it would make killing him easier. I was only guessing about the spanking.</p> <p>I smirked and nodded, \"Yeah, Vince said to say hi. I think that was his name.\" I tilted my head and made a confused face as I pulled my lipstick out, \"My name is Wanda. It's short for Wanda Lynn.\"</p><p>I wrote my new name on the mirror in the foyer, like I was one of those waiters in the restaurants with the paper tablecloths and the upside-down writing.</p><p>\"Wanda huh, I like that name.\" He shot back his drink. The sound of the ice made me want some too, but I didn\u2019t need that clouding my brain, not yet. I would need it later, when I wanted to drink away the memory of his naked body anywhere near mine. He poured more and walked towards me.</p><p>I stuck the lipstick in the clutch and walked to him as I fished the two pills out. I held them in my fingers and dragged my hands up his sweaty fat chest, pinching the pills between two fingers.</p><p>I giggled, \"You wanna spank me first or me spank you?\" As the words left my lips, I contemplated just taking the poison myself and ending it there.</p><p>He laughed and grabbed my breast in my thousand-dollar halter-top. \"I think I'll spank you first.\"</p> <p>I tilted my head and smiled sweetly, \"Okay.\" I looked around, \"Where do you want me?\"</p><p>He pursed his lips, \"Bed, ass in the air.\"</p><p>\"Skirt on or off?\" I dragged my empty fingers along the waistband of my skirt.</p><p>He nodded, \"Skirt on and pulled up.\"</p><p>I blushed and walked to the bed. I looked at him, as sexy as I could and lifted the skirt slightly, letting my ass cheeks peek out the bottom. He smiled like he got a new toy, or let\u2019s be honest, a sundae. He licked his lips and I decided it was a sundae for sure.</p><p>I bent over the bed and placed my hands on the bed, still gripping the pills.</p><p>He walked over and rubbed his hands over my nearly bare cheeks. The French underwear rode a fair amount. He rubbed in a circular motion and then gave me a hard smack. I made a sexy face and moaned.</p><p>\"You like that, huh?\"</p> <p>I nodded, \"I do.\"</p><p>He smacked again and then rubbed more. His fingers were brushing my underwear. I wanted to bury my face and cry, but I smiled. I gave him my sexy bedroom face. He smacked again. The vibration was actually not bad, considering I had never been spanked before. Not that the feel could take away from the fact, I was being spanked by a three hundred pound sweating beast. He rubbed my cheeks, \"You work out, Wanda\"</p><p>I nodded, \"I do. I run sometimes.\"</p><p>He gripped my ass and nodded, I could see the filthy thoughts burning through his mind. He spanked once more and then pulled my underwear to the side. I stood up fast and planted a kiss on his squishy lips. I could smell cigar and paint chips, I swear it.</p><p>\"Lie back,\" I whispered into his lips. He lay back on the bed. I crawled towards him and unzipped his pants. I coughed. It was part fake and part smell. He smelled like sweat, old booze, and smoke.</p><p>\"I need a drink.\"</p><p>He pointed, almost panting. I got up and pranced over to the table. I took his drink he had before and drank a sip.</p><p>\"You want the rest?\" I asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>I took it in my hand and slipped the pills in, as I walked to the bucket of ice. I clinked in one more and stirred it with my finger.</p><p>He licked his lips again. The capsules were fast dissolving I guessed, because they were gone by the time I got to the bed.</p><p>He shot it back and reached for me, but I grabbed the glass and pulled away, \"I still have a tickle.\"</p><p>He chuckled, \"I'm gonna tickle you.\"</p><p>I laughed, \"You are a bad man.\"</p><p>He nodded, \"I am.\"</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, \"You want me to punish you for a minute?\"</p><p>He nodded. I poured the scotch into the glass and carried it to him. I drank a sip and passed him the rest. He gulped it back and scrambled off the bed.</p><p>I pulled his belt off and wrapped it around his wrists behind his back and bent him over the bed.</p><p>\"Pull it out, stroke it,\" he muttered into the bedding.</p><p>I gulped and used my mom voice, \"I\u2019m in charge. I'll pull it out, when I'm ready. You've been a bad boy.\" I ripped his pants down and spanked his flabby ass cheek. He moaned into the bed. I spanked again, harder. He moaned into the bed and then he started to twitch. He jerked like he was having a heart attack. I stepped back and put my hands to my mouth. I cried out for help, \"Help me.\"</p><p>I look around the room. No one was there to help me. How good was it looking on the camera? I turned and ran for the door. I screamed, \"HELP ME!\"</p><p>A man was walking down the hallway. He looked up at me.</p><p>\"Help, please!\" I shouted and turned, running back into the room. The man followed. When we got inside, fat man was dead on the floor. His pants were down and his hands were bound behind his back.</p><p>The man untied the fat man\u2019s wrists and pushed him on his back.</p><p>\"Call 9-1-1!\" he said frantically.</p><p>I was having a proper panic attack. I grabbed the phone next to the bed and dialed 9-1-1. The phone made a noise and a person answered, \"Front desk?\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"I need 9-1-1. My...uhm...boyfriend. He's had an attack. We were playing around and he got sick. Hurry. Please hurry.\" I covered my eyes and hung up the phone.</p><p>I grabbed the fat man's hand and sobbed fake cries. I didn\u2019t have any tears. I should have had some, but apparently, I couldn\u2019t cry when I was being the person they needed me to be.</p><p>My panic attack was authentic by the time the ambulance arrived. I was hugging myself and pacing.</p><p>The man from the hallway, who had come to help, wrapped an arm around me as they attached the fat man to the stretcher.</p><p>\"Had you been dating long?\" he asked.</p><p>I shook my head, \"We just started.\"</p><p>He squeezed, \"You wanna come back to my room and I'll get you a drink?\"</p><p>I glanced up at him and smiled, not that it mattered. His eyes were focused on my chest.</p><p>\"No thanks. I just want to go home.\"</p><p>The man in a dress shirt and slacks eyed me up. I had already given him my statement. \"It's a heart attack they figure, so you're free to go.\" I nodded and hugged my arms around myself. I picked up my purse and the glass I drank from. I poured one more shot of scotch and drank it back. I carried it from the room.</p><p>The dark-red Wanda, with a heart, on the mirror made me sick, as I made my way to the elevator.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know the room he was staying in, but I sort assumed it would be the presidential suite. I also sort of assumed, that he would expect me to find him.</p><p>I stepped in past the bellhop. I hadn\u2019t recalled there being one before.</p><p>\"Presidential suite, please,\" I muttered like I was stricken with trauma.</p><p>He tapped the cell phone in his belt, like it was to the beat of a cheesy Celine Dion song. I looked over at him and smiled when I saw it was Luce. She honestly looked like a guy, in a bellhop's uniform.</p><p>I glanced at the screen of the cell phone and read the sideways message, making a smirk cross my lips. I hugged myself tighter, as she started to get a head bob to the music. She dropped her hat on the floor. I bent to pick it up, palming the powder she dropped in the tiny packet. She smiled when I passed the hat to her.</p><p>I stepped off the elevator, ignoring her completely, and made my way to the door. I knocked, holding my clutch and the packet in the same hand.</p><p>Servario answered and smiled bitterly, \"That was a show and a half.\" He stepped back to let me in and shook his head, \"I should have guessed you would find a way to ensure that it was a legit kill.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"I don\u2019t know what you mean. It was horrible, the way he had a massive heart attack like that.\"</p><p>I entered the room, opening my clutch and passing him the lipstick back and slipping the packet in.</p><p>\"This is yours,\" I said softly.</p><p>His eyes were burning, \"You disappointed me in so many ways.\"</p><p>I felt fear creeping up inside of me, when I glanced at his twitching hands. I had learned to take a hit in training but I really didn\u2019t want to take one.</p><p>He grabbed me and ran his hand up into my hair. He pulled back slightly, tilting my head and exposing my throat, \"You let him touch you,\" he whispered into my cheek and tugged hard on my hair. I sucked a breath in, trying not to wince.</p><p>He smiled pleasantly, \"I told you, this is mine.\" He reached down and brushed his fingers along the center of my underwear.</p><p>I shook my head slightly, \"He didn\u2019t touch that.\"</p><p>His eyes flashed, \"You let him have an experience with you, that I have not.\"</p><p>My ass started to hurt, just imagining the things he was going to do to it. I needed the powdered belladonna packet in my purse. I needed him to pass out. He towered over me, almost putting me on my tiptoes in the six-inch heels. My fingers dug into his thick chest.</p><p>\"I really want a shower,\" I said softly. It was true. I did.</p><p>He looked me over, \"You're lucky. You have another job to do in a couple days. I need you rested.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt the relief creeping through me, trying not to be obvious. He released me and scowled, \"Go wash his hands off of you,\" he muttered and turned away.</p><p>I staggered, feeling the breakdown coming on as I walked into the bathroom, slipping the belladonna from my purse. When I got into the massive bathroom, I leaned against the counter, slipping the teensy packet under the tissue box. I took one of the tissues and pretended to blow my nose, as I pulled off my heels. I flung my purse in the opposite direction of the belladonna and started to pull clothes off. My back and feet weren\u2019t killing me, as I assumed they would be.</p><p>When I stepped down, my feet spread back out. They hadn\u2019t hurt when I was wearing the heels, but being barefoot was nice.</p> <p>I struggled with the zipper on the halter and the clasps of the bra. My fingers were weak.</p><p>I killed a man.</p><p>My first kill; he was dead and I was alive. I killed him to survive. I was no better than Servario, or Coop, or my father.</p><p>I dropped my clothes to the floor and stepped into the ridiculous shower. The whole room was ostentatious, but the shower was like Extreme Home Makeover.</p><p>Six showerheads lined the wall with double-rain showerheads above and steam jets. I turned it all on, as hot as I could take, and tried to let it wash off some of the bad things I let them put on, and in me. I squeezed disturbing amounts of body wash into my hand and started to scrub. I used my nails, raking them over every inch of me. I washed a second time before starting on my hair. I scrubbed until there was nothing left but false lashes, floating on the floor for the drains.</p> <p>Under the hot water and hiding in the steam, I let it out. The tears mixed with the rain from above and my back slid down the tiled wall.</p><p>I slumped and rocked and let it hurt for the minute I could give.</p><p>The problem with only having a minute to succumb to the greatest pain you've ever been in, is it hits like a truck.</p><p>I was curled in a ball and rocking back and forth when he stepped in with me. He lifted me into the air and cradled me against him.</p><p>\"Not so tough, now are you?\" he asked.</p><p>I sniffed and sobbed and let him hold me, \"I've never killed anyone before.\"</p> <p>He kissed the top of my head, \"If I wasn\u2019t so angry with you for the way you played me, I would say it was the best hit, I have ever seen.\"</p><p>I didn\u2019t take the pride he was trying to pass me. I ignored it all. I finished crying and looked up at him.</p><p>He set me down, \"You okay?\"</p><p>I frowned and wiped my face, \"Do you care, if I'm not?\"</p><p>His eyes were greenish under the light, set off by his tanned face. He shook his head, \"I don\u2019t want to.\"</p><p>I swallowed my hate and nodded, \"I sort of assumed that.\"</p><p>His eyes narrowed, \"You are the most dangerous kind of woman in the world.\"</p><p>I snorted and shook my head. I stepped under the water again, covering my breasts.</p> <p>His words turned to a whisper, \"You make me want to be worthy of you. That\u2019s a dangerous effect to have, on a man like me.\"</p><p>I kept my eyes closed and tried to block out the fact, that again he had said the nicest thing ever spoken to me.</p><p>\"I don\u2019t want you to be anything but mine,\" he said and stepped closer, taking the water from me.</p><p>I looked up into his eyes. They had darkened like a storm had rolled in, and he looked like the most dangerous man in the whole world. The difference between us being, that HE was one of the most dangerous people in the world and I was a yoga-addicted widow.</p><p>His arms wrapped around me, pulling me in. He bent and kissed the top of my head, \"I don\u2019t want to have to kill you to make this feeling go away, Evie.\"</p><p>His words made me instantly sick. I was at my threshold for disturbing shit.</p><p>\"Don\u2019t make me love you,\" he muttered, \"Because it will end badly for us both.\" He finished washing and left the shower.</p><p>The trembling housewife was back instantly. I held myself and tried to come up with a plan.</p><p>When I left the shower, my clutch was emptied onto the counter. I had assumed he would go through it, but I sort of expected him to put it back like he hadn't. My clothes were gone and in their stead was a sexy, silk nightgown. I sighed and stepped into the body dryer on the wall. I lifted my arms and pressed the on button.</p><p>I ran my hands through my hair, maximizing the hot air's effects. I needed to be a bitch. I needed to nag him and whine, and make him see the real me. I had the ability to drive my husband into the arms of every woman we knew. I was badass at not being loved.</p><p>The hot air spared something inside of me. Something that made me want to finish it. The death of the fat man was a disturbing guilt that ate at my insides, but the survivalist in me was ready to let that one death slide. She was ready to finish this and get her family back. I liked my survivalist's instincts.</p><p>I slipped on the fuzzy robe on the back of the door and tossed the silk on the wet floor. I dragged it with my foot and left it there, on the floor. If I had learned anything in a decade, it was that men hated wet women's clothing on the floor of the bathroom. Which was odd, since they always seemed to leave everything of theirs on the floor of the bedroom. Either way, it was us women who picked it all up.</p><p>I left the bathroom and the belladonna. I didn\u2019t need it. I had a decade of experience, I hadn\u2019t even harnessed yet.</p><p>\"Is there anything to eat?\" I asked, almost rudely, when I left the bathroom.</p><p>He was on the phone. He looked unimpressed with my fuzzy white robe and huge blown out hair.</p><p>\"Babe...\u201d I clapped my hands at him, \u201cFood?\" I said again and mimed eating.</p><p>He looked horrified and shook his head.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and walked to the mini bar that wasn\u2019t so mini. There were stacks of chocolate bars and different types of packaged foods. All the expensive stuff, no Hostess or Nestle. I grabbed a jar of caviar, some crackers, a chocolate bar, and a soda. I purposely left the really good toasts that the caviar was no doubt for. The cheaper crackers would taste better. They always did.</p><p>I ate the chocolate first in huge bites. I was starved. If European men hated anything, it was the way Americans ate. I stuffed my face, like I was at Bob's Big Bar, and opened the can of soda. I drank it back and burped a little. Soda always made me gassy. I covered my mouth and wiped with a napkin. I left the unfinished chocolate and dirty napkin on the small table and walked with the soda and remainder of my meal to the huge couch. I sat on it cross-legged and turned on the TV. Designing Women was on. I smiled and sat back.</p><p>I crunched loudly and left crumbs. The caviar and soda was interesting but I ate, moaning and enjoying.</p><p>He scowled at me, so I returned the look. If he didn\u2019t want to love me, I would just treat him the way I treated my husband.</p><p>A major flaw in the plan of course, was the fact Servario was ridiculously scary, and considerably hotter, than my husband.</p><p>I looked back at the show and forced the crackers down. I started to feel sick. Too much liquor and not enough food was starting to catch up. I put the food on the coffee table and finished my soda. He was about to see something that would turn him off forever.</p><p>I had been bulimic for years as a dancer, when I was a young girl. Our dance teacher taught us we could be hungry or just throw our food up, but we were forbidden to gain weight. I was a foodie so I had chosen to throw up, rather than starve.</p><p>I quit when I was eighteen; my dentist told me he knew what I was doing. It was affecting my enamel. He threatened to tell the commander (aka my father), if I didn\u2019t quit. I quit doing it, enlisted, and was scarfing back enough carbs to kill someone, when I went through basic. I couldn't keep weight on then. I stopped being bulimic then and never looked back. Well, I tried not to. Sometimes when I felt a loss of control in my life, I would succumb to a binge and purge. James had thought I was lactose intolerant. It was a sad secret no one ever knew about, except Dr. Miglio and the other dancers.</p><p>The sad memories brought back flashes of seeing the other dancers later. We were mid-twenties and all of us were still damaged from the effects of Mrs. Smithers. The effects of constantly seeking approval and hurting our bodies, to be what she wanted.</p><p>One girl was still on mass doses of laxatives and ephedrine. Another was anorexic. My favorite, Becca, was three-hundred pounds. If you traced each of our timelines back, you would see the corresponding moment we ended being the person we were supposed to be, and became who she wanted us to be. When the pressure was too much, we snapped and quit but our bad habits stayed with us.</p><p>I had quit dancing before the rest of them, but I still had an ulcer and a lot of cavities. I still had triggers that made me sick\u2014fast food, milkshakes, cheesy pasta, and chocolate eaten while drinking soda.</p><p>I burped again and placed the soda on the table. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes and started my visualizations.</p><p>I was swimming in a cool lake, the water was lapping against me, rocking me. The chilly breeze swept across my face. I could see the rocky shore and hear the laughter of the other kids swimming.</p><p>It was the only memory that made the nausea go away.</p><p>I burped again and shot up from the chair. I leapt the coffee table and skidded across the silk nightgown on the still-wet tiles. I landed with my face in the toilet, thank God. Everything left in a series of heaves. My body was still the professional purger it had been all those years before.</p><p>The sickness left as quickly as it had come. I flushed and waited for the feelings to completely pass.</p><p>\"You are disgusting. That was a horrif...are you alright?\"</p><p>I cursed myself silently when he started out annoyed and turned to sympathetic, upon seeing me kneeling over the toilet.</p><p>I flushed again and waved him away, but he didn\u2019t leave like James would have. He crawled up behind me, kneeling in the water and silk. He held my hair and rubbed my back and speaking in a soft tone, \"When I was seventeen, my father took me for a ride in the car. He told me that he was going to make me a man.\"</p><p>I cringed, imagining where the story could go. I knew a lot of bad things about his father.</p><p>He continued softly, \"I imagined he was taking me to one of the premier brothels in the area. Of course, I was already a man, but I was willing to humor him. Instead, he drove us to his factory. He owned a company that packaged goods. He parked and we walked into the factory. I was disappointed, I could have gone for a whore. I'd only been with teenage girls at that point.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I started to become afraid but his voice was rhythmic and soft. It flowed with the motion of his massaging. His accent seemed thicker.</p><p>\"We got inside and I saw all his workers were lined up. There were other men there. I rarely went to the factory but I knew who they were. Father clapped his hands and shouted for a man named Roberto to come forward. The poor man shook when he walked but tried to look proud. I was so na\u00efve. I had no idea what my father wanted.\"</p><p>I knew exactly what he wanted. I was biting my lip and waiting for it.</p> <p>\"He handed me a gun and told me that I was to shoot Roberto. I asked him why? He backhanded me in front of the men. His ring cut my cheek slightly. I was scared and confused, I guess. I stood up and took the gun from my father and pulled the trigger. The gun never fired. It was empty. My father laughed and took the gun from me. He backhanded me again and told me that a real man chose for himself, what he did and didn\u2019t do. He told me to take what I wanted in the world and let no man be the ruler of my choices. He said even if I got slapped around by the world, I still needed to make my own choices.\"</p><p>The story was sad but I was grateful what I assumed was going to happen, never did.</p><p>\"Then he raised the gun and shot Roberto. He knew the chamber I fired was empty and the next was not. Roberto died in front of me, bleeding to death and gasping for air. My face stung and I hated my father. He laughed and patted me on the back, then took me to see the real family packaging business. Business was what made me a man. It was never firing the gun. He knew I had that in me, all along.\"</p><p>I was lost. His story contradicted the back massage, and the fact he was sharing it with me, made me want to run away. I didn\u2019t want to get close to him, not emotionally.</p><p>He sighed, \"It was the first time I saw someone die. Very sad day indeed.\"</p> <p>I closed the lid and grabbed some toilet paper to wipe my face. I focused on the silver handle of the toilet and the sensation of the paper wiping my face. I didn\u2019t want inside of his world. I didn\u2019t want to know what he had been through.</p><p>He pressed his face against the back of the robe and kissed me once before standing, \"So you see, I understand the feelings you have over killing him. It gets easier I'm afraid.\" He left the bathroom. I felt considerably worse. Not about killing the fat man, but about the fact I would have to kill him. Servario would have to die, if I was going to get away. He was fucking insane, like his father. And his stories were creepy.</p><p>I washed my face and brushed my teeth with the one toothbrush on the counter, I assumed was for me. I rinsed with mouthwash and left feeling the hopelessness of the situation. I slipped the belladonna in my robe pocket.</p><p>He was waiting on the couch. I walked past him, towards the bed in the smaller bedroom of the two I had noticed. I curled into the sheets and closed my eyes. Every inch of me hurt. The weird bathroom-plane sex had more than likely left marks on my back. The second time made me uncomfortably sore between my legs, and the death of the fat man, and the loss of my children's safety made my heart heavy.</p><p>\"Is there a reason you're sleeping in here? There is a huge bed in the master quarters,\" he asked. I opened my heavy eyelids to his silhouette in the doorway.</p><p>I sighed and rolled over, \"Sleepy.\"</p> <p>\"Fine.\" I heard him close the door but he was still in the room. I cringed as he unzipped. I tucked my arm under the pillow and turned my mind off. I refused to let his warm body next to mine be anything beyond a reminder of my predicament, which there was nothing I could do about. I was his, for the time being.</p><p>The next morning he was on the far side of the bed, as far as he could get from me. I shivered and rolled towards him.</p><p>I could let him be a body pillow. He was roasting with intense body heat. I wrapped my freezing feet around his calf making him jump.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>I shivered, \u201cIt\u2019s cold in here.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an odd look and then put his arm out for me. He wrapped around me, when I laid on it.</p><p>Instantly, his hand took mine and placed it on his huge erection. I sighed, \u201cNo,\u201d and pulled it back.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, \u201cI need to eat. I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>He pulled my hand back and began stroking himself with my palm.</p><p>I gave him an unimpressed look, earning me a grin. I hadn\u2019t been expecting it. I snorted, \u201cYou\u2019re cheerful in the morning.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were filled with green flecks, \u201cYou are having a strange effect on me, Evie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d I said and wrapped my hand around his rigid, morning wood and squeezed.</p><p>Chapter Nine - A silver locket in my pocket</p><p>I rolled over and cuddled into him, pulling the covers up and smothering him with my body. I felt his body go rigid; even in his sleep he disliked intimacy.</p><p>It made me smile inside. He wasn\u2019t comfortable with anything but fucking and working, and of course, talking about things that made me uncomfortable.</p><p>I still didn\u2019t understand why he had chosen to sleep in the small bed with me for the past few nights. I thought about that more than my own escape or why he had tried to set me up, for killing the fat man.</p><p>We had grown closer and closer, my cabin fever lessening with every moment. Three days of the spa-like bathroom, any meal I craved, and ridiculous amounts of sex had changed me.</p><p>I felt like something inside of me was waking up. Like the hibernation of marriage was finally starting to end and the fun, sassy girl I had once been, was emerging from her cave. It had to be the result of multiple orgasms a day.</p><p>Of course I had tried to fight it. I drugged the shit out of him with the belladonna. Apparently, his reaction to it wasn\u2019t the intended one. He got relaxed and wanted slow, intense sex. I had come to the conclusion, he was a magician with his tongue. I blushed just watching him sleeping, forcing myself not to want to like him, let alone desire him, as much as I did.</p><p>He stirred and woke, giving me a look, \u201cYou\u2019re like a cat. Do you have to touch me while you sleep? I\u2019m sweating from it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cYou\u2019re warm and Steve has the damned air conditioning on so high, I can see my breath in here.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and sat up, sort of pushing me off of him.</p><p>I liked watching him squirm.</p><p>He pulled his computer up onto his lap, \u201cIs breakfast here?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t left the room.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t spoon me all night long like a girlfriend and then not act like one in the morning. Go see.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cThis is my first vacation in forever, fake or not\u2014I intend on enjoying it. You go get me breakfast. You want to fuck me as much as you possibly can, then you\u2019ll have to start acting like a boyfriend. I want spooning and breakfast in bed. Later, you may read to me,\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>He growled and I rolled on top of him some more.</p><p>\"I'm trying to type,\" he said, not bothering to hide the annoyance in his tone.</p><p>I nestled in closer and moaned.</p><p>I was getting good at ignoring the sad fact, I had a life that was in chaos outside of the hotel room. Denial was an easier emotion than guilt, or fear, or anything I didn\u2019t want to deal with.</p><p>I disregarded the fact his body had been doing bad things to mine since we met, and embraced that I had yet to not enjoy one of them.</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t entirely true.</p><p>The day before, he had demanded a blowjob. I had tried telling him I was shit at them, and besides that, we were in the shower. All those jets and showerheads had nearly drowned me, when he grabbed my hair and pushed my face down farther on him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t appreciate it when I shoved him back and shouted that I was a wife, not a deep-throating porn star. Thankfully, it had earned me a hard fuck on my hands and knees instead. I struggled and worked at pretending I didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>I plucked at the dark hairs on his arms, \"So what's the job?\" I asked.</p><p>He spoke distractedly, \"Firstly, you\u2019re going to stop plucking at me like I am a chicken and get me some damned breakfast. Secondly, I am going to fuck you, when I am done sending this email, and then we are going to take a shower. Thirdly, you will then go and kill a man named Derringer and you will do it messy. Fourthly, we will then be taking the jet back to Boston.\"</p><p>I looked up at him, fully blocking out the demand I kill someone else, and shook my head. \"We can't have sex in the morning. We can have it on the jet back to Boston. I don\u2019t do mornings.\"</p><p>He gave me a look and sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose and closing his eyes, \"My God, you have a lot of rules. Why can\u2019t we have morning sex?\"</p><p>I licked my lips nervously and then just said it, \"I can't have it until I've had coffee and a full bathroom experience. Otherwise, I won't go all day and I\u2019ll have a bloated belly.\"</p><p>His hand dropped, \"Did you just tell me you can't have sex, because you need some coffee and raisin bran to complete the morning... first?\"</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He bit his lip and processed, \"That\u2019s sickening. You have to learn about appropriate sharing and not appropriate sharing.\"</p><p>I climbed off the bed, pulled on the sweats I had made Steve go buy for me, and tied my hair into a messy ponytail. I stretched and yawned, \"You\u2019re keeping me here against my will. I am a thirty-six-year-old woman. You can't expect me to be a giggly, twenty-year-old who keeps secret the fact she poops and passes gas.\"</p><p>He grimaced and continued to type on the laptop, \"Good God, you aren\u2019t going to start passing gas in front of me, are you?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \u201cNo. My mother would beat me if I did that.\u201d</p><p>He looked wounded, \u201cYou know you\u2019re not here against your will. You may leave, if you want.\"</p><p>I stopped the act of disgustingly-lazy housewife and frowned, \"What?\"</p><p>He nodded, \"You can leave anytime. You know the deal we have.\"</p><p>I walked out of the room to where my clutch was on the table in the foyer. If I stayed, I would have to kill the Derringer man, messily. I needed out. I needed to take my chances and run. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He called out of the room, \"Take with you what you brought. None of the things I've bought for you.\"</p><p>I looked over at the door and sighed. I pulled off my t-shirt and slipped the sweatpants down my legs. I kicked them to the side. A noise behind me of choking, got my attention. I looked back and blushed, \"Sorry, Steve.\"</p><p>He waved me off and gulped back some coffee to wash down whatever he was choking on.</p> <p>\"Thanks for the fun!\" I shouted and bolted for the door. I held my wobbly bits and ran past the guards, flinging open the door to the stairs. I had a clutch and a hair elastic and my own hands for coverage. I sprinted down a flight and opened the door to the next floor. I closed it and tiptoed down the next flight. Just in case they were following me, they would think I\u2019d left. I slowly opened the door on the lower floor and knocked on the first door I found.</p><p>An elderly lady answered and jumped back.</p><p>I blushed, covering my pubis and breasts, \"My robe got stuck in my door. My kids are laughing and won't open it.\"</p><p>She started to snicker and opened the door for me, \u201cLittle brats!\u201d</p><p>I stepped inside and closed it, still covering myself. She passed me the robe from her door. I pulled it on and shook my head, \"Little brats is right.\"</p> <p>She laughed, \"Oh my. I bet they'll have sore bottoms.\"</p><p>I nodded, \"Sure will. Do you mind if I call the front desk from your phone?\"</p><p>She shook her head and laughed, \"Lord no. Use the one in the bathroom.\"</p><p>I slipped in and dialed 9-1-1 on the phone I pulled from my clutch.</p><p>The FaceTime screen came up. \"Where are you?\" The young man spoke while sipping something looking like Starbucks. I put my fingers to my lips.</p><p>I winked, \"My kids locked me out of the room, floor 17, room 1723.\"</p> <p>He nodded and was gone. The code was what we had agreed on, when I left the car in the parking lot of the Boston airport. It meant I was in severe shit and needed an evac immediately. It meant there would be a car waiting at the front door. I would have to find a way to make it there, without being spotted and taken back to the room, or worse.</p><p>I slipped the phone back in and thanked her. She chuckled again and walked me out. I ran along the hall to the other set of stairs. I opened them and sprinted down. My bare feet were nearly silent at first, but the flights started to get unbearable. I opened up a door on the tenth floor and ran across the hall. I pressed the elevator button, but ran for the stairs on the other side. I opened the door and ran down the next two fights. I opened the door to the eighth floor and ran for the elevator button. I pressed it and waited. It came almost immediately. When it opened, a young couple of plastic-looking people gave me a confused look. I wrapped the robe tighter and jumped in. I pressed the main floor button, and the second and third floor buttons. I gave them a weak look, \"My kid got away on me. Made a run for it while I was in the shower. He's playing in the stairwell around the second floor.\"</p><p>They both smiled and nodded.</p><p>I hated how fast my lying had come back. I was a master. Although I had to admit, it was much easier to lie when you had kids. There was so much more to lie about at thirty-six than there was at twenty-four.</p><p>When we landed on the third floor, I jumped out and ran for the same exit I had been in. I pulled the door and ran down the last two flights. I kept going the last flight to the parkade and dialed 9-1-1 on the phone.</p><p>\"Parking garage, top floor!\" I shouted and opened the steel door at the bottom of the stairs, as I pressed the button off on the phone. I ran across the parkade in the robe. My feet were officially killing me, but the thundering heartbeat and sickening feeling in my stomach were pushing me forward.</p><p>The slapping sound of my bare feet filled the garage, as I looked for the car that would be coming for me. A white car with black windows squealed around the corner. Relief and excitement filled me instantly, as I saw his face.</p><p>\"Evie!\" I looked back at the stairwell door as I ran for the car. Servario was huffing at the big door. He shook his head, \"What are you doing?\"</p> <p>I turned and walked backwards for the car, blocking the view of Coop. \"You said I was free.\"</p><p>He laughed and shook his head, \"Yeah, but I also said you had to leave naked. I didn\u2019t think you would.\" He let go of the door and walked toward me. His pants were done up and belted, but his shirt was ruffled. He had thrown on his clothes in a panic.</p><p>I shook my head, \"Guess you don\u2019t know me very well.\"</p><p>I continued to take steps backwards. I heard the car door open. I prayed he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to get out and anger Servario. Seeing a young attractive man picking me up might make him slightly angry. Or psychotic. I wasn\u2019t sure which it was.</p><p>\"You can't leave. I own you.\" he smirked and I could see the look in his eyes. He knew he didn\u2019t. I had won the game of 'Who framed Evie Evans'. He had nothing on me but my finances.</p><p>I shook my head, \"You don\u2019t. I know where my kids and mom are and you have nothing on me for the heart attack he had. Keep the money.\"</p><p>His smile turned dangerous; I was poking the bear who liked to do the poking. \"I didn\u2019t mean that kind of own. You knew that though. You're mine. You know that.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cI do know you don\u2019t want to love me, or that'll end badly for us both.\" I stopped when I felt the metal of the car stab me in the back.</p><p>He looked like I had killed his dog, \u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the door and jumped in and he broke into a sprint. He punched the back of the car as Coop sped away. He blew through the gate to pay and skidded along the street, cutting off a wall of traffic. I screamed as trucks were coming for my door. He hit the gas, jerking me back and laughed. \"Evie, what did you do to that mean terrorist?\" He joked, \"He looks crushed.\"</p><p>I felt sick. I had the strangest arms dealer hangover as we drove off.</p><p>I looked over at Coop and smiled, \"Thanks for coming.\"</p><p>He shook his head, \"I\u2019m gonna get my ass chewed for it, but whatever. You okay?\"</p><p>I nodded, \"Yup.\" I would be, after years of intensive therapy and the possible misuse of red wine and vodka.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to kill a man named Derringer today.\u201d</p><p>Coop frowned, \u201cHe\u2019s an agent?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, \u201cGlad I ran then.\u201d</p><p>Coop nodded and looked like he was processing.</p><p>We drove to a safe house in Summerlin, just outside Vegas.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to a safe house, but Luce and Jack are there. We\u2019re going to be on the run after all this, if they don\u2019t like that you ran away from Servario.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, \u201cI had to. He wanted me to kill again and he... he was...\u201d How did I explain what he was?</p><p>\"Want to talk about it?\" Coop asked. I looked at him and noticed his knuckles were cut and bruised. I reached over and ran my fingertips across them, \"What's that?\"</p><p>He smirked and gave me a look, \"So no then?\"</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>He lifted his hand and straightened it, \"That is a bar brawl, at a biker bar last night.\"</p><p>I frowned, \"Why?\"</p><p>He shook his head slowly and kept his eyes on the road, \"Just needed to blow off some steam.\"</p><p>I smirked back, \"Teenage girls can rile you up like that. When you get older and date women, it gets easier, I promise.\"</p><p>His jaw clenched and he turned and gave me a stoic look, \"It was a woman that caused this.\"</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>He opened the garage and drove in slowly. He closed it before we got out.</p><p>\"Did he hurt you?\" he asked.</p><p>I shook my head, \"No more than I hurt him.\"</p><p>He winced, \"Did you...? Forget it. I don\u2019t wanna know.\" He made a weird face and climbed out of the car. He stormed inside, leaving me feeling conflicted. I wasn\u2019t really sure what it was that we were about to discuss. Was he going to get angry because I said yes to everything, like he and my libido asked me to?</p><p>I walked inside to see Luce smiling at me. She crossed her arms and tilted her head, \"Leaves the Bellagio in a robe? You are going down in history, my friend.\" She put her knuckles out for me. I patted them again, awkwardly. She laughed at me, \u201cYou are a crazy woman.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \"A crazy woman who could go for a shower and some clothes, and maybe some oatmeal, or a protein shake. Are any of those things possible? Maybe some therapy?\" I asked.</p><p>She nodded and pointed at the kitchen to my right, \"Fully stocked, except for the therapist. Jack, you remember Evie?\"</p><p>I looked into the kitchen to see the young man who was always on the phone. I smiled, but he gave me a look and nodded, \"Good afternoon, Mrs. Evans.\" He walked past me. I looked back at Luce. She shook her head and walked into the kitchen with me. She leaned against the counter as I rifled the cupboards for food, real food.</p><p>\"He's BFF's with Coop. He's pissy \u2018cause Coop went scary psycho yesterday and got drunk and started a fight in a biker bar.\"</p><p>I noticed the tinge of blue under her eye and winced, \"Because of me being on a mission?\" I whispered back.</p><p>She nodded, \"We were all upset. We figured you would be in and out of the hotel. We didn\u2019t get told you were staying there until the day after the fat man. After the first two days Coop went a little snaky.\"</p><p>I sighed, \"Join the club.\"</p><p>She folded her arms, \"We wanted to evac you two days ago but upstairs wouldn\u2019t hear of it. Coop made the call and they said we were not to interfere. They were letting it ride. You were not to leave under any circumstances. Coop\u2019s gonna make the call and tell them we had no choice.\"</p><p>I felt the horrified look creep across my face, \"They risked me out like that? I don\u2019t even work for them.\"</p><p>She nodded, \"Coop was pissed. He went off; almost lost the mission to someone who could remain detached. You being there had no bearing on the mission.\"</p><p>I leaned on the counter, \"They left me in there on purpose? They made me stay there for three days? It had no bearing on the mission? I don\u2019t even understand why they made me do any of it. Servario doesn\u2019t trust me, and he sure as shit doesn\u2019t have anything on me. What was the fucking point?\" My voice rose above a whisper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded, \"Precisely.\" She leaned in and barely spoke when she whispered, \"He thinks they're working with Servario. He thinks you were Servario\u2019s demand all along.\"</p><p>My stomach dropped. My voice dropped low, \"I just got whored out by the fucking military to the arms dealer, who is being blamed for my husband\u2019s fake death?\"</p><p>She nodded against my face, \"Oh good, at least you know that no one thinks James is dead. We think he\u2019s still working with Servario. Or maybe even CI. We\u2019re starting to think, the shit has been piled on us. Like the mission was a fake too. Something to appease Servario.\"</p> <p>My skin tingled and my brain worked overtime. Had my husband just agreed to let a criminal have his way with me? Had he let that same criminal take everything away from our family? His children\u2019s food and money? I felt like I was going to burst out of my skin and go in every direction at once. I looked at her and nodded, \"You got running clothes here?\"</p><p>She nodded at the ceiling. I tugged at the robe and ran from the kitchen. I took the stairs several at a time. My feet screamed but I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>I burst through the bedroom to find Coop standing in the middle of the room with his shirt off.</p><p>I stopped and noticed the cut of his abs and the thickness of his chest. His arms were veined and bulky. He was strapping and brawny without a shirt on, but still cut nicely enough that he didn\u2019t look huge and beefy in clothes. I noticed the single round blue and orange tattoo on his right hipbone. It was the one I had caught a glimpse of before.</p><p>His eyes met mine with cold blue fury. He walked past me and out of the door, leaving me upstairs with the smell of his deodorant and the scent that was just him.</p> <p>I walked to the duffels of clothes and found things I could make into running clothes.</p><p>I strapped on Luce's runners, which were a half-size too big and headed for the front door.</p><p>I slipped out the front door and burst like a shot. It was how I ran, fast and furious.</p><p>My feet slapped the cement in horrid amounts of pain, but I pushed it.</p><p>I heard the sound of someone else running. I looked back, seeing Coop. He was gaining on me. His legs were thick and strong. Good for the short spurt. Mine were long and lean. I could carry a distance, he couldn\u2019t. I knew that just by looking at him. I sprinted ahead and let my stride widen.</p><p>He caught up almost instantly.</p> <p>His face was red and angry.</p><p>I shook my head, \"You won\u2019t last with me, Coop.\" I gasped for air. I loved it.</p><p>He huffed along, \"I think I'll surprise you.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \"I'm older. I\u2019ve got better stamina that\u2019s been built up over time. I've been running for a long time.\"</p><p>He grinned, \"I got your stamina, baby.\" He licked his lips, \"I think I could outlast you easy.\"</p><p>I laughed and shook my head, \"You're a perve.\"</p><p>He nodded, \"I want to hear it. I need to hear about it.\"</p><p>I felt my chest tighten. I stopped running and wheezed. I put a hand up, \"You don\u2019t want to know.\"</p> <p>He paced around me with his hands on his hips, \"I need it. I need to know.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my arms and pulled me to him, \"You\u2019re different than you were before. I wanna know why.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, \u201cI\u2019m not different.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI watched you. I saw it. The mundane, bored, fucking housewife to that prick, James. God damned, Evie. How are you so smart and so clueless at the same time? James never loved you. I saw that the first time I watched you all.\"</p><p>I huffed for air and watched his angry eyes fighting the things he wanted to say. \"I saw it right away. You were so lonely and sweet. You did everything for everyone else. When was it ever going to be your turn? They were sucking the life out of you. All three of them just took and took and took. Like leeches.\"</p><p>I pulled my arms from him, letting rage fill me, \"It\u2019s called being a parent dumbass. You make your kids first.\" Momma bear was starting to surface. I put my finger in his face, \"YOU wanna know so bad, for your fucked-up little game? Fine. He fucked me. He fucked me on the plane and he fucked me in the hotel. It was fabulous, if you have to know. Happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I scowled, \u201cYou were watching me and my family? That\u2019s fucking creepy.\"</p><p>I turned back to the house but he grabbed my hands and held me tight, \"I HAD TO WATCH! IT WAS MY JOB! IT BECAME MY WHOLE LIFE TO WATCH YOURS SUCK! TO WATCH YOU BE SO PERFECT AND SO AMAZING AND GET NOTHING BUT THOSE LITTLE MOMENTS ALONE OR ONE FUCKING NICE WORD FROM YOUR KIDS!\"</p><p>I slapped him, hard. His eyes lit up. He grabbed my hands, \"You feel better?\"</p><p>I started to laugh/cry, \"NO! GODDAMMIT!\" I ripped my arms from his and turned and walked back to the house.</p><p>How the fuck did a frat boy see so many things that I had missed? \u201cDon\u2019t talk about my kids like that!\u201d I muttered.</p><p>An instant pain ripped into my ankle, as I lost my balance and went down on the grass next to me. The fury ended with that.</p><p>\"Fuck! I wore those stupid, six-inch heels without an issue and now I've twisted my ankle in runners.\u201d</p><p>He plopped on the grass next to me but never said anything for a few minutes, as I rubbed my ankle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different. I can see it.\u201d he finally spoke.</p><p>I nodded, \u201cYou were right. I was lost in it. I let them get bigger than me, all of them. I\u2019m an extremist. I do everything one hundred percent. It\u2019s why I quit CI. I knew I could never be a mom and an agent. I need to be the best.\u201d I lay back on the lawn of the strange house I was in front of, and looked up at the desert sky, \"Is it ever this blue, back home?\" I asked, not wanting to discuss it anymore.</p><p>\"Not in Boston. But then again my home is Hawaii, so it has its moments there.\"</p><p>I turned my face, \"You\u2019re from Hawaii?\"</p><p>He nodded and turned his face to me.</p><p>I sniffed again, \"Is the symbol on your hip Hawaiian?\"</p><p>He shook his head. I saw him shut it off when he spoke the words, \"My little brother drew it for me when he was eight.\"</p><p>I let him have the last word. There were too many things in the sentence he wanted to stay hidden. Instead, I asked the obvious, \"So you think James is alive?\"</p><p>He nodded, \"Some shit has happened in the last couple days that makes no sense.\"</p><p>I flinched, \"You think they traded me for something?\"</p><p>He nodded, \"I have no idea what. I knew something was up when they let you ride on the plane with him. That\u2019s a huge risk for an agent. But then to make you kill the fat man, who by the way, had done time for bad things with a fourteen year old girl in Havana and gotten away with it.\"</p><p>I smiled, \"Thank you.\"</p><p>He nodded, \"Then for them to make you stay in the hotel with Servario? Why? For what? To kill Derringer, a lame agent who means nothing to anyone? No, none of this is adding up.\"</p><p>My brow knit together, \"That doesn\u2019t make sense.\"</p><p>He nodded, \"I know. I mean what's so special about you?\"</p><p>I laughed as he backpedaled quickly, \"I mean... well, you now. He's like a rich arms dealer and you're... a regular...\"</p><p>\u201cYou mean a cougar?\u201d I gave him my most offended look and shoved him.</p><p>He laughed and pointed, \"Admit it.\"</p><p>I crossed my arms under my flattened chest and nodded. \"You're right. He can buy any girl he wants. Why me\u2014and did James trade me to Servario? If that\u2019s the case, I won\u2019t recover from that one. I\u2019m not a prostitute.\"</p><p>He rolled over and faced me, \"What about what James was working on?\"</p><p>I shrugged, \"You know as well as I do, he never told me shit.\"</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, \"We are missing a piece of the puzzle and I know you're the key.\"</p><p>I looked back at the house we were in front of and then back at him, \"We need to get off these people\u2019s grass. I would be flipping out, if I were them.\"</p><p>He laughed and stood offering me a hand, \"How's the foot?\"</p><p>I sighed, \"Sucky.\"</p><p>He bent down, \"Get on.\"</p><p>I frowned, \"What?\"</p><p>\"Get on. Piggy-back ride.\"</p><p>I shook my head but he backed into me. I wrapped my arms around his thick neck. He lifted me like I was nothing and carried me.</p><p>\"Feels like a camel ride.\"</p><p>He chuckled, \"Focus. So what kind of gigs did you have as an agent?\"</p><p>I closed my eyes and remembered, \"We mostly worked September 11th back then. It was fresh. That was our major goal. Servario was a gunrunner; we focused hard on anyone who was involved in weapons.\"</p><p>\"Did you uncover anything you shouldn\u2019t have?\"</p><p>I laughed, \"I was fresh off the farm. I ran coffees and got into the field for basic shit. I never was a big player, ever.\"</p><p>He tapped his fingers against my calves, \"Weird. You don\u2019t recall seeing anything and thinking, this is weird or anything like that?\"</p><p>I shook my head and wrapped my legs and arms tighter.</p><p>\"You like having me between your thighs?\" he asked sarcastically.</p><p>I grinned, \"I do, actually.\"</p><p>He looked back, \"Yeah?\"</p><p>I nodded, \"It's nice. I can tell all my older-lady cougar friends that I rode on you.\"</p><p>He looked back, \"If you want, I can give you something to tell them about.\"</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \"I don\u2019t do the whole notch on the belt thing, Coop. Wasn\u2019t my thing fifteen years ago and it's not my thing now. I am not the person I was in the hotel. That doesn\u2019t happen to me, ever. You may have been a gigolo in Sweden, not me. I ran coffees and Intel.\"</p><p>He crossed the street to the safe house and walked up the driveway. He opened the door and carried me in.</p><p>\"You can put me down.\" I slapped his shoulder.</p><p>He squatted and let me climb down. I limped to the single couch in the room.</p><p>Luce gave me a nod, \"You hurt yourself?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Twisted ankle.\"</p><p>She carried in my purse and dropped it in my lap. \"This thing has been vibrating so much, I almost stuck it down my pants.\"</p><p>Coop grimaced and pressed an ice pack on my ankle. I winced from the cold and opened the stupid clutch. I pulled out the phone and sighed, \"Twelve missed calls.\"</p> <p>Something silver caught my eye. I frowned; I\u2019d forgotten I had put it in there. I reached in and clutched it in my fingers. It always made me feel stronger.</p><p>\"What's that?\" Luce asked.</p><p>I opened my palm and ran my thumb across the engraving, \"Locket from my dad for graduation.\"</p><p>\"What's it say?\" she smiled sweetly, making her face light instead of intense.</p><p>I smiled back, \"It's his grad date and mine. We both graduated from Fort Huachuca, twenty-five years apart.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah? Cool. Your old man was well known. He ran some crazy ops, back in the day. The cold war had to be awesome.\" She sat on the folding chair across from me.</p><p>\"Yup. He worked a lot during the cold war.\" My level of pride for the man was immeasurable.</p><p>Coop leaned his head in, \"You wanna take a shower with me?\"</p><p>I frowned and was about to throw my shoe at him, but he winked and scratched his head.</p><p>I shrugged, \"Sure.\" The house must have been full of bugs. I slipped the locket around my neck.</p><p>He came and picked me up in his arms, \"You can't walk to the shower with that bum foot.\" he grinned.</p> <p>Luce laughed, \"You wouldn\u2019t rather my help with the shower, Evie?\"</p><p>I cocked an eyebrow, \"Pretty sure I would rather it, but I have a really disturbing desire to see what he's packing.\"</p><p>Luce laughed, \"You know it\u2019s one of two things, Evie, and neither is a good thing.\"</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>Coop winced, \"You guys say we're dirty.\"</p><p>\"Payback. We owe you for the centuries of oppression and abuse.\" I laughed.</p><p>He climbed the stairs, \"Do not even get me started on the things you owe me.\"</p><p>He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door. He started the shower and turned on the fan.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what was happening, but he pulled his shirt off and I smiled like an idiot. He lifted mine off and then dropped his jogging pants but kept his briefs on.</p><p>I slid my pants down and stepped out of the runners and socks gingerly. My ankle was pretty swollen. At least it wasn\u2019t a sprain. I stood in just my panties and bra and shivered slightly.</p><p>He lifted me up and carried me to the shower. Our skin against each other was hot and sweaty. He closed the door and whispered, \"I was apart of something about your dad once. That locket reminded me of it.\"</p><p>My stomach sank, \"I don\u2019t understand.\"</p><p>He swallowed, \"I saw files once about a mole op your dad was heading up. The review of the op basically didn\u2019t happen, until after he had died. They were looking for something. They felt that he had kept vital information from his reports, purposely.\"</p><p>None of it was about James or me. It was about my dad. I was a pawn. Was that possible? I shook my head, \"My dad was a hero. He never betrayed his country. He died for this country.\"</p><p>He shook his head, \"I didn\u2019t say he was traitor. I said he kept things from the files purposely. He might have been keeping it safe from eyes and ears for a reason. I was new when it happened and, honestly, the locket is the only reason I remember it.\"</p><p>I whispered, \"You have a photographic memory. I've seen it.\"</p><p>He nodded, \"I do, and I remember it like it was yesterday, they had taken all your dad\u2019s things into custody, nothing was cleared for your mom to have from his office. I was new; we were to go through his things, cataloguing everything and boxing it up. Everything was considered to be suspicious and we were to run all documents through known codes.\"</p><p>I frowned, \"He wasn\u2019t a mole. He was a good spy.\"</p><p>His eyes trailed down my throat to the locket. He reached up and grabbed it between his fingers, grazing the swell of my chest. \"There was a receipt for a locket. The surveillance team had seen him buying it. We never found it though. A team was sent to your parents\u2019. We searched everything, the safe, the cellar. There was nothing ever found. They were pissed about us not finding it. I remember that. I also remember, that James let them conduct a thorough search of your house and nothing was ever turned up there. It was way back in the day. I was brand new. We were interviewed separately afterward, about the things we found, and the ways they were handled.\" His eyes twinkled, \"Weird way to handle a deceased man's effects. Especially when he\u2019s a national hero.\"</p><p>I hugged myself harder, \"He gave the locket to me, the week he died. It was four years late. He had already given me tons of things for graduation, so it seemed strange he was giving me this too. But when I saw the dates, I was pretty excited. He never wanted me to enlist. Then, he never wanted me to go CI, even though my entire life had been spent preparing for it. The last straw was James. We had fought because he hated James. He never seemed happy for me, or the choices I made. I told him I didn\u2019t want to see him, it was after the wedding. He came and picked me up in a weird car I had never seen before, and we drove to a place by the water. We sat in the car in the rain and he gave it to me and told me he was sorry for saying the mean things. He was glad I was leaving, retiring when the baby came. He never wanted this life for me. I thought it was because, he thought I couldn\u2019t do it, which hurt. He had always protested when I made choices, but then he was proud of me when I completed them. This felt like he was glad I was leaving.\"</p><p>Coop\u2019s eyes burned down on mine for a moment. I couldn\u2019t help but pull back and stop the moment, we were obviously having. He wiped the water from his face, \"He wanted you safe from it all.\"</p><p>I glanced up into his face and nodded, \u201cI think so. I think he wanted me out of that life and away from James. At least if I wasn\u2019t at work, I wasn\u2019t the laughing stock of the office.\u201d</p><p>He looked conflicted about things, \"We need to run those dates and see if it's some kind of code.\"</p><p>A terrible feeling bit into my stomach, \"Are my kids safe?\" I asked feeling the nerves filling me.</p><p>He nodded his head, \"You remember the orders I gave?\"</p><p>I nodded back, preparing myself for the worst.</p><p>\"That was FBI. It wasn\u2019t CIA or military run. I have a friend in the FBI. No one will know where they are. I don\u2019t even know. I gave the orders because Martin's team specializes in mole operations. I wasn\u2019t sure what we were dealing with and I know he\u2019s the best. They make the snap decision in the air and the pilots are members of the team. When you wanted them hidden, I had a bad feeling you knew something.\"</p><p>I finally breathed, \"Oh my God. Thank God. You're much better at this, than I've been giving you credit for.\" The move was smart. It was something my dad would have done. He never trusted anyone. I looked up at him, \"Where are we gonna go?\"</p><p>He whispered back, \"Not a fucking clue. If we leave here and you don\u2019t go back to Servario, we won\u2019t have any help or resources. The people looking for answers in your dad's shit were my bosses, our bosses. They told me not to take you from Servario. I disobeyed a direct order. Until we have some answers, we need to be off grid. This shower is the only place they can\u2019t hear us if we whisper. Not to mention we probably have about an hour, before they arrive here and take us into custody.\"</p><p>I sighed and looked down at the locket, \"It's just a necklace.\"</p><p>He forced a grin, \"Nothing about your dad was ever simple. He was a genius. Let's not talk about this again, until we're out of here. They always have eyes on the house. We need to get out of here and regroup.\"</p><p>I looked up, getting a face full of water. I sputtered, \"I know where we can go.\"</p><p>He nodded and stopped the water. We stood there in the dripping and silence, he clenched his jaw. I looked down and forced my thoughts away from his lips. I heard him open his mouth and interrupted whatever he was about to say, \"Pass me a towel, please.\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" he sounded weird. I didn\u2019t want to think about it. I didn\u2019t want any of it. I wanted to be a parent and a widow, even if it was fake, and forget the rest. I defiantly didn\u2019t want to think about the things I had done with Servario, or the fact I was still thinking about him. The memory of his face in parking garage tugged at me.</p><p>We dried off, not speaking. I hobbled, still soaked, to the bedroom and changed into the spare clothes.</p><p>Downstairs we met in the kitchen, \"Who wants breakfast?\" Coop asked.</p><p>Luce nodded and glanced at Jack, who nodded back at her.</p><p>\"IHOP?\" Luce asked.</p><p>I nodded, \"Yeah, I love it there.\" It was a lie. I hated all chain restaurants.</p><p>I followed Luce to the dining room, which was filled with black cases. She opened them and started putting guns in her pants and boots. I followed suit. It felt weird to hold a piece again, it had been so long. I had only trained with them; I never was forced to work with one, ever.</p><p>The walk to the car was tense and awkward. If the eyes on the house were suspicious before, they would be increasingly so, after we left.</p><p>Chapter Ten - Hot-wire my heart</p><p>The car we stole, after we ditched the car we left in, was a beater. The vibration was annoying me. I looked at Luce next to me in the backseat and frowned, \"We need a different car.\"</p><p>She laughed, \"I know. We'll ditch this one and take another.\"</p><p>Coop looked back at me, \"Where are we going? I got on the eighty like you asked.\"</p><p>I swallowed, \"Salt Lake City.\"</p><p>He frowned, \"What?\"</p><p>I nodded and laughed, \"My uncle Fitz lives there. He'll know what the heck is up with the locket.\"</p><p>He frowned, \"Why is that? Why don\u2019t we have a record of a Fitz? I\u2019ve never seen that name before. Is it short for something?\"</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get the smile off my face, as I shook my head, \u201cNo, he's not exactly an uncle.\" I was excited to see him, nonetheless. It had been years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Your dad trusted him that much?\" Jack looked back at me, giving me a sneer. It was weird on him. His face was usually pleasant, patronizing, but pleasant.</p><p>I shrugged, \"It's a long story. I'll let Fitz tell it.\"</p><p>Coop shook his head, \"Uh, no. We are not walking into a trap.\"</p> <p>I laughed, \"You aren\u2019t, trust me. He's not something I can explain. You just have to see it, to understand.\"</p><p>Coop scowled at me in the rearview. I rolled my eyes and watched out the window.</p><p>Coop's stare never left the rearview for longer than a few seconds. He was obsessed with whatever was behind us. He swerved off the highway onto an off ramp. I caught a blur of the word Lovelock. He drove like a savage, skidding around corners and through a neighborhood.</p><p>He pulled into the driveway of a random house and parked the car. We jumped out\u2014well, they jumped out and I hobbled after them. We crept along to the house next door and then through the backyard of that house. We ran through the backs of four houses.</p><p>Coop moved quickly. My heart was in my throat. Had he seen something? They moved like they had been born working together. I felt like the only non-agent, limping along behind them. They ran to a huge fence, each did a pull up and hopped over. I stood there looking at the six-foot fence. There was no way I was going up and over. I grabbed the rough wood and instantly pulled my finger back. The sound of footsteps coming distracted me from the splinter, I was about to pick out. I ran to the back corner of the yard and dropped to my knees.</p> <p>I grabbed handfuls of the weeds and dragged them out fast. My fingers cut and bled, but I ripped with savagery. I mussed my hair with my dirt-covered hands and then rubbed them across my face and clothes.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Coop hissed through the fence.</p><p>I threw dirt at the fence and hisses like a cat, \"Psssst! Get outta here, pesky cat.\" I wiped my hair back from my face and smeared more dirt and blood across my face, \"Darla, keep that cat in your own yard.\" I added a little Wisconsin flare to Darla, cat, and yard.</p><p>I turned and screamed when I saw the seven men in black clothes. I held my head at a funny angle and made a face, \"You get outta my yard. We don\u2019t have any gang activity around here. I'm gonna call 9-1-1 if you don\u2019t go. I'm tired of you hooligans, thinking you can run this neighborhood.\" I stared at them with my mouth agape and the dirt covering my hands and face. I stuck my belly out as far as it would go and slouched.</p><p>One of the young men gave me a horrified look and put his hands in the air, \"Sorry ma'am. You didn\u2019t happen to see some people run through here?\"</p><p>I scrunched my face up and used my grandma\u2019s word for what, \"Wha? Wha? No.\" My Wisconsin flare was getting stronger, \"You get outta my yard.\"</p> <p>He looked around and turned away, following the others around the house. My heart was pounding, but I turned back and started picking weeds again with shaking hands.</p><p>After a few minutes, I got up and walked around the side of the house to the garage. I opened the unlocked door and walked in closing it slowly and locking it. I leaned against the back of it and took in gulps of air.</p><p>They were military. The military was after us, we went off the reservation and they were looking for us. I didn\u2019t know what to think. What had I done? Why hadn\u2019t I just stayed with Servario, like they had wanted? I had risked my kids and mother.</p><p>\"Are you insane?\"</p><p>I jumped and looked up to see Coop in the far corner. I frowned, \"How did you...?\" I looked around the garage.</p><p>He looked angry, \"That was stupid. Why didn\u2019t you jump?\"</p><p>I huffed as I spoke, \"Because my old, fat, lazy ass can't do a pull up, dick. My ankle is still sore and I don\u2019t jump fences. I have twenty-two percent body fat and almost no upper body strength.\"</p><p>He grimaced.</p> <p>I pointed, \"That is a respectable number for a woman my age.\"</p><p>He nodded, \"Keep telling yourself that. The car is around the block. Meet us there in five.\" He walked across the garage towards me. I stepped out of the way for him to leave through the door.</p><p>I looked around the empty garage, \"How the bloody hell, am I supposed to do that?\" I muttered.</p><p>The old Honda Civic in the garage gave me an idea. I climbed in the driver\u2019s seat and pulled the wire box. I hot-wired the car and opened the garage door. I flipped the visor and looked at the dirt stains on my face.</p><p>I backed out and closed the garage again. I pointed at the men in black in the driveway next door and shouted, \"Stay outta my yard!\"</p><p>I drove away, grinning.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want the cocky feeling I was filled with to get me bad juju. Bad-agent juju always ended up with the cocky person getting caught. In my case, that would get me shipped back to Servario. The dirty part of my brain didn\u2019t entirely object to going back. Servario had ways of convincing you that you wanted to stay. I had a horrid inkling that I\u2019d only run out of fear of my feelings for him.</p><p>I rounded the corner and stopped the car behind the minivan they had stolen. I could see Jack's dark head in the tinted window.</p><p>I jumped out and hopped into the back of the van.</p><p>Luce was laughing, \"That was amazeballs, dude. Put it there.\" She held her knuckles out. Apparently amazeballs was a positive thing. Even Jack was snickering. I patted the top of her knuckles with my hand, earning me a crazy look.</p><p>I glared at them, \"I hate you all.\"</p><p>Coop growled and drove the van like he was late for his kids\u2019 hockey practice. I mocked him behind his back with sneers. Luce smiled and nodded in his direction, \"I thought he was going to have a stroke.\"</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \"Yeah, well I woulda had a stroke, if I tried to jump that fence. My ankle is still sore and I'm out of shape.\"</p><p>Jack nudged me, \"You look great to me. My mom is really out of shape.\"</p><p>My mouth dropped open, \"I'm not old enough to be your mom, you little shit.\"</p><p>He blushed, contrasting his cheeks against his dark hair, \"Sorry. You know what I mean.\"</p><p>I glared at him, \"How old is your mother?\"</p><p>He swallowed and looked at Luce for help, \"Uhm... she's forty-three. She was twenty-one when she had me.\"</p><p>I pressed my lips together. My best mom friend was forty-five.</p><p>I snarled, \"Whatever.\"</p><p>Luce looked back, \"My mom's fifty if that makes you feel better.\"</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cScrew you all.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, \"Did you hot-wire that car?\"</p><p>I grinned at that, \"I did.\"</p><p>Coop looked at me in the rearview, \"Lucky it was an older model. They're easier.\"</p><p>I narrowed my gaze, \"You're dead.\" He smiled his cocky, asshole grin, the one that made my blood boil.</p><p>I looked out the window as he drove, and Luce played a game on her iPhone.</p><p>\"Can't they trace that one?\" I asked.</p><p>She shook her head, \"I buy my personal shit from a guy who makes sure it falls off a truck and lands in a tech guy\u2019s hands, and then gets sold under a table somewhere.\"</p><p>I snorted, \"Nice and legal you mean?\"</p><p>She looked up and winked, \"It's the only way.\"</p><p>\"Why are they coming after us for going off the reservation?\" I asked.</p><p>Jack looked back, \"We had no idea what we were getting into, with you and your husband. We honestly thought this was a weapon to destroy the world, as it always is, and someone betrayed the government like they always do.\"</p><p>My eyes narrowed, \"Don\u2019t lump me with my husband. He isn\u2019t my husband. He's in on this on his own.\"</p><p>Jack's eyes glinted when he grinned back at me, \"Regardless, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case anymore. We think your dad was in on some crazy shit and somehow you are being used to find whatever he hid, a long time ago.\"</p><p>I sighed, \"What I want to know is why are they turning on us?\"</p><p>He shook his head and turned back around, \"No clue.\"</p><p>I bit my lips and prayed Uncle Fitz would know what was happening.</p><p>We arrived in Salt Lake six hours later. I was passed out when I felt the car stop.</p><p>I looked up as Coop parked and instantly felt my neck go out. I winced, rubbing the spot.</p><p>Luce too woke up and stretched. She yawned and smirked at me, \"Crick in the neck?\"</p><p>I nodded, \"I am too old for this shit.\"</p><p>I sighed and got out of the car. I tried to stretch, but the pain in my neck was shooting down my spine. Coop walked over with his iPhone and held it out, \"This is the map of the city. Where am I going?\"</p><p>Jack got out and walked into the corner store we were parked at, with Luce following him.</p><p>\"Grab me some chocolate and flavored water please!\" I shouted at her.</p><p>She gave me a thumbs up and walked inside.</p><p>I looked down at the map, still rubbing my neck. Coop grabbed my arm and spun me around. He handed me the phone and started massaging.</p><p>\"Let me. You look at the map,\" he mumbled.</p><p>I closed my eyes and let the warmth and strength of his fingers relax me. I moaned, \u201cThat feels amazing.\"</p><p>\"Map.\"</p><p>\"Shhhhhhhh. Just rub.\"</p><p>He chuckled, \"Oh the things I could add to that comment.\"</p><p>I smiled, but kept my eyes closed.</p><p>\"Your dad was a good man, right? The reports are true, right?\" he asked after a couple minutes.</p><p>I nodded, \"He was the best. He sacrificed everything for this country.\"</p><p>His breath tickled the back of my neck, when he let out a long sigh.</p><p>I opened my eyes and dragged the map so it zoomed in on a spot, \"Corner of Edison and ninth, next to Randy's Record Shop.\"</p><p>He increased the pressure, digging into my neck. I closed my eyes again.</p><p>\"You're so tense.\"</p><p>I scoffed, \"Uh... yeah. Of course I am.\"</p><p>He laughed, \"You gotta learn to roll with the punches a little better.\"</p><p>I pulled away and gave him a horrified look, \"Excuse me? You bury your husband and the next day get molested on a plane by an arms dealer, and kill a fat guy who wants you to spank him and jerk him off, then tell me how YOU feel.\" I shook my head and climbed back into the van. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He clenched his jaw and gave me a steely look, \"He isn\u2019t even really dead, and I said sorry about the plane. I had no idea.\"</p><p>I sneered, \"Tell that to my kids. Oh wait, you can't. They\u2019re being protected by the witness-protection agency. Right.\" I slid the door shut and folded my arms. My neck ached still but he looked less than impressed, little shit.</p><p>Luce climbed in and passed me the small bag of snacks. I looked in and frowned, \"This isn\u2019t flavored water.\"</p> <p>She nodded, \"I know, but you shouldn\u2019t eat all that artificial sweetener. It gave all the rats cancer, dude.\"</p><p>I wanted to snap at her, but I knew it was just that I was losing my mind. I took deep breaths and reminded myself, it was just flavored water.</p><p>I took the cap off the bottle of sparkling plain water and shuddered when I took the first sip. It was bitter and horrid. I gave her a look. Her eyes widened, \"What?\"</p><p>I snatched the orange juice out of her hand and passed her the water.</p><p>\"I don\u2019t drink that crap, it's bitter.\" She reached for the juice.</p> <p>\"Then we compromise.\" I swatted at her and sighed taking the water back. I opened the van door and dumped some of the water out. I poured the juice into the bottle and passed her back the half empty bottle of juice.</p><p>She scowled, \"You suck.\"</p><p>I nodded and sipped my flavored water.</p><p>Coop climbed in, stuffing a protein bar in his mouth. When Jack got in, we drove to the spot on the map. It was a flower shop, last time I had come by. I glanced out and frowned at the small sign.</p><p>\"Lester's Art Hut?\" Coop asked.</p><p>I nodded, \"I guess. Maybe he sold it. Maybe they know where he went.\" I climbed out.</p> <p>Coop did the same, \"Wait. What if they're expecting you?\"</p><p>I laughed and limped to the front door. I opened it and smiled. It was Fitz's place, for sure. It still looked like the set of the movie The Birdcage.</p><p>Coop stalked in behind me, stopping and pressing his body against mine. I don\u2019t think he even noticed me. His mouth was agape as he looked about, \"Where the hell are we?\"</p><p>It was decorated like it was a PRIDE float.</p><p>I looked back, wincing at my sore neck, \"Uncle Fitz's.\"</p><p>He pointed, \"It said Lester.\"</p><p>I shrugged, \"This is Fitz.\"</p><p>He came around the corner in a pale pink bowling shirt and a beaming grin, \u201cI knew that voice, the second my ears heard it.\u201d</p> <p>His Jersey accent was replaced by a southern one. He was big on characters.</p><p>He spread his arms like wings and pulled me in when I stepped to him.</p><p>\u201cUncle Fitz,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He kissed the top of my head, \u201cI heard you are in some trouble, young lady.\u201d</p><p>I nodded into his silky, pale-pink shirt. Hugging him was like coming home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in huge shit.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cWho is that sexy piece of military man-meat?\u201d</p><p>I snorted, \u201cCoop\u2014Uncle Fitz, Uncle Fitz\u2014Coop.\u201d</p><p>His hand left my back and I felt the motion of them shaking hands.</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you, son.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at Coop and winced when my neck turned.</p><p>Fitz swung an arm around me and waved his hand at Coop, \u201cTell them others to come in too.\u201d He walked me to the back of the store and through a dark hallway, \u201cYou are in serious shit. Your dad never wanted you to find this.\u201d</p><p>I tried to look up but my neck was killing me, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled again, \u201cOh lordy, you are gonna be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven \u2013 Magic beans</p><p>The heat permeated through my flesh and into my muscles. I moaned as it vibrated softly and massaged my aching neck.</p><p>\u201cGot that thing off of the Home Shopping Network. They sent it to me for free \u2018cause I spent over a thousand dollars on there last year. It\u2019s called the Magic Beanbag. You heat it in the microwave, and then plug the vibrator in and put the beanbag in the holders and voila, a heated massage.\u201d Fitz smiled and passed us each a margarita.</p><p>I drank the salty, lime drink and moaned, \u201cI missed you.\u201d My voice had a slight vibration from the vibrator.</p><p>Coop watched him, still not mellowing out, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit early for marg\u2019s, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked with a definite tone.</p><p>Luce scoffed, \u201cIt is never too early for a margarita, and after the week we\u2019ve had, I think we should have two.\u201d</p><p>Fitz beamed, \u201cI like you!\u201d</p><p>She grinned, \u201cLikewise. New favorite uncle, right here.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled like he was listening to bible study or watching a documentary. He never seemed to engage much. It was like he was taking it all in.</p><p>Coop sighed and sat on the oversized, floral couch. It matched the room beautifully. I felt like I might actually be in Savannah, Georgia or somewhere South and warm.</p><p>Fitz\u2019s dark-brown eyes sparkled when he looked at me, \u201cWhat do y\u2019all know?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and leaned back into the massage, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms and sat in the fancy armchair, \u201cWell, I knew this was coming. I knew James was onto something.\u201d He sighed and looked around, \u201cYou have to know, once this can of worms is opened there ain\u2019t no coming back.\u201d</p><p>I furrowed my brow, \u201cIs this what killed my dad?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYou could say that.\u201d He looked uncomfortable, \u201cI don\u2019t want this to ever come out. I don\u2019t want to be the reason you know jack shit.\u201d</p><p>Coop placed the full glass on the coffee table and leaned forward, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Fitz\u2019s eyes darkened, which didn\u2019t seem possible. His old, tanned face darkened with them, \u201cI was in with Lincoln, her daddy. We enlisted same year, joined CI same year, and I retired the year he was gone.\u201d</p><p>I could see the skepticism on Coop\u2019s face. It made me smile. Coop gave him a look, \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>Fitz brushed the comment off, with a truly-feminine hand wave, \u201cMy life before doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m Fitz now, and I\u2019m living the life I always wanted to.\u201d He stood and walked to the kitchen. He did what my mom did, and talked as he sliced and stirred, \u201cBack then, Gays had no choice, but to be in the closet. But Linc knew, he knew day one. We were in basic together and he made a shitty comment at me. I could have slapped him silly, but I just laughed it off. We were friends instantly. He saved me tons of times. Covered for me, so I could meet up with,\u201d a slow smile crept across his face, \u201cFriends. I was indebted to him the day I met him.\u201d He pointed his huge knife at me from across the room, \u201cHe made me godfather of this pain in the ass, the day she was born, her and Sissy.\u201d He winked, \u201cI always imagined I was more of a fairy godmother though.\u201d Luce and I laughed, but Jack snorted some of his drink and Coop looked confused. He wanted the story.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lieutenant Daily,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Fitz\u2019s eyes lit instantly. I could see his hand tighten on the grip of the blade. I put a hand in the air, \u201cHe has one of those memories, Fitz. Every detail of everything he has ever read or seen is in there.\u201d</p><p>Fitz\u2019s stormy look never left.</p><p>I looked at Coop glaring, \u201cKeep your mouth shut and let him talk.\u201d</p><p>Coop gave me the look, I was getting used to, \u201cYou both have five minutes to have this all make some sense, before I drag your ass out of this place. This feels like a stall, like he\u2019s waiting for the backup.\u201d</p><p>Fitz started to laugh, \u201cOh honey, I am dead. Didn\u2019t you read that little chestnut in the files, Mister Memory Bank?\u201d</p><p>Coop sighed, \u201cI only saw a few comments about you, like the godfather thing. They didn\u2019t have anything about the fairy godmother though.\u201d</p><p>Fitz laughed, \u201cYou are an animal in the sheets, aren\u2019t you? I, myself, love control freaks.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at Coop\u2019s tightening jaw.</p><p>Fitz challenged him with his stare, but Coop didn\u2019t bite. Fitz finished cutting the fruit salad, \u201cAnyway, how much do y\u2019all know about the second world war?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cCan you stop with that accent? It\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNo. I choose my reality to be the gay version of Gone with the Wind.\u201d His eyes lit up, \u201cI have some of the dresses; wanna put some on for the rest of the story?\u201d</p><p>I giggled and shook my head. Jack swallowed nervously, Luce looked more scared than he was.</p><p>I winked at Fitz, \u201cThey don\u2019t get your sense of humor.\u201d\u201d</p><p>Coop spoke through his teeth, \u201cSecond world war?\u201d</p><p>Fitz pointed the knife at him, \u201cRight. Anyway, did you all learn about how Hitler was taking the best of the best as far as scientists and intellects were concerned?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cYeah. We\u2019ve all seen Indiana Jones.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cI swear to God in Heaven, nine minutes is all I need with Harrison Ford in that outfit, with that whip.\u201d He fanned himself, \u201cWhew!\u201d</p><p>The others laughed, getting used to the show. Fitz was crazy.</p><p>He nattered as he peeled a massive watermelon and cut it into tiny pieces, behind the huge marble island in the kitchen. \u201cWell, when the other countries, the Brits especially, found out Hitler was doing that, they went nuts. Thus formed the much more modern spy agencies we all work for. The scientists were lost as the war ended.\u201d I noticed the subtlest grin crossing his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do with the Burrow?\u201d Coop asked. I could tell he was beyond annoyed.</p><p>Fitz froze. He looked up, \u201cYou said you knew nothing.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cWe know James was looking for the Burrow. Him and a guy named Gustavo Servario. That\u2019s it though. It feels like nothing.\u201d</p><p>Fitz looked at each of us, \u201cYou all are in over your heads.\u201d</p><p>My spine started to tingle; his Jersey accent was back.</p><p>He placed the knife down, \u201cHave you spoken the word Burrow to anyone beyond you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cNo, but we spoke about it at the bugged house. The government knows about the Burrow. They\u2019re the ones trying to get it.\u201d I was lost. I looked at Coop; he looked the way I did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slammed a hand down on the hard counter, \u201cOf course they know about it! They made the fucking thing! They hid them! They made a unanimous decision and saved the world from ending, at the hands of idiotic idealists.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Jack, \u201cGuess you were right.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYay.\u201d</p> <p>Fitz closed his eyes and pinched his brow with his juice-covered hand, \u201cWe need to run now. They know you\u2019ll come here.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, \u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNot where the Burrow is concerned.\u201d</p><p>My guts started to burn, \u201cYou said you knew James was going to find something out or be onto something. What the hell did you think we were here for?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cI thought you found out about your mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, \u201cShe\u2019s one of us. Always has been. Close your damned mouths; you look like idiots. She was like the Mata Hari of our time. Magnificent spy.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t feel my legs and arms, \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, \u201cShe\u2019s retired. She used to be one of the head spies for MI6.\u201d</p><p>Betrayal and sickness rolled around inside of me, \u201cShe\u2019s English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGerman and English. Her mother\u2014your grandmother, was born in a concentration camp. Your great-grandparents both died there and your great aunt fled to England with your grandmother. She met an Englishman and married him and gave birth to your mother. It was obvious early on, your mother was far more intelligent than the boys in school. MI6 hired her in the sixties at eighteen. She climbed ranks faster than the men. She was the first female to reach those sorts of ranks. Brilliant, bloody deadly too. She can kill with her pinky finger.\u201d He spoke with such pride in his voice, but I nearly gagged.</p> <p>\u201cShe has my kids!\u201d I blurted.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cThen they have never been safer.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and tried to see it all. I shook my head, \u201cNone of it makes sense. She never left the house. She was always there. He was gone on mission, but she was there. She was baking and sewing and making ornaments. She let the lawyer into James\u2019 office, she let me go to the hotels, and she let the bad men get to James and me. How had it all happened before her eyes? She would have known if she was a spy, even a shitty one, much less, a brilliant one.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cThen she did it for a reason. She has to be aware of what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes, \u201cWhat kind of fucking operation is this?\u201d</p><p>I could see sadness in Fitz\u2019s eyes, \u201cShe stopped when you were born. You and Sissy were everything to her. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be able to get pregnant. You were both a miracle. A set of twin girls for a lady who couldn\u2019t have a single baby. As you aged, she slowly got back into it. Small missions, tiny jobs, little things she could do while you were in school.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, \u201cNot for her. She was one of a kind. She could take you to the park, assassinate someone, and not even bat an eyelash, or have a hair out of place. She was a machine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does that even mean? Did she do that?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cOf course not. She never endangered you. She became a regular American mother. She doted on your father, but always maintained the aid to her country.\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers through my hair and tried not to notice the grease, \u201cWhat is the Burrow?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to know anything else. I didn\u2019t have room for it.</p><p>I looked up to see Fitz shaking his head, \u201cSomething dangerous. Something that once you know about it, you can never come back from knowing. You leave the service the way I did.\u201d He looked sickened, \u201cThe way your father did.\u201d</p><p>Tears flooded my eyes.</p><p>He was alive.</p><p>He was another person who had pretended to be dead and left me.</p><p>I got up and walked to the hallway, \u201cI need to lay down.\u201d</p><p>I walked to the spare room I had slept in before, and curled up in the sheets.</p><p>When I closed my eyes I saw it all. The obvious things that stuck out but seemed innocent with unknowing eyes. With jaded bitterness, I could see them for what they were.</p><p>The door opened, just as I was about to jump up and scream at Fitz some more.</p><p>Coop poked his head in, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cFuck no.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and closed the door. He laid on the bed on his back, \u201cFeeling stupid?\u201d</p><p>I punched him in the arm, hurting my hand.</p><p>He snorted, \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d He turned, looking at me, \u201cYou hit like a girl.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, \u201cHow could they? How could they lie and cheat Sissy and me? How could the very same shit happen to my kids? Do you see the irony in this? It\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>Coop was looking at me still, when I opened my eyes, \u201cAlmost like it was planned,\u201d he said.</p><p>I nodded, \u201cI have no doubt, some of it was. Look at it all? It all fits so nicely when you stand back. Up close it\u2019s a jumbled mess, but from a distance you can see everything. You can easily just slip the puzzle pieces together.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand, \u201cYour kids are safe. She isn\u2019t going to hurt them. She isn\u2019t going to let them get hurt.\u201d</p><p>My eyes watered, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she tell me the truth? Why didn\u2019t she let me in?\u201d</p><p>He wiped a tear dripping down my cheek, \u201cDid you tell your kids what you used to be?\u201d</p><p>I scowled, \u201cOf course not. They\u2019re only little.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, \u201cDid you ever plan on telling them about you being a spy? Do you plan on telling them about James\u2019 betrayal, or his still being alive, or what he really did for a living?\u201d</p><p>I clenched my jaw.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYou don\u2019t know why she never told you things, but you can see how easy it is to want to protect them.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cI was CI though. Why didn\u2019t she tell me then? Or when I was retired. We shared more things, than I ever knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You have to ask her.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, \u201cHow do I reach her?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I climbed off the bed and left the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the Burrow?\u201d I shouted down the hall.</p><p>Fitz passed me a bowl of probably the most amazing-looking fruit salad I\u2019d had ever seen. I sighed taking it and my seat.</p><p>He sat with a bowl of fruit too, \u201cWell, I guess since the story of how the Burrow was created is the same as the story of how your mom became a spy, I can just head off from where I was before in the story. The newly-formed spy operatives joined forces and saved the weapons from the Germans. We didn\u2019t get them all, just the ones with the potential to destroy the world with their so-called brilliance.\u201d He ate a bite and chewed, but he seemed lost in it all, \u201cWe took them somewhere no one would ever find them. An asylum where they would be safe. At first the presidents and leaders were aware the Burrow existed but they didn\u2019t know where it was. Then the Korean War happened and they wanted the weapons. They wanted to win. The Master Key makes the call. He decides if the cause is worthy or not. He saw the request for aid from the Nations involved in the Korean War. He turned them down. It was then, that the first mission to try to find the Burrow was executed by our own governments. We had been brothers in arms and suddenly we were at war within our own ranks. The men working for the Burrow would die protecting it and the men working for the cause would die trying to find it.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Coop standing in the hallway. I could see he was as in the dark as I was.</p><p>Fitz spoke through the bite he was chewing, \u201cThen came the Vietnam War. The CIA would stop at nothing to get those weapons. The Burrow had been moved in secret to protect it. It was no easy feat. Everyone was so angry when they couldn\u2019t find it, and then eventually more weapons started to disappear. Anytime a new one was created, it was taken. The Burrow grew as technology developed. It wasn\u2019t even during the Gulf War, Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq that we saw much threat against the Burrow. As technology grew, so did the Burrow\u2019s capabilities. Since 9/11, we have had the hardest time keeping the Burrow a secret.\u201d He sighed and ate another bite.</p><p>I took a bite and chewed, \u201cWhat kind of weapons?\u201d</p><p>Coop answered, \u201cPeople.\u201d</p><p>Fitz looked back, \u201cYou are a sharp one.\u201d</p><p>Luce gave me a look, \u201cPeople?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>Jack inhaled sharply, \u201cThat actually makes sense.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cWhat does?\u201d</p><p>Coop crossed his arms and leaned against the wall, \u201cThey\u2019re hiding the scientists and engineers, who pose a threat to society with their inventions and discoveries. Isn\u2019t that right, Fitz?\u201d</p><p>Fitz nodded, \u201cYes, it is. You see, they always come from an innocent place. The intelligent mean well. The technology rarely has weaponry as the intention, but the governments, our own homeland security, CIA, MI6, and the UN always see it as potential. So we fake a death with a heart attack, or accident, or sometimes we just go with plain old missing persons. We take them and their work to the Burrow. We leave behind misinformation and lies. Nothing in this world is ever as it seems. You have to understand, everyone thinks the weapons will save them or give them the upper hand, but the council has to be able to see that winning won\u2019t save us in the big picture. Pollution, destruction of country\u2019s environments, destruction of land, deaths of innocents, upping the ante and winning, have to all be separated and looked at piece by piece.\u201d</p><p>I had only one question, \u201cWhere is the Burrow?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Only the Master Key knows that.\u201d</p><p>Coop took his seat again, \u201cWhere is the Master Key?\u201d</p><p>Fitz shook his head, \u201cI would die before I would reveal that. He or she must find you, if they wish to be found at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas my father a Master Key?\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up, \u201cHe was so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>I shouted, \u201cWAS HE, FITZ?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He jumped slightly, \u201cHe was.

I have endangered you by telling you with these other people here. Your children will never be safe again. Are you happy you know?\u201d</p><p>I fought a sob, \u201cFuck!\u201d What other word was there?</p><p>I looked around the room for the magic beanbag, as my neck nearly seized.</p> <p>Chapter Twelve \u2013 Love in all the wrong places</p><p>I stared up into the dark ceiling and knew.</p><p>There was one answer to the problem in my mind. I glanced over at Luce\u2019s rising and falling chest. She was either sleeping or very good at faking.</p><p>I reached for my clutch and slipped the phone from it. Coop had told me to leave it behind, but I hadn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to think about why. I looked at the screen and the number that had called seventeen times and pressed it. I pressed the message button and texted slowly, \u2018Come Find Me! I\u2019m in SLC\u2019</p><p>I pressed send and tried to keep my breathing even. What was he going to do to me, if I came back? Would he hurt me?</p> <p>I slipped from the bed and tiptoed from the room and down the hall. I picked my shoes up, but as I rounded the corner I heard a whisper, \u201cYou won\u2019t get far you know. Mister serious, he likes you.\u201d</p><p>I turned to see a pair of dark eyes in the shadowed corner of the store.</p><p>I nodded, \u201cHe\u2019s like nine-years old. I need answers, Fitz. I\u2019m done risking you. Tell them I went back to Boston. Tell them to forget they ever met you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and I could see the glint of his teeth from the streetlights shining in the window, \u201cI\u2019ll be out of here the minute they are, kid.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to have involved you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly, \u201cI knew it would come for me one day. I\u2019m glad it was you. The Burrow can\u2019t stay hidden without a lot of work, and unfortunately, times are changing. It\u2019s getting increasingly harder to keep its secret.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned, \u201cWhat do you do with the doctors that don\u2019t want to stay hidden?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he stepped forward and hugged me, \u201cHave a safe trip, kid. Go easy on the arms dealer.\u201d He ignored my question.</p><p>I pulled back, \u201cHow do you know it all?\u201d</p><p>He kissed my cheek, \u201cI still know people.\u201d</p><p>He slipped something like a business card in my hand, \u201cIf you get stuck, call this number. But don\u2019t call, unless you want to be gone forever.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cOkay. Thanks, Uncle.\u201d I kissed his weathered face and opened the front door to the store. I walked down the cold sidewalk and turned up an alley. I pulled on my boots and tucked the card in my clutch.</p><p>The phone vibrated.</p><p>\u2018Done with your uncle then?\u2019</p> <p>My heart hurt instantly. I went to the phone function and dialed in the code and then the number to the shop. Fitz answered, \u201cYou missing me already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRUN, FITZ! DON\u2019T WAIT! WAKE THEM AND RUN NOW!\u201d</p><p>He hung up before I had a chance to explain. I started to run. I dialed the number that had called repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure of this midnight call?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, \u201cI need you to help me.\u201d I ran to a corner and stopped there. I pressed my back into the concrete wall and spoke softly, \u201cI will do whatever you want, if you help me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cYou know how to play hardball. Whatever I want?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip. I wanted to call him a pervert degenerate, but I didn\u2019t. I nodded, \u201cWhatever you want. But you can\u2019t hurt anyone. Not my uncle, not the team helping me, and not my family.\u201d</p><p>A large black SUV pulled up the corner of the street. The window lowered. I gasped when I saw his face, \u201cWe can negotiate in the car.\u201d</p><p>I lowered the phone. How had he done it? No one should have known about Fitz. There was no way we were followed, unless one of us was a mole. And yet there in front of me was Servario, with a look that could skin a cat.</p><p>I looked both ways and walked across the road softly. I expected a bullet to strike me in the back, as he moved over and I climbed in.</p><p>The new car smell struck me. \u201cDid you buy this today?\u201d</p><p>His eyes had none of the green hints in them, that were there when he was happy. I closed the door and looked down, \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt them,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He tapped the glass in front of us and the SUV drove away. As we rounded the corner, I caught a glimpse of Coop running after us.</p><p>\u201cIronic, isn\u2019t it,\u201d he said and sipped from his glass, \u201cLast time it was me running, desperate for you to stay with me, and it was young Cooper driving away with you in his car.\u201d He leaned over, taking a good look at Coop, \u201cI have to say, I think he has a bit of a thing for you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head as I watched Coop from the window, \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s like that with everyone. He\u2019s flirty and fun away from the job, and serious and controlling on the job. Somehow he makes it fun still, even when he\u2019s serious.\u201d</p><p>His tone changed to angry, \u201cI dare say, you have a thing for him as well.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Servario\u2019s stoic face, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ran.\u201d I needed the subject changed.</p><p>He turned, \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and nodded, \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He made me shiver.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak to me as we drove. I continued to look at him, to try to catch a glimpse of how he was feeling or what he was thinking.</p><p>We arrived at the airport and the door was opened. He climbed out and walked to the plane. Roxy was startled to see me. She looked down as I boarded. I assumed that was bad.</p><p>My heart was in my throat. I sat in my seat from before and fought the nervous tears that were threatening me. I was cooler than that, a better spy than to cry from his possible anger. I would take what he would dish.</p><p>He didn\u2019t sit beside me, like before. He went to the cockpit.</p><p>Roxy brought me a glass of wine and quickly left again. Her eyes never met mine.</p><p>Steve nodded at me as he took his seat.</p><p>I laid the seat back and closed my eyes. If he was going to beat or torture me, I would have to take it. I needed answers; they were worth whatever happened to me.</p><p>I closed my eyes and saw my kids\u2019 faces. Jules smiling at me and looking so much like her father it was painful, and Mitch trying so hard to be grownup.</p><p>At least they had a ninja granny to protect them. I made it out unscathed, they would too.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to take off, you should at least hold the wine,\u201d his voice was detached as he took his seat.</p><p>I sat up quickly and held the glass. The jet started right away and began the taxi to the runway.</p><p>I glanced nervously in his direction. I was having a hard time seeing the cruel man and not the curve of his lips or the thickness of his fingers. I sipped the wine at first and then finished in a gulp, \u201cWhy are you so angry?\u201d</p><p>He focused on the laptop in front of him, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, \u201cYou are. I was married, remember? I can tell when a man is angry.\u201d</p><p>A smile played with his lips momentarily, and then it was back to stoic. He looked at me for a second, \u201cI was crossing the line before. It was wrong. I\u2019m not your husband, Evie.\u201d</p><p>I unbuckled the seat belt and walked to the bathroom. I closed the door and sat on the closed toilet lid. He always had me in knots, whenever he was around. It was like walking on thin ice, constantly.</p><p>The jet started to take off, slamming my side into the sink. I tried to grab ahold of the bar next to me, but the force was too great. I gave in and let it squish me into the counter. I needed to think anyway.</p><p>I wanted answers and details from him, but he was no longer interested in me sexually. Why had he been so interested before, or at all? Nothing was making much sense and without the womanly wiles to get him talking, I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I could try to spin it around in my favor. I could do what I did to James, and act like I was the angry one. He hated that.</p><p>It was an idea. When the plane got to cruising altitude, I stripped naked and cleaned myself in the sink with the hand towels, which was awkward and familiar. I opened the door and looked down the hall. He was no longer in the chair. I tiptoed to the very back of the plane to the dressing closet. I dropped my clothes on the floor and looked through the racks of clothes.</p><p>It was a sea of designer labels and soft fabrics. I pulled on a white lacy bra and matching panties. They still had tags, making it slightly less weird. Settling on Armani, I went with the most coverage I could get. I looked very comfortable in the long black, side-slit maxi skirt and mocha sleeveless, tie-waist tunic. I looked around for sandals. Instead, I found a suede pair of black Manolo Blahnik mules with a pointed toe. It was an elegant choice and made me look like a wife.</p><p>I pulled on a couple bracelets and pulled my long, dark hair up into a bun.</p><p>\u201cThat tan tunic compliments your dark skin,\u201d Roxy said with a soft smile.</p><p>I grinned, \u201cThanks. My dad was half Black Irish and half Icelandic. Dark hair and golden skin. It was a good thing to inherit. My twin sister and I aren\u2019t identical and she looks more like our mother.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed my hand and whispered, \u201cAre you insane for coming back?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cI need him.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, \u201cOh my God, if you knew how many times I\u2019d heard that from girls about him. He\u2019s a bigot player. You need to run.\u201d</p><p>I forced the fake smile to remain on my lips, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>She gave me the up down, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I blushed, \u201cI wanted to look professional, not the other kind of professional. All your clothes are more twenty-three and hitting the clubs. This suits me and my other clothes were covered in garden dirt.\u201d</p><p>She waved her hands, \u201cThis is exactly what he bought for you. He brought it on board yesterday. Jesus, you played right into his hands, calling him. I lost ten bucks in the bet we placed on you showing up and putting this on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I folded my arms, \u201cWhat? He knew I was coming back? He bought this?\u201d Was I that predicable? \u201cWhat is he fucking psychic?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, \u201cSometimes I think he is.\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips, \u201cYou sure it was for me?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, \u201cDoes it look like it belongs to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together and nodded, \u201cYeah, dumbass.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the tags I\u2019d removed and winced, \u201cHe\u2019s gonna know I took the tags off.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back the curtain, \u201cYou owe me ten bucks and a new pair of Christian Louboutin ankle boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d I muttered and walked out of the room to the seats out front. I almost sat in a different one, but I remembered I was the one who was angry. I needed a reason. I sat down and looked at the plate of prawns and sauce in front of me. My stomach gurgled. I rubbed it and picked up a prawn by its tail. I dragged it through the still warm sauce and moaned when I took the first bite. \u201cThis is good, Roxy.\u201d</p> <p>She grinned as she passed me, \u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>She winked and walked to the front of the plane.</p><p>I ignored his existence and enjoyed my meal, as I broke off a piece of bread and dragged it through the sauce on the plate. The crusty bread was still warm. I moaned again.</p><p>She cleared it and placed a plate of seared white fish, with a creamy sauce and roasted vegetables. The sauce was a lime and cilantro.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you ate a proper meal?\u201d he finally spoke.</p> <p>I shrugged and drank from my wine glass. I knew when it was, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to admit the last thing I\u2019d eaten was picks and nibbles of random foods. I wished I\u2019d eaten the entire fruit salad at Fritz\u2019s.</p><p>I hoped they were okay.</p><p>I glanced at my clutch on the table. I would need to call when we landed.</p><p>\u201cYou need to take better care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, \u201cI need the stability back in my life. I need you and the CI, and CIA, and James to leave me alone. I was eating regularly before. I was drinking water and eating five meals a day and going to yoga. Now I\u2019m hopping on planes and eating food from convenience stores, and I still don\u2019t know that my kids and mom are safe, or if my husband is really dead.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, \u201cI knew you would look nice in that outfit.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and turned back to my plate of food, gulping back the last of my second glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you angry with me? You think I caused all of this?\u201d</p> <p>Giving him my death stare and then letting it slide into indifference, I shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe. There are too many versions of you to possibly know.\u201d</p><p>He smirked, \u201cYou know me; you just don\u2019t want to admit you like what you see.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and turned back to my dinner. We landed just after Roxy cleared our food.</p><p>I hugged her as I left the plane, \u201cI\u2019ll get you those shoes.\u201d</p><p>She pinched, \u201cYou better not, but I want my ten bucks.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and kissed her cheek, \u201cAnother magnificent meal. I don\u2019t even know how you can get the fish so perfect on a plane.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, \u201cYou flatter and then I have to make sure it\u2019s out of the park next time too.\u201d I could see her eyeballing Servario nervously. He was stoic. I decided that should be his new name.</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cI doubt that will be an issue,\u201d and followed Steve.</p><p>His broad shoulders and thick back made me wonder how he stayed so fit. He seemed pretty lazy. He was probably one of those guys who stayed fit, no matter what they did.</p><p>We walked to the SUV waiting for us. I had noticed we weren\u2019t back in Boston. We flew into San Diego.</p><p>My stomach was a ball of nerves. I looked a Servario, \u201cI thought we were going home.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a blank look, \u201cWhen did I say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to call my cat sitter and get her to drop by and feed the cat. I\u2019ve been gone for days.\u201d</p><p>He watched my face for a second, \u201cFine. Make it fast and speaker phone.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out the cellphone he gave me and dialed her, praying Coop traced my calls. I wanted him close in case this was a huge mistake and I needed an evac.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cBeth, how are you? It\u2019s, Evie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvie, how are you doing? Are you okay?\u201d she sounded sad still.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are the kids?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cThey\u2019re good. Sad, but good. Anyway, the reason for my call is I need you to stop over and check on Ralph and make sure he\u2019s okay. I\u2019m in San Diego for a couple days. We\u2019re in San Diego. We decided to take a trip and I forgot, in all the chaos, to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I\u2019ll see him once a day and check on the house.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Servario, \u201cThat should be great. You have a key still, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I do. Have a great trip out west!\u201d</p><p>I smiled, forgetting what I was doing, \u201cThanks sweetie. Say hello to your mom.\u201d I hung up the phone and shook my head, \u201cSo weird. Her world is normal and mine is destroyed,\u201d I muttered, before I could stop myself.</p><p>He said nothing. When the truck stopped, the door was opened. I climbed out, ignoring everything around me. I was overcome with the strangest feeling I\u2019d had since my husband died/ran away.</p><p>I was lost.</p><p>He grabbed my hand and pulled me in a door. I caught a warm breeze, loaded with the smell of the ocean and frowned, \u201cAre we at the beach?\u201d</p><p>He pulled me inside and closed the door. He looked at me, \u201cDon\u2019t try anything. They will hurt you, if you try to leave.\u201d He pressed his lips against my forehead and walked away.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked, like I had a right to know.</p><p>He waved, \u201cOut for the night,\u201d and vanished down a long wide corridor. I looked around at the splendor. Everything of his was beautiful. My home was amazing and in all the right areas, whereas his was all luxury. Luxury I was completely alone in and not in the mood to enjoy.</p><p>I turned and walked into the large sitting area off the front room. A bottle of Apothic was already opened and poured into the carafe next to the empty bottle.</p><p>I poured a glass, sighing.</p><p>The walls were covered in art. It was rich and warm Spanish-styled home. It suited the sexy version of him I wanted to see again.</p><p>I slumped into a leather, burnt-orange sofa and drank.</p><p>\u201cOut for the night?\u201d I muttered and pulled out my phone, tapping it against my palm.</p><p>My head game of being the one who was pissed off, didn\u2019t work. He didn\u2019t come crawling and beg to know why or brought me flowers. Of course seeing it now, the reason for James\u2019 constant worry about my moods was obvious. He had a guilty conscience.</p><p>I stood and grabbed the carafe and walked down the other hallway. I clicked on light switches, only to discover an array of stunning rooms. Finally, I reached a room with a large fireplace and fabric couches. I curled up on one with my wine and dialed 9-1-1.</p><p>Luce answered, \u201cHey?\u201d She looked worried.</p><p>I put a finger to my lips, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cYeah. I just need answers. Did Fitz get away?\u201d</p><p>She cocked an eyebrow, \u201cYeah. He woke us up and dragged us to some safe house. We stayed for two hours, then got in a helicopter, and then a private jet. He dropped us in Boston.\u201d</p><p>I felt confusion all over my face, \u201cJet?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, \u201cYeah. Jet.\u201d</p><p>In the background I heard Coop yelling. The phone went crazy and then refocused on his face.</p><p>He looked savage, \u201cWhat did I say, Evie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need answers, Coop.\u201d</p><p>He made a face, \u201cDon\u2019t give me that shit. Fitz filled in a lot of blanks. We were getting somewhere. You fucking bailed, because you wanted to see him again and don\u2019t bullshit me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cNo, I swear. Fitz was never going to tell us anything useful. What more do we know? We know what the Burrow is and that\u2019s it. We don\u2019t know where it is, or who\u2019s there, or what to do with the information. We still don\u2019t have any resources.\u201d I sighed and looked down shaking my head. His sentence hit my ears, \u201cWait, what? Did you say jet? Where the hell did Fitz get a jet?\u201d</p><p>Coop\u2019s look matched mine, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t always had that?\u201d</p><p>I snorted, \u201cUh no. The buyout for people like us is about half the value of a pension.\u201d</p><p>He paused, \u201cWeird. He seemed pretty comfy in it. The pilot knew him.\u201d</p><p>I wriggled my nose, \u201cWas the pilot gay?\u201d</p><p>Coop scoffed, \u201cHow the hell should I know?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cAsk Luce.\u201d</p><p>He turned, \u201cYo, was that pilot gay?\u201d</p><p>I could hear her response, \u201cAlmost as gay as you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>I ignored their banter and replied, \u201cHe might be dating the owner. Gay people hire gay people, so they don\u2019t get fired for being gay.\u201d</p><p>He frowned harder, \u201cGays don\u2019t get fired for being gay, it\u2019s not the fifties, Evie.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows, \u201cCoop, a teacher got fired in Idaho last week, because her dead mother\u2019s obituary had her partner\u2019s name in it. She\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped, \u201cAre you for real?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sick. Okay, but back to brass tax. I\u2019m coming to get you.\u201d</p><p>I winked, \u201cThis is what\u2019s wrong with the world. Stay close; I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m ready to get picked up.\u201d</p><p>He scowled, \u201cTry not to have too much fun.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \u201cI think you need to head back to Sweden for the week. You seem tense.\u201d</p><p>He flipped me the bird and I pressed it off.</p><p>I dropped the phone and looked around the room. The huge wall-mounted TV looked like something I would be able to use, without too many problems. Of course, I had to search high and low for the remote. It took me twenty minutes to turn it on. I couldn\u2019t get sound but I watched the picture. It was Casablanca. It was at the part where she walks into the bar and sees the piano player. I almost tear up, as I see her ask him to play the song they liked. Seeing the anger and the way Bogart storms across the bar to stop Sam from playing the song, makes me think of Servario. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The look on Bogart\u2019s face, was the same one he got. Mostly it was the fake smile, with the heartbroken eyes. Almost like his lips couldn\u2019t convince the rest of his face, he was happy.</p><p>I wondered if I was easy to read or if I was more stone-faced.</p><p>I finished my glass of wine and curled into the pillows and cushions. The couch was soft. I closed my eyes, but they opened almost immediately from fear. I didn\u2019t like being in the wide open.</p> <p>I got up and stumbled down the hall farther. I opened door after door until I reached a set of double doors.</p><p>I opened them, instantly smelling him in the air. I searched the wall for the light switch. When I clicked it, rope lighting in the ceiling and windowsills lit the room up.</p><p>The room was ridiculous. I couldn\u2019t even imagine him ever needing a room like it. I closed the doors and crossed to the extra-large king-sized bed. It was made and pristine, like every inch of the unlived-in home.</p><p>I turned to find another set of double doors. I opened them to discover the walk-in closet. It was the size of a bedroom. Ladies\u2019 clothes, in a few different sizes, filled a tiny corner of the closet. That disturbed me. I closed the doors and looked around at the clothes. He had so many suits, it looked like it was a department store.</p><p>I kicked my shoes off and noticed how plush the carpet was on my toes.</p> <p>I flopped onto the floor and curled up under his suits. The room smelled like him. I reached up and jerked a suit free of the hanger and laid it down, taking in deep breaths of the smell of him.</p><p>My mind played tricks on me. It lied to me about what it would be like, if a man like Servario loved a girl like me.</p><p>It would be more like Romeo and Juliet and less like Casablanca. We would both end up dead.</p><p>I closed my eyes and felt safe in the small room, no one would look for me in.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen \u2013 Three\u2019s a crowd</p><p>I woke to a sound I didn\u2019t recognize.</p> <p>It sounded like people but then it didn\u2019t. It was muffled and then it was loud again, like it moved in waves. I blinked and opened the door a tiny crack. Figures moved in the dark. I heard moaning and a girl making a sound, I was certain I had made with him.</p><p>I stopped breathing, closing the door silently.</p><p>With it closed, I pressed my hand against the back of the hardwood and waited for my stomach to drop back down. He was having sex... in his bed... with me in the house. Did he know I was there, in the closet? Was this purposeful?</p><p>The reality of the whole situation didn\u2019t filter in slowly, it slammed my brain hard. I was his prisoner, his captive, his pawn. I had fooled myself into believing he might have cared about me. Instead, he was setting me up again, only this time he wanted me to hurt. I had let the mission become getting him to dominate me again, instead of finding the Burrow.</p><p>It dawned on me that I could have stayed with Coop, Luce, and Jack. I could have made it work with them as a team finding answers. Deep down, I had wanted to come back.</p><p>I wanted the things he made me feel, fear... anger... shame... desperation... pleasure. The pleasure was the worst.</p><p>The rhythmic sound of the girl got louder.</p><p>I took a breath and ignored my basic human senses, which told me not to look, and put my hand on the knob again. I wanted to see it.</p> <p>I turned the knob and opened the door a crack.</p><p>My eyes had adjusted to the dim light, making it easier to see them. The tanned complexion of his broad back and rounded shoulders, looked stunning in the moonlight. He thrust and I could almost feel him inside of me. The door was open only wide enough for my one eye to see through, and yet, I saw it all. Her legs lifted to his shoulders, pressing against his chest to arch her hips better. He sat up, pumping wildly. The sounds escaping her intensified with the slamming of his body against, and inside, of hers. His firm, rounded ass flexed with each mighty strike as his fingers dug into her thighs, dragging her back to him. His head dropped back as a slight moan escaped his lips. I barely caught it, over the spasms going on inside of her body, making her scream and writhe. I was jealous of her but for the wrong reason. I envied her, the release she was getting.</p><p>He chuckled and patted her thigh, \u201cSteve will see you out.\u201d He climbed off the bed and walked, still erect with a condom on, to the bathroom.</p><p>She climbed off the bed, and pulled her mini dress back to its rightful spot.</p><p>She tousled her long, blonde hair and walked from the room, holding her pumps.</p><p>I heard the shower turn on and knew it was my only chance. I waited for the water to sound like it was hitting his skin. The suspense of it all made it feel like a real mission. I knew he liked long showers. I waited until I heard the jets kick in, he liked them to massage his back.</p><p>I slipped from the closet, tiptoeing to the door. I turned the handle slowly. My breath was silent, but my heart was beating wildly.</p><p>I opened the door very deliberately, trying not to make a sound. Just as I had it open half an inch, it slammed shut and his soaking wet, dripping body pressed into my back.</p><p>\u201cI saved the best for you,\u201d he whispered into my neck. I shuddered, \u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me.\u201d The right kind of jealousy hit when his dirty hands touched me.</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cI figured you were used to sharing your men with other women.\u201d That stung.</p><p>Cold hatred crossed my face, shutting my body down, \u201cYou\u2019re clearly not my kind of man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet here you are, my woman,\" he growled and pressed my face into the door, lifting my skirt, \u201cI just have to know.\u201d</p><p>The fight came alive in me. I spun, pushing hard against his chest. He staggered back. I threw open the door, running as fast as I could. In the dark, and disoriented feeling of being in a different house, I was lost instantly.</p><p>A light down one of the hallways beckoned to me.</p><p>My bare feet slapped against the tiles, as did his.</p><p>He called out to me, taunting me, \u201cI like hunting, Evie. I like chasing the things I want to be on top of.\u201d</p><p>I started running on my tiptoes when I realized I couldn\u2019t hear his footsteps anymore. I opened a door when I rounded a corner. I ran hard and rounded another corner. I was back in the main sitting room. The house must have been built like an octopus.</p><p>I sprinted across the foyer and down the hall he had gone down for his night out. I opened the first door I found and slipped inside. I closed the door and flicked on the light. It was a games room. Billiards and other tables lined the massive space. I flicked the light off and ran for the back of the room. I remembered where the tables were and hid underneath one.</p><p>My breath and heartbeat were my only company.</p><p>The wait felt like it was an eternity but it was seconds. The suspense was built so high I didn\u2019t think it possible to be more afraid or paralyzed than I was.</p><p>I heard the door open but no light came through into the room. It was pitch black, even in the hallway. He must have turned off everything.</p><p>I stayed perfectly still, listening for breath or steps but he moved silently.</p><p>I crawled farther under the table as my eyes had adjusted to the lack of light, I hoped I would be able to see him. I needed to make it to the door.</p><p>\u201cI can hear your heartbeat,\u201d he whispered and I couldn\u2019t figure where it came from.</p><p>I held my breath, frozen in fear and a sickening sort of anticipation.</p><p>I waited before creeping forward again.</p><p>My left foot was grabbed mid crawl. I screamed and kicked but he dragged me back on the carpet so fast I didn\u2019t stand a chance. I scrambled but he was on me instantly, pressing me into the floor with his weight.</p><p>His hot breath licking at my nape.</p><p>I didn\u2019t give up the fight until he star-fished my body, pinning my arms and legs out from me.</p><p>Somehow he was still able to free one of his hands, dragging it down the side of me.</p><p>He lifted my shirt, tickling the side of my body.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>He kissed the back of my neck, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>He was right. I was horrified at myself and the fact I was growing excited as his hand slipped down my thigh. The fabric of my skirt rustled as he dragged it up my body. He slid his thick fingers up my spread legs to my ass cheeks and then down between my thighs.</p><p>\u201cI need to know.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, whispering into the carpet, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me. I don\u2019t care what you have to know. Why don\u2019t you go find yourself another whore, if you\u2019re not done?\u201d</p><p>I could hear the smile in his reply, \u201cEvie, I want to know if you liked watching me with that whore.\u201d</p><p>Shame filled me. I knew what he would find inside of my panties.</p><p>He let go of my body slightly and arched my ass up with his other hand. He pulled my underwear to the side, dipping his finger between my lips. I felt him slipping in the wetness there, the wetness caused by my watching him fuck someone else.</p><p>He moaned when he discovered my shameful secret. \u201cI had a feeling, what I might find.\u201d</p><p>I hated that he was pleased by the perverse thing I had done, and proud of the things he had made me like, and want. My body was trembling in frozen delight, waiting for the fingers inside of me to move.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t. He kept them there, completely still and began kneading my ass with his other hand.</p><p>My hips tried to rotate against him to try to force him to move, but he pressed me back down with his free hand.</p><p>When I stopped moving, he lifted my shirt up to my shoulders. He planted hot kisses along my back ribs and spine, still not moving his fingers.</p><p>My breath picked up, my body was ready to convulse. His kisses lowered to my ass cheeks. He dragged my underwear between the cheeks.</p><p>His words on the plane about fucking my ass started to play over and over in my head. He wouldn\u2019t, would he? I would fight him to the death on it. No matter what.</p><p>I jumped when I felt his teeth on my ass. He bit, not hard but enough to make me tense.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he spoke softly and then bit again.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like the biting, I wanted the fucking but he refused to do the thing I wanted.</p><p>He murmured sweetly to my ass cheeks, \u201cYou liked watching me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d His breath caressed my skin.</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his finger inside my pussy. I cried out into the carpet as he thrust, pumping his fingers in and out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stopped just as I was about to orgasm.</p><p>\u201cYou liked watching me fuck her. Say it.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head but I couldn\u2019t speak. The sounds that threatened to leave my lips, were not words.</p> <p>Sweat started to form on my brow.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to let you cum, Evie?\u201d</p><p>I trembled, near tears but never spoke a word.</p><p>\u201cThen, you say it.\u201d His voice was no longer a whisper in the dark. He was commanding me.</p><p>My weakened voice quivered when I tried to speak, \u201cN-n-no.\u201d</p> <p>He slowly dragged his fingers from me, but when he was just at my opening, he thrust back in. He held them there momentarily before repeating. On the third time I shouted, \u201cI LIKED IT! FUCK YOU! I FUCKING HATE YOU!\u201d</p><p>His hand instantly picked up in speed. He inserted a second finger, stretching me and pumping rhythmically. I gripped the shag carpet, crying into it as my entire body went pins and needles, and then burst into orgasmic flames. Beads of sweat covered every inch of me. He pumped until the twitching stopped. I was about to sigh and possibly cry a little, when he lifted me off the floor, flipping me over. He laid me on the billiards table, spreading my legs and burying his face between them.</p><p>He licked my swollen slit in flicks and sucks, starts and stops. I felt his tongue enter me as his fingers rubbed my clit. He sat up, slapping my pussy a few times softly. I was startled by it at first, but then the vibration was nice, I had no idea.</p><p>Just as I was getting into the groove of the soft slaps, he would replace his hand with his mouth, and begin the licking again. I could feel the second orgasm building as he flipped me over, dragging me back down so I was bent over the table. My feet barely touched the ground. He slapped my ass hard. My legs being spread as far as they were, made the vibration tingle everywhere.</p><p>I gasped as he crawled a hand up my back, nestling it at the base of my head, and pulled my hair. He lifted my head up and spanked again. I cried out. I wanted it to be a cry from pain but it was not.</p><p>\u201cYou going to let that little fucker touch you again?\u201d he asked menacingly.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what he meant. \u201cThe fat man?\u201d Who else had touched me?</p><p>He spanked and pulled harder, \u201cThat young man.\u201d</p><p>Coop.</p><p>I shook my head, struggling against the hair pulling, \u201cHe never touched me.\u201d</p><p>I heard his belt rustle, making my eyes bug out. Was he going to whip me with the belt?</p><p>Instead of a lash, his cock entered me hard.</p><p>His hand left my head and planted on my hips. He gripped my skin, like he had hers. He pulled my ass back, fucking me.</p><p>He reached forward amid thrusts and rubbed between my legs, circling my clit.</p> <p>The felt of the table scratched against my cheeks and palms. The sound left my lips, like it did hers. I could see him, thrusting into her the way he had done to me. I came again, seeing her feet in the air and his strong ass flexing. His thrusts had slowed to make my orgasm deliciously paced.</p><p>Flipping me on my back again, he grabbed my ankles and placed them on the same spot hers were.</p><p>I didn\u2019t notice until his cock was buried deep inside of me. I tried to kick away but he held me there. Only when he had filled me with his orgasm, could I tell the difference between what he done to her and what he had done to me. He cried out, making a sound I hadn\u2019t heard in the room with her, but that I recalled from the hotel.</p><p>He slapped against me one last time and collapsed on top of me, forcing my legs apart again. I wrapped them around him as he breathed into my breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou set me up,\u201d I whispered into the heavy, dank air of the giant room, we had somehow managed to pollute with our filth.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI didn\u2019t force you to like it though.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my belly and stood up, \u201cI need you to hate me, Evie.\u201d</p><p>He left the room and I didn\u2019t feel afraid of him anymore.</p><p>I showered in a spare room and found a smaller room to sleep in.</p><p>When I woke, I looked around the room for something to put on. The other clothes felt wrong, on a bunch of different levels.</p><p>I wrapped in a blanket and made my way back to his room. I could see his foot sticking out of the covers. I snuck into the closet and stole a pair of shorts for jogging and a t-shirt. His clothes hung off me, like they would a kid. I left the blanket in the closet and made my run for the door.</p><p>I found the kitchen from the smell in the halls. It was waffles. My mouth watered.</p><p>A small man in a chef\u2019s outfit grinned at me, \u201cYou hungry?\u201d he asked through a thick French accent.</p><p>I nodded and sat at the breakfast table.</p><p>Everything was oversized, marble, and expensive. His house was like something out of a magazine, including the chef.</p><p>He brought me a coffee and a plate of fruit.</p><p>I looked at the fruit and then back at the kitchen. \u201cCan I have some of the waffles?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say, he was like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld. He was holding out on the waffles, until he was ready to give them to me.</p><p>I picked up a chocolate covered strawberry and bit down. I was starving.</p><p>The coffee was perfect. I stirred the cream in and sipped. Even with the strawberry taste in my mouth, it was oh-my-God good. My kids would love this house. I wondered what the cost of the chef was? I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, if I had enough money in James\u2019 sneaky-whore account to have a chef or even a house like this?</p><p>I picked the newspaper up off the table, where it was no doubt placed for him, and gasped when I saw the front page.</p><p>\u201cPRIVATE JET CRASHES ON MOUNT WASHINGTON\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you reading my newspaper?\u201d Servario interrupted my reading.</p><p>I didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cA jet crashed on Mount Washington, after taking off from Boston,\u201d I muttered. I paused a moment, as I thought about how possible it was that was Fitz. I felt the burning in my eyes, \u201cDid you do this?\u201d</p><p>He looked confused, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFitz left Boston after dropping everyone else off. He was in a private jet; did you kill him? Is this his jet?\u201d</p><p>He sat and shook his head, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know whose jet that was. What am I psychic?\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, \u201cFine.\u201d I stood up and walked away. I could tell he was lying to me.</p><p>\u201cAre those my clothes?\u201d he asked after me.</p><p>I spun around, feeling sickening anger at the possibility that Uncle Fitz might have been in a plane crash. \u201cI\u2019m done with this. This sick, twisted version of playing house with you. Last night was really fun and I have to admit surprising. I have new things to talk to my shrink about now; that\u2019s always good. But I am done. You either level with me, or I am walking out the front door, and I will kill whoever decides to get in my way.\u201d</p><p>He grins at me, \u201cYou feel that confident in your abilities?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, \u201cNo. I feel that confident in my anger at the things that happened last night.\u201d</p><p>He watched me and then sighed, \u201cCome and sit and eat breakfast. Pierre makes an incredible Belgian waffle.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to the counter and stole a waffle from the steaming plate of them Pierre was plating. I walked away, \u201cScrew you, Servario. I\u2019ll leave you two alone. Thanks for the waffle, Pierre.\u201d</p><p>I nearly ran to the room where I had slept and grabbed my clutch. I left the room, but he was right there, \u201cThat was incredibly rude and I\u2019ve asked you repeatedly not to swear.\u201d</p><p>I looked up into his stormy expression and chewed the stolen waffle, \u201cYou\u2019re right. These are the best.\u201d</p><p>His mood didn\u2019t improve, \u201cIf I tell you what I know, will you stay?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cNo. I\u2019m here because my vagina wants to be. I need to focus on my kids. You need me to hate you\u2014well, you know what? The feeling is mutual.\u201d</p><p>A grin toyed with his lips, \u201cYou say that word with no apprehension. I find that odd. You are too forward with the things you\u2019ll say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat word?\u201d Had I sworn again?</p><p>\u201cVagina.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my clutch and snickered, \u201cOne of my kids got stuck in there for like twelve hours, before the doctors figured it out. I had been in labor for thirty-nine hours, before I got a cesarean section. I pushed for two hours and got two\u2014yes two hemorrhoids, hence the reason I won\u2019t ever have anal sex. I have a deep amount of comfort with the lower half of my body because of it all. I recovered with mineral baths, Epsom salts, and rectal suppositories. I didn\u2019t have sex comfortably for one whole year, and even then, it was annoying. Yet, I still had another baby. The second was much easier. I just booked the surgery and out she came. Then on top of all of that, I breastfed both my kids the full recommended eighteen month minimum, earning me horrid looks from everyone, even other women. I was the pervy hippie who breastfed for too long.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he might get sick.</p><p>I nodded, \u201cAnd voila, you no longer see me as a sexual object you get to toy with.\u201d I stood on my tiptoes, dragging his cheek down to my level, \u201cThank you for making me feel things I haven\u2019t felt in a long time, shame and perversion included.\u201d I brushed my lips against his rough cheek and walked past him. I knew he was still stuck in the hemorrhoid story. That truly was a cock blocker.</p><p>\u201cSay goodbye to Steve and foxy Roxy for me,\u201d I looked back and walked to the foyer, then strolled out the front door. I had zero idea where I was, but the good thing about iPhones was the map. I decided to steal his iPhone. I didn\u2019t even care if he tracked me down. I was never letting him in my panties again.</p><p>\u201cDirty bastard.\u201d I muttered, and turned the phone on as I walked to the gate. It didn\u2019t open. I sighed and looked back. Servario was walking down the very, long driveway.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d My clutch vibrated at the same time he shouted something at me. I ignored Servario and took the FaceTime call. It was Coop, not Jack.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem.\u201d</p><p>I could see the seriousness on his face, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and pinched between his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat, Coop?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and shook his head, \u201cThe protection team has gone missing. They have hourly check-ins with someone, and it\u2019s been five hours since a check-in has happened.\u201d</p><p>My breath was stolen. I shook my head, \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, \u201cI know. Your mom, more than likely, got the kids away, but...I still want to know. We need to figure out what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>It was my worst-case scenario. There was nothing I could do, from where I stood. \u201cI need to find them. Come get me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and the call ended.</p><p>I turned and looked at the gate; there was no way I was climbing over it.</p><p>I turned my back and waited for Servario to hurry up and come drag me back. The defeat and fear were all consuming. How could I find my family, if he was holding me captive?</p> <p>Servario chuckled, \u201cYou\u2019re taking my clothes again. I think you\u2019ve forgotten the deal we have about you taking the things I bought you.\u201d</p><p>I looked down, grinning, hiding the terror I was feeling. I shook my head, \u201cYou didn\u2019t buy this for me. I stole it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing. It\u2019s mine. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>I fought the tears in my throat, \u201cFine, have them back but I\u2019m not yours.\u201d</p><p>I pulled down the shorts, luckily the shirt was long enough to cover my bare ass. I noticed a guard in the guardhouse across the huge driveway. He looked confused.</p><p>Servario shouted at him, \u201cTake a break and turn off the cameras!\u201d</p> <p>The guard closed the blinds.</p><p>I bit my lip and lifted the shirt up. It was pulled down hard and fast, dragged against my skin. His huge hands pinned it to my sides, \u201cStop that,\u201d he scolded.</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cYou are distracting me on purpose. I see it now. Your role in this, from the beginning was to distract me. Tell me the truth. My kids are missing. You tell me the God damned truth.\u201d I was shaking from the bad things rolling through my mind.</p><p>I stared at the massive wrought-iron gate that dwarfed even him.</p><p>His words came slowly, \u201cYou were so wrapped up in them at first, it was so easy. You missed so many things, running here and there and everywhere with the kids. Then you got bored. I was scared you would see the truth then. I was about to intervene, when you found hot yoga.\u201d</p><p>I turned to face him, shoving him, \u201cARE YOU HIGH? WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH MY KIDS?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of my head, looking grim, \u201cThe secret must be kept at all costs.\u201d</p><p>It hit me like a ton bricks in the head, \u201cYou\u2019re the Master Key...\u201d The words left my dry mouth. I felt him nod against the top of my head, \u201cWho better, than a man suspected of a thousand bad things.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen \u2013 Why mommy, what BIG shoes you have!</p><p>We hadn\u2019t spoken in hours.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t answer a single question or tell me where we were going, so it didn\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t want to talk, unless it was Q&amp;A time, anyway.</p><p>My foot tapping was getting on his nerves, I could tell.</p><p>I looked down at the outfit I was wearing and shook my head, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have normal clothes for women on the jet?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a sideways look, \u201cYou\u2019re the only normal girl, ever to come on here. You could have stayed in the other outfit. Lord knows, all you care about is comfort.\u201d His tone was mocking.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cYes, maybe you could have found me a piece of cord to hold the shorts up. Look, I don\u2019t dress like I\u2019m homeless, all the time.\u201d</p><p>He coughed, \u201cYou aren\u2019t exactly a sex kitten either.\u201d</p><p>I glared, \u201cThe other outfit would have suited the house slippers of yours I stole.\u201d</p><p>He gave me another look, \u201cYou make sure those get back to the house. They were a gift from my mother.\u201d</p><p>I sneered, \u201cYou have a problem.\u201d</p><p>He looked hurt, \u201cWhat? My mother bought them for me.\u201d</p><p>I tapped my heel and tried not to look down at the sexy heel, or think about the fact they were spiciest shoes, I\u2019d ever donned. I wished the tight pants were half as comfortable, but they cut into my slight mommy tummy fiercely.</p><p>Steve looked back at me, \u201cFor the love of God and all things holy, stop tapping your damned foot.\u201d</p><p>I scowled, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Servario snorted, \u201cWe land in eight minutes, children. Shut it.\u201d</p><p>Steve scowled and turned back around.</p><p>I wanted to tap louder. My nerves were on fire. I needed to hold my babies.</p><p>I distracted myself with a question, I assumed he would actually answer, \u201cWhy are we always flying? Is this really how you live?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, \u201cWe need to keep moving. I can\u2019t afford a mistake right now.\u201d And that was it.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him, \u201cFine, be aloof.\u201d</p><p>We landed and I forced Steve and Servario to run to the car. Well, as fast as my heels would go. The salty smell of the Boston harbor made me relax a bit.</p><p>I watched out the window as we drove to wherever we were going.</p><p>\u201cSo you called young Cooper and explained we would meet them tomorrow?\u201d he asked distractedly.</p><p>I nodded, \u201cI gave them my word, that you meant them no harm and were not working with the military or government; I told them you just wanted the Burrow.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cHave I ever worked with them? I like nothing better, than to watch them squirm.\u201d</p><p>My stress levels were too high. I didn\u2019t want to listen to him speak, but I needed answers, \u201cWhere are my children?\u201d I pestered again.</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not in the position to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>I growled, \u201cNo one is ever in the position to tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow, \u201cDo you know much about your mother, Evie?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and looked back out the window.</p><p>He laughed, \u201cYou do know. I was wondering, when they would let it spill. Now that you know, I can tell you, your children are safe. I can also tell you, no one would care for them the way your mother will.\u201d His eyes sparkled, \u201cShe has kept you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my mother?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I felt sick. An arms dealer, who was secretly the Master Key for the covert op my father had dedicated his life to, knew my family better than I did.</p><p>\u201cIs my sister safe?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cNever. She is a walking disaster.\u201d</p><p>What didn\u2019t he know?</p><p>The car stopped in a neighborhood I didn\u2019t recognize. The houses were smaller and older. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t really look like your type of neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a blank stare, \u201cThey\u2019re inside, smartass.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, \u201cHow do you do it? How do you know everything?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, \u201cI know people, who know things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I crossed my arms and got comfy in the seat.</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cGo inside and tell them to hurry up. We have ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>I noticed the darkness of his eyes; they were missing the green altogether.</p><p>I unbuckled my seat belt and crawled across the seat to him, climbing onto his lap and straddling him. I lowered my face and licked along his neck to his ear. I bit down on his lobe. He was a sex addict, there was no doubt taunting him would get me information. I ground my pelvis into his and sucked his lobe, \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>His hands roamed my back, settling on my hips where he gripped me hard. I made my way, kissing and sucking, to his cheek and placed feather-light kisses on either side of his face. \"If you tell me what you know, things between us could be different,\" I muttered and brushed my lips against his.</p><p>He was frozen, either terrified or about to attack.</p><p>I kissed him once more, \u201cYou want me to play along next time, Servario? You want me to suck things? Bite things?\u201d I leaned to the other side and whispered into his other ear, \u201cStroke things?\u201d</p><p>He shifted us both, nestling his erection between my legs better.</p><p>I sat back, grinning ear from ear, \u201cMaybe you want me to put on a show for you? Let you pick the outfit, the shoes, and the toys?\u201d I bit my lip.</p><p>He swallowed; the darkness had overtaken his eyes in a dangerous way.</p><p>\"We'll see,\" I muttered and opened his door, climbing off of him and walking up to the house.</p><p>I winced at the thought of him forcing any of that.</p><p>If ever there was a bluff, that was it. I didn\u2019t have a show or any sexual talents. I could cum and hold my legs up. James wasn\u2019t seeking it elsewhere, because I was too much in the sheets.</p><p>I just prayed Servario didn\u2019t know that yet. The terrible blowjob I\u2019d given him in the shower, might have ruined my chances at seducing him. But I was willing to try. I needed him hard, weak, and under my spell. I just needed to learn how to cast one first.</p><p>Luce opened the door to the dingy house, looking confused and cautious. \u201cHow the hell are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cHe must have known you took the phone and bugged it. He\u2019s onto your every move. He\u2019s a savage stalker.\u201d</p><p>I could hear Servario walking up behind me on the gravel driveway, \u201cExcept fleeing the hotel. I wasn\u2019t aware you would actually do any of that, not naked anyway,\" he said flatly.</p><p>I looked back at him and noticed he was walking funny. Luce looked down at his groin and nodded, \u201cWelcome to casa del dumpo.\u201d</p><p>We entered and instantly, I was hit with the smell of fried food. Servario looked like he might throw up. I felt like I might.</p><p>Coop came around the corner with a gun out, \u201cWhat the fuck? You said we were meeting tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Servario sighed, \u201cYes well, that was for the benefit of the government agents tracking you with those cell phones you buy illegally. Please feel free to leave those here. We need to hurry. We have four minutes before they\u2019re here. I wanted them to think that we were picking you up tomorrow. They aren\u2019t as smart as they think they are.\u201d</p><p>I looked back, \u201cIt was ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cThat was before your display in the car. Let\u2019s move.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned his back on Coop, who was still pointing his weapon on him.</p><p>Coop shook his head, \u201cYou played right into his hands, Evie.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, \u201cHe\u2019s all we\u2019ve got right now. I need to find my kids.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell them, he was the Master Key.</p> <p>Servario shook his head with his hand over his face, \u201cWell, that\u2019s all the poverty I can take. Let\u2019s, shall we.\u201d He pointed at the doorway. When Coop didn\u2019t speak Servario turned and left with Luce following him. She smiled back, \u201cHe\u2019s sexy. I\u2019m game. It\u2019s better than this shit hole.\u201d</p><p>I scowled at the dingy insides, \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>Jack came out with a plate of food, \u201cMy old roommate\u2019s mom\u2019s house. She died and he travels a lot, so he hasn\u2019t sold it yet. He isn\u2019t here. He\u2019s in Thailand. He said we could stay, and apparently, he\u2019s rented the basement out to a nice couple of chubby people with their own deep-fry machine. It\u2019s in the house. She made this fish and chips right downstairs.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and stole a fry, \u201cThose have been around since before you were born, whippersnapper.\u201d</p><p>He beamed, \u201cI\u2019m getting my mom to buy one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou eat whatever you want and stay skinny, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Jack laughed and took the plate of food to the car. He sat up front.</p><p>I looked at Coop with the gun in his hands still, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He holstered it and sighed, \u201cThis is a mistake. Later when he sells us down the river, you remember I said this was a mistake, and that you were thinking with your dick.\u201d</p><p>I closed the door behind him, \u201cI will. Don\u2019t worry, I already have my apology planned out. Have you heard anything about the kids and my mom?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>I almost sobbed a tiny bit. He walked with me out to the car, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cI hardly know. I need my kids.\u201d I didn\u2019t trust Servario\u2019s word that they were fine. Not yet.</p><p>He looked concerned, as he squished into the back seat. I sat up front with Jack and made him share his food.</p><p>\u201cGood God, I wish we had brought a larger vehicle. That stinks. Please throw it out the window,\u201d Servario asked, sounding snooty. He clearly had never had to stuff a bunch of people into a car before.</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cNo. Steve\u2019s eating some now too.\u201d</p><p>Servario opened his window and made a sighing noise.</p><p>\u201cIs the tartar sauce homemade too?\u201d Steve asked with a big mouthful.</p><p>Jack nodded, \u201cYes. I watched her make it, while the fish was frying. Amazing woman.\u201d</p> <p>Coop snorted, \u201cSize of a damned Buick, you mean.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked back, \u201cYou hush your mouth. That woman was a chubby angel. She made me homemade donuts yesterday. I\u2019m marrying a chubby woman. I decided this just yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and dragged a fry through the fatty-mayonnaise tartar sauce, \u201cNever trust a skinny cook.\u201d</p><p>Steve glanced at me, \u201cI thought you were a good cook.\u201d</p><p>I beamed, \u201cAre you calling me skinny?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYou are skinny. Don\u2019t be one of those skinny girls, who doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s skinny.\u201d</p><p>I gave Coop a death stare, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help when people call you fat, all the time.\u201d</p><p>Coop looked less than impressed, \u201cI never said you were fat. I said lazy and old.\u201d</p><p>The same homicidal look I usually had on my face when I was with him, appeared. I turned around, crossing my arms.</p><p>Servario muttered, \u201cSay something rude like that again, and I won\u2019t need to leak your location.\u201d</p><p>Coop laughed. I glanced back at him, \u201cYeah. Look who has the arms dealer on her side? This old, lazy bitch, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Coop\u2019s eyes gleamed with the things he wanted to say. He gave me a grin and a wink instead. I shook my head and turned around; it wasn\u2019t the response I was expecting.</p><p>We drove out of the city to a small, private airport.</p><p>Steve parked the car and walked ahead. I climbed out and followed him. Servario hurried along, \u201cHurry. They\u2019re close behind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Coop asked running for the plane. I cursed my choosing the sexy Christian Louboutin platform, patent-leather jade-colored pumps. They were so pretty. I was never parting with them. I forced Servario to give Roxy money, so she would stop complaining when I tried them on.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a Bratz doll,\u201d Luce said with a smile.</p><p>I laughed, \u201cHis planes have clothes on them. They\u2019re all designer and amazing. It\u2019s a fun distraction.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up, \u201cWhat sizes?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, \u201cFours and a couple things in six. Shoes are all size seven. I can squeak into the fours, if I don\u2019t eat or breathe.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose, \u201cI\u2019m a six for sure, but I can definitely fit the shoes.\u201d</p><p>I whispered, \u201cYou have to sneak them past Roxy. That girl has a problem.\u201d</p><p>We were all huffing when we boarded. Everyone put on seat belts as the jet took off.</p><p>I glanced at Servario, whispering, \u201cHow did you know they were coming?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI have a friend. He keeps tabs on CI, CIA, MI6, the UN, and Homeland Security. Thus far, they don\u2019t know we have them.\u201d He looked at Coop, Jack, and Luce sitting up a few rows from us with Steve. \u201cThey just think I have you for all the fun I can handle.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cThey sold you to me for information. James found documents linking me to the Burrow. It\u2019s what I have been terrified, you would find. I don\u2019t know how James did it. The man was a bumbling idiot. But, even a broken watch is right twice a day.\u201d</p><p>I gulped, \u201cThey knew you were asking for me for sexual purposes?\u201d Horror was smeared across my face. \u201cWhy not just kill me? Why do that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuring your dad.\u201d He gave me a stern look, \u201cThe only stipulation was the fat man and Derringer. CI wanted something on you, something they could lure your father with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey told you that?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNo. I know because of sources.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, still whispering, \u201cCI knows he\u2019s alive?\u201d I\u2019d barely had time to register it myself.</p><p>\u201cYes. It was in the documentation James must have found. You must have had something at your house, something that linked me and your father to the Burrow. Information that was from after he had died. I played along and said I had been working your dad over all along, because I had to have the Burrow. I acted like I was willing to do anything to get it. They wanted to make your life so hard, that your dad would be forced out of hiding. They were trying to frame you for a variety of things. Mob ties and other unsavory things. Prostitutes and murderesses lose their children.\u201d</p><p>I gasped, \u201cYou let them humiliate and frame me?\u201d</p><p>He laughed so quietly, I barely caught it. He shook his head again, \u201cNo. I only let them humiliate you. I own the casino and the hotel. I would have faked the recording, before I let them frame you. You ran when I was trying to help you. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t have to. You are a bit of a genius when it comes to spy work.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Coop and shook my head, \u201cNo. It was them. They set it up perfectly.\u201d I looked back at him, \u201cYou still let everyone believe you were having sex with me, against my will. How could you do that? And why did they believe you wanted the Burrow so badly?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look, \u201cReally? I\u2019m a gunrunner, Evie. I always want anything to do with weaponry. Your pride is nothing, compared to the secrets I keep. I\u2019m sorry you were embarrassed to be with me. Now you know how I manage. But if it makes you feel better, I also told them that I wanted you, because I wanted to avenge the death of my father, more than anything.\u201d</p><p>My brow knit, \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and whispered, \u201cI told them I wanted to work out a few weeks of fun with the daughter of the man, who had destroyed my family. Your running, only made me look like a monster. I suppose I owe you a thanks for keeping up my appearances.\u201d</p><p>My insides started to tingle, \u201cMy dad killed your dad?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look, \u201cIt was the bitter end of the Cold War and the Star Wars were out of control; everyone\u2019s dads were murdering someone. Mine caught wind of the Burrow. He wanted it. Your father, being the Master Key, was dispensed to remove the interest in the Burrow. It\u2019s our job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cDon\u2019t be. Your dad saved my life. I was eighteen and on CI\u2019s payroll, not to mention, given the freedom and finances to do whatever the hell I wanted. I ran the family business the same as I always had, to avoid suspicions. Only I didn\u2019t have to worry, the way my father did. I was given resources. I was able to develop the business and make my family more money, than we could ever spend.\u201d</p><p>I pointed at his face, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a bit of arrogance in your teeth.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cYou Americans have a saying for that... don\u2019t hate the player, hate the game.\u201d</p><p>A sickening amount of disgust was filling me, as I processed the fact he\u2019d told me such nice things, and yet, had bargained to have me.</p><p>The jet hit cruising altitude and Coop was out of his seat and back with us, within seconds. He knelt in the seat in front of me, looking us both over, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>Servario sighed.</p><p>I nodded, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like swearing, unless it\u2019s referring to sex.\u201d</p><p>Coop rolled his eyes, \u201cI care about the terrorist\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>Servario\u2019s gaze lowered, \u201cI am not a terrorist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArms dealer... terrorist... same shit, different pile of shit.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \u201cWow, this could be fun but let\u2019s not do this. Not on a plane.\u201d</p><p>Coop tilted his head, \u201cYour call.\u201d</p><p>Servario scoffed, \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with my cock\u2019s size and how far it can piss, Cooper.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Coop\u2019s look didn\u2019t improve. His steel-blue eyes didn\u2019t get less intense, and his jaw didn\u2019t ease up on its clench. He looked ready to go.</p><p>I put a hand on his arm, \u201cWhen we land, we will talk about it. Right now, we need to remember that none of us can win this alone.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and placed a hand over mine, holding it to his arm. He squeezed, \u201cKeep telling yourself that it\u2019s all going to work out, and that he doesn\u2019t have an ulterior motive. It\u2019ll make banging him, that much easier.\u201d</p> <p>Servario growled.</p><p>Coop got up and left for the seats at the front.</p><p>I swallowed and looked at Servario, \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be able to bother you, if fucking me was the only thing you and I had going.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look, but I couldn\u2019t see the answers on his face.</p><p>Then something else occurred to me. \u201cWhy did you actually make me have sex with you? I get that you lied about wanting revenge for your father\u2019s death to appease the CI and CIA, but you didn\u2019t have to actually do it. You could have just taken me to the hotel and made me kill the fat man, and that would have been the end of it. Or we could have run from the beginning, like we\u2019ve been doing. You could have told me the truth.\u201d</p> <p>He smirked, \u201cEvie, I wasn\u2019t lying to them; I wanted you. Not to mention, I needed to keep up the fa\u00e7ade of sex-addicted arms dealer.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cYou are addicted to sex. I can tell. I think you did all of this to use me, even if it was just a little. You haven\u2019t told me anything, or utilized the time we had to help me, or my father.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows, \u201cNo, I utilized it to fuck you, a lot. I\u2019ve always wanted to have sex with you. Well, before you were married. With James you were so sad and lonely. I saw you before, when you were twenty-one. You were full of life and excitement, and piss and vinegar. I didn\u2019t know that girl was gone, until I saw you about six months ago, when I discovered James had knowledge of the Burrow. I started watching you the same time this lot did.\u201d He nodded towards Coop and continued, \u201cWhen James died you seemed even worse, until you found out about the affairs. That\u2019s when I saw it. There it was\u2014a tiny spark of the girl who was once there. She resurfaced for a moment and I knew she wasn\u2019t lost, only buried in your sad existence.\u201d</p><p>The tingle in my belly grew, \u201cYou made me have sex with you for fun?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, \u201cI didn\u2019t make you do anything. You did it all on your own. I needed to keep up my reputation, and I needed it to be hard on you, or they would have suspected something. Guys like me don\u2019t fall for or help girls like you. You wanted everything we did.\u201d</p><p>I shook, \u201cNo. I did it because I thought I had to. You scared the hell out of me. You made me kill someone. We could have run. I thought I needed to keep my children safe. I thought I was...oh my God.\u201d I unbuckled and walked to the back of the plane. I closed the door to the bathroom and sat on the toilet.</p> <p>I did it, because I wanted to. I wanted him. I was an idiot and slowly becoming a ho.</p><p>I shook my head. There was no room left for the things still floating outside, waiting to be dealt with.</p><p>My throat got thick. I turned and threw up lunch from the plane ride to Boston.</p><p>I flushed and washed my face and fled for the safety of the dressing closet.</p><p>I sat there, dumbfounded, until Luce came into the back.</p><p>\u201cThis it?\u201d she asked, already pulling her shirt off.</p><p>I laughed because it was better than crying.</p><p>She started pulling things on. Her tight, fit body was leaner than I thought.</p> <p>She fit the four perfectly.</p><p>She made a face at the tightness and plucked at it, \u201cSee, too tight.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to fit.\u201d</p><p>She looked at it and wrinkled her nose.</p><p>Roxy pulled back the curtain. Her expression was fierce for thirty seconds until she clapped, \u201cMakeover!\u201d</p><p>I laughed and Luce moaned.</p><p>Roxy pointed, whispering savagely, \u201cYou bitches want to try on my clothes and steal my shoes. Then I get to make over the lesbian.\u201d</p><p>Luce looked wounded, \u201cI\u2019m not gay.\u201d</p><p>I laughed harder and got a better seat for the show.</p><p>Roxy nodded, \u201cYes, you are. You just didn\u2019t realize it yet. Here, feel these.\u201d She grabbed Luce\u2019s hand and placed it on her perky breast. Luce shook her head and attempted to pull her hand back, \u201cNo... no... this is wrong. Please, don\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>Roxy frowned, \u201cI have very nice breasts. Lesbians always like them.\u201d</p><p>Luce looked at me, pleading for help with her eyes. I shrugged, \u201cI seriously thought you were gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d Roxy started massaging her own breasts with more vigor, of course still using Luce\u2019s hand.</p><p>Luce scowled, \u201cYou guys suck. I had a boyfriend named Lance, up until three weeks ago. I\u2019m not gay.\u201d</p><p>Roxy and I burst out laughing, \u201cLance is such a gay name. He\u2019s a closet gay too.\u201d</p><p>Jack walked into the back room grinning, \u201cI suspected this was what the girls change room looked like. One girl watching, while the other two made out.\u201d</p><p>I threw a tissue box at him. He laughed and ducked back out. He folded his arms, staying in the entryway.</p><p>Roxy closed the curtain, \u201cNo. You can\u2019t see her, not till we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms around myself and hugged, holding me together.</p><p>Roxy set to work. I felt myself withdraw from them. They chatted and laughed. I didn\u2019t have it in me.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Luce and smiled, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Roxy shook her head, \u201cI tried to warn you. He\u2019s a pig.\u201d</p><p>My smile grew, \u201cHe is. I like him, I don\u2019t know why. I can\u2019t make myself hate him. He\u2019s lied from the start, hidden my children away from me, used me.\u201d The last part of the sentence was nearly silent. I didn\u2019t want to face that part because he was right when he said, I let him do it all. I wanted it and him.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even worried about my children, not properly.</p><p>Roxy vanished through the curtain and came back with a fishbowl-sized glass of wine.</p><p>I smelled it, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I sipped and looked down into it, like it was a magic crystal ball and would tell me my future.</p><p>Sighing, I drank and watched as Roxy made Luce, into something I never imagined possible, delicate.</p><p>She wore an asymmetrical navy Marc Jacob\u2019s dress that hit mid-calf and had only one arm. The line of the dress ran across her tight and perky chest. She had cleavage and even a little side boob with the bare arm and shoulder. She lifted her delicate-looking foot with the Jimmy Choo glittery platform sandal and shook her head, \u201cThey look and feel like ankle boots, but they\u2019re sandals. They\u2019re really comfy.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s because they cost a grand, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>Roxy nodded, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s about the price. The lace-looking shoe is what makes it a sandal, but the lace coming all the way up to your ankle, gives you the sturdiness of boots. Jimmy Choo is a genius.\u201d She handed her a small, blue Coach shoulder bag and I marveled.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing.\u201d</p><p>Luce smiled at me, \u201cI look pretty.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the response I expected from her.</p><p>I nodded, \u201cRoxy, you have done an amazing thing here.\u201d</p><p>She beamed and clapped again, \u201cI love it!\u201d</p><p>Luce took my hand as I put down the empty fish bowl. I could feel the bottle of wine I\u2019d drank. We walked out to the front of the plane.</p><p>Servario looked back, taking a double take.</p><p>Coop\u2019s jaw hung open and Jack dropped his iPad onto the floor.</p><p>Steve looked over and grinned. He looked hungry.</p><p>Luce\u2019s dark eyes were smoky and sexy. She looked almost Egyptian with the makeup.</p><p>Her dark hair, that I had imagined was short, was actually very long. It hung in a side ponytail over the bare arm in tendrils and small curls. Her lips were red, Russian Red.</p><p>Her nails were navy to match the dress but tipped with stark white, also matching the trim of the dress. The hem and neckline were lined with stark white. The navy and white almost had a mariner look to it.</p><p>She was a model with her tanned, tight skin and zero body fat. The curve of her arm was still thicker, but in a lean and sexy curve.</p><p>She made Roxy look plain, which was a feat.</p><p>Servario turned back around, \u201cWe land in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>Luce looked down, blushing. The other three men were still standing and staring.</p><p>Coop closed his mouth, \u201cYou look hot.\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded, \u201cToo hot.\u201d</p><p>I went to my seat and buckled in.</p><p>Luce walked to hers and instantly Jack was sitting next to her. Steve sat on the other side.</p><p>Luce shook her head, \u201cThere are plenty of other seats, you two scram.\u201d</p><p>Steve got up, but Jack stayed.</p><p>Steve sat in his regular chair. I looked down and tried to focus my eyes. I was drunk.</p><p>Servario didn\u2019t talk to me. I was stewing inside.</p><p>I glanced over at him, \u201cAre you trying to push me away still? Is that why you said those things to me?\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his laptop, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I whispered, \u201cAre you trying to push me away? Is that why you said that?\u201d</p><p>He looked confused, \u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>I felt disgust slither down my throat, \u201cYou just wanted sex?\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips, \u201cNo. I had to protect myself, and I couldn\u2019t let anything happen to you. Your father saved me once, I owed him that. I had to keep you and your children safe. Pretending to be interested in the Burrow and you, made it possible for me to protect you and not risk myself. Yes, I risked your reputation but that was the cost. There is always cost with me, Evie. I did try to warn you... As far as the sex was concerned, it was an added bonus. You wanted it too. It had been ages for you; you seemed receptive to it.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t fight the fury making its way to my face, \u201cI have a hard time believing you went to that effort to fuck me. Why me? Why not just the whore from your room?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugged, \u201cI told you, I had always wanted to, and then after seeing you so angry and desperate, I knew you would be into some fun.\u201d</p><p>I almost gagged, \u201cWhat about the bank accounts, and the payroll, and the money James had left behind?\u201d</p><p>He pointed at the computer, \u201cIt\u2019s there for you and your children. You may have it, if and when, I am safely back to being a scummy arms dealer, and you are back to being the prudish mother you were.\u201d</p> <p>I looked forward, \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>He looked grave, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I felt sick, \u201cYou said I was yours.\u201d</p> <p>He gave me a grim smile, \u201cI said a lot of things to get in your pants.

It\u2019s more fun if you give yourself to me, than if I am forced to take what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you let us live?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrow as he thought on the answer, but never spoke.</p><p>I unbuckled my seatbelt, needing to be away from him.</p><p>I walked to the front of the plane and sat next to Jack. I buckled my belt and tried not to think about how sick it all was\u2014how sick Servario was.</p><p>I needed to warn them that he was going to kill them, but I needed my kids more.</p> <p>Chapter Fifteen \u2013 Silent as the grave you promised me</p><p>When we landed it was dark and humid. I wasn\u2019t excited about the tight pants I was wearing in the heat. We walked to the limo waiting for us on the dusty tarmac. Looking back, the sleek, white jet and stretched, black limo looked out of place at the tiny rundown airport. I slumped into a seat and closed my eyes, blocking the world out.</p><p>We drove for what felt like an eternity. The limo bumped along the road, until we reached our destination and the vehicle came to a stop. I opened my eyes, seeing a look of worry on Coop\u2019s face. I nodded subtly.</p><p>The doors opened. My heart started to pick up pace as we got out into the damp heat. We were outside of a villa of sorts. There was a huge gate. As it opened Servario leaned in, \u201cYou will be sleeping in my room tonight.\u201d Chills ran up my spine.</p><p>We entered the courtyard of a beautifully lit home. Torches lit the way down the courtyard. \u201cThe way to the sea.\u201d Servario pointed.</p><p>The home was massive and every room was lit, making it warm and inviting. We walked into the house, greeted by a small woman in a maid\u2019s uniform.</p><p>Servario held his hand out to everyone, \u201cPick rooms in the wing to the right, shower and rest up. We leave again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Luce stepped out of the heels, \u201cNight.\u201d She walked down the hallway. Jack followed her but Coop watched me for a second.</p> <p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d</p><p>I glanced sideways at Servario speaking with Steve, and shook my head, \u201cYou know how us agents are, always thinking with our cocks.\u201d</p><p>He saw it. He knew what I meant. \u201cFuck,\u201d he mouthed and walked down the hall, \u201cNight, Evie.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cNight, Coop.\u201d</p><p>I was almost trembling when I looked at the men talking, \u201cWhich way to your room?\u201d</p><p>Servario pointed down the hall the opposite way my team went. I walked past his arm and headed for the room.</p><p>Of course it was ridiculous. It was oversized and lush. If I hadn\u2019t seen his cock I would assume he was trying to make up for things with the extravagance in his life. I closed the double door and found my way into the huge ensuite. I started a bubble bath and stripped down, tying my hair up. He had salts and bubbles and soaps, all in a dish. I climbed into the steamy tub, nearly moaning. The tub was an oversized, corner unit.</p><p>I closed my eyes and planned my next move. I would seduce him, tie him up maybe, and get them out. But was that risking my kids? Did he have them or did my mother or did he have them all? Where had Fitz gotten the private jet? Why was my father in hiding and did my mother know? What did I know for a fact?</p><p>Nothing. Everything was up in the air.</p><p>James might be alive, or not.</p><p>Servario might be the Master Key, or not. My team might be murdered, or not.</p><p>My kids might be safe, or not.</p><p>I might be kept alive, or not.</p><p>Nothing was left, nothing was a guarantee.</p><p>I heard a zipper and opened my eyes. Servario dropped his pants and pulled his shirt off. I closed my eyes, but he didn\u2019t have a shower like I thought he might. He stepped into my tub, pushing me over to a side, to accommodate him.</p><p>The water level rose, nearly touching the top of the tub.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked, not raising my voice.</p><p>\u201cI am enjoying my last night with you.\u201d</p><p>My stomach sunk. \u201cYou\u2019re going to murder me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer me. I opened my eyes, startled by the look on his face.</p><p>\u201cJust promise not to hurt my kids.\u201d The words weren\u2019t a plea. They were a demand. My life for theirs.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI will guard them with my life.\u201d</p><p>Tears leaked from my eyes, \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>His lip quivered as he mouthed something and I read his lips, \u201cThe secret must be kept. There is no price too high. No matter what it is, I will pay it to protect the world from the chaos it could bring.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak aloud in his own home? Were we ever safe? He was always mouthing and whispering. He was always silent, unless he was showboating his bad qualities. Then he was loud and slightly demented.</p><p>He turned on the loud jets as he picked up one of my feet and started to rub, \u201cTell me something you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, barely hearing what he\u2019d said, \u201cI like you. I don\u2019t know why, but when it\u2019s just you and me, and say, some bubbles or a bed, I like you.\u201d I spoke in the same low whisper he did.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cTell me something you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, \u201cI joined the mile-high club with you. I have never had sex on my jets, ever.\u201d</p><p>I laughed silently, still too-near tears for it to not sound like crying, \u201cDidn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could do anything in the world, for the next year, what would it be?\u201d</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>He chuckled murmuring, \u201cHumor me.\u201d</p><p>Arching an eyebrow, I spoke softly, after thinking for only a second, \u201cTake my kids to an ashram in Thailand and learn to be a Yogi. Let them homeschool for the year and run around on a private beach, like Swiss Family Robinson, only the Thai edition. Then I would rent a house in France and I would take them to museums and galleries, and the ruins of France. I would winter in the Alps and ski. And I would probably finish the year off in Australia, or Greece, or somewhere completely different. Maybe on a yacht.\u201d The words each brought a different flash of images, I could imagine every moment. I could see their faces.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI knew you were high maintenance, deep down.\u201d</p><p>I laughed bitterly, still leaking tears.</p><p>His eyes looked the same as mine, devastated.</p><p>\u201cWhat about after that? Would you go back to Boston?\u201d</p><p>I searched his face for where it was all going, \u201cYou mean if I could and be safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cI would. My kids are in an amazing school. They love their friends and sports. They excel in the things they do. I would go back. I would need a different house though, maybe neighborhood. James fucked some of the neighbors as well.\u201d</p><p>He coughed, \u201cThat man makes me look like a preacher.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a look, \u201cYeah, maybe one of the ones who they have to keep moving \u2018cause he is always in the paper for bad things.\u201d</p><p>He pinched my toes.</p><p>I pulled back my foot. He grabbed the other one and started to massage it.</p><p>\u201cEvie, if things were different and you were just a girl and I was just a guy, would you go to the Alps with me for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>The question hurt my insides. I shook my head, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI see.\u201d He paused, \u201cMay I ask why?\u201d</p><p>I blinked a tear down my cheek, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever forget the conversation we had on the plane.\u201d</p><p>A soft smile grew on his face, \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>We lay in silence until, finally, I stood up, dripping water on him, \u201cI need some sleep. Do you have some pajamas I can borrow?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNo, you may not wear any.\u201d</p><p>I climbed out and dried myself with, what was probably, the softest towel on the planet. The queen probably didn\u2019t have as nice of a towel. I walked naked to his bed and climbed in.</p><p>He got out and walked across the room in the dim light coming from the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cShould I sleep in the closet or are you not having company over tonight?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cYou stay right where you are.\u201d</p><p>My stomach tensed, \u201cGustavo, you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>He turned sharply, grinning, \u201cYou never call me that.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head, \u201cI should sleep in clothing. I just...I can\u2019t\u2014, not with you. Not ever again.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and fiddled with a drawer of things, \u201cAll I ask is for five minutes to persuade you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say no to me.\u201d He pointed at me and walked back across the room to turn off the light in the bathroom.</p><p>He climbed into the bed, dragging me across it to him. He wrapped himself around me and whispered in my ear, \u201cYou want to know my perfect year, assuming I had another one to live?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I was scared of him. Not the right kind of fear though. It was a fear he was going to break my heart, after only a week of knowing each other.</p><p>His words were breath only, tickling my ear, \u201cIt would start with spooning you for a whole night, like you deserve to be. Then I would do everything in my power to ensure your life was the way you wanted it to be. I would say that I would die for you, Evie, but that won\u2019t guarantee your safety. I would spend my whole year in your shadow, protecting you and earning the place I want to be in your heart. So that you would invite me for Christmas in the Alps.\u201d He kissed my cheek, \u201cI need one last show out of you tonight. Someone is watching me and I don\u2019t know who. Please, let me play bad guy. Can you do that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears were streaming down my face, I gave myself the moment and then shut it off. I turned to him, speaking loudly, \u201cYou have five minutes to make me want it. But you have to stop whispering that dirty shit in my ear.\u201d</p><p>I could see the glossiness of his eyes in the moonlight, filtering in when he nodded, \u201cI knew you\u2019d come around.\u201d</p><p>I woke hours later and looked over at him. He was sleeping still. I cuddled in and let everything he had said be more than it probably was.</p> <p>Flashes of the night before crept in my brain, making me blush. I\u2019d ridden him for the first time. It was amazing. My body was clenching just from remembering.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me sweat,\u201d he uttered, not opening his eyes.</p><p>I smiled, \u201cYou made me sweat last night.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, \u201cYou liked it.\u201d</p><p>I bit his arm lightly, \u201cYou liked it.\u201d</p> <p>He opened one very green eye, \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>His smile was infectious. I dragged my hands across his torso, \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ll see is Matilda has any raisin bran for you.\u201d</p><p>I swatted him and climbed off the bed. \u201cI want more of Pierre\u2019s waffles.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and watched me pull on clothes, I stole from his drawer, \u201cStop stealing my clothes and no more waffles for you. You aren\u2019t even allowed to come over anymore.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p> <p>I looked down at his shorts and black t-shirt, \u201cThese almost fit. Were you slimmer before?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cI called ahead a few days ago and asked Matilda to get you some of my clothes, from when I was a boy, out of the old bags. I was shoving them in there last night, when you were being rude to me.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms, \u201cHow am I so predictable to you? How do you guess my every move?\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkled, \u201cYou military people are all the same. You follow orders. I knew if I told you to do something, you would.\u201d</p><p>I snorted as I left the room in search of food.</p><p>I found Coop instead.</p><p>He gave me a grave look, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cYeah. We\u2019re fucked, but I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? What did he say?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and walked down the hall, \u201cNothing. That\u2019s the problem. He hasn\u2019t told me anything. He doesn\u2019t talk to me about James, or the Burrow, or anything. I told him whatever happens, to keep my kids safe and that\u2019s the only guarantee I\u2019ve gotten from him.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, \u201cMartin\u2019s team hasn\u2019t checked in since they went silent.\u201d</p><p>Worry snuck in, where I had told myself not to. I sighed, \u201cWhat can we do? Realistically, what are our options?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and led me to the bedroom where Luce and Jack were sitting on a huge bed.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Luce smiled. I could see the fear on her face. She looked like herself again, no makeup, or fancy clothes, or big hair. I pointed to their outfits, \u201cWhere\u2019d you get clothes from?\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged, \u201cThere were laid out already. The lady, who doesn\u2019t speak any of the languages I have tossed at her, did it.\u201d</p><p>I snorted, \u201cHow many do you speak, Jack?\u201d</p><p>He looked down, \u201cCounting Elvish and Klingon, nine.\u201d</p><p>I smirked and looked at Luce who was shaking her head, \u201cDude.\u201d</p><p>He blushed, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms, \u201cWe need a plan.\u201d</p><p>Coop made a face, \u201cThis place is bugged to fuck. I found seven between my room and this one. I\u2019m assuming we didn\u2019t get them all. We\u2019ve been pretty careful of what we said.\u201d</p><p>I pointed at the clothes, \u201cAnd we all put on clothes from here. Probably sewn in the damned hems.\u201d</p><p>Luce sighed, \u201cGo for a swim?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>We walked back out into the main room and out the front door.</p><p>There was no one around, \u201cCreepy how there is no staff, huh?\u201d</p><p>Coop looked around, \u201cSuper creepy. Not to mention, Steve took our guns before we got on the plane.\u201d</p><p>The path to the ocean was bricked with sand and rock gardens the entire way. The ocean was beautiful and turquoise.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d</p><p>Jack smirked, \u201cWe are in Mexico, just North of Veracruz.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, \u201cHow the hell did he get us in Mexico without passports or shit?\u201d</p><p>Coop picked up the pace, \u201cNot a clue.\u201d</p><p>We started to run, as we got closer to the sandy beach. We all dove into the waves. They weren\u2019t too rough, there was a rocky break, out in the water, not too far from the beach. It got the worst of the moody Atlantic. The beach near the house was more of a pool. The water was warm, and yet refreshing. We swam out against the current, each of us dunking and soaking ourselves thoroughly.</p><p>I flutter-kicked and looked back at the house, \u201cHe\u2019s trying something. I don\u2019t know what, but I think he wants to help us.\u201d</p><p>Coop pointed, \u201cWell, here he comes, swimming trunks and all. Maybe he\u2019ll just offer it up.\u201d</p><p>I laughed when I saw, he truly had on Bermuda shorts and was carrying a stack of towels.</p><p>He dropped them on the beach, far from us and jogged for the water. We all watched in silence as he jumped in and swam out.</p><p>Servario bobbed and looked us all over before speaking softly, \u201cI was hoping you would come out here. Let\u2019s all pretend to swim and be playful. Whoever is the mole, is watching. Unless of course, it\u2019s one of you.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI have a mole. I didn\u2019t know, until recently. My staff is unaware of a lot of aspects in my life, and when I made inquiries about the Burrow, like any arms dealer worth his salt would, I had James up my ass, instantly. My plan was to put it out there and see who bit. James bit instantly.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Coop, \u201cOne of ours, maybe?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cIf there is, it\u2019s over my head.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned, \u201cWait, who was Derringer to all this?\u201d</p><p>Servario shook his head, \u201cThe patsy, your people wanted to blame a lot of things related to all of this on. It\u2019s not him. It\u2019s someone in my employment. My houses are not safe. My planes weren\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, \u201cIs the plane safe now?\u201d I asked thinking on the conversation we\u2019d had.</p><p>He smirked, \u201cI had something installed, it alerts to issues of that nature. The plane starts and an alarm goes off, it only works in planes and vehicles.\u201d</p><p>Coop looked confused, \u201cDoes anyone know you installed it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNo. Impossible.\u201d</p><p>Coop looked lost, \u201cSo you\u2019re on our side?\u201d</p><p>Servario shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m on her side. Whatever side you choose, will dictate if I\u2019m on your side or not.\u201d</p><p>I could tell Coop wasn\u2019t buying it. Jack nodded, \u201cThat actually makes sense. You must have been friends with her dad, and that\u2019s why the information James found, tied you together.\u201d</p><p>Coop\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cHer father killed your father when you were what, eighteen?\u201d</p><p>Servario\u2019s eyes had no green in them, \u201cLet\u2019s drop it. It\u2019s my business, not yours. Yours is staying alive. Your government has a few key members in it, who won\u2019t rest until they\u2019ve got the Burrow. Those same people, by now, think you all are involved. Running with Evie, when you were told to keep her with me, didn\u2019t help your cause. You don\u2019t stand a chance at surviving the next forty-eight hours, unless you off them and hide the evidence linking you.\u201d</p><p>My teeth started to chatter as we floated in the water, \u201cWe know the commander is involved.\u201d</p><p>Coop nodded, \u201cHe\u2019s been my only contact throughout the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>Luce nodded, \u201cThe eyes on the house. We know for sure that\u2019s gonna be one team, following along. They wouldn\u2019t risk the information getting out.\u201d</p><p>Servario licked his lips, making a face from the salt, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, there has to be a politician in on this. There is no way the commander got involved, without someone higher up putting it in his face. The only people who really knew about the Burrow were very high in the CIA, UN, MI6, and CI. One of them has opened this can of worms.\u201d</p><p>I thought and nodded, \u201cWe split up and take them out?\u201d</p><p>Coop gave me a look, \u201cThis is a top breach if we do it. We can be tried with espionage, treason, terrorism, and a variety of other really chargeable offenses. You in for that, with your kids?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and looked at Servario. He shook his head, \u201cShe\u2019s out. She isn\u2019t negotiable. She is a civilian.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed, \u201cAre my kids safe?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, you aren\u2019t in.\u201d</p><p>I searched his face, \u201cI\u2019m in. This is my father\u2019s work, my country\u2019s work, my mother\u2019s work, and if this ends, my kids can have normalcy again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could die and leave them orphaned\u2014or worse, get caught and shame them with the lies they charge you with.\u201d</p><p>I swam to shore, \u201cWe leave here in an hour. We need to figure out your situation first.\u201d</p><p>I knew who it was.</p><p>I knew who the mole was.</p><p>He came out of the water after me, \u201cYou aren\u2019t in.\u201d</p><p>I looked back, \u201cYou ever sleep with Roxy?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cI told you I won\u2019t have you disrespecting her. I truly hired her for the cooking and the OCD. She is very clean. Yes, she\u2019s pretty but I don\u2019t like to mix business with pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on my hips, \u201cYou mixed it with me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cYou have never been anything, but pleasure in my mind.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, \u201cRoxy doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>He picked up a towel and dried himself off, \u201cYou think it\u2019s her?\u201d</p><p>I dried off and walked up to the house, \u201cShe is it. She\u2019s jealous.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at Coop, Luce, and Jack in the water, still plotting. He sighed, \u201cNo way. I never brought women on the plane, and I\u2019ve never been that way with her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrugged, \u201cYou fucked how many chicks on that yacht?\u201d</p><p>His eyes burned.</p><p>I pointed at him, \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to see you with your whores; you\u2019re a sex addict. What did you think? You think she was never gonna get tired of the constant, hardcore sexathons you had on board. She told me about them. Women coming on board to cum. She hates you for never picking her, and your obsession with me has only provoked it. I guarantee James got to her, she\u2019s the weak link.\u201d</p> <p>He looked sickened, \u201cYou are better at this, than I am giving you credit for.\u201d</p><p>I laughed at him, \u201cNo, you were blinded by the tight piece of ass, who you could pay to cook and clean and not have to spoon in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh. He looked like he might actually be sick.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen \u2013 Blood debt</p><p>We boarded the plane and, instantly, I felt sick. Roxy smiled and waved. Luce, Coop, and Jack were in the dark, but they were still cautious.</p> <p>\u201cThe pilot said he didn\u2019t know where we were going?\u201d Roxy said with a smile.</p><p>Servario smiled at her softly, \u201cNo. I wanted to keep it our secret.\u201d He walked past her to the pilot, who I had yet to see.</p><p>A brief look of confusion crossed her face, as she went to the back of the plane. I liked her. I hated that she had betrayed a man she suspected of doing horrid things. She knew he was bad and, no doubt, feared quitting. Then James had come along and threatened her, using his government ties to bribe her into working with him. I can only assume it was how it happened, but I was willing gamble on it.</p><p>Technically, she had made the right choice, the just choice. But my kids were part of the things that prevented me from helping her.</p><p>I let her go to the back of the plane.</p><p>I took my seat, my usual seat, and waited for us to take off, and for the shit to hit the fan.</p> <p>Luce gave me a grave look.</p><p>I winked subtly.</p><p>Steve hadn\u2019t come. Servario had put him to work elsewhere.</p><p>It was just Roxy, the mystery pilot, and us.</p><p>I stopped paying attention to anything and everything. I had a sickening guilt twisting inside of me.</p><p>I was sacrificing another person for my family.</p><p>Coop was staring at me when I looked up. He mouthed, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I twitched a no.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t as good at mouthing things as he and Servario were. I could still read lips as fast as ever.</p><p>Coop mouthed again, \u201cYou want me to make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>I laughed and nodded.</p><p>He came over and sat in the pod next to me, Servario\u2019s usual spot. I wondered if Servario would care if Coop was sitting there?</p><p>Coop leaned in, \u201cYou have to let it slide. Just think, she made her bed.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together and then whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t. I have a terrible feeling.\u201d</p><p>He got up and went to the front of the plane. He came back a minute later with a tray.</p><p>I laughed when Coop put it down.</p><p>I licked my wrist and held it out. He shook the salt on mine and then his and poured the shots. He poured four instead of two.</p><p>He nodded at Jack and Luce. They were sitting beside each other up front, but both got up and made their way to us.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Luce laughed and licked her wrist. Jack shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not good at this one. Tequila makes me throw up.\u201d</p><p>Luce shook her head, \u201cWhat is your deal?\u201d</p><p>Jack hesitated and licked his wrist. Coop salted and passed out the shots.</p><p>He held his up, \u201cTo our families, wherever they are. May they be safe, wherever they are.\u201d</p><p>Jack added, \u201cAnd may they never know about how close the world comes to ending or what we really do for a living.\u201d</p><p>I snorted, \u201cCheers to that.\u201d</p><p>We clanked, licked, drank and sucked.</p><p>Jack walked away, with his glass and a sour face. Luce laughed, \u201cI\u2019ll go make sure he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I looked at them walking back to their seats and gave Coop a look.</p><p>He looked at me like I was insane, \u201cDuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Coop shook his head, whispering, \u201cThat dress made everyone see her differently. Jack may never be the same.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and whispered, \u201cI seriously thought she was gay.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cShe seems like one of the boys....\u201d</p><p>Servario interrupted my sentence, \u201cYou used to be like that.\u201d I glanced up at Servario standing next to me. I hadn\u2019t even noticed him coming back.</p><p>I squinted, \u201cI was not.\u201d</p><p>Servario folded his arms across his chest, \u201cYou were. You were the sharpest shooter, and had to be the fastest runner, and could drink everyone under the table. You were.\u201d</p><p>Coop laughed, \u201cI heard the same reports.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, blushing, \u201cI must have forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Coop smirked, \u201cThe best agents are \u2018one of the boys\u2019. They fit in; first rule of being an agent, F.I.F.O. It means Fit In or Fuck Off.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand out for another shot. I looked up at Servario, \u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t her?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look and walked to the back of the plane.</p><p>We took off but Roxy never came back, neither did Servario.</p><p>Coop poured me a third shot. I couldn\u2019t stop my eyes from darting to the back.</p><p>I drank the shot smoothly, fighting the shudder I wanted to do.</p><p>My belly rumbled.</p><p>Coop laughed, \u201cI\u2019m starving too.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at him, \u201cHow are we going to clean this all up?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cThis mess is huge. I don\u2019t even know. Right now we\u2019re riding with enemy number one. Me, Luce and Jack all went off the reservation, so we\u2019re as guilty as you now. They\u2019ll find a way to pin this on us too. Being with Servario is only making it easier for them to do it.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and sighed, \u201cI know, and yet, I have the feeling that he is the only person we can actually trust.\u201d</p><p>I opened one eye when he didn\u2019t say anything. He looked stricken, \u201cI agree,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>For the strangest of reasons, Coop\u2019s words didn\u2019t make me feel better.</p><p>I closed my eye again and let the comfy pod take me away.</p><p>I woke up with a start. I looked around the plane, Luce and Jack were leaned up against each other. Coop was sound asleep next to me.</p><p>I heard a noise.</p><p>It must have been the thing that woke me up.</p><p>I unbuckled and walked to the back of the plane.</p><p>\u201cStop, we shouldn\u2019t be doing this here,\u201d Roxy said, in between ragged breaths.</p><p>My stomach clenched, \u201cOh God,\u201d I whispered to myself.</p><p>He was fucking Roxy.</p><p>He was betraying me.</p><p>I froze and prepared myself for what I was about to see.</p><p>Did I want to see it?</p><p>I didn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t feel the same as before. The conversations we\u2019d had since then, changed everything.</p><p>But had they? Had I fallen for his smooth lines and sexy ways?</p><p>Christ.</p><p>She moaned again, \u201cOh my God, Gustavo... please!\u201d</p><p>I reached for the curtain to the dressing room and ripped it back fast.</p><p>Her hands were tied to the roof with blood trails running down them. Her face was beaten. Servario\u2019s hands were cut from hitting her. He looked back with a savage expression, \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and fought the motherly urge to dive in front of the blow he gave her, with the back of his hand. She cried out again, shaking her head and sniffling. \u201cPlease, Evie, help me. Please. I swear, whatever you think is missing or whatever, I didn\u2019t do it. I wouldn\u2019t do that to you, Gustavo.\u201d</p><p>Servario shoved me back and closed the curtain. The look on his face was scarier than anything I had ever seen. His eyes were completely black.</p><p>She cried out moments later.</p><p>I jumped, stepping away from it. My back pressed against the wall.</p><p>She was innocent. I was wrong. I had a terrible feeling.</p><p>I sunk to the floor, shaking and forcing myself to listen to each strike.</p><p>He could beat a woman that badly?</p><p>I didn\u2019t know him.</p><p>She screamed in a long series of shrieks and bleats like a sheep. Whatever he was doing, was bad.</p><p>\u201cFUCK YOU!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>I could hear him speaking in low, hushed tones.</p><p>\u201cEVIEEEEEEE! EVIE, SAVE ME!\u201d she screamed and sobbed.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know I was shaking, until I felt the still of Coop against me. He wrapped around me, holding me tight to him. Instead of stopping the madness, he carried me to a row of seats and sat, holding me like a child. I was cradled against his chest. But even the distance couldn\u2019t stop the screams.</p><p>\u201cWe have to help her. I was wrong. I was wrong. Please,\u201d I pleaded.</p><p>Coop shook his head, \u201cYou didn\u2019t do this, Evie. If he suspects her, then we have to let it play out. We need to know who we\u2019re against. Without her, we\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d</p><p>I felt tears streaming down my cheeks, \u201cWhat if she\u2019s innocent?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, \u201cThere is no magic pill to determine that. Torture is the best way. You\u2019ve been trained, you know that.\u201d</p><p>I crawled off of him and sat in the chair next to him, \u201cI haven\u2019t been part of this world for a long time. And technically, I was never part of anything like this.\u201d</p><p>The screaming never died down for a long time.</p><p>It started to dull in my mind though.</p><p>We flew for a long time before Servario came out. He had blood spatter all over him. He sat next to Coop and I.</p><p>\u201cI have a list of names and a location for James.\u201d Servario\u2019s voice was distant and disturbing.</p><p>I looked at him, \u201cIs she... dead?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNo. I\u2019m not done with her. He stared forward at the wall in front of us with the huge, blank, flat-screen TV on it.</p><p>Coop was the one to talk first, \u201cSorry man, that\u2019s rough having to do that to a girl.\u201d</p><p>Servario clenched his jaw.</p><p>I looked down and waited to get off the plane.</p><p>We touched down in the dark again. It felt like we were always in the dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Servario never tried to touch me or talk to me.</p><p>When we landed, a helicopter was waiting for us on the tarmac. We were boarded on it, when I got my first glimpse of Roxy. Her eyes were swollen shut. She was a mess\u2014fat lips and cuts. Her hands were wrapped in soaked bandages. He dragged her from the plane and shoved her in the back. Her blonde hair was ratty and missing in parts.</p><p>Luce and Coop shared the same blank expression, whereas I imagined Jack and I were both horrified.</p> <p>He looked at me, terrified.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>We were somewhere warm still. We flew down a coastline, rocky and beautiful. I was lost, completely.</p><p>I forced myself to see the stunning things, and not the dying girl in the back, who used to be stunning.</p><p>The helicopter circled a huge house. It landed on a large, cement pad.</p> <p>James was walking down the path from the huge house. My breathing stopped completely, as my heart pounded out of my chest. I felt my face flush. Coop covered my hands with his, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him.</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNo\u2014to what you\u2019re thinking or feeling. Shut it off.\u201d</p><p>I tried, but my kids\u2019 faces were all over his. My kids, who I hadn\u2019t seen in, what felt like an eternity. My face pinched and balled. I fought tears so hard it hurt.</p><p>I sniffled and sighed, \u201cI can do this,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>We landed. James didn\u2019t look up. He walked until the door opened.</p> <p>Then he stopped, stared and then frowned. His girlfriend was tossed from the helicopter first. Servario had a gun drawn. He passed one to Luce and Coop, as he stepped down.</p><p>James put his hands up. He was completely lost and confused.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even seen me yet.</p><p>I climbed out last, following Jack.</p><p>His eyes darted as the helicopter turned off, making a huge wind surround us all momentarily, until it finally stopping spinning.</p><p>James\u2019 eye caught my face. He put his hands out, \u201cEvie!\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and snatched the gun from Luce\u2019s hand. I fired at his left kneecap.</p><p>He screamed out as crimson started to seep out from this beige, linen pants.</p> <p>Luce reached for the gun, but when she saw my face, she stopped.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d I asked just barely audible.</p><p>His face crumpled as he held his knee, \u201cEvie, please let me speak.\u201d</p><p>I shot at the other knee, missing. He dropped to the ground anyway.</p><p>Servario walked away from the nearly falling-over Roxy and came up to me. He looked down, lifting my face up. He brushed his lips against mine, \u201cLet me. You don\u2019t want this memory when you look at your children,\u201d he whispered into my lips.</p><p>I nodded and stepped back. He pulled the gun from my hand and passed it back to Luce. She gave me an understanding look but Coop looked psychotic.</p><p>\u201cIs Mel here?\u201d I asked past Servario\u2019s back. He wasn\u2019t looking at me, he was trying to crawl to his girlfriend, Roxy. She swayed as blood dripped from her bandaged hands.</p><p>Finally James looked at me long and hard, \u201cYour father did this, Evie. Not me.\u201d</p><p>I pointed, \u201cJust kill him. I want him gone for real.\u201d</p><p>I turned and walked back to the helicopter.</p><p>I heard the shot fire but I didn\u2019t look back. Then the second one.</p><p>I sat in the seat and waited. I wanted to look inside of the house. I wanted to know his secrets. I wanted it all to become clear to me but a voice, probably my father\u2019s, told me I didn\u2019t really want that.</p><p>It told me that I wanted to let this one go. I would find answers in other places too. I didn\u2019t just need these answers. These ones would haunt me for all my days.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen \u2013 Princess Evie</p><p>The jet felt haunted as we crossed an ocean. I could only assume it was the Pacific. We were going to Asia. I wondered if he was taking me to an ashram. I needed it.</p><p>I looked at Servario, trying not to see the sadistic fuck I\u2019d seen in that room. He looked like I\u2019d killed his cat, when he glanced over at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Evie.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cMe too. I\u2019m sorry it was her.\u201d</p><p>Coop glanced over from the notes Servario must have taken while torturing her. \u201cSo Mel is dead. She was the one in the car.\u201d That hurt. Mel too, had been used by James.</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cHe didn\u2019t need her anymore, because he had Roxy. Roxy, who wanted to find herself a millionaire like Servario.\u201d</p><p>Servario stood and walked to the front of the plane.</p><p>Coop continued, \u201cJames was helping frame you to get your dad out of hiding. He had asked Roxy to take pictures of every meeting Servario went to. After your dad was dead, he and Servario met. Roxy got it on her cellphone so it must have been recent. It was the proof CI needed to use you to bring him out of hiding.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, \u201cThey knew he was in hiding all along? He\u2019s been dead for a long time.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, \u201cMust have suspected something. Anyway, Servario beat her and broke her and she confessed. The plan was to take the money, leave you screwed and leave the kids with your mom. She actually said James never really cared what happened to the kids. He just wanted his easy life in his beach house with his blonde.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t even hurt anymore. Not even for my kids. I didn\u2019t even care a little. I couldn\u2019t. If I cared about one thing, all the emotions I was shutting off would find their way in.</p><p>I sighed, \u201cHe was a douche nozzle.\u201d</p><p>Coop snorted, \u201cYeah. Dumb fuck. Who does that to their own family? Anyway, Servario used Roxy\u2019s cell to text James and send the helicopter. James was expecting her to get off alone. They were going to start their new life together. Roxy had been letting him in on the progress of the fuck-Evie campaign. Apparently, he was quite satisfied with how it had turned out. You were a fugitive and Servario was forcing sex on you all the time and humiliating you.\u201d His tone was filled with disgust.</p><p>I blushed at that. My lips curled into a grim smile, \u201cShe was thorough.\u201d</p><p>Servario brought a tray to Luce and Jack and then one to us. It was filled with snacks and things. He smiled at me, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Evie. I had no idea it was her. I assumed Steve.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, \u201cThey got the death they deserved, then I guess.\u201d I smirked, \u201cThe account is still there right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>My eyes flashed, \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>We landed hours later in smoggy Tokyo.</p><p>I frowned, \u201cJapan?\u201d</p><p>Servario bowed, \u201cYes, Princess Evie.\u201d</p><p>We climbed into another helicopter. I shook my head, \u201cIt\u2019s too much. I need to be away from all vehicles\u2014all. I need a vacation from this vacation.\u201d</p><p>Jack moaned, \u201cNot another flight.\u201d</p><p>We sat in our seats and instantly started for the mountains.</p><p>Servario grinned, \u201cThis is going to take about two hours. So buckle up and try to enjoy the ride.\u201d He seemed tense.</p><p>I supposed I would too.</p><p>I, on the other hand, felt a renewed sense of freedom. My marriage had never had confines that I was aware of. Looking back, I could see the sense of freedom I was feeling was stemming from a lack of confines. Ones I had gotten so used to that I didn\u2019t see them.</p><p>The money in the account freed me from worry, guilt, and obligation.</p><p>The kids were mine. I had never considered divorce, seven months without sex and I never considered divorce. I knew why that was. I never wanted to battle it out like our friends had.</p><p>I glanced at Servario and smirked. He was a savage and a complete fiend, and yet he made me feel like a woman. I finally understood the damned song, \u201cA Natural Woman.\u201d Looking at him, I would swear I could hear the bloody lyrics.</p><p>He scared me.</p><p>I liked that. Was there shame in my feelings for him, after everything? I couldn\u2019t find any.</p><p>We would never fall into a routine. We would never go seven months without sex. I would never be truly safe with him.</p><p>I liked that a lot.</p><p>Clearly, he wasn\u2019t the only freak in the relationship that would never be a relationship.</p><p>Looking out over the city, I wondered if he was taking me to my kids? I was scared we were never going to get them back. I couldn\u2019t let myself dwell or I would cry.</p><p>I closed my eyes and laid my head back.</p><p>The next thing I knew, I was being shoved. I opened my eyes with a start.</p><p>Jack grinned at me, \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I looked around, he was waiting for me. Everyone else was outside stretching their legs.</p><p>I smiled, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>He beamed, \u201cI could cry. It\u2019s genius. It actually makes perfect sense.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, \u201cYou are such a nerd.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I climbed out to see nothing but forest.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>Servario gave me a look. I wasn\u2019t sure what it meant. \u201cThis is where I leave you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, \u201cNo. What? No. I don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, whispering, \u201cI have to. I can never set foot in there. It\u2019s a rule. The Master Key may never set foot in the Princess\u2019s temple, once he has taken on the role. I know I\u2019m safe right now but they don\u2019t know that. They assume I could bring the bad people down on them. I take the role of Master Key and I walk away. Always leading the suspicious people away from this spot. This temple.\u201d</p><p>I looked around, \u201cWhat temple?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to a small black cave-looking thing, \u201cThat\u2019s the entrance. You have to go in there and walk until you see the light again.\u201d He held a hand out, \u201cI need all of your clothes, and phones, and every piece of electronics.\u201d I looked down at the others. When they looked up at me, they could tell something was wrong.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that we griped.</p><p>We eventually got naked, one at a time behind the helicopter, and left everything with him. We put on the robes he left us. They were stunning Japanese traditional-looking robes.</p><p>Luce smiled when she came from behind it in the robe. It wasn\u2019t her usual smile, but it counted as effort, after everything we\u2019d been through.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice, huh?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded, \u201cSo pretty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look pretty.\u201d I read Jack\u2019s lips as he leaned over and whispered it to her.</p><p>I gave Servario a pleading look, \u201cPlease just come.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cI\u2019ve broken every other rule for you, Evie. This is one I cannot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t be strong without you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed; it was fake, \u201cYou are stronger than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. You have to say that.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and kissed my forehead, \u201cConsider inviting me to Christmas. Please, baby. I want to see you in all your glory, pajamas till noon and everything.\u201d</p><p>I felt the dam breaking. The tears were winning.</p> <p>He kissed each of my eyelids, \u201cGo now.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked to the helicopter.</p><p>The pilot started it up.</p><p>I started to sob.</p><p>Servario pointed at me. Coop grabbed one of my hands, dragging me to the cave entrance.</p><p>We stepped into the darkness and all I could think about, was the light behind me.</p> <p>We walked for a while before my eyes adjusted. The dark of the tunnel was annoying and never ending. My eyes were sticking from the tears.</p><p>Coop never let go of my hand. He squeezed tight, pulling me through.</p><p>My CI brain switched on about halfway. Our pace slowed and I knew what was happening.</p><p>I never doubted for a second, that each one of us assumed it was a trap of sorts.</p><p>We didn\u2019t trust Servario, not completely.</p><p>We never heard Roxy\u2019s story or James\u2019.</p><p>We took everything Servario had said at face value.</p><p>In the dark, Jack whispered, \u201cIs anyone else seeing that last scene in the movie The Usual Suspects rolling around in their head? You know where Kevin Spacey leaves the police station and his limp slowly leaves.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, \u201cI have that same bad feeling I had on the plane.\u201d</p><p>Coop nodded, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect on the other side of this tunnel.\u201d</p><p>Luce laughed bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m waiting for him to shoot it with bombs and collapse it.\u201d</p><p>That was it.</p><p>We all started running.</p><p>I tripped but Coop dragged me up.</p><p>\u201cLight!\u201d Luce shouted back.</p><p>We slowed when we saw it get brighter.</p><p>It was a door.</p><p>When we got closer we could see the light around the edges.</p><p>Coop went to the front. He ran his hands on the metal of the door, making an almost-silent scratching noise against it.</p><p>\u201cNo handle.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, \u201cKnock.\u201d</p><p>He banged lightly.</p><p>Something made a grinding noise, and instantly, dust moved in the beams of light we had around us from the door.</p><p>It pulled back and light filled the dank space.</p><p>My eyes needed a second to adjust, but when they did I didn\u2019t believe what I saw.</p><p>My father.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>The man looked much older, grey-haired and more wrinkled than before, but he was my father.</p><p>His face split into a grin, but I could see the panic in his eyes.</p><p>His smile was fake. He wasn\u2019t happy to see me.</p><p>I wanted to cry but the commander didn\u2019t like crying. At least I didn\u2019t think he did, but tears leaked from his old, green eyes.</p><p>He held his arms out for me. I leapt into them. He wrapped and squeezed and I couldn\u2019t breathe but I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d I caught the word being screamed from beyond my father and I.</p><p>My ears caught it in the distance.</p><p>Dad kissed me on the cheek and pulled me back, \u201cGo see them. They\u2019ve missed you, something fierce.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and felt the collapse of the walls inside of me.</p><p>I broke free of him and ran along the cobblestone. I dropped to my knees and they jumped me.</p><p>I cried as hard as they did.</p><p>\u201cYou took too long!\u201d Jules squeaked at me.</p><p>I cried and sniffled, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It was more work than I thought.\u201d</p><p>Coop ruffled Mitch\u2019s head, \u201cHey, kid.\u201d</p><p>Mitch stood up and crossed his arms over his chest, \u201cHey, Coop.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at the way he tried to be a big boy around Coop. They seemed to hit it off the moment they met, back at the house after James\u2019 funeral. Jules clung to me for a second longer and then pulled my hand, \u201cCome see. There\u2019s a real princess.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and looked back at Luce and Jack. He mouthed, \u201cI knew it. Ise Grand Shrine temple.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and gave him the thumbs up, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means?\u201d I mouthed back.</p><p>Jack made a face, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I laughed and said aloud, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at my dad, \u201cHow?\u201d I asked, being cryptic because of the others around us.</p><p>Dad grinned, knowing I meant how had they fooled me all along. He shrugged subtly, \u201cA hell of a lot of work.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cI bet. So Mom and you both?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, \u201cYour mom more than me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, still baffled, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Dad laughed again, \u201cA hell of a lot of work!\u201d He linked arms with me as Luce and Jack introduced themselves to Jules. She dragged them up the road. Coop and Mitch walked behind them.</p><p>\u201cYou were right about James, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI know, princess. I tried to make him do the right thing by you and I made a bigger mess. I\u2019m sorry. I should have been honest with you. I liked to imagine my rank had an effect on him. The guy was a wiener.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>He gave me a sideways glance, \u201cA dead wiener?\u201d</p><p>I nodded quickly, knowing he would want full details when we were completely alone.</p><p>\u201cSuffer?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again.</p><p>He sighed, \u201cI take you and Servario met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d I missed him already.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a strange kid too. I like that one though. He came to me when he was twenty-two and asked my permission to date you. I kick myself now for telling him no. I told him the secret was more important. I think he liked you because you were so good at all of this, but telling him no, seemed to make him obsess about you. Well, fat lot of good that did me. Look at where you are. You\u2019ve met him anyway,\u201d he chuckled and I understood something new about Servario. His infatuation with me had been genuine from the beginning, and the challenge of being told no by my father, had only made things worse.</p><p>I decided to save that one for later and looked around, changing the subject, \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>He glanced around in awe, \u201cThis place is perfect for our purpose. It\u2019s a Japanese temple that\u2019s dedicated to a Goddess. There are 123 temple shrines here. This particular one is forbidden access for regular visitors. No one may enter, and then there\u2019s the fact they renovate every twenty years. Anyway, the legend is that a daughter of some guy wandered the woods for twenty years, trying to find the perfect place to worship this goddess. She ended up here in Ise. It\u2019s all rebuilt, every twenty years, to maintain the respect of the order of things. The natural decay cycles. So we can be here, moving in amongst the shrines, staying hidden.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, \u201cWhy would the Japanese ever agree to this? They hate Americans, rightfully so.\u201d</p><p>He looked down on me intensely, \u201cThe Fat Man and The Little Boy. After the Second World War they were dedicated to the preservation of the world. Few cultures care about nature and balance like the Japanese do. Once we dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese royals were in. They wanted the immediate control of the weapons that ruined so much of their country. They gave us their most sacred temple as a show of their dedication to the Burrow. They don\u2019t hate Americans, they hate disrespect.\u201d</p><p>I looked around at the people walking past us. They were multicultural. \u201cSo everyone here is a threat to the world in some way?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>He nudged me, \u201cYou have no idea. You guys coming here is a huge mess. I\u2019ll be lucky to get out alive.\u201d</p><p>I looked around, \u201cI can imagine. What have you told the kids?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, \u201cThat they\u2019re in Thailand, going to an ashram for meditation. They\u2019re pretty mad at you for picking this as a vacation. I told them it was James\u2019 idea.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>I looked up to see my mom walking down the road. I started to cry again. I ran to her. She wrapped around me, \u201cMy baby.\u201d</p><p>My sister was close behind. She wrapped around mom and me.</p><p>\u201cSissy.\u201d</p><p>She shook when she hugged me. I knew she would be in the dark. She wouldn\u2019t know and wouldn\u2019t want to. She was a typical hippie from a typical commune on the West Coast.</p><p>\u201cAre you in some kind of shit,\u201d Sissy whispered.</p><p>Mom gave her a look, \u201cNo swearing in the temple.\u201d</p><p>Sis scowled at me, \u201cHow did this happen? We\u2019re prisoner here and Dad\u2019s alive? What the heck?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, \u201cI got nothing.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cI see.\u201d She grabbed dad, \u201cYou\u2014old man, are in trouble. You broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cIt was all for you girls. I needed to keep you safe.\u201d He looked at me, \u201cSpeaking of which, you have a date with some people.\u201d</p><p>I held my robe to my body and nodded, \u201cI figured something would come of it.\u201d</p><p>He put a hand out for me. I took it and smiled at my mom and sister, \u201cBe back in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Mom smirked.</p><p>We walked up the road, I smelled the blossoming trees and looked around at the beauty of it all.</p><p>\u201cThey will make you clean this up or die. That\u2019s the only option.\u201d</p><p>I looked up, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and the grim look I saw on his face when he first saw me, was back.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cMy hands are tied. James screwed you hard kid. He put you a pickle, I\u2019m not positive you\u2019ll get out of.\u201d</p><p>I started to panic but he grabbed both my arms, \u201cBut I do know, if anyone is going to get out of it, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, \u201cYou think so?\u201d My faith in my survival was dwindling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded, \u201cOne hundred percent. If anyone can, it\u2019s you. That Coop kid is intense but I really like him. He reminds me of me I think. Luce seems reliable, and Jack is a genius. The kid speaks fake languages.\u201d</p><p>I laughed weakly, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou four are going to have to do something, that no one has done before.\u201d His eyes sparkled.</p><p>He turned and dragged me up the short hill. We entered a small building that became huge inside.</p> <p>I saw everyone else in there. Jack laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s like the Harry Potter tents, way bigger inside.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, \u201cLet\u2019s face the music.\u201d</p><p>Dad led the way into another room.</p><p>We stepped into an elevator. It went down.</p><p>I started to get nervous. We stopped and got out into an intense-looking laboratory or tech building. He brought us to a door. He put his hand on it, \u201cSay yes to everything,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>Coop glanced at me and grinned.</p><p>Dad pushed on the door and when we entered I nearly had a heart attack. The room was bright and huge, and set up like a senate. It was filled with people from everywhere.</p><p>We walked into the middle and voices started from all sides of the room.</p><p>My palms started to sweat. We followed my dad to the center of the circle. He put his hands in the air.</p><p>A woman with dark hair, and an evil sort of sparkle in her eyes, spoke, \u201cYou have a choice. You will end the threat to the Burrow, or you will forfeit your lives. We have hidden you and your families long enough.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Luce looked a bit surprised, but Coop seemed like he was expecting it.</p> <p>\u201cOur countries will offer you support, financing, and intel, but you will have to do the work and clean up the mess. You must stop whoever is looking for the Burrow and get whatever information they have gathered.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my dad, \u201cAren\u2019t we fugitives as of now?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNo, something is being done to make it look like Servario took you all captive and hurt you. You will walk from this still unaware and clear of any suspicions.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand how that was possible at all.\u201d</p><p>The woman looked at my father, \u201cYou and Servario know your jobs?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once firmly and turned to me, \u201cI love you more than anything on this planet. There is a custom here on this island.\u201d He kissed my forehead, \u201cI give you all my hope and love and strength.\u201d He lifted the locket and smiled, \u201cI gave it to you a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the locket and my cheek and turned on his heel in true, military fashion, walking away from me.</p><p>I knew then, whatever he and Servario were going to do, he wasn\u2019t planning on coming back.</p><p>I didn\u2019t let myself have the second I needed. I shut it off and looked back at the lady. Her eyes shone when she spoke, \u201cI am sorry for your loss.\u201d</p> <p>My face was strong and brave, and I didn\u2019t let the tears flowing down my cheeks affect that.</p><p>\u201cYou will leave here tomorrow. You will begin something incredible and intense. We are doing something we have never done before. The world is a different place, than it was when we started, and we feel like this is the best way to keep up with the change.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Coop. He looked lost. That was a bad sign.</p><p>She cleared her throat, \u201cWelcome the new Master Keys! Commence the swear-in ceremony.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped. Coop took my hand in his, squeezing it hard.</p><p>I wanted to protest. I had kids. I was a single mom. It wasn\u2019t fair. Just as I opened my lips, I noticed a man in the background. He was incredibly old. He smiled at me and waved. He had no fingers on his hand. He looked at me with an awe and respect I didn\u2019t deserve. Not yet. But I imagined I would one day.</p><p>I just needed to figure out how to do it all.</p><p>I smiled at the man and looked down at the floor, when I felt my heart attempting to leave my chest.</p><p>I put my right hand in the air and spoke the words, but my heartbeat distracted me.</p><p>The lady came down and hugged me, \u201cThey have made such a sacrifice for you to be able to leave here and live normally; well, to the outside world you will be normal. Even to your own military operation you will be innocent. For that they died.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, \u201cThey?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, \u201cThey both had to die. They had to clear the suspicions from your name and the temptation to harm you. Servario will not be suspected as the Master Key or linked to the Burrow. He will look like another greedy arms dealer looking for another weapon. Your father\u2019s remains will be found in Mexico and Servario\u2019s in Boston. That will be where you lot escaped from. The true Master Key will kill him and help you escape the madness and torture. You must be grateful for the sacrifice they\u2019re making.\u201d</p><p>My breathing picked up, I nodded, \u201cYes, I am a lucky girl.\u201d She smiled and missed the heartache and sarcasm in my voice.</p><p>He smiled, \u201cYou must leave here tomorrow and you may never come back. The Key must never come near here again. Your father was granted special privileges to come and live here, during his faked death, but that is not something we ever do. This whole mess is because we let him live.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Coop, Jack, and Luce; that statement didn\u2019t sit well with me. Was she going to have us killed when our usefulness ran out?</p><p>We walked from the circular room.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone else feel like we were just given a death sentence that we\u2019re supposed to feel grateful for?\u201d Jack muttered.</p><p>I pushed the elevator button but my heart was burning, \u201cPretty much. Like this is a huge honor, they\u2019re bestowing on us.\u201d I felt all the floors above me threatening to come down on me. The avalanche of bad things was back. This time it was real. The elevator dinged and we all stepped in like mindless zombies.</p><p>We left the next day.</p><p>I didn\u2019t remember the flight.</p><p>I tried to accept the fact we had to be tortured and left in the hotel parking lot, where we were locked in the back of a van. We managed to escape and flee to another hotel where Coop called us in. We were brought in for questioning and cleared, when it became obvious whoever was the Master Key had killed James and Roxy, and possibly Servario. The commander came down and requested we start back after we all healed. We would be the Burrow task force, to stop this sort of thing from happening again. We needed to know what it was, so we could protect our country from it.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter to me.</p><p>I still needed to give myself the moment I had been denied at the temple.</p><p>An agent drove me to my car, which was still parked at the Boston airport.</p><p>He dropped me off and drove away. I lifted a bruised hand up into the midday sun and looked at it. It was real. I could feel the dam about to burst inside of me, so I got into the car and drove home quickly.</p><p>When I got to my driveway, I looked up at my house. My family, what was left of it, came running out to greet me. They had been returned home from their lovely getaway in Thailand.</p><p>After we hugged on the lawn, and my kids got past the bruising, my mom wrapped her arms around my neck and whispered, \u201cHe loved you so much.\u201d She sobbed and walked into the house. I felt a sickness, I couldn\u2019t let in. He had to be dead for her to act like that.</p><p>I went directly to my room. I needed a shower. I needed to really cry in the shower.</p><p>I opened the bedroom door and then the bathroom.</p><p>I gasped and dropped to my knees.</p><p>In Russian Red my bathroom mirror read, \u201cBest week of my life xoxo\u201d.</p><p>The lipstick was on the counter next to a pair of black, patent-leather Christian Louboutin ankle-boot pumps.</p><p>Had he done it before or after? Was he dead? I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>I sobbed into my carpet.</p><p>What if he was dead?</p><p>I had nothing...no feeling...I was numb.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen \u2013 The end of me</p><p>His death was the end of me.</p><p>The end of sad Evie Evans. The mom who made everyone more important. The hockey/soccer/every damned sport-under-the-sun single parent. The yoga-pant wearing, mortgage poor, stressed to the hilt, and sex-deprived wife.</p><p>She died.</p><p>She died the week her dad was shot down in Mexico. Her ex-husband and his girlfriend had been there as well. The house was torched and the helicopter pilot was murdered savagely.</p><p>She died the week the only man she had ever been able to be a real woman with, was murdered. He died in a hotel room of a heart attack, but they suspected poisoning. Maybe potassium chloride pills. No one knew. His body had vanished from the ME\u2019s office before they could be sure.</p><p>In dead Evie\u2019s stead, there was a new Evie. She was strong and fun, like a girl she once knew.</p><p>She still cried sometimes at night, when no one was looking, but that stopped when she got a postcard in the mail from a stranger. All it said was \u201cSee you at Christmas\u201d. She stopped crying then.</p><p>She stopped being broken at night when no one could see. She started counting down the days till Christmas. And until the damned house sold, so she could stop looking over at the neighbors\u2019 house and wanting to kill the home-wrecking slut that lived there.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
