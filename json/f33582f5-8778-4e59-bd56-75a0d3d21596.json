She had no idea where she was or how she\u2019d gotten lost. After all, she\u2019d lived in Colville her entire life. She should know\u2014did know\u2014every square inch of this town. But the last thing she remembered was going out to collect the mail and that must have been hours ago.</p><p>The street didn\u2019t look familiar and the houses weren\u2019t any she recognized. The Henderson house at the corner of Chestnut and Elm had been her marker, but it was nowhere in sight. She remembered that the Hendersons had painted their place white with green shutters. Where was it? she wondered, starting to feel frantic. Where was it? George would be upset with her for taking so long. Oh no, how could she have forgotten? George was dead.</p><p>The weight of grief settled over her, heavy and oppressive. George, her beloved husband, was gone\u2014taken from her just two months short of their sixtieth anniversary. It had all happened so fast....</p> <p>Last November, her husband had gone outside to warm up the car before church, and a few minutes later he lay dead in the carport. He\u2019d had a massive heart attack. The nice young man who\u2019d come with the ambulance had told her George was dead before he even hit the pavement. He sounded as if this was supposed to comfort her. But nothing could have eased the shock, the horror, of that dreadful morning.</p><p>Vivian blinked hard, and despite the May warmth of eastern Washington, a chill raced up her bare arms. She tried to extinguish her growing panic. How was she going to find her way home?</p><p>Susannah would know what to do\u2014but then she remembered that her daughter didn\u2019t live in Colville anymore. Of course Susannah wasn\u2019t at home. She had her own house. In Seattle, wasn\u2019t it? Yes, in Seattle. She was married with two precious children. Susannah and Joe\u2019s children. Good grief, why couldn\u2019t she think of their names? Her grandchildren were her joy and her pride. She could picture their faces as clearly as if she was looking at a photograph, but she couldn\u2019t recall their names.</p><p>Chrissie. The relief was instantaneous. Her granddaughter\u2019s name was Chrissie. She was born first and then Brian was born three years later. Or was it four years? It didn\u2019t matter, Vivian decided. She had their names now.</p><p>What she needed to do was concentrate on where she was\u2014and where she should go from here. It was already starting to get dark and she didn\u2019t want to wander aimlessly from street to street. But she couldn\u2019t figure out what to do next.</p> <p>If there\u2019d been any other pedestrians around, she could\u2019ve stopped and asked for directions to Woods Road.</p><p>No...Woods Road had been her childhood address. She hadn\u2019t lived there since she was a schoolgirl, and that was before the war. For heaven\u2019s sake, she should be able to remember her own address! What was wrong with her?</p><p>The place she was looking for was the house she and George had bought almost forty-five years ago, when the children were still at home. She felt a mixture of fear...and shame. A woman of eighty should know where she lived. George would be so frustrated and impatient if he ever found out about this.... Only he\u2019d never know. That didn\u2019t make her feel any better, though. She needed him, and he wasn\u2019t there to help her, and that filled her with anxiety so intense, she wrung her hands.</p><p>Vivian started walking again, although she wasn\u2019t sure where she was headed. Maybe if she kept moving, if she concentrated hard enough, the memory would eventually return to her.</p><p>Her legs tired quickly, and she sighed with relief when she saw a bench by the side of the road. Vivian couldn\u2019t understand why the city would place a nice wooden bench there\u2014not even near a bus stop. It was a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. If George knew about this, he\u2019d be fuming. He\u2019d been a public servant all those years, a superior court judge. A fine one, too, a man of principle and character. How proud Vivian was of him.</p><p>Still, she was so grateful for somewhere to sit, she wasn\u2019t about to complain. George had freely voiced his opinions about matters of civic responsibility and what he called city hall\u2019s squandering of resources. While she listened to her husband\u2019s views, she didn\u2019t always share them. She had her own thoughts when it came to politics and things like that, but she usually didn\u2019t discuss them with George. That was something she\u2019d learned early in her marriage. George always wanted to convince everyone of the superiority of his ideas and he\u2019d argue until he wore people down. So when her views differed from his, she kept them to herself.</p> <p>Sitting on the hard bench, she glanced about, hoping to find a landmark. Oh my, this was a busy street. Cars whizzed past, their lights blinding her until she felt dizzy. She wasn\u2019t nearly as tired now that she was sitting. That was good, because she needed to think. Thinking was important. She hated forgetting basic facts, like her address, her phone number, people\u2019s names. This happened more and more often now that George had died, and it frightened her.</p><p>Perhaps if she closed her eyes for a moment, that would help. She\u2019d try to relax, clear her mind, since all this worry only made her memory less reliable.</p><p>It was chilly now that the sun had gone down. She should\u2019ve brought a sweater but she\u2019d been working in the garden earlier and it had been hot. Her irises were lovely this spring, even though her garden was in sad shape. For years, it had been a source of pride and she hated the way it looked these days. She did as much as she could, but so much else needed to be done. Weeding, pruning, planting annuals...After dinner she\u2019d decided to do some watering and remembered that she hadn\u2019t collected the mail. That was when she\u2019d gone out, planning to walk to the neighborhood mailbox. And now here she was, lost and confused and afraid.</p><p>That was when Vivian sensed someone\u2019s presence and opened her eyes. Joy coursed through her veins as she stared, wondering if her mind had betrayed her.</p><p>\u201cGeorge?\u201d</p><p>Her husband of fifty-nine years stood beside her, shadowed under the nearby streetlight. His smile warmed her and she straightened, eyes wide open, terrified he\u2019d disappear. George had come to help her, come to save her.</p><p>\u201cThat is you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer but stood there plain as could be. He\u2019d always been such a handsome man, she thought, admiring his broad shoulders and his confident posture.</p> <p>They\u2019d been high school sweethearts and known each other their entire lives. Vivian felt she was the luckiest girl in the world when George Leary asked her to marry him. They\u2019d been apart for nearly three years while he was fighting in Europe. Then he\u2019d gone to college to get his law degree on the G.I. Bill. That time of struggle had paid off, though, and after a few years of private practice, he\u2019d been invited to join the bench. George had been the one and only love of her life and she missed him terribly. How like him to come to her now, in her hour of need.</p><p>Vivian reached out to him, but George backed away. She dropped her hand abruptly, biting her lower lip. No, of course\u2014she should\u2019ve realized she couldn\u2019t touch him. One couldn\u2019t touch the dead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me, but I can\u2019t find my way home.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again and she was so relieved he wasn\u2019t upset with her. She\u2019d forgotten things before he died, too, and sometimes he got frustrated, although he tried to hide it. She\u2019d even stopped cooking but that was because she\u2019d forgotten so many of her recipes. The ones in cookbooks were too hard to read, too confusing. But George never complained and often heated soup for both of them.</p><p>Vivian felt she should explain what had happened. \u201cI went to get the mail and I must\u2019ve decided to go for a walk, because when I looked up I wasn\u2019t anywhere close to the house.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out his hand and she got to her feet.</p><p>\u201cCan you take me home?\u201d she asked, hating how plaintive and helpless she sounded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Then she realized that dead men couldn\u2019t talk, either. That was all right; she didn\u2019t care as long as George stayed with her. Six months it had been since he\u2019d died and every one of those months had seemed an eternity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you came,\u201d she whispered, trying to hide the way her voice cracked with emotion. \u201cOh, George, I miss you.\u201d She told him about the garden, even though she knew she was rambling. He\u2019d never liked it when she talked too much, but she was afraid he\u2019d have to leave soon, and there was so much to tell him. \u201cGeorge, I\u2019m sure Martha is stealing. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I watch her like a hawk when she comes to clean, but still I find things missing. I can\u2019t let her rob me blind, and yet I hate to fire her after all these years. What should I do?\u201d She hadn\u2019t really expected him to answer, and he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Then, suddenly, she saw the house. They were on Chestnut Avenue, where they\u2019d lived since 1961. She walked laboriously to the front door, holding on to the railing and taking the steps one at a time. When she looked up to thank George for helping her, her beloved husband had vanished.</p><p>\u201cOh, George,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cCome back to me...please. Please come back.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Susannah Nelson dumped the leftover broccoli salad into a plastic container and shoved it inside the refrigerator, closing the door with unnecessary force. Brian, her seventeen-year-old, had mysteriously disappeared after dinner, leaving her with the dishes. She shouldn\u2019t be surprised. He had a convenient excuse every night to get out of doing his assigned chores.</p><p>\u201cIs something bothering you?\u201d her husband asked from his perch in the family room. Joe lowered the newspaper and all Susannah could see were his dark brows and his eyes behind the steel-rimmed reading glasses.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve noticed, but this is the third night in a row that Brian hasn\u2019t done the dishes,\u201d she said, more sharply than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do them,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Susannah told him. \u201cNor should I.\u201d</p><p>Joe set the newspaper aside. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Brian, is it? You\u2019re upset about something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am annoyed about the way he\u2019s been skipping out on chores, but you\u2019re right, that isn\u2019t everything.\u201d What concerned her most was her inability to identify a specific reason. She\u2019d been on edge for weeks, feeling vaguely dejected.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that she\u2019d dreamed of Jake again last night. Her high school boyfriend had been making nightly appearances, and that unsettled her as much as anything. Susannah was happily married and despite the abrupt ending to her teenage romance, there was no good reason for her to dwell on Jake. Her marriage had survived the crises that any successful marriage does. Her children were nearly grown; her daughter was in college, ready to start her own life. Brian had summer employment, working for a construction company, and would earn enough to pay his own car insurance. The school break would officially begin in a day\u2019s time, and she\u2019d be free for nearly seven weeks. Why, after more than three decades, was she dreaming of Jake? It made no sense whatsoever. There he was, big as life, filling her head with memories of a long-lost love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSchool\u2019s almost out,\u201d Joe reminded her. \u201cThat should cheer you up.\u201d</p><p>He was right; it should. Today was the last day of classes and her fifth-grade students had been overjoyed at the prospect of summer vacation. Susannah was equally ready for a break. Maybe for more than a break\u2014a change. What kind of change, she didn\u2019t know. She supposed she could think about it over the summer\u2014after tomorrow, anyway, when she\u2019d be finishing her paperwork.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been restless since your father died,\u201d Joe commented in a mild voice. He glanced at her across the family room. \u201cMaybe you should talk to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I should talk to a counselor?\u201d She hated to think it had come to this. Yes, her father\u2019s death had been a shock, but at the time her grief had seemed...formal. Almost abstract. As though she\u2019d mourned the idea of losing a father more than the man himself. She\u2019d never gotten along with him. They\u2019d tolerated each other, at best. As far as Susannah was concerned, her father was dictatorial, overbearing and arrogant. The moment she turned eighteen, she couldn\u2019t get away from him fast enough.</p> <p>\u201cHe was your father, Susannah,\u201d Joe reminded her gently. \u201cI know the two of you weren\u2019t close, but he was still your father.\u201d He removed his glasses. \u201cIn fact, maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re feeling like this. Now that he\u2019s dead, there\u2019s no opportunity to settle your differences\u2014to work things out.\u201d</p><p>Susannah shook her head, dismissing the suggestion. Her relationship with her father had been difficult. Complicated. But she\u2019d accepted that reality years ago. \u201cThis has nothing to do with him.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked as if he wanted to argue, but she didn\u2019t let him. \u201cYes, his death was unexpected, but he was eighty-three and no one lives forever.\u201d The truth of the matter was that while they weren\u2019t completely estranged, they rarely spoke. That didn\u2019t seem to bother him any. Over the years, Susannah had made occasional efforts to bridge the gap between them, but her father seemed incapable of deepening their relationship.</p><p>Whenever she\u2019d phoned or visited, Susannah talked to her mother. George Leary was a decent grandfather; she\u2019d say that for him. Both Chrissie and Brian thought the world of her father. As for her\u2014well, it was better to not think about the way he\u2019d interfered with her life, especially during her teenage years. Yes, she was sorry he\u2019d died, especially so suddenly, but she discounted the possibility that his death was the cause of this discontent she felt. If she was going to blame anyone, it would be Jake. But it wasn\u2019t as though she could mention this to Joe, her husband, her wonderful husband. Hey, honey, I\u2019ve been thinking about another man lately. That wouldn\u2019t go over too well, no matter how understanding Joe was.</p><p>Her husband continued to study her. \u201cEven though you don\u2019t agree,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cI suspect your father\u2019s death had a strong impact on you. Don\u2019t you remember what it was like when my parents died?\u201d</p> <p>She did remember and was embarrassed to admit that she\u2019d grieved for her father-in-law more than she had her own dad. When Joe\u2019s mother died ten months later, they\u2019d both been devastated. It had been a rough time for them as a family. Susannah had envied Joe\u2019s close relationship with his parents when her own, particularly with her father, was so distant.</p><p>\u201cOf course it was a shock to lose my dad,\u201d Susannah went on, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think this mood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepression,\u201d Joe inserted. \u201cLow-grade, garden variety depression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not depressed.\u201d Even while she denied it, she knew Joe was right.</p><p>Her husband raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t depressed, then what is it?\u201d</p><p>Joe was a solid, strong, self-assured man. Honorable. After twenty-four years together they\u2019d grown accustomed to each other, so alike that they often ordered the same thing from a menu, read the same books, voted for the same candidates. She didn\u2019t understand how she could lie beside him in the same bed night after night and dream about another man. This wasn\u2019t like her. Not once in her entire marriage had she even considered looking at another man.</p> <p>She\u2019d be crazy to risk her marriage by searching for a high school fling. The episode with Jake was long over. She hadn\u2019t seen or talked to him since she was seventeen, and that was...oh, more than thirty-three years ago now.</p><p>Joe replaced his glasses after polishing the lenses on his shirt. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a lot going on in the last six months. Your father\u2019s death, your fiftieth birthday, a demanding year at work and everything else.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t telling Susannah anything she didn\u2019t know. Perhaps those were the reasons for this discontent, this need to find out about Jake, but she doubted it. Even gardening, her passion, didn\u2019t soothe her\u2014or distract her. While she was quick to deny that anything was wrong, Susannah felt certain it all went back to her high school boyfriend and the way their relationship had ended. What she needed was closure\u2014that irritating, overused word. And yet nothing else quite explained it. Jake was an unfinished part of her life, a thread left hanging, a path not taken.</p><p>In that sense, her father\u2019s death had triggered her unease, her recurring memories of Jake, since George was the one responsible for breaking them up. As always, he\u2019d been so sure he knew best. The problem was that he sat on his high and mighty judgment seat in court during the day and didn\u2019t step down from it when he came home to his family at night.</p><p>Susannah refused to dwell on thoughts of her father, refused to let herself nurture these negative feelings toward him. But tonight, for reasons she didn\u2019t understand, her memories of Jake wouldn\u2019t leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cIt might be a good idea for you to spend a few weeks with your mother this summer. Perhaps then you\u2019ll find some resolution concerning your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Susannah agreed, although she didn\u2019t really believe it. They\u2019d already decided she should visit Vivian once the summer holidays started, to check up on her and assess the situation.</p><p>The phone pealed in the distance, but neither Joe nor Susannah hurried to answer it. With a teenager in the house, there was no need.</p> <p>Brian stuck his head out his bedroom door and shouted her name at an ear-splitting decibel. \u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>Susannah wanted to ask him who it was, but he\u2019d retreated into his bedroom so fast she didn\u2019t have a chance. Walking over to the kitchen phone, she lifted the receiver and waited for him to hang up.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusannah, is that you?\u201d</p><p>The female voice was familiar, but she couldn\u2019t immediately place it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Martha West. I\u2019m sorry to bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s okay.\u201d Susannah tensed. Martha had been the family housekeeper for years. The only reason she\u2019d be calling was to tell her something had happened to her mother. \u201cIs everything all right with Mom?\u201d The last time Martha phoned had been with the news that Susannah\u2019s father had dropped dead of a heart attack.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just fine,\u201d Martha assured her. \u201cI did want to talk to you, though, before you drove here. Vivian mentioned that you planned to visit soon and, well...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to say this.\u201d Again she paused. \u201cSusannah, your mother seems to think I\u2019m...taking her things. I hope you know I\u2019d never do anything like that. I swear I had nothing to do with those missing teaspoons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeaspoons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother accused me of taking four of her matching teaspoons when I was there to clean this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartha, I know you\u2019d never do anything like that.\u201d The woman was completely trustworthy.</p><p>\u201cI would hope not,\u201d she blurted. \u201cAnd let me tell you that if I was going to steal, it wouldn\u2019t be teaspoons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she said I hid her purse. I searched for an hour and found it tucked behind the sofa cushions. When I showed it to her, she said I was the one who\u2019d put it there.\u201d</p><p>Susannah groaned. \u201cOh, Martha, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with her,\u201d the housekeeper said, sounding exasperated. \u201cNothing\u2019s been the same since your father died. One day she\u2019s her normal self and the next, well, I hardly know her anymore. She asked me why I\u2019d take her things. I would never! You know that. Teaspoons? She believes I walked away with her teaspoons and God help me, even though I looked everywhere, I couldn\u2019t find them. But I didn\u2019t take them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t. I\u2019ll talk to her,\u201d Susannah promised.</p><p>\u201cSo she hasn\u2019t said anything to you about me supposedly stealing her things?\u201d Martha asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This was a half truth. In their last conversation, her mother had said she wanted to have a talk about Martha once Susannah arrived. Susannah had assumed that the housekeeper was planning to retire. As it was, Martha cleaned the house only twice a week now. She was getting on in years, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her,\u201d Susannah said a second time\u2014although she had no idea what she\u2019d say.</p><p>\u201cPlease do, and if you can\u2019t convince her that I\u2019m an honest and loyal employee then...then maybe I should look for work elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Susannah pleaded. \u201cGive me a chance to get to the bottom of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Martha seemed somewhat appeased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch when I get there,\u201d Susannah said.</p><p>After a few words of farewell, Martha ended the conversation and Susannah replaced the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Joe asked as he refolded the evening paper.</p><p>Susannah sighed deeply and told him.</p><p>\u201cYou did say your mother seems awfully forgetful these days.\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cI talk to her almost daily, but there\u2019s only so much information I can get over the phone.\u201d She sighed again. \u201cMom keeps telling me the same things over and over, but I thought that was simply old age. Maybe it\u2019s more than that.\u201d Many of her friends faced similar concerns with their aging parents.</p><p>\u201cWhat about asking one of her friends?\u201d Joe came into the kitchen and stood beside her. Gazing down at her, he clasped her shoulders, his eyes serious.</p><p>She looked up at him with a resigned smile. \u201cI\u2019ll give Mrs. Henderson a call. She\u2019s been Mom\u2019s neighbor for years.\u201d</p><p>After finding the Hendersons\u2019 phone number, Susannah reached for the phone again. When the initial greetings were dispensed with, she was quick to get to the reason for her call. \u201cI\u2019m worried about my mother, Mrs. Henderson. Have you talked to her lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Rachel Henderson told her, \u201cshe\u2019s often out puttering in her garden\u2014not that she gets much done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she...mentally?\u201d Susannah asked next.</p><p>\u201cWell, to be honest, she just hasn\u2019t been herself since she lost George,\u201d the neighbor said thoughtfully. \u201cI can\u2019t say exactly what\u2019s going on...but I\u2019m afraid something isn\u2019t right with Vivian.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d Susannah asked. Joe walked over to the coffeepot and poured himself a mug while watching her.</p><p>She knew. Deep down, Susannah had known for weeks that her mother was having problems. She\u2019d sensed changes in Vivian even before her father\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cI realize you talk to your mother a lot and I don\u2019t mean to be putting my nose in where it doesn\u2019t belong. Al said I should mind my own business, but then this evening...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened this evening?\u201d Susannah asked, suddenly nervous.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that Vivian hasn\u2019t adjusted well to losing your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her mother was often weepy and sad, talking endlessly about George and how desperately she missed him. Susannah had driven across the mountains to visit over spring break but had only been able to stay four days. Vivian had clung to her, pleaded with her to remain in Colville longer, but Susannah couldn\u2019t. Driving there and back meant the better part of two days, and that left only one day to prepare for school.</p><p>Susannah had tried to talk her mother into moving to Seattle, but Vivian had stubbornly refused to consider it. She didn\u2019t want to leave Colville, where she\u2019d been born and raised. Her surviving friends all lived in the small town sixty-three miles north of Spokane.</p><p>\u201cSomething happened this evening?\u201d Susannah repeated, wanting Rachel to get to the point.</p><p>\u201cI know this may shock you, but your mother asked me to help her find George.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Susannah\u2019s eyes shot to Joe. \u201cShe thinks my dad\u2019s alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe claims she saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Susannah muttered.</p><p>\u201cShe was wandering down the street, looking confused. I got worried, so I went after her. Then she started talking all this nonsense about George\u2014how he brought her home and then disappeared. When was the last time you saw her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarch.\u201d Susannah knew she needed to visit Colville more often, but she hadn\u2019t been able to make it during the last few months. Between Brian\u2019s sports, other commitments, including a teaching workshop, and social engagements, there hadn\u2019t been a single free weekend. Guilt felt like a lead weight dragging her down. \u201cI planned to drive over this weekend. School\u2019s out for the summer and I\u2019m going to spend a couple of weeks with Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wise,\u201d Mrs. Henderson said. \u201cShe\u2019s lost weight, you know.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother was barely a hundred and ten pounds when Susannah had seen her in March.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she cooks anymore,\u201d her neighbor went on.</p><p>During her visit, Vivian had asked her to make dinner every night. Susannah hadn\u2019t minded and the shelves certainly seemed to be well stocked. Although Susannah had noticed a number of gourmet items her mother had never purchased before. Like fancy mustards. And sun-dried tomatoes in pesto, which Susannah had used in a pasta sauce.</p><p>\u201cYou mean she isn\u2019t eating?\u201d Susannah clarified.</p><p>\u201cNot much, as far as I can tell. I keep inviting her over for dinner, but she refuses every time. I\u2019m not the only one she\u2019s refused, either. She seems to be holed up in the house and barely comes out, except to work in her garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d Her mother had always been social, enjoying the company of others, hosting parties for George and their friends.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask her that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut on the phone she talks as if she sees you quite a bit,\u201d Susannah said. It wasn\u2019t like her mother to lie.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, we chat over the fence, but I swear...\u201d Mrs. Henderson paused. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m not sure your mother knows who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d This was what Susannah feared most. Her mother was losing her memory, and it seemed due to more than the erosion of old age.</p><p>\u201cAnother thing,\u201d Mrs. Henderson said, hesitating again.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Susannah urged.</p><p>\u201cThe other day when I went to check on her, I found her sitting in the dark. Turns out she forgot to pay the electric bill. She felt embarrassed about it, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019d like me saying anything to you, but I felt you should know.\u201d</p><p>Susannah groaned inwardly. These were the very things she\u2019d worried about. Bills unpaid, the stove left on, meals and appointments forgotten.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d Mrs. Henderson rushed to add. \u201cI helped her get it straightened out and her lights are back on. Like I said, she told me you\u2019d be visiting soon and I thought I\u2019d talk to you then, but this business with her seeing George\u2014now, that\u2019s got me worried.\u201d</p><p>It worried Susannah, too. She wished Mrs. Henderson had contacted her earlier. \u201cI tried to talk to Mom about moving into assisted living when I was there in the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she told me. It upset her something fierce that you were going to kick her out of her own house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that?\u201d Susannah\u2019s stomach tightened. She was hurt that her mother would even think such a thing, let alone voice it to a neighbor.</p><p>\u201cYes, but quite honestly, Susannah, I don\u2019t feel she should be on her own any longer.\u201d</p><p>Susannah should\u2019ve insisted back in March, but she hadn\u2019t felt she could take her mother out of her home so soon after a major loss. She\u2019d had enough upheaval in her life. Evidently it\u2019d been a mistake not to act sooner.</p><p>Susannah ran one hand through the soft curls that had fallen onto her forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt might be best if you came right away,\u201d Mrs. Henderson suggested. \u201cI would\u2019ve phoned you myself, but Al said I should keep out of it. Seeing that you phoned me, well, I figured I\u2019d better tell you what\u2019s going on with your mother. I hope that\u2019s okay?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful you told me,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cI\u2019ll drive over as soon as I can make arrangements.\u201d</p><p>After a brief farewell, Susannah replaced the receiver. Joe leaned against the counter, still watching her, coffee mug in hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s worse than I thought,\u201d she said, answering his unspoken question. \u201cApparently she\u2019s wandering around the neighborhood looking for my father.\u201d</p><p>Joe released a low whistle. \u201cYou\u2019re going over right away, then?\u201d Originally Susannah had intended to wait for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cI guess that would be for the best.\u201d Then, thinking out loud, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t have any choice but to put her in an assisted-living facility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>Susannah pinched the bridge of her nose, dreading the approaching confrontation. Her mother would fight her on this. She didn\u2019t doubt that for a minute.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go with you? Perhaps the two of us will be able to talk some sense into her.\u201d</p><p>Susannah shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d He frowned as though disappointed. \u201cYou were wonderful when my parents died, Suze. I want to be there for you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Susannah was afraid she\u2019d cry. \u201cNo...I need to do this on my own. I\u2019ve decided,\u201d she said, the idea taking shape in her mind as she spoke, \u201cthat I\u2019ll stay in Colville for a while.\u201d Although it was crazy to even consider the idea, she might be able to find out where Jake was living. She had to talk to him, had to find out what had happened and why. Susannah knew her father had something to do with the breakup; she just didn\u2019t know the details. Maybe, once she learned the truth, she could put an end to this fantasizing about Jake.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Joe sighed heavily. \u201cBut after you convince her to move, you\u2019ll have to make a decision about the house.\u201d</p><p>Susannah hadn\u2019t even thought of that. All at once the task seemed overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t meet his eyes while she contemplated spending time in Colville. \u201cThree weeks should do it, I imagine. Possibly a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t going to be easy to talk my mother into leaving her home,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the matter of arranging assisted-living accommodation for her. And cleaning the house. Whether I decide to rent it or put it on the market, either way it\u2019ll need to be cleared out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could help. Brian, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can manage.\u201d She appreciated the offer, but she wanted to spend time with her mother\u2014just the two of them. Not only that, she had a private agenda concerning Jake, an agenda she couldn\u2019t confide to her husband. She had to resolve that problem on her own. If Joe and Brian were there, she\u2019d be torn between her present and her past. \u201cPerhaps on the weekends, if you want.\u201d As a dentist, Joe couldn\u2019t change his appointment schedule at the last minute.</p><p>\u201cBrian and I have our fishing trip scheduled for next weekend, but we can cancel that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d she protested. It was hard enough for the two of them to find time together.</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cThen we\u2019ll try to come one weekend after that.\u201d He put down his coffee mug and glanced at her, a half smile on his face. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019re going to learn a lot more than you expected from all of this.\u201d</p><p>Susannah suspected he was right.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Chrissie Nelson shoved the last of her clothes into her suitcase and looked anxiously out her dorm room window. Jason was late. He\u2019d promised to be here by ten to take her to the airport. School was over and the dorm was mostly deserted. She\u2019d be flying out of Eugene, where she attended the University of Oregon, to Seattle for the summer. The end of the school year didn\u2019t thrill her, mostly because she\u2019d be leaving Jason behind. She wasn\u2019t like some of her friends, eager to return home. In fact, Chrissie dreaded the emptiness that lay ahead.</p><p>Pushing her long straight blond hair over her shoulder, she suppressed a deep sigh. Her roommate, Katie Robertson, had left the night before, and so had several of her other friends. Jason had driven Katie to the airport, but Chrissie\u2019s flight wasn\u2019t until today. He\u2019d stopped by the dorm after he\u2019d dropped Katie off; he and Chrissie had gone out for a farewell drink and he\u2019d promised to meet her in plenty of time for her 11:30 flight. When he\u2019d picked Katie up, he\u2019d arrived with two hours to spare\u2014and he\u2019d waited with her at the airport. Chrissie had a niggling sensation that he\u2019d been more solicitous than necessary....</p><p>That made it sound as if she was jealous and she wasn\u2019t. Jason had never given Chrissie the slightest reason to doubt his devotion. He was simply thoughtful. Latching her suitcase closed, she grunted as she lifted it off the mattress with both hands and set it on the floor.</p><p>The problem with going home for the summer was that she didn\u2019t have a job. And at this late date, the prospects of decent employment were slim to none.</p><p>She was almost twenty and still tied to her parents. Chrissie hated that. The idea of being at home for the next eight or ten weeks\u2014and dependent on her parents for spending money\u2014depressed her. She preferred to stay in Eugene, but her part-time job on campus had ended with the semester. Next year everything would be different; Chrissie intended to make sure of that. This would be her last summer in Seattle. She was an adult, and she wanted to live her own life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as she got home, she planned to tell her parents that she was moving out of the dorm. Two other girls had invited her to live off-campus with them in a small house. They\u2019d divide the rent, and it would be much cheaper than living at the university for a third year. It would be a good experience, she\u2019d tell her parents, plus it would save them money. She was perfectly capable of managing on her own. Her father would listen to reason, but she wasn\u2019t sure she could count on her mother.</p><p>Jason\u2019s Honda Civic pulled up to the curb. Chrissie leaned out the window and waved. He climbed out of his car, glanced up and smiled, then waved back. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he called.</p><p>That was typical of Jason\u2014always considerate. She felt fortunate to be with him. They\u2019d met on a blind date and he\u2019d impressed her the moment they began to talk. They had a lot in common, but that didn\u2019t mean they were alike. Far from it. Jason, a law student specializing in accounting law, was about as conservative as they came. His grades were high and his work habits disciplined and methodical. Chrissie, on the other hand, was carefree and fun-loving, and something of a procrastinator. The problem, she\u2019d decided, was that she worked best under pressure. Term papers were written the night before they were due. What other people failed to understand, she often explained righteously, was that she\u2019d been thinking about the subject for weeks, gathering the needed data. Starting it early wouldn\u2019t have improved the end product.</p><p>Jason never left anything to the last minute and her delay tactics exasperated him. Still, they were crazy about each other. He did occasionally try to change her ways\u2014and vice versa. At least he didn\u2019t constantly complain about her study habits like her parents did. Her grades weren\u2019t any worse in college than they\u2019d been in high school. Okay, they weren\u2019t great but she never got less than a C. The major reason she\u2019d decided on college was because all her friends were going. Everyone just expected her to continue her education, and she hadn\u2019t come up with anything she\u2019d rather do.</p> <p>She stayed more because of the social life than the academics\u2014the parties and the boys. Jason, with his wide muscular shoulders, could have been a football player, but sports were of little interest to him. He dressed for class as if he were going into an office, wearing sweaters and slacks in the winter and short-sleeve shirts and Dockers in the summer. His hair was conservatively cut, above the ear. Basically, he was every mother\u2019s dream. Her dream, too, although she would never have expected to fall for a guy like him.</p><p>On that first date with Jason, she\u2019d tried to find the beast within, striving to break through his proprieties, with limited success. She was convinced there was a bad boy inside him waiting to emerge and Chrissie wanted to find him. Jason certainly didn\u2019t object, and while they were different they were also good together. He appreciated her spontaneity and lightheartedness. She liked the fact that he was reliable and thoughtful. And although they might argue about everything from politics to movies, they had an enjoyable time making up afterward.</p><p>Needless to say, her parents were thrilled with him, and who wouldn\u2019t be? He was as close to perfect a boyfriend for their daughter as they could hope for. She and Jason hadn\u2019t talked about marriage yet, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise her if he gave her an engagement ring at Christmas.</p><p>Jason came into her room and heaved the heavy suitcase into his arms. Grunting and panting, he maneuvered it down the stairs\u2014no elevator in her building\u2014while she carried her backpack and purse.</p><p>When they reached the bottom, Chrissie cast him a woebegone look. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said without meeting her eyes. But that could\u2019ve been because he was busy hoisting the suitcase into his trunk.</p><p>Still, his offhand remark startled her. \u201cIt will?\u201d She found that hard to believe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you like crazy, but before we know it you\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>His cavalier attitude was completely unexpected. She wanted him to feel as bereft as she did; obviously he didn\u2019t. Eyeing him closely, she wondered if she was reading more into his comment than warranted. She didn\u2019t want to sound like a whiny ten-year-old, but she was taken aback by his response.</p><p>She decided not to overreact. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. Besides, I can come and visit you over the Fourth of July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to save your money for school?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, as if financial concerns were of little significance. She\u2019d assumed he\u2019d leap at the suggestion. Apparently not. A moment later, Jason took Chrissie by the shoulders and astonished her by kissing her long and hard. Normally, he frowned on public displays of affection, but today nothing about him was the same. She reveled in his moist lips molding to hers as he held her close. \u201cNext summer...\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNext summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to stay in Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d With that, he placed her backpack carefully beside the heavy bag and shut the trunk.</p><p>\u201cFirst things first,\u201d she said as Jason opened the passenger door.</p><p>He hesitated, looking puzzled.</p> <p>\u201cI have to convince my mother to let me move out of the dorm before I talk to her about staying in Eugene next summer,\u201d she elaborated.</p><p>\u201cYou really have a thing about your mother, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Chrissie flared.</p><p>\u201cYou always seem worried about what she\u2019s going to say.\u201d</p><p>His observation irritated her. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to argue, but he\u2019d totally missed the point.</p><p>\u201cYou just said you had to get your mother to agree that you can rent with Joan and Katie,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFor the last week, ever since final exams, you\u2019ve been complaining about going home and having to deal with her. Not once did you mention your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is the more reasonable of the two.\u201d She was furious that Jason would even suggest she had a problem with her mother.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, it\u2019s fairly common, you know? Mother-daughter conflict, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Chrissie said coldly as she climbed into the passenger seat and without waiting closed the door. She fastened the seat belt while Jason walked around to the other side of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cYou and your mother seem to have these underlying issues,\u201d he said when he got into the car. He inserted the key into the ignition.</p><p>She stared at him, annoyed that he was pursuing the subject. \u201cAre you trying to start a fight?\u201d she asked, refusing to be drawn into one.</p><p>Jason turned to her, then gradually smiled. \u201cNot really. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t act as if you\u2019re going to miss me all that much,\u201d she said, and immediately wanted to swallow her words. They made her seem insecure and she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIs it because I didn\u2019t encourage you to fly down for the Fourth of July? If so, the reason\u2014aside from not wanting you to spend the airfare\u2014is that I already have plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents asked me to visit them and I said I would.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape Chrissie\u2019s notice that he didn\u2019t invite her to join him and his family.</p><p>\u201cAre you glad I\u2019m leaving Eugene?\u201d she asked. She knew he\u2019d be staying; he was fortunate enough to have a full-time summer job with a big law firm. His family lived in Grants Pass, a couple of hours away.</p><p>Jason sighed as if she were behaving like a difficult child. \u201cForget I asked,\u201d she snapped. \u201cIt was a stupid question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d Jason said. He gripped the steering wheel with both hands. \u201cWhy are you being so sensitive?\u201d</p><p>He was right; she was overreacting, even though she\u2019d vowed not to. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to go back to Seattle for the summer. Maybe I\u2019d rather be here with you instead of trapped in a house with my mother for the next ten weeks.\u201d The moment she mentioned her mother, Chrissie realized she\u2019d said the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to her, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what? My relationship with her? My mother\u2019s so caught up in her own world that she can\u2019t be bothered with me.\u201d</p><p>Jason stopped at a traffic signal. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know? You only met her once.\u201d Chrissie had brought Jason home at Easter and he\u2019d spent three days with her family. The visit had been a success on all counts.</p><p>As they\u2019d pulled out of the family driveway, Chrissie had basked in her parents\u2019 approval. Both of them had liked Jason immensely.</p><p>\u201cYou have wonderful parents, Chrissie,\u201d he said now.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014but my mother\u2019s going to make my life hell this summer. She\u2019s upset with me for not having a job, although she\u2019d never come right out and say so. Instead, she\u2019ll find a hundred different things to criticize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to look for a job over spring break,\u201d Jason reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI was, but I got busy\u2014the time just slipped away. Don\u2019t you start on me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what this summer\u2019s going to be like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Chrissie. It\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me give you an example,\u201d she broke in, \u201cand this is based on experience. Mom will ask me to clean the bathroom and I will. Then she\u2019ll come in after me and scrub the sink all over again. This is her way of letting me know that I didn\u2019t meet her high standards.\u201d The summer stretched before Chrissie like one long exercise in tolerance and patience. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t like how I cleaned the sink, you\u2019d think she\u2019d just say so, but oh, no, not my mother.\u201d</p><p>Jason muttered something noncommittal.</p><p>\u201cBrian has a job,\u201d she continued. \u201cMom\u2019s already mentioned that fact about fifty times. He\u2019s working for a construction company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making too much of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Chrissie muttered. \u201cWhat she\u2019s really saying is that if I\u2019d looked for a job like she wanted me to over spring break, I\u2019d have one waiting for me now.\u201d She could imagine the constant barrage of digs that lay in store for her. Her mother couldn\u2019t bear the thought of Chrissie being idle all summer, so she\u2019d threaten to line up babysitting jobs for her. Babysitting at almost twenty? In Chrissie\u2019s opinion, that was cruel and unusual punishment.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to believe that finding temporary employment is easy. I suppose I could get a job at a fast-food place, but even those aren\u2019t as available as they used to be. Besides, I don\u2019t want to spend my summer asking someone if they want fries with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d He clearly wasn\u2019t interested in arguing with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs a last resort, my dad will leap to the rescue and offer me a pity job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll bring me to his office and I\u2019ll be reduced to doing menial tasks, for which he\u2019ll pay me minimum wage.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a dreadful summer. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Jason countered absently.</p> <p>Chrissie doubted he\u2019d even heard her. His mind certainly wasn\u2019t on her; that much was apparent. She looked at him and frowned, unsure what to think. Something had changed between them. She could feel it\u2014had felt it from the moment he arrived. Jason had never been late before.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d she asked, then added, \u201cBetween us, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her and shrugged. \u201cSure. Why shouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d</p><p>Instinct said otherwise. \u201cYou drove Katie to the airport last night, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I did.\u201d</p> <p>Chrissie noticed that his hand tightened around the steering wheel. What had happened between him and Katie the night before? She didn\u2019t mention how long he\u2019d spent at the airport. Originally she was supposed to tag along, but Katie had a lot of stuff and it would\u2019ve been a tight fit in a small car, so she\u2019d stayed behind. That, apparently, had been a mistake.</p><p>Nothing had happened, she told herself. Chrissie couldn\u2019t believe Jason would do that to her. Besides, Katie was one of her best friends. They planned on renting a house together in a few months. The last thing Katie would do was steal Jason away from her.</p><p>No, neither of them would betray her, Chrissie thought firmly.</p><p>The rest of the drive was completed in an uncomfortable silence.</p><p>Jason drove up to the curb at the airport and Chrissie climbed out as soon as he came to a stop. Without a word, Jason jumped out and opened the trunk, heaving her suitcase onto the ground.</p><p>\u201cThe summer will go fast,\u201d he said with false cheerfulness. \u201cYou\u2019ll be back here in no time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d she agreed with the same fake exuberance. \u201cNo time at all.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, too, and dragged her bag onto the sidewalk. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better get inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a great summer.\u201d</p><p>She tried to smile. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed her, but it fell short of just about every other kiss they\u2019d exchanged. She was afraid she was losing Jason and it broke her heart.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Susannah wasn\u2019t looking forward to this trip back to Colville. The eastern Washington community was like small towns all over the country. Her eyes went immediately to the town clock, which featured a statue of a frontiersman, as she drove through the city center. Colville with its JCPenney store on Main Street was the big city to many of the smaller communities surrounding it. There was a traffic roundabout now, but while she was growing up, Colville had the only traffic light in Stevens County.</p> <p>It was small-town America at its best.</p><p>And its worst.</p><p>The drive took seven hours with a brief lunch break. As Susannah rolled into the outskirts of town, her tension grew. She turned the music up louder, trying to lose herself in the insistent beat of the Rolling Stones. The first building she passed was the Burger King restaurant, which had closed its doors. It was probably the only franchise in the entire chain to go out of business. The bowling alley came next. The sign out front listed the special of the day as a breakfast of two eggs, toast and coffee for $2.99\u2014up from the $1.99 of her childhood. That had been the special for as long as Susannah could remember.</p><p>She drove past Colville Mortuary, which had once been owned by her uncle Henry, who was long dead now. Susannah had grown up with hordes of cousins, none of whom had settled in the area. They, too, had no reason to stay in Colville.</p><p>As she continued down Main Street, she felt a growing sense of dread. Getting her mother into an assisted-living complex wasn\u2019t a prospect she relished. This anxiety, however, resulted from more than the difficult task that awaited her. When Susannah left Colville for college, she\u2019d never looked back. Oh, she\u2019d returned any number of times over the years, but whenever she did, the familiar depression returned, too. Part of that had to do with her brother\u2019s death; he was killed in a car accident the year she turned eighteen. She was in a French boarding school at the time, and her father\u2019s phone call had come in the middle of the day. A call from America was sure to be bad news. And it was. It\u2019d been the worst news of her life. Her brother, older by three years, had died in a crash on a notoriously bad curve just outside Colville.</p><p>Susannah\u2019s world changed forever that day. If her brother\u2019s death wasn\u2019t devastating enough, her father had refused to fly her home for the funeral. She never forgave him for that. He\u2019d been the one who insisted on shipping her off to France in the first place. Then, while she was so far from home, her whole life had collapsed. Susannah was never the same afterward. Her parents had never recovered, either.</p><p>It seemed to her that whatever happiness her parents had shared vanished after Doug died. Joy fled from their lives, leaving their marriage stark and empty. That was Susannah\u2019s perception, although her mother had a different version of events, a version Susannah considered a case of denial. But then, how could Vivian have stayed with her husband if she\u2019d been honest about her unhappiness\u2014and his role in it?</p><p>When Susannah had returned from her year away, she could barely tolerate living in the same house. After she left for college, she didn\u2019t even consider moving back.</p><p>Doug\u2019s death wasn\u2019t the only reminder she brought with her. She couldn\u2019t come here and not think about Jake Presley\u2014especially now that he\u2019d invaded her dreams on a nightly basis. Any number of times over the years she\u2019d wondered about him, but never more than in the last few months. The sweet tenderness of her first love had been ruined by her father, too.</p><p>Susannah wanted to believe that Jake was happy, a husband and father, and successful in whatever field he\u2019d chosen. It\u2019d taken her a long time to get over him\u2014but she had. Or so she\u2019d thought.</p><p>Shaking her head to clear her mind, Susannah slowed her car to the reduced thirty-five-mile-an-hour speed limit. She passed Benny\u2019s Motel and the Safeway store where her mother had shopped for fifty years. The four-block-square City Park was behind the motel. Farther down the street was Ole King Cole\u2019s restaurant. Every year on Mother\u2019s Day, that was where her father took her mother for dinner. Either there or Acorn\u2019s.</p><p>Refusing to be ambushed by the past, Susannah forced herself to stare straight ahead. When she reached the end of Main, she ventured up the hill toward ChestnutAvenue and her childhood home.</p><p>The light was on, although it was barely five o\u2019clock in the afternoon and summer-bright. Susannah pulled into the driveway and turned off the engine. The screen door opened instantly, as if her mother had been standing on the other side waiting for her arrival.</p><p>The house, built in 1960, was constructed of brick. At the time it had been one of the new ranch-style homes, among the most elaborate in town. It had four bedrooms, one of which her mother used for crafts, plus a finished basement with rec room and laundry.</p><p>And the garden. Her mother\u2019s beautiful garden. Vivian liked to sit there in the cool of the evening and read or knit. Her father had installed lighting on the back deck for that very reason.</p><p>\u201cSusannah.\u201d Vivian held out her arms as Susannah climbed from the car.</p><p>Bounding up the front steps, she was shocked to see how frail her mother had become, especially in such a short time. She appeared to have aged ten years since Susannah\u2019s visit in March. Mrs. Henderson was right; Vivian had lost weight, so much that her clothes hung on her. The belted housedress bagged at the waist and her stockings were wrinkled and loose. Susannah wrapped her arms gently around her mother and felt immersed in guilt. She should\u2019ve come sooner, should have realized how poorly her mother was doing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Vivian said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m here, too,\u201d Susannah told her. Joe would be fine without her for a few weeks. The children, too. But Susannah\u2019s mother needed her.</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d Vivian urged. \u201cI made iced tea.\u201d</p><p>Susannah slipped her arm around her mother\u2019s narrow waist and together they walked inside. She was surprised to see a few newspapers scattered on the steps, still in their protective plastic sleeves. This was unlike her meticulous mother.</p><p>The house was much as she remembered it from her last visit. The chair where her father had watched television every night sat empty. The crocheted doily pinned against the back was still in place.</p><p>Even in his retirement, the television wasn\u2019t allowed on before the five o\u2019clock news. The judge had decreed it and no one dared question his decisions, least of all her mother. Susannah wondered if Vivian watched daytime programs now that her husband was gone. She suspected not. Old habits die hard.</p><p>The kitchen table was set with dishes and silverware. \u201cYou didn\u2019t make dinner, did you?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>Her mother turned from the refrigerator and frowned. \u201cYou told me not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning to take you out to eat, anyplace you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. I was afraid I did something wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>Her smile seemed so fragile, so tentative. After all these years of marriage she was lost without George. Her dependence on him had been absolute, Susannah thought. She blamed her father for that more than she did her mother.</p><p>\u201cSit down and tell me about the children,\u201d her mother said, pulling out a chair at the kitchen table for Susannah. The round oak table was an antique now and the chairs along with it.</p><p>Stepping over to the counter, her mother filled tall glasses and brought them to the table. Then she sat down, looking expectantly at Susannah.</p><p>Susannah sipped her tea. \u201cBrian has a summer job in construction. He\u2019s thrilled and the money is excellent.\u201d</p><p>Her mother smiled with approval. \u201cAnd Christine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s picking her up from the airport this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s smile faded. \u201cShe was away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt school, Mom. Chrissie\u2019s coming home from college for the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course. Chrissie\u2019s away at school now, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She\u2019s about to enter her junior year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a summer job, too?\u201d</p><p>Susannah should have anticipated the question. \u201cNo. Not yet, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll find one.\u201d This was wishful thinking on her part.</p><p>Her mother nodded. \u201cYes, she will. She\u2019s such a beautiful young girl.\u201d Susannah\u2019s gaze drifted into the dining room, where Vivian kept family photos on the buffet. Chrissie\u2019s high school graduation picture stared back at her. Her daughter\u2019s long blond hair, parted in the middle, flowed down over her shoulders as she smiled into the camera. Susannah\u2019s own high school graduation photograph, taken after her return from France, was positioned next to that of her daughter. Her hair had been long and blond then, too, but curlier than Chrissie\u2019s. It had darkened over the years and was now a light shade of brown. These days she kept it short and styled. In her graduation picture, Susannah wore a cap and gown and held her diploma, tilted at an angle as if it were a cherished scroll. It was all for show. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChrissie\u2019s so much like you at that age.\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s gaze flew back to the photographs. Frankly she didn\u2019t see the resemblance. Her daughter was nothing like her in temperament or in looks. At almost twenty, Chrissie still had a lot of growing up to do.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the eyes,\u201d her mother continued.</p><p>Susannah looked again, partly, she supposed, in the hope that her mother was right. For the last year or so, Susannah and Chrissie had been at odds. Not for any particular reason, but over a succession of little things. Susannah felt that her daughter didn\u2019t take life seriously enough. She didn\u2019t put much effort into school and tended to waste time lounging in front of the TV, indulging in long conversations with her friends and sleeping in until noon. Chrissie should have summer employment, but instead of going on a job search, she\u2019d frittered away her spring break, convinced she could charm herself into employment when it suited her.</p> <p>\u201cYour hair was that blond when you were young,\u201d her mother said wistfully.</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t want to disillusion her mother, but Chrissie\u2019s pure blond color came courtesy of an expensive salon.</p><p>\u201cThe minute Joe\u2019s mother set eyes on the baby, she told us Chrissie looked exactly like her aunt Louise,\u201d Susannah commented. Joe had rolled his eyes, but Susannah did see a resemblance. Not then, of course, but more recently.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom, Chrissie\u2019s flying home. Joe\u2019s going to the airport to pick her up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, you said that, didn\u2019t you? I forget sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Mom, we all do.\u201d She gave her mother\u2019s hand a reassuring pat, then stood. \u201cI\u2019d better bring in my suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay more than a day or two this time, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>A smile brightened her mother\u2019s dull eyes. \u201cGood. I hoped you would. I\u2019ve been so lost without your father. And now Martha\u2019s left me, too!\u201d She slipped her hand into the pocket of her dress and removed a tissue to dab her eyes.</p><p>Martha had quit! Susannah groaned inwardly as she walked out of the house and opened the trunk of her car. She brought in a large suitcase; assuming she\u2019d be in town for a few weeks, she\u2019d packed more than her usual overnight bag.</p> <p>Susannah carried her suitcase down the hallway to her childhood bedroom, which remained exactly as it had when she\u2019d lived at home. Her desk was still there; her chair, too. The heavy blue drapes were the same, although faded, and the lighter blue shag carpeting looked terribly dated now. She couldn\u2019t imagine why her parents had never updated their home after she\u2019d graduated from college. It was as if they\u2019d been stuck in a time warp for the last thirty years. There\u2019d certainly been money to make changes.</p><p>\u201cI saw a friend of yours last week,\u201d her mother said, coming to stand in the bedroom doorway, watching Susannah as she unpacked.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Susannah had few friends in town. She\u2019d attended her ten-year reunion, but had felt awkward and out of place. She\u2019d been married to Joe for three years then, and the two of them had stayed at each other\u2019s side. Susannah hadn\u2019t returned for subsequent reunions. She didn\u2019t know these people anymore. Because she\u2019d been away for the last year of school, she hadn\u2019t even graduated with them, not officially.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d her mother said and closed her eyes, forehead creased in thought. \u201cCarolyn!\u201d she said triumphantly. \u201cYou remember Carolyn. Carolyn Bronson.\u201d Her mother paused. \u201cShe said you should phone her sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarolyn Bronson?\u201d Susannah couldn\u2019t believe it. Carolyn had been her best friend and the richest girl in Colville. They\u2019d gone to France together. Her father owned the mill that employed nearly forty percent of the town\u2014or had at one time. With the changes in the lumber industry, Susannah didn\u2019t know how the yard had fared.</p><p>\u201cYou were good friends with her, right?\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen Carolyn in years.\u201d Carolyn had been the one friend from Colville she\u2019d stayed in touch with for a while. Then they\u2019d grown apart and their correspondence had dwindled down to an annual Christmas card. About twenty-five years ago, Susannah\u2019s card had come back stamped: MOVED\u2014NO FORWARDING ADDRESS. She hadn\u2019t heard from Carolyn since. Her mother had read in the paper\u2014she regularly studied the obituaries\u2014that Carolyn\u2019s parents were both gone. Susannah hadn\u2019t realized Carolyn was back in Colville.</p><p>\u201cCarolyn was so excited when I told her you were coming to town. She said she\u2019d love to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid she happen to mention if she was married?\u201d</p><p>Vivian shook her head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, but I think she would have if she was, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn had married shortly after college; it had lasted barely a year. To the best of her knowledge, Carolyn had never remarried. Susannah wondered if the experience of that divorce had left her friend cynical about marriage.</p><p>\u201cI remember her mother,\u201d Vivian murmured, pinching her lips. \u201cShe always acted as if she was better than the rest of us.\u201d Carolyn\u2019s mother had been a war bride from Paris, and in retrospect Susannah thought she\u2019d never really adjusted to life in a small American town. Carolyn had been an only child, and her mother had insisted her daughter attend high school in France. She and Susannah were friends all through grade school and junior high, and then Carolyn had left for a boarding school just outside Paris. They\u2019d written for a while, but their letters became infrequent as they each made new friends.</p><p>Later Susannah\u2019s father had sent her to the same school. Carolyn had been her salvation.</p><p>It was Carolyn who\u2019d cried with her when she learned of Doug\u2019s death. Susannah had been inconsolable and desperate to get home. But that wasn\u2019t to be. She was convinced she wouldn\u2019t have survived the rest of that horrible year without her best friend.</p><p>Back in the United States, they\u2019d attended separate colleges but stayed in touch. That special bond had lasted through Carolyn\u2019s failed marriage. Then Susannah met Joe and they\u2019d married and the friendship had slowly come to an end.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she gave me her number. It\u2019s unlisted.\u201d Her mother seemed flustered for a moment and then relieved. \u201cI remember now, I put it in my purse so I wouldn\u2019t lose it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did Carolyn move back to Colville?\u201d</p><p>Her mother blinked several times, as though this was something she should know and didn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t...remember. I don\u2019t recall if she told me.\u201d Changing the subject, her mother motioned toward the chest of drawers. \u201cShould I clean out the drawers so you\u2019ll have some place to unpack your things? Your father put stuff in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Vivian nodded, then shuffled away, presumably to change clothes.</p><p>Susannah finished her unpacking. Then, taking the cell phone from her purse, she sat on the edge of the bed and punched the number that would dial her Seattle home.</p><p>Her son answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cHello, Brian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom. How\u2019s Grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. Is your father home yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Chrissie\u2019s here, too. We\u2019ve already had a fight over who got to use the phone.\u201d He lowered his voice and it sounded as if he\u2019d cupped his hand around the mouthpiece. \u201cApparently she\u2019s on the outs with Jason and she\u2019s in one bitch of a mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStatic,\u201d Susannah said automatically. That was the term she used whenever her children or her students spoke in an unacceptable way. She\u2019d picked up the habit as a fifth-grade teacher. Her kids might consider her old-fashioned, but she didn\u2019t allow them to use foul language, insulting labels or bad grammar, and that wasn\u2019t a rule she planned to change. She said the word static in order to give the child an opportunity to correct his or her mistake.</p><p>\u201cOne hell\u2014heck of a mood,\u201d Brian amended, \u201cbut she\u2019s been a real you-know-what since she walked in the door.\u201d</p><p>Susannah sighed. \u201cLet me talk to your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She heard Brian shout in a voice loud enough to shatter glass. \u201cDad! It\u2019s Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Chrissie was on the phone first. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Chrissie. Grandma needs me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I need you, too. You should\u2019ve let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re disappointed....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad isn\u2019t any help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you and Jason have a falling out?\u201d</p><p>A half-second pause. \u201cBrian told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Susannah could imagine her daughter sending her brother a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cHow dare he!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong, and I think\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m afraid Jason\u2019s interested in someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ask him?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie hesitated. \u201cNot directly. I probably should have. He hasn\u2019t phoned yet and he said he would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissie, you just got home. Give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>There was a lengthy silence and Susannah sighed again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI guess all you can do is wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked Jason, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much.\u201d God willing, her daughter would one day marry a man like Jason. Not anytime soon, of course. \u201cYou\u2019re upset now, but sleep on it and everything will look better in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you were here,\u201d Chrissie whined. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take me with you? I love Grandma and I\u2019d like to spend time with her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to get to Colville as quickly as possible.\u201d Leave it to Chrissie to make her feel even guiltier. She was tired. School had drained her and nothing about her life felt right.</p><p>\u201cDad said I had to cook dinner,\u201d Chrissie muttered. \u201cHe said that without you here, I\u2019m supposed to take over meals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Dad would find that helpful.\u201d And since her daughter wasn\u2019t working, she could do something around the house, Susannah thought but didn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to be his galley slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne meal a day, Chrissie, is hardly slave labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had plans for tonight.\u201d</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t want to get into an argument with her daughter. \u201cLet me talk to your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but tell him he\u2019s being totally unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>Susannah rolled her eyes toward the ceiling, grateful to have escaped her daughter\u2019s theatrics. Half a minute later, Joe got on the phone.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said. \u201cHow was the drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I listened to music the entire way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid it help?\u201d</p><p>His real question was whether she was still depressed. \u201cI think it did,\u201d she said without a lot of enthusiasm, \u201cI\u2019ll be okay in a week or so.\u201d She prayed that was true.</p><p>For a moment it seemed as if he hadn\u2019t heard her. \u201cDo you intend to visit your father\u2019s grave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSusannah, don\u2019t get all bent out of shape.

Telling Joe her mother was waiting, she ended the conversation and turned off her cell phone. When she glanced up, Vivian stood in the doorway, wearing her church hat and winter coat. \u201cI found Carolyn\u2019s phone number,\u201d she said proudly, holding a small slip of paper.</p><p>\u201cMom, you don\u2019t need your coat. It\u2019s almost eighty degrees outside.\u201d The temperature had flashed from the Colville State Bank as she\u2019d driven through town.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Where would you like to go for dinner?\u201d Susannah asked, assisting her mother out of the heavy coat. She hadn\u2019t changed her dress, and Susannah found her a light sweater to wear instead of the coat.</p><p>\u201cWherever you want, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you decide, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother\u2019s face fell. She seemed uncertain and a bit confused. \u201cThere\u2019s always Benny\u2019s Caf\u00e9, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather go to Acorns?\u201d she asked, knowing that was the place her father would have chosen.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s smile was instantaneous. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved their oysters. No one in town does them better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mom, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when we get back, you\u2019ll phone Carolyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom, I\u2019ll phone Carolyn tonight.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Carolyn Bronson was thrilled to hear from Susannah Leary\u2014no, Susannah Nelson. Naturally, she\u2019d hoped Susannah would phone, but for reasons that were hard to explain, she hadn\u2019t expected her to. It\u2019d been years since they\u2019d last talked, twenty-five years at least. Decades. Now as she drove into town to meet her, she peered through the windshield looking for the tavern the men from the mill frequented most. Less than a mile down the road from Bronson Mill, it was the only place she could think to suggest.</p> <p>When Susannah called an hour ago, they\u2019d had so much to say that it took nearly thirty minutes to get off the phone once they\u2019d agreed on a place to meet. They had a lot of years to catch up on, and neither of them wanted to break the connection.</p><p>The tavern was on the road that led to Colville, where the old A &amp; W drive-in had been when they were growing up. It\u2019d been converted into a pub and it seemed as good a meeting place as any.</p><p>Carolyn thought it was a shame that she\u2019d been back in Colville for over five years and this would be the first time she\u2019d stepped foot in the most popular watering hole for miles around. Even driving below the speed limit, she nearly went past it. She smiled at the name of the tavern. He\u2019s Not Here. That was actually pretty clever.</p><p>Although Carolyn had visited her parents often, she hadn\u2019t looked up old friends. Her high school years had been spent in a boarding school in France, at her mother\u2019s insistence. Carolyn feared she\u2019d been a bitter disappointment to her delicate French mother. Brigitte had tried hard to teach her grace and charm and what she called the art of being a woman. But, while she\u2019d scored top grades academically, Carolyn had failed to meet her mother\u2019s expectations in all other respects, and took after her father\u2019s side of the family. The lumberjack side.</p><p>She\u2019d always been astonished that her parents had gotten together at all. They\u2019d met in Europe during World War II and her mother had become a war bride. More than once Carolyn had wondered if her mother had ever regretted her choice of a husband, whether she\u2019d resented being forced to live in Colville. Brigitte was like an exotic orchid stuck in a row of sturdy sunflowers.</p><p>There were plenty of spaces in the parking lot at the tavern. The light inside was dim and she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d recognize Susannah. Her own hair, still chestnut but streaked with gray, was even longer now than it had been when they were teenagers. She wore it pulled away from her face in a thick braid that fell haphazardly over one shoulder. She had on black jeans and a light summer jacket, which was what she generally wore to the mill. When necessary, she donned more feminine attire, but that wasn\u2019t often.</p><p>She found a booth and slid onto the polished wooden bench to wait. Only a minute or two after she\u2019d arrived, Susannah came through the door, saw her and immediately headed in her direction. Carolyn would have known her anywhere. Susannah hadn\u2019t changed a bit. Oh, perhaps she was a few pounds heavier, but not many, and she wore her hair shorter these days. It was a shade or two darker, as well. She had on white linen pants and a teal sweater with large white flowers on the front.</p><p>Her childhood friend sat down across from her in the booth, facing the door. \u201cMy goodness, when did they get a Wal-Mart in Colville?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn couldn\u2019t remember. There\u2019d been news of it coming for a year or two before the store was actually built. \u201cI came back five years ago, and it was already here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat long? Really? Funny, neither Mom or Dad said anything about it.\u201d She dragged in a deep breath. \u201cYou look fabulous. It\u2019s great to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d Carolyn meant it. She\u2019d always regretted that they\u2019d lost contact. \u201cHow\u2019s your mother?\u201d</p><p>Susannah set her purse on the bench beside her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019s worse than I realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Carolyn said sympathetically.</p><p>Susannah leaned back against the hard wooden booth and sighed. \u201cI took her to dinner, and half the time she thought I was my aunt Jean, who\u2019s been dead for fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>Susannah laughed softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to start talking about Mom. She\u2019s a sweetheart, but ever since my dad died she\u2019s been confused and\u2014\u201d As if catching herself doing it again, Susannah shook her head. \u201cFirst, I want to know how we missed seeing each other all these years.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn shrugged, unwilling to tread through time and examine the might-have-beens, especially those of the last few years. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I was so caught up in what was happening to my family, it was all I could do to deal with that. I moved back just before my father died. He\u2019d been sick for quite a while, and the business had gone downhill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I took over, the mill was on the brink of going under. It\u2019s taken every minute of every day to get back on track, so I haven\u2019t done much socializing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019ve had no life.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn nodded. \u201cThat pretty much sums it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the mill doing these days?\u201d Susannah straightened, a smile on her face. \u201cI have to tell you I\u2019m very impressed that you\u2019re running such an important business. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re solvent and growing.\u201d Carolyn didn\u2019t mean to brag, but the mill was thriving at a time when many others were shutting down. Investing wisely, making the most of foreign trade opportunities and her management skills had brought Bronson Mills from the verge of closing its doors to becoming a major player in the state.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Carolyn asked. \u201cWere you in town a lot?\u201d</p><p>Before her friend could answer, the waitress came for their order and they each asked for a Diet Coke.</p><p>Susannah waited until she\u2019d left before answering. \u201cI didn\u2019t come to town very often\u2014two or three times in the last five years. Until recently, Mom and Dad drove over to the coast to visit me. Dad died last November.\u201d</p><p>Although Susannah mentioned her father\u2019s passing without apparent emotion, Carolyn detected a small quaver in her friend\u2019s voice. Her own father had been dead several years now, but she continued to feel his loss each and every day.</p><p>\u201cYou lost your mom, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>\u201cMom died of cancer about two years ago,\u201d Carolyn said, and while her death was equally painful, Carolyn felt that her mother was ready and, in fact, had welcomed death. Her life had been nothing like she\u2019d dreamed, filled with disappointments and disillusionment. And without her husband, she lost whatever contentment she\u2019d managed to find. Brigitte had not succeeded in making many friends or developing interests of her own; that was something Carolyn didn\u2019t like to think about.</p><p>\u201cDad died of congestive heart failure,\u201d she added. It was a horrible way to die. Carolyn was grateful she\u2019d been with him those last months. They\u2019d always been close, but they\u2019d drawn even closer as the end of his life approached.</p><p>When Carolyn first returned to Colville, she\u2019d assumed she\u2019d be selling off the mill, but during the last months of her father\u2019s life, she realized she couldn\u2019t let go of her heritage. The mill had been in the family for three generations, and now it was hers. Owning Bronson Mills, she\u2019d discovered, was even more of a responsibility than it was a privilege.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Susannah murmured.</p><p>\u201cLosing my dad was hard,\u201d Carolyn admitted. \u201cThe two of us were tight. After I\u2019d been here awhile, I began to feel that no matter where I lived, this town, this place, was my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it\u2014running the mill, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn smiled, embarrassed to admit the depth of her feelings about the family business. \u201cI love it. I didn\u2019t think I would. The only reason I got my MBA was to please Dad, but I promptly took a job in Oregon working with Techtronics. I enjoyed it and advanced to a management position. I\u2019d just been offered another promotion when I got the call from Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe call?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn would never forget that phone conversation. \u201cHis whole life, Dad never asked a single thing of me.\u201d Unlike her mother, who seemed to be consumed by demands, most of which Carolyn was incapable of fulfilling. \u201cHe asked me to come home. He needed me. I put in my notice the next day, packed up and headed for Colville.\u201d</p><p>The waitress returned with their drinks and for a moment they were silent.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew how to help Mom,\u201d Susannah said thoughtfully. \u201cI know I\u2019ll have to move her, but convincing her of that\u2019s going to be hard.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn didn\u2019t envy her friend the task. \u201cWhat are you planning to do with the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I know Mom\u2019s comfortable, I\u2019ll probably put it up for sale. Assisted living is expensive. I was shocked when I made a few phone calls and found out exactly how much it costs. Dad provided for Mom, but their largest asset is the equity they have in the house. There\u2019s no question that I\u2019ll have to sell it, and the sooner the better so I can invest the money.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about taking her to Seattle, to a facility near you?\u201d That seemed more logical to Carolyn.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could get her to budge, but she refuses. Her friends are here\u2014even though she hardly ever sees them\u2014and things are familiar to her. Plus, the housing fees are more reasonable on this side of the mountains than in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you still have your mother,\u201d Carolyn reminded her. \u201cWhen mine died, I had this gut-wrenching revelation that I was an orphan. All alone in the world. I was almost fifty years old and I kept thinking I wasn\u2019t ready to be an adult. Sounds ridiculous, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cI feel the same way. I hate having to make decisions about my mother without Doug to talk to.\u201d She swallowed visibly. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. My brother should be helping me with this. Doug should be here.\u201d</p> <p>Carolyn bent her head to hide her reaction to hearing his name. A twinge of pain passed through her. His death had hit her hard.</p><p>Susannah stared into the distance. \u201cI miss him. My brother died thirty-two years ago, and I still miss him.\u201d She lowered her eyes to her drink and swirled the straw around, clinking the ice cubes against the glass. \u201cDoug and I should be dealing with this together.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn didn\u2019t want to talk about Doug. \u201cYou\u2019re still married, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s what your mother said when I ran into her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes...Joe and I have been together for almost twenty-five years. We have two kids, both nearly grown. Joe\u2019s a dentist and I teach fifth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always thought you\u2019d marry Jake.\u201d As Carolyn recalled, her friend had pined for him the entire nine months she\u2019d spent in France. She\u2019d waited endlessly for his letters. In the beginning he\u2019d written, but he\u2019d stopped after the first few months. Then Doug had been killed and Susannah had gone into a deep depression.</p> <p>A faraway look came over her friend. \u201cI always believed I\u2019d marry him, too....\u201d She ended with a shrug. \u201cHe\u2019d moved by the time I returned from France. I tried to find him but I never could. I wonder what happened to him\u2014why he left and why he didn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn was furious with him for abandoning Susannah when she\u2019d needed him most. She remembered how Susannah had asked around for him after their return. But he was gone; his family, too.</p><p>\u201cMy last time with Jake was horrible,\u201d her friend continued, seemingly lost in her thoughts. \u201cI sneaked out of the house, and we met in my mother\u2019s garden. We sat on that stone bench, behind the trellis. It was always so romantic there, and it smelled so lovely.\u201d She raised her eyes to meet Carolyn\u2019s. \u201cJake wanted me to run away with him and I didn\u2019t have the courage to do it. I was only seventeen. I said no. In the morning my parents drove me to Spokane to catch a flight to France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never heard from him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than those few letters after I left, nothing.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn leaned closer. \u201cYou did the right thing. Can you imagine how you\u2019d feel if your daughter eloped at that age?\u201d</p> <p>Susannah smiled. \u201cThat certainly puts things into perspective, doesn\u2019t it? My daughter is as headstrong as I was and more than a handful. She\u2019s almost twenty and insists she\u2019s an adult, but she acts more like a teenager.\u201d</p><p>Susannah brought out pictures of her children and showed them to Carolyn. Chrissie and Brian were very attractive, and so was Joe, Susannah\u2019s husband, in a solid, appealing way. Although she\u2019d never met him, Carolyn had a positive feeling about Joe\u2014about all of Susannah\u2019s family. She rarely admitted it, but she would\u2019ve liked a husband and children of her own. It hadn\u2019t happened. The divorce had devastated her, and she\u2019d buried herself in her work in an effort to forget. Before she knew it, she was forty and then her father got ill.</p><p>Still, most of the time she didn\u2019t mind being alone. Better that than marriage to a man like her ex-husband, whose repeated infidelity had undermined the little confidence she\u2019d had. In fact, she was shy and always had been. She\u2019d learned to overcompensate in other areas and was an effective manager. Few would guess how difficult it was for her to communicate with a man socially.</p><p>Susannah slipped the photos back inside her purse. When she glanced up, she seemed to study Carolyn, then said, \u201cYou look happy.\u201d</p><p>Her friend\u2019s assessment surprised Carolyn. But Susannah was right. Only recently she\u2019d found herself singing as she dressed for work. The sound of her own voice had caught her off guard and she\u2019d stopped abruptly, wondering what there was to be so excited about. She\u2019d realized then that it wasn\u2019t anything in particular. She was content and had become secure in herself. Yes, every now and then she entertained regrets, but she suspected everyone did. The business was running at a profit and that would have pleased her father beyond any of her other accomplishments. The mill was once again Colville\u2019s main employer and as the mill went, so did the town. She had reason to be proud. The family business had given her a sense of purpose; it was in salvaging Bronson Mills that she\u2019d truly forged her identity.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Carolyn asked, wondering about her friend\u2019s marriage. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Susannah answered quickly, perhaps too quickly. She reached for her Coke. After a moment, she said, \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019ve been depressed and out of sorts for the last few months. Joe says this all goes back to losing my father, but I disagree.\u201d She glanced up. \u201cI...\u201d She hesitated, looking mildly embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Carolyn watched her friend closely.</p> <p>\u201cIt started a little over three months ago. I haven\u2019t told anyone\u2014I can\u2019t. Not even Joe...Out of the blue, Jake came to me in this...this stupid dream. I can\u2019t even tell you what it was about. From that moment on, he\u2019s been on my mind almost constantly, and now he shows up in my dreams practically every night.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cHe\u2019s probably married, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s flirting with danger, but I want to find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do what?\u201d</p><p>Susannah frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. Ask him, I guess, why he never wrote me after Doug died. Ask him why he moved and didn\u2019t tell me where he\u2019d gone. I keep thinking about what would\u2019ve happened if I\u2019d run away with him that night.\u201d</p><p>Nothing good was Carolyn\u2019s guess, but presumably Susannah knew that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve heard if he\u2019s living in the area?\u201d Susannah asked, her eyes alight with hope.</p><p>Carolyn didn\u2019t. \u201cNo, but then I don\u2019t know everyone in town.\u201d</p><p>Susannah pushed the hair away from her forehead. \u201cLike I said, I haven\u2019t told Joe about this. I feel so guilty, as though I\u2019ve been unfaithful, but I haven\u2019t done anything. I wouldn\u2019t risk my marriage over this. I\u2019m just curious, you know?\u201d She looked nervously at Carolyn.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to find out what happened to Jake.\u201d</p><p>Susannah slowly nodded. \u201cYes. I want him to be happy and to let him know that I am, too. I\u2019m not interested in starting an affair.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAs Erma Bombeck once said, I don\u2019t have the underwear for it.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn laughed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this conversation. I have to tell you it feels good to discuss this crazy idea.\u201d She paused, staring into the distance. \u201cAll I want is five minutes with Jake. Even a phone conversation would satisfy my curiosity. Is that so terrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Carolyn understood, but although she didn\u2019t say it, she agreed with Joe. Susannah\u2019s discontent\u2014apparent in this sudden urge to find her high school boyfriend\u2014was somehow connected to her father, to his death. She knew that the relationship between Susannah and her father had been a difficult one; this was a huge loss in Susannah\u2019s life, whether she accepted that or not.</p><p>Once more her friend made a circular motion with her straw setting her ice cubes clinking. \u201cYou were always the kind of friend I could talk to. I would never have made it through those last five months in France without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were good friends,\u201d Carolyn said simply, thinking Maybe we can be again.</p><p>The waitress came by and they ordered fresh drinks. \u201cI should head back to Mom,\u201d Susannah said reluctantly, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to leave. Talking to you has really helped. I don\u2019t feel nearly as guilty or alone as I did earlier. Thank you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how long you\u2019ll be in town?\u201d Carolyn asked. Her friends were few, and she had little life outside of the mill. She gardened, fed the deer that ventured on to her property, did a bit of needlepoint and worked fifty-or sixty-hour weeks. That was the sum total of her activities.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here for two or three weeks,\u201d Susannah told her. \u201cIt all depends on how things go with Mom.\u201d</p><p>The waitress returned with their Diet Cokes.</p><p>Carolyn picked up her drink. \u201cIf you get a chance, stop by the mill and I\u2019ll give you the grand tour.\u201d It would be fun to show her friend the improvements she\u2019d made, even if Susannah didn\u2019t understand their importance.</p><p>They talked for another fifteen minutes, and Susannah tested her French, which after all these years was surprisingly good. Carolyn remained fluently bilingual. Toward the end, Carolyn\u2019s mother had spoken exclusively in her mother tongue.</p><p>\u201cI remember that my conversational French improved according to how much wine I drank,\u201d Susannah said, laughing.</p><p>Carolyn grinned. \u201cMom made me learn French as a child. I grew up speaking both languages.\u201d She rarely used it now, but she certainly didn\u2019t regret having the ability.</p><p>\u201cHave you gone back to Paris since high school?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>\u201cA few times. My grandparents died in the war and I only had one aunt, who never married. My mother didn\u2019t want me to lose my heritage and I\u2019m grateful for the time I had there, but my life is in Colville.\u201d Carolyn knew why her mother had insisted she study in France. She\u2019d been hoping her daughter would meet a nice French boy and fall in love with him. Unfortunately, Brigitte hadn\u2019t realized how closely the nuns watched over their charges at the boarding school. Any chance of meeting boys inside\u2014or outside\u2014those convent walls had been virtually nonexistent.</p><p>Susannah checked the time. \u201cIt\u2019s nine o\u2019clock. I\u2019d better go. Mom\u2019s probably waiting up for me.\u201d She took a deep breath, then said, \u201cI\u2019ve made arrangements to take her to visit a couple of assisted-living facilities tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know yet?\u201d</p><p>Susannah shook her head. \u201cI thought I\u2019d broach the subject over dinner, but I couldn\u2019t do it. Mom was so pleased to have me with her and so excited about going out to a restaurant, I didn\u2019t have the heart to upset her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe misses your father, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreadfully. Which is understandable\u2014they knew each other their entire lives. Mom\u2019s completely at loose ends without him, but that\u2019s not the worst of it.\u201d Susannah shook her head. \u201cAs we were driving back to the house, Mom got very quiet. She said she had something important to tell me. She claimed that my father had come to her earlier this week.\u201d Susannah closed her eyes for a few seconds. \u201cHer neighbor had already told me about this. But to hear Mom describe it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s missing him so much that her mind must be conjuring him up,\u201d Carolyn suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat was my reaction at first, too, but then Mom told me he walked her home. This wasn\u2019t some momentary visit, some trick of the mind. Her hand nearly left bruises on my arm, she was so adamant. My mother says she spent at least half an hour with my father.\u201d</p> <p>Shocked, Carolyn couldn\u2019t come up with anything to say. Except that Mrs. Leary was obviously in bad shape, and Susannah already knew that.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>The next morning, Susannah walked through her mother\u2019s garden, seeking a moment of peace. It was something she often did at home during the summer, wandering through her own garden, assessing the state of her flowers, inhaling their fragrance, making plans for the day. She noticed that Vivian\u2019s plants and flowerbeds were in reasonably good condition\u2014better than she\u2019d expected.</p><p>Afterward, she returned to the house for coffee, hoping there\u2019d be some milk or cream. She opened her mother\u2019s refrigerator and was appalled at what she found. The cheese had grown moldy. A tomato had shriveled up and shrunk to half its original size. Containers filled with leftovers crammed the shelves, most of them several days, if not weeks, old. Along with that, Susannah saw a number of small tinfoil packages; she assumed these were bits of meat. She had no intention of finding out. Almost everything should\u2019ve been discarded long ago.</p><p>The coffee perked in the old-fashioned pot behind her. Of course she hadn\u2019t discovered the carton of milk she\u2019d wanted but the door of the fridge held many small bottles and jars, some of them unopened. Just how many types of mustard could one woman accumulate? Susannah counted twelve different varieties\u2014at least eight more than she\u2019d seen during her visit in March.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you get up,\u201d Vivian said, coming into the kitchen. She tied the sash of her housecoat around her waist. Susannah noticed that her mother had taken to shuffling her feet, as if her slippers were too heavy for her. She took tiny steps and looked so much older than she had even a few months ago.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mom,\u201d Susannah said cheerfully.</p><p>Her mother brought down a cup and saucer from the cupboard and set them next to the coffeepot. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Her mother nodded. \u201cDo you need something?\u201d</p><p>Susannah glanced back inside the refrigerator and remembered her father shouting at her as a kid to close the refrigerator door. \u201cI was looking for milk,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI have lots of milk.\u201d Vivian seemed surprised that Susannah hadn\u2019t found it. \u201cI\u2019m positive I got some just the other day.\u201d</p><p>Susannah moved a number of plastic containers onto the counter and sure enough, an unopened milk carton rested at the back of the top shelf. Bringing it out, she placed it on the table and reached for her cup. The smell alerted her the moment she opened the milk. When she saw that the expiry date was over a month ago, she dumped the thick, lumpy liquid down the drain, running water to lessen the foul odor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d Vivian asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone bad.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s face twisted with displeasure. The narrowed eyes and pinched mouth was an expression Susannah remembered well from her childhood. It was the same frown she got when she\u2019d misbehaved.</p><p>\u201cI think we should take that carton back to Safeway and demand a refund. They sold me spoiled milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Mom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just like those big chain stores to take advantage of a widow. Well, I won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s too early in the morning to get upset. Drink your coffee and we\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d Susannah figured it was pointless to explain that Vivian had bought the milk six or seven weeks ago and then forgotten all about it.</p><p>As her mother poured coffee from the sterling silver coffeepot, her hand trembled. Susannah had to bite her lip to keep from stepping forward and taking over. When Vivian finished, she sat down at the kitchen table, seeming rather pleased with herself. Susannah could only suppose it was because she\u2019d managed without spilling a drop.</p><p>\u201cI had a nice visit with Carolyn Bronson,\u201d Susannah commented, as she joined her mother at the table.</p><p>\u201cWho, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarolyn Bronson. Remember, you saw her recently and she gave you her phone number? We met last night at the pub where the old A &amp; W used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, of course. How are her parents?\u201d</p><p>Susannah found this sporadic forgetfulness frustrating\u2014and sad. But if she reminded Vivian that both Mr. and Mrs. Bronson had died, she might upset her. In any event, she had more pressing subjects to discuss. She decided to be intentionally vague. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bronson is a funny one.\u201d She leaned closer to Susannah and lowered her voice. \u201cShe\u2019s always putting on airs because she\u2019s French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarolyn was one of my best friends all through school,\u201d Susannah said mildly.</p><p>\u201cI tried to be friendly,\u201d her mother continued, ignoring her remark. \u201cWent out of my way, in fact, but apparently I wasn\u2019t good enough for the likes of Brigitte Bronson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarolyn sent you her best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a sweet girl.\u201d Vivian sipped her coffee and again Susannah noticed how her mother\u2019s hand trembled as she lifted the cup. \u201cUnlike her mother...\u201d</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t want to get involved in a mean-spirited conversation about Brigitte, but she knew what Vivian meant. Although nothing was ever said, Susannah had always had the impression that Carolyn\u2019s mother didn\u2019t approve of their friendship. As an adult, she was able to analyze those feelings, understanding that Mrs. Bronson was a woman whose unhappiness made her cold and resentful.</p><p>Susannah waited until her mother had finished her first cup of coffee before she brought up the subject of assisted living. \u201cYou must be rambling around this house all by yourself,\u201d she began casually.</p><p>Her mother stared at her. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you lonely?\u201d</p><p>A soft smile turned up the edges of Vivian\u2019s mouth. \u201cI was until your father came back to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2014\u201d Susannah bit off words of protest. She was afraid that her mother had lost her grip on reality and grown comfortable in her fantasy world.</p><p>Vivian studied her as though waiting for Susannah to comment on her father\u2019s visits.</p><p>\u201cActually, Mom,\u201d Susannah said, gathering her resolve. \u201cThere\u2019s something we need to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Susannah said, praying for the right words. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about you being here all alone, especially now that Martha\u2019s quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d she said, calmly dismissing Susannah\u2019s apprehensions. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you consider moving to Seattle?\u201d That would solve so many problems, but even as Susannah asked she knew it was futile.</p><p>\u201cAnd leave Colville?\u201d Her mother appeared to mull it over, then shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t. Much as I\u2019d love to be closer to you and the grandchildren, I won\u2019t leave my home.\u201d</p><p>Susannah knew that change of any kind terrified Vivian.</p><p>\u201cDoug and your father are buried here,\u201d her mother went on.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends are close by.\u201d</p><p>Most of whom were dead or dying, but Susannah couldn\u2019t bring herself to mention it. \u201cI\u2019d be able to visit far more often,\u201d she offered as enticement, hoping against hope that her mother would see the advantages of moving.</p><p>Vivian sipped her coffee and allowed the cup to linger at her lips a moment longer than usual, as if she was considering the prospect again. Slowly she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear, but this is my home. Seattle is way too big a city for me. I\u2019d be lost there.\u201d</p><p>Susannah reached across the table and took her mother\u2019s fragile hand. \u201cThat\u2019s something else we need to discuss. Mom, I\u2019m afraid this house is too much for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d An edge sharpened her voice.</p><p>\u201cI worry about you here all alone, trying to cope with maintenance and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019ll shovel the sidewalk when it snows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hire a neighborhood boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if a water pipe broke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pipes aren\u2019t going to break, Susannah. Now stop being difficult.\u201d</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t feel she was the one who was being difficult. The more she thought about the problems faced by an elderly person living alone\u2014especially an elderly person losing her memory\u2014the more worried she became.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to come all the way from Seattle to talk such nonsense to me,\u201d Vivian said in a querulous voice.</p><p>Susannah remembered what Mrs. Henderson had said about her attempt to discuss assisted living back in March. That had probably influenced today\u2019s response\u2014if Vivian even remembered the earlier conversation. Regardless, Susannah had hoped that by pointing out a number of practical issues, she could get Vivian to realize on her own the advantages of moving into an assisted-living complex. Clearly that approach wasn\u2019t going to work.</p><p>\u201cMom, I think we need to sell the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Vivian banged her cup against the saucer, her eyes wide. \u201cFor the last time, Susannah, I am not leaving my home. I am stunned that you would even suggest such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother\u2014\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Vivian stood, deposited her cup and saucer in the sink and disappeared down the hallway to her bedroom, muttering as she left.</p><p>Susannah planted her elbows on the table, and cupped her ears with her hands. She closed her eyes, silently praying for wisdom. She hadn\u2019t expected this to be easy, but so far she was getting absolutely nowhere.</p><p>After Vivian had dressed, she came back into the kitchen. Ignoring Susannah, she collected a straw basket and clippers. The garden was in full bloom; irises and roses were two of Susannah\u2019s favorites and they were in abundant display along the white picket fence. The lilacs were pruned and shapely, and their heady scent drifted through the open window.</p><p>Given her mother\u2019s limited endurance, Susannah had been surprised to discover that the garden looked quite good, although the fence was a disaster. The paint had faded and one entire section tilted precariously. Her father would never have allowed that to go unfixed for more than a day. He was a stickler for order, at home and in the courtroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d clean out the refrigerator,\u201d Susannah said, making a peace offering.</p><p>Vivian kept her shoulders stiff as she pulled on her gloves. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want to do, go right ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Susannah walked toward her. \u201cWe still need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot about me moving. That subject is closed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to make sure you\u2019re safe and well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so concerned all of a sudden. Besides, I\u2019m getting stronger every day.\u201d The back screen door slammed as Vivian walked out of the house.</p><p>Susannah sighed heavily. She didn\u2019t want this to dissolve into a battle of wills between her and her mother.</p><p>It took her forty minutes to clean out the refrigerator. She discarded all the containers; the contents of some were impossible to determine. Among the identifiable remains, she found old tuna fish, green-tinged cottage cheese, rotting fruit and vegetables. Her mother saved every scrap and bit. Rather than leave this garbage to smell up the kitchen, she wrapped everything in plastic and carried it outside to the receptacle by the garage.</p><p>As she returned to the house, Susannah noticed that the shelves on the back porch were filled with dozens of senseless items. Her mother must\u2019ve kept every plastic container she\u2019d bought in the last six months. Piles of aluminum trays were neatly stacked, not for recycling, but for some future use. As a daughter of the Depression era, her mother tended to save everything, but it had never been this bad. Even empty toilet paper rolls were carefully piled up.</p> <p>\u201cMom, what do you intend to do with all this stuff?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>Her mother looked over from where she stood in her garden, a hose in one hand, and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m saving it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d She paused. \u201cI never snooped around your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not snooping. Everything\u2019s out in plain sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I question what you save and don\u2019t save?\u201d</p> <p>Susannah had to agree that she didn\u2019t. She went back to the kitchen and wiped the counters. This wasn\u2019t how she wanted the visit to go, but she couldn\u2019t delay the inevitable, either.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to ride down to the grocery store with me, Mom?\u201d she asked when Vivian entered the house.</p><p>Vivian put one long-stem red rose in a vase and set it in the center of the table. \u201cMy lettuce is coming up nicely,\u201d she said with satisfaction. \u201cSo are my herbs. Rosemary\u2019s my favorite, you know.\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cMaybe we could take a drive around town when we\u2019re finished our shopping.\u201d She strived to make this sound like an enjoyable outing.</p><p>Vivian hesitated, as if she wasn\u2019t quite ready to forgive her for their earlier argument. \u201cThat would be nice,\u201d she finally agreed.</p><p>Together they drove to the Safeway. Vivian slipped her arm through Susannah\u2019s as they crossed the parking lot and Susannah had the distinct feeling it was because she needed help maintaining her balance. This was also a silent message to let her know all was forgiven now.</p><p>They loaded the cart with food Susannah hoped would tempt her mother\u2019s appetite. She bought macaroons, her mother\u2019s favorite cookie. Asparagus, Ritz crackers and other treats Susannah knew her mother wouldn\u2019t purchase for herself. She quietly put back a jar of Russian mustard Vivian had placed in the cart, but kept the olives.</p><p>They left the air-conditioned comfort of the store. The sun was out in full force and at ten o\u2019clock it was nearly seventy-five degrees.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a hot one today,\u201d Susannah said as they transferred their groceries to the trunk of her car.</p><p>Her mother responded with a half smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Susannah, but I wouldn\u2019t do well in Seattle. I know you\u2019re disappointed, but I can\u2019t leave Colville. This is my home.\u201d</p><p>A lump momentarily filled Susannah\u2019s throat. \u201cI know, Mom. I don\u2019t want to take away your home. Please understand that I only want what\u2019s best for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who knows what\u2019s best for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are. Assisted living doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll lose your independence. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssisted living? Why bring that up?\u201d Cutting her off, Vivian climbed inside the car and locked the door.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s that,\u201d Susannah said under her breath. She finished unloading the groceries, closed her trunk and parked the cart.</p><p>Opening the driver\u2019s side door, she slid into her vehicle. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to take a look, would it?\u201d</p><p>Her mother refused to answer.</p><p>\u201cMom, please don\u2019t be so stubborn.\u201d</p><p>Vivian turned her head away and gazed out the passenger window. In all her life Susannah had never seen her mother behave quite like this. Susannah had always viewed her mother as a subservient and obedient wife, the passive partner in that marriage. She couldn\u2019t remember her mother going against her father\u2019s dictates even once. Her father, the judge, ruled the home and his family. What he said was law.</p><p>Thinking about it now, Susannah marveled at the fact that, despite her father\u2019s authoritarian ways, Vivian often managed to get what she wanted. The methods she employed were never direct. Vivian was a master manipulator, and that was clearer in retrospect than it had been at the time.</p><p>Now Susannah was compelled to be equally indirect. \u201cI thought we\u2019d go for a short drive,\u201d she said pleasantly. She turned on the ignition and the air-conditioning kicked in, flooding the car with an influx of hot air until it gradually cooled.</p><p>Vivian remained quiet.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me there was a Wal-Mart in town,\u201d Susannah said in conversational tones. \u201cWant to go?\u201d Her mother had always loved shopping.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Vivian smiled then and the tension eased from between Susannah\u2019s shoulder blades.</p><p>Instead of going back to the house to drop off the groceries, Susannah detoured and drove past the first of the assisted-living facilities she\u2019d contacted. It was a modern complex that resembled a nice hotel, with balconies and a fountain in front of the circular driveway.</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t say anything, but slowed as they drove past.</p><p>\u201cYou apparently don\u2019t know your way home anymore,\u201d her mother said, ice dripping from every word.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know where Chestnut Avenue is,\u201d Susannah murmured. She shook her head. Vivian had never been to the assisted-living facility, but she knew exactly where it was located.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that milk to spoil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d Susannah turned and drove toward the house.</p><p>In less than five minutes, Susannah was unloading the car. She put the refrigerator items away and left the rest of the bags on the kitchen counter, afraid that if she delayed too long her mother might change her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Her mother blinked as if confused.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Wal-Mart, remember?\u201d</p><p>Vivian studied her, apparently not sure this was something that interested her.</p><p>Yeah, right, Susannah thought. She had trouble hiding a smile as the two of them went back to the car. The Wal-Mart parking lot was nearly full. This time her mother didn\u2019t slide her arm through Susannah\u2019s, but after a few steps she clasped Susannah\u2019s elbow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen this many people since the Fourth of July parade,\u201d Vivian said as the blue-vested store greeter steered a cart toward them.</p><p>\u201cPayday at the mill,\u201d the woman said, commenting on Vivian\u2019s remark.</p><p>Carolyn was doing well this season, Susannah mused as she allowed her mother to push the cart. Having something to hold on to helped Vivian keep her balance.</p><p>They\u2019d started down the first aisle when Susannah heard someone call her name. She turned to find a tall, slightly overweight woman watching her. It took a moment to realize who this was.</p><p>\u201cSandy? Sandy Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusannah Leary?\u201d</p><p>They broke out laughing at the same time. \u201cMy goodness, it\u2019s years since I saw you.\u201d Sandy\u2019s eyes sparkled with unabashed delight.</p><p>Sandy had been a good friend, the kind of person who always saw things in a positive light. They\u2019d kept in touch after graduation, and Susannah had served as a bridesmaid in Sandy\u2019s wedding when she\u2019d married Russell Giddings, the local pharmacist\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you lived in Colville,\u201d Susannah said.</p><p>\u201cRuss and I have been back for ages.\u201d</p><p>Susannah smiled at Vivian. \u201cYou remember my mother, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Hello, Mrs. Leary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, dear. You were Susannah\u2019s friend, right?\u201d</p><p>Sandy nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter\u2019s trying to move me out of my home,\u201d Vivian announced, loudly enough for several heads to turn in their direction.</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true.\u201d Vivian leaned against the cart. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s living over at Altamira,\u201d Sandy said. \u201cAnd she loves it. She told me she was sorry she waited so long to move.\u201d</p><p>Susannah smiled her gratitude.</p><p>Vivian crossed her arms in defiance. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving my home, and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>Sandy shared a sympathetic look with Susannah. \u201cLet\u2019s get together soon,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Susannah shrugged, unsure what to tell her. Getting Vivian settled was her top priority. \u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d she began, \u201cbut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the phone book, so call me.\u201d Sandy squeezed her elbow, letting Susannah know she understood.</p><p>She would have welcomed the opportunity to visit with Sandy. They\u2019d become friends after Carolyn was shipped off to boarding school. Sandy had been with her the night Jake had first asked her to dance.</p><p>A tingle of happiness went through her at the memory. They\u2019d gone to a school function after the football game\u2014a dance in the high school gym. Jake had been at the game, too, with Sharon, another girl from their class. He\u2019d been talking to the players on the sidelines. Susannah had just started her junior year and Jake was a recent graduate. He worked at the mill and had stopped by the dance\u2014without Sharon. Several of the senior girls flirted outrageously in hopes of getting his attention. Susannah thought he was the cutest boy in the universe, but she was convinced she didn\u2019t have a chance with him. She was only sixteen; he was nineteen.</p><p>When Jake had crossed the gym floor and held out his hand to her, she\u2019d nearly keeled over in a dead faint. He didn\u2019t say a word as he drew her into his arms for a slow dance.</p><p>When the music faded, he\u2019d looked into her eyes, smiled softly and touched her cheek with his index finger. Then, again without speaking, he walked away. If Sandy hadn\u2019t come and collected her from the dance floor, Susannah figured she would\u2019ve stood there like a statue with everyone dancing around her.</p><p>Oh, yes, Susannah definitely wanted to get together with Sandy. And not just because she\u2019d have a chance to talk freely about Jake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is a good price for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s voice cut into Susannah\u2019s musings. \u201cIt is,\u201d she agreed automatically, although she didn\u2019t have a clue what Vivian was talking about. Suddenly\u2014impulsively\u2014she faced her mother. Jake\u2019s name hadn\u2019t been mentioned in over thirty years and it was time for answers.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cDo you know whatever happened to Jake Presley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJake Presley, my boyfriend in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t that singer, was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cThat was Elvis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m asking about Jake Presley. He used to live in Colville, remember?\u201d</p> <p>Her mother considered the question. \u201cWhat did his father do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe worked at the mill.\u201d Susannah strained her memory, but she couldn\u2019t recall his first name. Jake had been an only child. His mother had run off when he was four or five and he lived with his father.</p><p>After a moment, Vivian shook her head. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t remember any Jake Presley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Susannah said and struggled to hide her disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her mother seemed genuinely apologetic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mom,\u201d she said again.</p> <p>Only it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Vivian had turned on the Food Channel, pen and pad on her lap as she wrote down recipe after recipe. Puzzled, Susannah watched her mother. As best as she could figure, Vivian hadn\u2019t cooked a meal in months.</p><p>Susannah hadn\u2019t brought up the subject of assisted living since this morning, but she was biding her time. Getting her mother to be reasonable would require some inventiveness.</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m going to call Joe and the kids,\u201d she said, getting up from the sofa.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her mother\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t waver from the television screen.</p><p>Susannah walked into the kitchen and picked up her cell phone, which she\u2019d left on the table. She sat down and hit the first button on her speed-dial. Pressing the phone to her ear she waited. Three rings passed before Chrissie answered.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d her daughter said, sounding more cheerful than she had in their last conversation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her voice flattened. \u201cHow\u2019s Grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so enthusiastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s making me cook dinner again,\u201d Chrissie muttered. \u201cHe said I couldn\u2019t make anything that came from a box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father and I are trying to avoid processed foods as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to create a menu for his approval. Can you believe it? I spent two hours in the kitchen this afternoon. This is my vacation, too, and now I\u2019m stuck at home and bored out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t remind Chrissie that if she had a job, none of this would be happening; she knew her words wouldn\u2019t be appreciated any more than her advice would.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from Jason.\u201d Her daughter\u2019s depression and frustration were evident even over the phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder he was so eager for me to go home. It\u2019s just that\u2014oh, never mind, you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ve read the situation correctly? Why not just wait and see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she fumed. Her daughter made a scoffing sound. \u201cI knew something was wrong the minute he came to take me to the airport. A woman knows, Mom. Something happened between him and Katie, and I think it\u2019s been going on for a while. I didn\u2019t pick up on it until that day, and now I\u2019m furious with him and Katie.\u201d</p><p>Susannah had no idea what to say, so she added another lame, \u201cWait and see. It might not be as bad as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, it is.\u201d Chrissie groaned in derision. \u201cThe situation here isn\u2019t helping, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d Chrissie repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re with Grandma and I\u2019m stuck here. Thanks a lot, Mom. Thanks a lot.\u201d Having said that, she slammed down the phone and screamed for Joe.</p><p>A minute later her husband picked up the receiver. \u201cHi, Suze,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s Colville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrowing. There are so many changes I can hardly keep track. I took Mom shopping and she practically bought out the shoe department at Wal-Mart.\u201d</p><p>She heard his gentle amusement. \u201cI wondered where you got your penchant for shoes.\u201d Shoes had always been Susannah\u2019s weakness.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going with your mother?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d She described how her mother had embarrassed her in front of Sandy.</p><p>\u201cShe feels threatened,\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou would, too, in similar circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but...\u201d</p><p>After spending an entire day with her mother and witnessing how easily she tired, Susannah was more concerned than ever. They\u2019d had to stop frequently for breaks; once Vivian had even taken a brief nap on a pull-out sofa in the furniture department, with Susannah standing anxiously by.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to handle this. The minute I bring up the subject of assisted living, she gets defensive and angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you mention the phone call from her neighbor?\u201d</p><p>Susannah straightened. \u201cNo. But maybe if Mrs. Henderson and I both talked to her, Mom might listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might think you\u2019re ganging up on her, too.\u201d</p><p>Her husband had a good point. \u201cYou\u2019re right, she probably will. I\u2019ll tell her about the phone call first and if I have to, I\u2019ll bring in Mrs. Henderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take her to tour any of the facilities?\u201d</p><p>Susannah sighed in discouragement. She hadn\u2019t even gotten close. \u201cI drove past one, and Mom made some sarcastic remark about not knowing the way home.\u201d</p><p>Joe chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s got quite a stubborn streak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember her being like this. My mother was the soul of tact and graciousness, and all of a sudden she\u2019s\u2014\u201d Susannah didn\u2019t finish. She noticed a movement out of the corner of her eye, and turned to look. To her horror, she found her mother in the hallway, listening in on her conversation. Lowering the phone, she whirled around. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>With a sheepish look, her mother walked into the kitchen. Susannah didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been standing there, but suspected it had been quite a while.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d Susannah breathed, shocked that her mother would stoop to eavesdropping. \u201cMy mother was standing in the hallway, listening to our conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving my home,\u201d Vivian said loudly, \u201cand you can\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusannah?\u201d Joe\u2019s voice rang in her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She heard the drone of the disconnected line from her cell phone before she clicked it off.</p><p>\u201cMom, I think we should talk,\u201d Susannah said, gesturing for Vivian to join her.</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re going to say what I think you are.\u201d Her mother started to back out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you curious about why I drove over here earlier than I\u2019d originally planned?\u201d</p><p>Her mother hesitated. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Mom.\u201d Again Susannah motioned toward the other end of the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss my show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Food Channel runs the same episode in the morning, and before you say anything, it\u2019s perfectly all right to watch television in the middle of the day.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes narrowed, and her expression seemed to say she wasn\u2019t sure she should trust her daughter. This wasn\u2019t the way Susannah wanted to begin such a crucial conversation. Instead of arguing further, she leaped into it. \u201cMartha phoned me in Seattle, and I talked to Mrs. Henderson, too.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sat down on the chair, her posture straight, her eyes filled with defiance. \u201cAll right, tell me what Rachel\u2019s saying behind my back. As for that Martha, she\u2019s not to be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, Mrs. Henderson is your friend.\u201d She\u2019d intercede for Martha later.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s jealous of my garden. She always has been.\u201d Her mother crossed her arms defensively. \u201cHer gladioli and irises never do as well as mine. Her roses, either.\u201d</p><p>Susannah intended to avoid that issue, in case it turned into another War of the Roses. \u201cMrs. Henderson called because she was worried about you. So is Martha. Your friends are concerned.\u201d</p><p>A sheepish look came over Vivian. \u201cYou\u2019d be lost and confused, too, if you lost your husband of fifty-nine years.\u201d</p><p>Susannah said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI will die in this house, Susannah. It\u2019s my home. It\u2019s where I belong. I am not moving.\u201d</p><p>The situation was impossible. \u201cMother, please listen because I need you to hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am listening. I just don\u2019t like what I\u2019m hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Dr. Bethel a few days ago, and he agrees it\u2019s time for you to make the transition to a facility.\u201d Susannah had called him the morning of her departure, wanting not only his assessment but any ammunition he could provide.</p><p>Her mother gasped, as if her longtime physician had betrayed her. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make this any more difficult than it already is. I\u2019ve made appointments to tour Altamira and Whispering Willows tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll go by yourself, because I refuse to be part of it.\u201d</p><p>A crescent-shaped moon was tucked in a corner of the sky as Vivian sat in her garden, a wad of tissue in her hand. She couldn\u2019t sleep. The wind-up clock George had used for years had ticked relentlessly at her bedside as she counted off the hours. Soon it would be daylight and she had yet to fall asleep. It felt as if everyone she knew and trusted had turned against her, including her own daughter. She\u2019d once considered Rachel Henderson a friend, but no longer. Even Dr. Bethel and Martha. She wished she could talk to George; he\u2019d know what was best. But he\u2019d only come to her that one time.</p><p>So Vivian had decided to sit outside. Whenever she shut her eyes, all she could think about was the fact that she was going to lose her home. Susannah wanted to move her in with strangers. She couldn\u2019t leave Chestnut Avenue.</p><p>She was old and had lost so much already. She\u2019d buried her husband and her only son. All she had left was her daughter, her house, her things. A lifetime of everything that was most important surrounded her in this home. All her pictures. Her furniture. The crystal vase that had belonged to her grandmother, whose mother had brought it from Poland. Vivian treasured it. Her flowers had never looked more beautiful than in that vase....</p><p>Perhaps worst of all, Susannah was asking her to give up her garden. This was almost more than she could bear. There was comfort in her garden, in its beautiful colors, its scents.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears welled in her eyes and she rested her head against the back of the garden chair and swallowed a wail of grief. Susannah would do it. She\u2019d seen that glint in her daughter\u2019s eye. She\u2019d seen the determined set of Susannah\u2019s mouth. Even as a child, Susannah had been stubborn, often to the extent of foolishness, defying George at every turn. Her only living child would haul her off to an asylum, all the while declaring that it was for Vivian\u2019s own good.</p><p>Exhausted, she finally closed her eyes and slowly rocked, letting the gentle movement lull her into a state of relaxation.</p><p>\u201cVivian.\u201d</p><p>Someone was calling her. A quiet voice far off in the distance. Was it in her mind? Or was it real? Vivian strained to hear. It was her George; she knew that much. George struggling to come to her, struggling to cross the great divide.</p> <p>Vivian\u2019s heart rate accelerated as she opened her eyes. \u201cYes, George, I\u2019m here\u2014I need your help.\u201d She hurried to tell him everything. \u201cSusannah wants to move me into an assisted-living facility. What should I do...Tell me, what should I do?\u201d She waited but no one answered.</p><p>\u201cGeorge, please! I need you to tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>Her cry was met with silence. She peered into the shadowed corners of the garden but saw no sign of him.</p><p>Sobbing openly now, Vivian began to rock back and forth but found little solace. She closed her eyes again, and it was then that she heard a single word float past her, soft as a whisper.</p><p>One word that would change her world. One word that told her what she had to do. One word from George. She\u2019d asked and he\u2019d answered.</p> <p>George told her to go.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Chrissie Nelson stared at the silent telephone and cursed it for the umpteenth time that day. No one had phoned, not even her best friends. Everyone was either vacationing or working, and she was trapped at home and she hated it.</p><p>Getting a job, any job now, was pointless and nearly impossible. She couldn\u2019t even work at her father\u2019s dental office, not that she really wanted to. She\u2019d done that the previous summer and it hadn\u2019t gone well. Okay, so maybe she wasn\u2019t as reliable as he thought she should be; apparently he was still annoyed about the days she\u2019d disappeared after lunch, because he hadn\u2019t offered her a part-time position this summer\u2014not even as a last resort. Her job, he said, was cooking and cleaning, and he was supposedly paying her. He didn\u2019t have enough money in his account to give her what she felt this was worth.</p><p>Chrissie would much rather be with her grandmother. She\u2019d always been close to her Grandma Vivian, and she hadn\u2019t seen her since the funeral and everything had been so upsetting then. Grandma had been so brave when the family left. Chrissie remembered seeing tears running down her grandmother\u2019s face as the family car pulled out of the driveway and then she\u2019d started crying, too. It\u2019d been so hard to leave her behind. Chrissie\u2019s heart ached for her\u2014and all at once she knew what she had to do. She had to go to her Grandma Vivian. That was where she wanted to be, where she needed to be. Somehow she\u2019d find a way.</p><p>Determined now, Chrissie reached for the phone and dialed her grandmother\u2019s number in Colville. After four rings she assumed no one was home, but just as she began to hang up, her mother answered.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Mom, it\u2019s Chrissie.\u201d She forced a bright cheerful note into her voice.</p><p>\u201cChrissie. You\u2019re lucky to catch me. I was outside watering Grandma\u2019s garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, wondering how to lead into the subject of joining her mother.</p><p>Her mother seemed preoccupied. \u201cGrandma and I just got back from visiting assisted-living places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma went willingly?\u201d So progress had been made.</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother was willing to listen to reason this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. This is difficult for her. I don\u2019t know what made her change her mind but whatever it was, I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Grandma now?\u201d Chrissie asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lying down at the moment, thinking everything over.\u201d</p><p>In other words, she was taking a nap.</p><p>\u201cI had a great idea I wanted to talk to you about, okay?\u201d Chrissie hated sounding like a little kid afraid of being refused, but she sensed that her mother wasn\u2019t going to like this idea.</p><p>\u201cSure. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad mentioned that you were planning to rent Grandma\u2019s house or maybe sell it right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her mother seemed reluctant. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the nicer homes in town and I\u2019m not sure it would be wise to bring in renters, especially since we won\u2019t be able to keep an eye on the place.\u201d She seemed to be thinking out loud, weighing her options.</p><p>\u201cEither way, you\u2019re going to have to pack everything up, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could use some help.\u201d</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t answer immediately, which probably meant she\u2019d caught on to where Chrissie\u2019s questions were leading. She might as well get directly to the point. \u201cCan I come to Colville?\u201d Her mother\u2019s hesitation was long enough to raise Chrissie\u2019s hackles.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me there, do you?\u201d she asked hotly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me why I can\u2019t come. It\u2019s boring around here and everyone I know either has a job or is on some fabulous vacation while I\u2019m a prisoner in this house scrubbing toilets.\u201d That wasn\u2019t an exaggeration, either. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you hired a housekeeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father did,\u201d her mother reminded her in a mild voice. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Chrissie muttered. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father needs you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Chrissie argued. \u201cNo one does. This summer is a complete waste. I want to be with you and Grandma.\u201d Her throat started to tighten up and she made an effort to hide how miserable she was.</p><p>\u201cAnd do what?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Chrissie sighed. \u201cI already told you. Help pack stuff and spend time with Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut everything has to be sorted. I\u2019ll have to decide what to keep, what to sell and what to give away. I don\u2019t think my mother\u2019s capable of doing any of that, so I\u2019ll be the one making those decisions. I\u2019ve got to get your grandmother moved, too.\u201d Her mother sounded overwhelmed by it all.</p><p>If that was the case, Chrissie couldn\u2019t understand why she balked at her offer. \u201cWell, then, I can be with you when you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a vacation, Chrissie. This is hard work.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes her mother could insult her without realizing it. \u201cI know that. I can help, Mom. What do you think\u2014I\u2019ll watch television all day? This is a difficult time for you and Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is.\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice quavered a little. \u201cI had no idea it would be so difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving Grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I can come?\u201d The pleading tone was back, but Chrissie didn\u2019t care. She felt it was her right to be with her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to your father first.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie clenched her teeth, not knowing what to expect from him. It would be just like her dad to insist she stay in Seattle. She couldn\u2019t; she absolutely couldn\u2019t do that. If she had to deal with her brother and father all summer, she\u2019d go crazy. But that wasn\u2019t even the issue. Her grandmother needed her and so did her mom, and she needed to be with them. No, the decision was made. Chrissie was going to Colville whether she had permission or not.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>The house was eerily quiet as Susannah settled in front of the television. After four very long days, the move was complete. Her mother was about to spend her first night at the assisted-living complex. This single day had felt like an entire month.</p><p>The movers had arrived at eight that morning, eager to get the truck loaded. By the time everything had been set up in her tiny four-hundred-square-foot apartment, her mother was exhausted. So was Susannah.</p><p>The staff at Altamira had been wonderful. The forms were all signed and delivered, financial arrangements made and Dr. Bethel had given his written instructions. Once her mother had agreed to the move, it was as if everything had fallen naturally into place. In fact, they were fortunate that there\u2019d been a unit available. Another sign, in Susannah\u2019s opinion, that this really was meant to be.</p><p>It was dark now, after ten, and Susannah should be more than ready to collapse into bed, but her mind wouldn\u2019t stop spinning. The house was a shambles. Drawers open, cupboards, too. The floors were littered with remnants of her mother\u2019s life and, in many ways, Susannah\u2019s own. Emotion was close to the surface and grew closer with every minute.</p><p>Susannah realized she should phone her family and then go to bed, but sleep would be impossible. Nor did she feel like escaping into mindless television. She stood and wandered aimlessly from room to room, thinking she should sort through a few things, start packing what had been left. But her back hurt and her heart hurt and she\u2019d never felt more alone.</p><p>The whole situation was just so painful. Yes, she knew it was the right decision for all involved\u2014but then why was she feeling this relentless guilt?</p><p>The phone rang and she glanced at it, not sure she was up to answering. Her father had believed caller ID was an unnecessary expense so she could only speculate who\u2019d be phoning this late at night. It was probably her daughter, but Susannah didn\u2019t have the energy to cope with more of Chrissie\u2019s entreaties and complaints. Turning away, she decided not to answer. Then she changed her mind and impulsively grabbed the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She kept her tone as level as possible.</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s Carolyn. I\u2019m sorry to call so late but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarolyn.\u201d Susannah didn\u2019t bother to disguise her relief.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the move go?\u201d</p><p>Susannah leaned against the kitchen wall and wrapped the long cord around her elbow. Her father hadn\u2019t believed in cordless phones, either. \u201cPretty well\u2014except that Mom hates it already. She put on a good front but I could see how unhappy she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried phoning a couple of times, and I wondered when there wasn\u2019t any answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stayed with Mom until she went to bed.\u201d Susannah stared out the dark kitchen window as she tried to make sense of all the emotions churning inside her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make myself leave. Mom seemed so small and broken\u2014as if her life was over.\u201d Tears sprang to her eyes. \u201cI was aware that the move would be difficult for her, but I didn\u2019t realize how hard it would be for me.\u201d She couldn\u2019t restrain a low sob, and it embarrassed her. Susannah wasn\u2019t the type of woman who gave in to tears easily and yet here she was, an emotional mess.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Carolyn asked.</p><p>Susannah was grateful for her friend\u2019s sympathy. \u201cNo...it\u2019s just that I feel so awful about doing this to Mom, even though I know it was necessary.\u201d She paused. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one making these decisions.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was on my own with my mother after Dad died,\u201d Carolyn reminded her. \u201cTrust me, I know how hard this is. I didn\u2019t need to move Mom into a facility, thankfully, but sometimes I wonder if she might\u2019ve done better with other women her age.\u201d Abruptly changing the subject, she added, \u201cThe reason I phoned was to see if you could come for dinner one night next week. Thursday works best for everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone else?\u201d Susannah repeated. \u201cWho\u2019s everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into Sandy Giddings and she mentioned seeing you at Wal-Mart, so I invited her, along with Yvette Lawton and Lisa Mitchell. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p> <p>Sandy, Lisa and Yvette had been Susannah\u2019s best friends through high school. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d been friends with them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re acquaintances more than friends,\u201d Carolyn explained, \u201cbut I want to connect with the community and this seemed a painless way to get reacquainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds great. Thanks for setting everything up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls\u2019 night out,\u201d Carolyn said.</p><p>Susannah could use a night to relax with old friends. Although she\u2019d lost touch with these women, she felt excited about seeing them again. Carolyn might need to reconnect with the community, but Susannah needed to connect with her past. That had become clear to her. Sandy, Yvette, Lisa and Carolyn were part of her personal history.</p> <p>She and Carolyn chatted a few minutes longer and afterward she felt much better. She sat in front of the television again, flicking through channels, but she still couldn\u2019t concentrate. Then she went to bed, but it was a long time before she slept.</p><p>Her dreams were filled with memories of her childhood, of her mother baking cookies and serving as her Camp Fire Leader. She dreamed of summer walks with her father, going for ice-cream cones\u2014always strawberry for her, vanilla for him. As a judge, he was a community leader and to her, he\u2019d seemed the most wonderful man in the world. Her opinion had changed when she entered high school and she\u2019d discovered how dictatorial and unreasonable he was. She dreamed of the yearly Easter egg hunts she\u2019d participated in as a kid and swimming in the local pool with her friends.</p><p>The next morning, the sun shining in her bedroom window woke Susannah. It was a pleasant way to wake up, especially when the clear, bright sunshine was accompanied by the sound of birdsong. She showered and dressed, and made a pot of coffee, drinking her first cup outside. Before leaving to visit her mother, she watered the plants, lingering among the roses for a few minutes and marveling anew at her mother\u2019s energy. Vivian might have let other things go, but she\u2019d maintained her garden. Then she loaded the car with a few odds and ends for her mother\u2019s new home and headed out.</p><p>When she reached Elm Street, Susannah surprised herself by taking a left instead of a right and drove up the road that led to the cemetery. She hadn\u2019t been to her father\u2019s grave since the funeral. Why she felt the urge to go now, she couldn\u2019t say. Perhaps it had to do with her dreams, with her need to revisit the past.</p><p>She parked near the entrance\u2014the only car there\u2014and walked between the grave markers to where she\u2019d stood almost seven months earlier. As she moved across the lawn to her father\u2019s grave, she remembered his casket being lowered into the ground. The headstone was in place now, her mother\u2019s name on the marble slab beside his, along with Vivian\u2019s date of birth, followed by a blank space to note her mother\u2019s death.</p><p>Susannah stood, feeling stiff and uncomfortable, on the freshly watered lawn. \u201cHi, Dad,\u201d she said, her voice a hoarse whisper. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d She snickered at this weak attempt at conversation. From her early teenage years, she\u2019d never really had much to say to him. It wasn\u2019t any easier now that he was six feet under.</p> <p>\u201cMom says you\u2019re the one who told her to go into assisted living.\u201d Yesterday, her mother had made a point of letting Susannah know the reason for her sudden change of heart.</p><p>Susannah slid her shoe over the grass, which was slick and moist beneath her feet. \u201cI suppose I should thank you for that.\u201d</p><p>Biting her lower lip, she walked two grave markers away but didn\u2019t read the names on them. She wanted to leave, to walk back to her car and drive off, but for some reason she couldn\u2019t make herself do it.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Dad, you weren\u2019t the easiest man to live with. Mom went along with whatever you wanted, but not me. I know we would\u2019ve had a better relationship if I\u2019d given in to you, but...I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>In many ways her father was a tough man, rigid and often uncompromising. He had to be, sitting on the bench, dealing with lawbreakers and...well, lowlifes. Not surprisingly, her father had become emotionally distant, more so after Doug\u2019s death.</p><p>As clich\u00e9d as it seemed, George Leary had favored his only son. After her brother died, it was as if the sun had permanently disappeared from her father\u2019s world. Their relationship had been strained before her brother\u2019s fatal car accident, but had deteriorated even further afterward. The truth was, her father hadn\u2019t loved her as much as he had Doug.</p><p>Susannah gasped at that realization, pain spiraling through her. She clenched her hands into tight fists. That was it, although she\u2019d never acknowledged it before. Doug, his precious son, was dead and she\u2019d been a damn poor replacement.</p><p>With Doug\u2019s death, this branch of the Leary family had died out. Her uncle Henry had never married; Uncle Steve died on D-Day. That left only Doug to carry on the family name and he was gone. Gone, too, were her father\u2019s dreams.</p> <p>She was fifty years old and it had taken her this long to figure it out. In one of their recent conversations, Joe had suggested Susannah make an appointment with a counselor to help her deal with her father\u2019s death. At the time she\u2019d dismissed the suggestion. Today, however, she was beginning to think there might be some benefit to discussing her feelings.</p><p>\u201cWhen you died, I thought that if we\u2019d had a chance to talk...to sort everything out,\u201d Susannah whispered, \u201cit would\u2019ve been better for us both. I wanted to tell you how sorry I was and now...now I wonder if it would\u2019ve done any good. You were so set in your ways, so self-righteous.\u201d</p><p>Tears streaked her cheeks and she brushed them aside, angry that her father still had the power to reduce her to this. \u201cI wanted to talk to you, but I know that was impossible.\u201d</p><p>She circled his grave site, years of anger and frustration building to a fever pitch. \u201cNot once in all the time since I returned from Paris did we have a decent conversation. Didn\u2019t that bother you? I was your only surviving child. Didn\u2019t you want to know me?\u201d</p><p>Standing over the grave, she closed her eyes and waited for the ache in her heart to abate. \u201cI wonder if you noticed how rarely Joe and I came to Colville. Did you ever wonder why? No, I don\u2019t suppose you did.\u201d</p><p>Susannah had remained dry-eyed during her father\u2019s funeral. Joe claimed her father had loved her deeply, but Susannah believed otherwise. She\u2019d stayed strong for her mother, or so she\u2019d told herself. Now she realized she hadn\u2019t allowed herself to grieve, not for the father he\u2019d become or the father he could have been\u2014the father she remembered from early childhood. She couldn\u2019t break down for fear that once she started, she might not be able to stop.</p><p>As Susannah walked to her car, she was emotionally spent. She battled sorrow and tears, and regretted coming here.</p><p>When she reached her parked car, she leaned against the passenger door, trying to compose herself before going to visit her mother. She wasn\u2019t up to it this morning. Instead she\u2019d tackle the house, packing what she could, and making some of the decisions that had to be made.</p><p>As she got into the car, it occurred to Susannah that she hadn\u2019t visited Doug\u2019s grave in years. She almost began to cry again as she thought about her brother, who was just a week over twenty-one when he died.</p><p>On the way to the cemetery, Susannah had driven around the very curve where his car had gone off the road. From what she\u2019d subsequently learned, he\u2019d been doing in excess of seventy miles an hour when he hit the guardrail and slammed into a tree. Her one wish was that he hadn\u2019t suffered. She couldn\u2019t bear it if he had.</p><p>Susannah needed a few minutes to locate her brother\u2019s grave. She wondered again why her father hadn\u2019t been buried next to his son. Instead, Doug was five rows up. Presumably all the grave sites close by had been sold. That must have frustrated her father.</p><p>To Susannah\u2019s astonishment, lovely pink roses and purple lilacs were arranged in a vase by the headstone. She knew her mother had routinely visited the grave that first year, her grief nearly overwhelming. But to the best of her knowledge, Vivian hadn\u2019t been to the cemetery recently and if she had, she would\u2019ve left flowers at her husband\u2019s grave, too.</p><p>Susannah crouched down and fingered the delicate petals. The roses, still buds, hadn\u2019t been cut more than a few hours ago. She stood and glanced around, wondering if whoever brought them was nearby. As far as Susannah could see, she was alone.</p><p>Despite everything she\u2019d told her father, Susannah had little to say to her brother. She smiled down at his grave, blew him a kiss and returned to the car, determined to leave and not come back for a long, long time.</p><p>From the cemetery Susannah drove to Safeway, where she picked up packing boxes. Then, feeling she owed her mother a visit, she decided not to postpone it, after all, and drove to Altamira. Her mother sat in her tiny apartment, waiting for her. The minute Susannah walked in, Vivian stretched out her arms, her eyes pleading.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d she asked in a faltering voice. \u201cI was afraid you weren\u2019t going to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Susannah assured her. Taking the fragile, bony hand in her own, Susannah knelt so that the two of them were at eye level. \u201cHow did you sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Not a wink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much noise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...yes. I don\u2019t know and the food here is terrible. You don\u2019t expect me to eat cold eggs and dry toast the rest of my life, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, give it a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it already. I know your father thinks I should be here, but I\u2019m telling you right now, Susannah, I want out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks,\u201d Susannah reminded her. \u201cYou promised me you\u2019d give it your best shot for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly her mother nodded. \u201cYes, I know, but I can tell you this isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>Susannah prayed with all her might that her mother would change her mind and soon. Because there were no other options.</p><p>\u201cWhere are my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, we already brought your clothes, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my purple dress? I need that dress, Jean. You didn\u2019t give it away, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJean, oh, Jean, what am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>Susannah had to bite her tongue to keep from correcting her mother. \u201cI brought everything you asked for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be more comfortable if we brought over your father\u2019s chair, too,\u201d she said next.</p><p>Susannah had been afraid of this. \u201cMom, there isn\u2019t room for Dad\u2019s chair in here.\u201d</p><p>Her mother gave a quick shake of her head. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of room. I\u2019ll just move a few things around and we can set up my sewing machine in the corner.\u201d</p><p>Her mother hadn\u2019t sewed in years. Decades, even. But all Susannah said was, \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd bring me my books, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Mom.\u201d Apparently she was being sent off to do errands. \u201cDid you meet any of the other tenants this morning?\u201d</p><p>Vivian lowered her voice. \u201cThis place is full of old people. I\u2019m telling you, Susannah, I don\u2019t belong here. I swear everyone\u2019s at least eighty.\u201d</p><p>Rather than try to persuade her mother to give the facility a chance, Susannah left to do the errands Vivian had decreed. She was adamant that Susannah find her purple dress, but Susannah couldn\u2019t remember seeing one in her mother\u2019s closet.</p><p>Emotionally drained, she went back to the house. She unlocked the front door and propped open the screen as she dragged in the boxes.</p> <p>Halfway into the living room, she paused and looked around. Everything looked exactly as she\u2019d left it, but something didn\u2019t feel right. Except she didn\u2019t know exactly what. Standing in the middle of the living room, she felt a chill creep down her spine. She was imagining things, she told herself. And yet...</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, she ventured cautiously into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone here?\u201d she cried out.</p><p>No one answered.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Again there was no response.</p> <p>Heart pounding, Susannah moved from room to room. As far as she could see, nothing was amiss\u2014until she reached Doug\u2019s bedroom. Her mother had kept it in pristine condition, hanging his high school graduation picture on the wall, along with an array of ribbons from track meets and other sporting events. They were missing, each and every one of them. For some sick reason, someone had broken into the house and stolen her brother\u2019s high school memorabilia.</p><p>No matter what the future held, Susannah knew she could never let her mother find out about this.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t know what to make of this strange theft. The fresh flowers on her brother\u2019s grave added to the mystery. Then to find that someone had gone through Doug\u2019s high school things...It wasn\u2019t only his ribbons that were missing, either. A couple of other things\u2014a souvenir from Disneyland, a Beatles album, seemingly unimportant mementoes of his too-short life\u2014had simply disappeared. Perhaps her mother had given them away, but Susannah doubted that. Anything of Doug\u2019s was precious and treasured by both her parents.</p><p>Years ago, Brian had asked if he could have Doug\u2019s old baseball cards and her father had refused. Susannah had fumed about that for weeks. Now they appeared to be missing, as well.</p><p>Doing her best to ignore the nagging worries, she packed what was left in her mother\u2019s closet, which took most of the afternoon. She put aside a few additional outfits for Vivian, although the purple dress did not come to light. Her one real find was an old journal her mother had started in 1951, shortly after Doug was born. The fake leather front had cracked over the years. It had a tiny lock without a key, but Susannah tested the fastening, and it sprang open as if waiting to share its secrets.</p><p>She held the open book in her hand for the longest time, wondering if she dared read it. Deciding it would be an invasion of her mother\u2019s privacy, she set the palm-size diary on the dresser.</p><p>More than likely her mother didn\u2019t even remember that she\u2019d kept a journal. But then her mother remembered the oddest things.</p> <p>By the time she\u2019d finished clearing out the closet, packing clothes and shoes into boxes for Goodwill, Susannah was ready for a break. Her mother hadn\u2019t worn any of this stuff in years, but she\u2019d only scraped the surface\u2014there were two chests of drawers in the bedroom, plus shelves, a dresser.... This wasn\u2019t promising.</p><p>The phone rang just as she was about to make herself some tea.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d her daughter cried. \u201cWhere\u2019s the curry powder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need curry for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA recipe,\u201d Chrissie said. \u201cI was watching a show on the Food Channel and I decided to make curried chicken but it calls for curry powder and I\u2019m supposed to add it now.\u201d</p><p>Susannah refrained from mentioning that curried chicken obviously needed curry power and she should have gotten it out earlier. \u201cLook on the shelf next to the refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did. It\u2019s not there. This is important, Mom. Dinner will be ruined without it.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s tone suggested that the world would come to an end if she didn\u2019t locate the curry powder within thirty seconds.</p><p>\u201cTry the next shelf up. If I have it at all, it\u2019d be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The word was smothered as if Chrissie had pressed the receiver against her shoulder.</p><p>Susannah could hear tins and bottles being shuffled around, followed by an exclamation of victory. \u201cThanks, Mom. See ya.\u201d With that, the phone went dead.</p><p>\u201cGlad to be of service,\u201d Susannah muttered as she set the phone back in place. This was the first display of enthusiasm she\u2019d seen from Chrissie since her return home. Joe hadn\u2019t given a definite answer to their daughter\u2019s request about visiting Colville, but apparently Chrissie had accepted the fact that she was needed at home. That was fine with Susannah. While she\u2019d welcome help with the house, Chrissie would be a distraction, too.</p><p>As she put on water for a pot of tea, Susannah felt a sense of pride that her husband and children were managing without her. Her kids were maturing, assuming more responsibility.</p><p>Sitting at the kitchen table a few minutes later, with her tea steeping, she remembered the old diary she\u2019d discovered. It\u2019d been buried in a hat box, tucked away years ago and forgotten. Still feeling guilty about her interest, she brought it out of the bedroom and set it on the table next to the ceramic teapot and tiny pitcher of milk.</p><p>Susannah stared at the diary, afraid she might learn things about her parents she\u2019d rather not know\u2014and yet she was intensely curious. It wasn\u2019t hers to read, she reminded herself. This was her mother\u2019s private property. Then Susannah remembered that her mother had read her diary. Shortly afterward, Susannah had been shipped off to boarding school. Turnabout was fair play, she decided, squelching the guilt.</p><p>She opened the book and saw that her mother had used a fountain pen to record her thoughts. It was a five-year diary with only a few lines for each day. Vivian had maintained it faithfully through those years, as if not entering the day\u2019s activities would\u2019ve been wasteful. The blue ink had darkened but remained completely legible. As always, Susannah admired her mother\u2019s penmanship, the beautifully rounded letters sloping gently to the right.</p><p>April 3, 1957</p><p>George took Doug to his Little League practice and then pitched balls to him for an hour afterward. It did my heart good to see how much my husband loves his son and how much Dougie loves his dad.</p><p>Susannah recalled how often her brother and father had practiced together. She\u2019d felt a little left out and...unimportant.</p><p>June 20, 1957</p><p>I talked to George again about going to nursing school, but with the children so young he feels my place is here at home. I tried to tell him that lots of women are working outside the home these days, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. I know I\u2019d be a good nurse. George is right, although I can\u2019t help wishing I\u2019d gone into nursing school instead of marrying so young. But with the war...</p><p>Susannah frowned. Her mother had wanted to be a nurse? This was news to her. In all her years of growing up, Susannah couldn\u2019t recollect one word about her mother having\u2014or wanting\u2014a career, nursing or otherwise. Everything had centered on her father and his role as a judge.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, however, Susannah remembered how tender and caring her mother had been anytime she or Doug was sick. When he was ten, Doug had broken his arm in a tumble from his bicycle. It had been a bad break, but their mother had remained calm and gotten Doug to the hospital, where he\u2019d required immediate surgery to have the bone reset. Her mother was a natural caregiver, and yet this one desire had been denied her.</p><p>Upset by what she\u2019d read, Susannah flipped the pages to another section.</p><p>November 11, 1958</p><p>Both children have tonsillitis. The doctor thinks we should schedule surgery as soon as possible. This seems a somewhat drastic procedure to me. I worry about what might happen. I\u2019ve read everything I could find at the library and was unsettled more than reassured. I talked to George after dinner, but his mind was on a court case. I don\u2019t think he heard a word I said. He says I worry too much. Perhaps I do, but surgery, especially for Susannah, who\u2019s so easily susceptible to ear infections, concerns me.</p><p>As it turned out, Vivian had been right. After the procedure, Susannah had developed an infection and ended up in the hospital for five days. Her memory of that time was cloudy. She did have a vivid image of her mother sitting by her bedside, holding her hand throughout the ordeal.</p><p>Distressed, Susannah put the journal aside and poured her tea. Her hand trembled slightly as she added milk and stirred. After the first sip, she reached for the diary again. The next entries all described mundane events\u2014shopping trips, housecleaning, planting bulbs in her garden.</p><p>Susannah put down the diary and held her teacup in both hands as she considered what she\u2019d read. In retrospect, she felt she shouldn\u2019t have looked at her mother\u2019s journal. Only that morning, she\u2019d been bemoaning the fact that she\u2019d never really known her father and now she was learning that she didn\u2019t really know Vivian, either.</p><p>After a dinner of peanut butter on toast, Susannah drove back to Altamira to see her mother.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d Rose, who manned the front desk, greeted her as she walked in the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not arriving in the middle of dinner, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness, no. Dinner is served at five.\u201d</p><p>Susannah knew that, but she\u2019d been so involved with the diary she hadn\u2019t noticed the time. The main meal of the day was at twelve, with a light supper in the afternoon.</p><p>She saw that several of the residents had congregated in the main room off the entry and an older gentleman sat at the piano, playing Broadway tunes. Five women, two in wheelchairs, nodded their heads to the music. Another wheelchair-bound woman had fallen asleep.</p><p>Susannah was sad that her mother wasn\u2019t in the audience. It would help if Vivian made an effort to meet the others, but so far she hadn\u2019t revealed the slightest bit of interest or cooperation.</p><p>Determined to do everything within her means to help Vivian adjust, Susannah walked down the long carpeted hallway to her mother\u2019s suite. The door was closed. She tapped lightly but didn\u2019t wait for a response before stepping inside.</p><p>Vivian sat in her favorite chair in front of the television, her back to Susannah.</p><p>\u201cYou can take the tray,\u201d she muttered, apparently assuming that Susannah was an assistant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Susannah glanced at the tray, still waiting on a small table near the door. As far as she could tell, Vivian hadn\u2019t touched her dinner.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Susannah...\u201d She twisted around in her chair. \u201cI thought it was the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother rose awkwardly to her feet, keeping one hand on the back of the chair for balance. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Susannah eyed the minestrone soup and fruit plate and found them artfully displayed. The meals at Altamira were good, and nothing like the institutional food one would expect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not,\u201d Vivian grumbled. \u201cYour father told me I should move here, but I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down and I\u2019ll bring your dinner,\u201d Susannah suggested.</p><p>She set up a television tray once Vivian had returned to her chair. As soon as she was settled, Susannah brought her the fruit plate. \u201cI\u2019ll warm up the soup in the microwave,\u201d she said.</p> <p>To Susannah\u2019s delight, her mother ate every bit of her meal. Soon afterward the assistant arrived and removed the tray. For the next hour, Susannah and her mother sat side by side and watched two game shows in silence.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Susannah said when Jeopardy ended, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you wanted to be a nurse.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s gaze slid to hers. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, ah...I came across something you\u2019d written. While I was packing up the rest of your closet,\u201d she explained quickly, gliding over the fact that the \u201csomething\u201d had been her mother\u2019s diary.</p><p>\u201cI did consider it at one time,\u201d Vivian admitted, reluctance in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d Susannah felt disappointed for her mother but tried not to let it show.</p> <p>Vivian considered the question. \u201cYour father didn\u2019t think it was a good idea, and he was right. A few years after that, George was appointed to the bench and our lives changed. He had a civic responsibility and I did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve been a wonderful nurse,\u201d Susannah said, careful to hide her emotions.</p><p>Vivian gazed at her thoughtfully. \u201cPerhaps I would. Your father and I talked about it more than once, especially before he accepted the appointment. He realized his new role in the community would be almost as demanding on me,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe asked me to stay home while you children were young. I agreed. That wasn\u2019t the time for me to pursue a career, and then later, well...later I made the decision to stand with him, to be his helpmate. Being available to George and supporting his career was more important to me. It meant I was available to you children, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any regrets?\u201d</p><p>Vivian smiled. \u201cNot even one. Everyone makes choices in life, Susannah. Your father earned a good living, and we were fortunate that I didn\u2019t need to work. I saw it as a blessing\u2014and I still do. I volunteered at the blood bank, you know, and I was able to work in my garden.\u201d</p><p>Susannah wasn\u2019t so sure blessing was the appropriate word.</p><p>\u201cYour father and I were partners. You were always so eager to paint him as a villain and, my dear, he was never that. George was a good man, a loving husband, a wonderful father.\u201d</p><p>Susannah swallowed her arguments. The family was fortunate that Vivian could be home for them all. If she\u2019d ever felt cheated about not going into nursing, it had never showed. But Susannah felt cheated for her, and the opportunity she\u2019d lost.</p> <p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>The afternoon was cool and breezy as Carolyn arrived back at the mill, parking in her assigned spot. She\u2019d attended a very successful meeting in Spokane with a buyer from a major hardware chain, and all that remained now was finishing up the relevant paperwork.</p><p>Her long single braid stretched halfway down her back, swaying as she walked. She wore an unaccustomed suit, a plain navy one with a straight skirt and classically styled jacket. With her white shirt and flat black pumps, Carolyn\u2019s \u201cgo to meeting\u201d outfit was complete. She couldn\u2019t wait to peel off the panty hose. Since she never had any idea what to do with her hair, she\u2019d left it in its usual braid. She could only imagine what her fashionable mother would think if she could see her now. When it came to the feminine arts, Carolyn had failed miserably. The second she got to her office, she changed into jeans, boots and a cotton shirt.</p><p>Gloria, her personal assistant, had obviously left early for some reason. That was fine, since she put in whatever hours the job\u2014and Carolyn\u2014required.</p><p>As soon as Carolyn finished with the paperwork, she planned to head home herself, since she had company coming for dinner. Inviting Susannah, Sandy, Lisa and Yvette to the house was a giant leap into the public sphere for her. Carolyn had never socialized much; because of her position as Colville\u2019s main employer, it was risky. Her father had often cautioned her about getting too close to any one family. Still, none of those women was associated with the mill in any way.</p><p>With her responsibility to the business always in mind, she\u2019d kept mostly to herself since her return, forgoing friendships. At times she was lonely, but a sense of duty had been bred into her. She didn\u2019t resent her position; she took it seriously. This mill contributed significantly to the local economy, which meant the decisions she made affected the town as a whole.</p><p>Paperwork done, Carolyn walked into the yard, where the lumber was stacked ten feet high. Sprinklers continually kept the wood wet and cool. A fire could do massive damage, and every measure was taken to protect the raw lumber. The year before, she\u2019d purchased a new lumber stacker for the cut wood, one that minimized operating costs. With new machinery in place, including the stacker, her goal was to produce approximately 50,000 cubic meters of quality lumber annually. No small goal, but she\u2019d set her sights on that figure and had everything she needed to make it a reality.</p><p>When he saw her, Carolyn\u2019s plant manager, Jim Reynolds, hurried toward her with a clipboard in his hand. She relied on Jim, who was directly below her in the chain of command. He was much more than her manager; he was her right-hand man, with a drive and ambition that matched her own. Thanks to his years of working at the mill, the men respected his judgment\u2014and respected him. Carolyn didn\u2019t make a move without consulting Jim first.</p><p>Ten years younger than Carolyn, he was tall, muscular and tanned from all the time he\u2019d spent outside. He was happily married and had three kids, two of whom were about to enter college. Jim was a dedicated, honorable man. Carolyn was grateful that he worked for her and paid him a salary that was commensurate with his value to the business.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the meeting go?\u201d Jim asked as he approached.</p><p>\u201cWe have a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jim nodded approvingly, giving her a thumbs-up. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Jim knew as well as she did that this new plywood order would carry them through the summer. It was the first time Carolyn had cracked this hardware chain. She started to relate the details when he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWe nearly lost Grady Simpson this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Carolyn was instantly concerned. Grady had worked at the mill when her father was still alive. He was close to retirement age and had always been a solid employee.</p><p>\u201cHeart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like it.\u201d</p><p>Relief flowed through Carolyn.</p><p>\u201cBut he would\u2019ve been a goner if it wasn\u2019t for the quick thinking of that guy who does the landscaping.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn knew he worked for Kettle Falls Landscaping, the company she hired for the upkeep of the gardens here and her yard at home. She\u2019d used them for the past three years and they\u2019d done an adequate job. She\u2019d never had any complaints, but the new gardener, who\u2019d started about four months ago, was exceptional. He was conscientious, hardworking and punctual; equally important, he understood plants. No one had done a better job on her yard than Dave Langevin. He\u2019d impressed her enough for Carolyn to ask his name.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better begin at the beginning,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGrady was on the stacker when he keeled over. God only knows what might\u2019ve happened if that guy hadn\u2019t been mowing the lawn.\u201d The office had a small yard with some shrubs and basic flower beds, which required routine maintenance. \u201cBefore anyone else realized what was going on, this guy\u2014Dave\u2019s his name\u2014got to Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Dave Langevin,\u201d Carolyn said casually.</p><p>Jim finished the story, succinctly describing what had happened. \u201cHe administered CPR until the paramedics arrived. The EMT said Grady would\u2019ve been dead without Dave\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn hadn\u2019t seen the landscaping truck in the parking lot. \u201cHas he left? I\u2019d like to thank him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might, but he said he had some other work that needed to be done today. As soon as he saw that Grady was in good hands, he went back to mowing the lawn and took off shortly afterward.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn would seek him out later and thank him. \u201cIt sounds like you had an exciting afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Jim concurred wryly. \u201cBut I can live without that kind of excitement.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll have Gloria check on Grady so you can let everyone know how he\u2019s doing.\u201d Gloria, her assistant, was about as organized as they come. Her father had drilled into Carolyn the importance of surrounding herself with competent employees, and it was probably the most valuable lesson he\u2019d taught her.</p><p>Jim revealed a hint of a smile. \u201cGloria\u2019s already on it.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn should\u2019ve guessed as much.</p><p>\u201cGrady might need heart surgery later,\u201d Jim said, \u201cbut for now the danger has passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for that,\u201d she said as she headed toward her car.</p><p>\u201cGloria\u2019s arranged for flowers to be sent and she\u2019s taken care of the insurance stuff.\u201d He gestured toward the office. \u201cShe left early to meet Grady\u2019s family at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I wondered where she\u2019d gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can always count on Gloria,\u201d he said warmly. Reverting to a more businesslike tone, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll have an accident report on your desk first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Carolyn turned back, deciding to spend another half hour at the office. Her dinner preparations were under control and her house was clean. \u201cIf you see Dave before I do, would you tell him I\u2019d like to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>Jim smiled and promised he would.</p><p>Carolyn had been walking on air after closing the deal, but this near-disaster had brought her back to earth fast enough. Strolling beside Jim, she\u2019d almost reached the office when he commented, \u201cI\u2019ve seen Dave around and I like his work ethic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that her yard at the house hadn\u2019t looked this good in years.</p><p>\u201cI offered him a job.\u201d</p><p>That had been Carolyn\u2019s intention. She was grateful for his quick action in saving Grady\u2019s life; his decisiveness and commitment made him the kind of employee she wanted at the mill. Whatever she invested in training him would be worth it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe thanked me for the offer,\u201d Jim continued, \u201cbut said he liked his current job just fine. I told him what his starting wage would be and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more than he\u2019s making now, but he wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn didn\u2019t know whether she should be disappointed or gratified on behalf of her garden. She was pleased with the work he was doing, but surprised that he\u2019d walked away from a job offer that would likely double his income.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s his choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he drifts around a lot,\u201d Jim said. \u201cI asked him where he was from and he told me he\u2019d been living in California, and before that, Arizona and that he picked fruit in Yakima for a season. I\u2019ve met men like him before. They don\u2019t put down roots.\u201d</p> <p>Carolyn nodded, inhaling deeply. Ponderosa pine and fir scented the afternoon air. As a child, she\u2019d loved the smell of her father\u2019s clothes. Now her own shirts carried the same woodsy fragrance. To her, it was more enticing than the most exotic perfume.</p><p>They turned the corner just as the whistle blew. All around her the crew shut down their machines and, within moments, the buildings and yards emptied as men sauntered past, their black lunch boxes in hand. She enjoyed the sound of their talk and laughter, and the fact that they acknowledged her with nods or waves.</p><p>Carolyn ended up staying for an extra hour. She finished reading through her e-mail, checked on Grady\u2019s condition\u2014which was improving\u2014and then closed her computer before going home.</p><p>As she made her way down the long driveway, she noticed the landscaping truck parked outside her house. The bed was loaded with beauty bark, which Dave Langevin had begun spreading over her flower beds. Carolyn was pleased to see him.</p><p>She parked in the garage, then stepped out of her vehicle and walked toward him.</p> <p>Dave was a middle-aged man with dark hair, callused hands and deep-set dark eyes. He wore nondescript work clothes and a big straw hat that shaded his face. As she drew closer, he thrust his shovel into the earth and leaned against the handle.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d be here,\u201d she said.</p><p>He wiped the back of one hand across his brow. \u201cYour housekeeper said you were having dinner guests, and I wanted to get this beauty bark spread before they arrived.\u201d</p><p>It was thoughtful of him, and unexpected. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said simply, feeling a bit awkward. \u201cAnd thank you for your help this afternoon at the mill. Jim told me what you did.\u201d</p><p>Dave seemed almost embarrassed by her praise. \u201cNo big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt Grady thinks that. Jim said you saved his life.\u201d</p> <p>Dave stared down at the ground, then pulled out the shovel. \u201cBetter get back to work,\u201d he said tersely.</p><p>\u201cI understand, but I wanted you to know I appreciate what you did. Thank you again, Dave.\u201d</p><p>He seemed surprised that she knew who he was. For a long moment, he held her gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome...Carolyn.\u201d</p><p>Just the way he said her name made her look at him again, really look at him. When she saw that her scrutiny unsettled him, she turned and hurried into the house. The oddest sensation settled in the pit of her stomach. The last time she\u2019d felt anything like this had been the day she\u2019d met her husband, her long-divorced husband. There\u2019d been a powerful physical attraction between them and she felt the same thing now, with this man. This groundskeeper who\u2019d let it be known that he was a drifter. She was attracted to Dave Langevin. It was an uncomfortable sensation, one that left her vulnerable and alarmed. At her age and in her position, she couldn\u2019t afford to be interested in romance. And yet, there was something about him.... Responsibility, common sense\u2014and lack of time\u2014won out, otherwise she would\u2019ve invited him in or found an excuse for him to linger. But knowing her dinner guests would be coming soon saved her from making a fool of herself.</p><p>Despite her wariness, Carolyn studied Dave from inside the house. After ten or fifteen minutes, he walked over to his pickup truck and stored his equipment on the passenger seat. He opened the driver\u2019s door and then, as if aware of her surveillance, he paused and looked over his shoulder at her.</p><p>Embarrassed, Carolyn ducked away from the window and into the shadows, mortified that he\u2019d caught her watching him.</p><p>Touching the rim of his large straw hat, he climbed into the truck and drove off. As he rumbled down the driveway Carolyn couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that\u2014if she were to allow it, if she were to seek it\u2014Dave Langevin would be interested in her, too.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p> <p>Susannah no longer felt sociable, but it was too late to cancel out of dinner with Carolyn and the others. Dreading the evening, she sat at the table in her mother\u2019s kitchen and tried to relax. Vivian hadn\u2019t had a good afternoon and Susannah felt guilty about leaving her, guilty for having read her mother\u2019s private thoughts and then questioning her as if she had the right. Susannah blamed herself for Vivian\u2019s melancholy mood, which seemed to reflect her own dissatisfaction with life. She\u2019d made a mistake in reminding her mother of unattained dreams; a bigger mistake was bringing it up again today.</p><p>She\u2019d mentioned searching for Jake to Carolyn but she\u2019d done nothing, fearing...she didn\u2019t know what. Fearing, she guessed, what she might feel once she found him. If she found him. It was quite possibly the most inane idea of her life and still she couldn\u2019t let it go, couldn\u2019t get the thought of him out of her mind.</p><p>Because she was dissatisfied with her own life, Susannah had questioned her mother about the choices Vivian had made. She should\u2019ve known better. Her mother had grown even more irritable than she\u2019d been last night, claiming that Susannah was looking for excuses to vilify her father.</p><p>That simply wasn\u2019t true. All she\u2019d wanted her mother to do was acknowledge the truth. Twice, in two different journal entries, Vivian had written about her desire to enter a nursing program and both times she\u2019d been thwarted by George. Now her mother insisted a nursing career hadn\u2019t been that important.</p><p>Because of Susannah\u2019s questions, it had been an awkward visit; she felt bad about that. Later Vivian had refused to eat her dinner and lain down for a nap instead.</p><p>The rest of Susannah\u2019s day had been spent working. She\u2019d rented storage space and started taking packed cardboard boxes to the unit for safekeeping until she decided what to do with the house. More and more, Susannah realized her mother was incapable of making even the most mundane decisions. Like everything else, this would be up to her. In a midday phone conversation, Joe had suggested that renting storage space might be the best solution for now. He was right and Susannah had immediately called to arrange it. She appreciated the advice but felt he didn\u2019t understand the emotional difficulties she was facing.</p><p>Susannah was not only dealing with her mother, she was sorting through a lifetime of accumulated things. It seemed her mother had never discarded a single dish or piece of clothing, and her father wasn\u2019t much better. For decades, she\u2019d largely avoided her father and now, every time she opened a drawer, there he was. The memories of her teenage years made her uncomfortable. Because he was a judge, he felt he could dictate everyone\u2019s life, whether he had a gavel in hand or not.</p><p>After talking to her husband, Susannah found she was annoyed with him, too, unreasonable though that might be. He was in Seattle, living his normal, predictable life, and she was stuck in Colville. She didn\u2019t want to decide what to do with Aunt Sophie\u2019s handknit bedspread or her father\u2019s stamp collection. It was easy for Joe to sit at home and make helpful suggestions, she thought bitterly. Susannah knew he was only trying to be supportive, but at this point she doubted there was much he could do or say that would satisfy her\u2014and that bothered her, too. Almost overnight she\u2019d turned into someone she didn\u2019t know or like. Even spending time in her mother\u2019s garden hadn\u2019t calmed her the way it usually did. In fact, she\u2019d come away irritated all over again. How was it that her mother couldn\u2019t manage the simplest of household tasks and yet kept her garden in pristine condition? It was as if Vivian had let everything slide except her garden\u2014her life, her appearance, her mind were just about gone, but not her garden. No, not her precious garden.</p><p>Sitting at the kitchen table, Susannah buried her face in her hands. She was upset with her father and her husband, and now she\u2019d added her mother to the list, and Doug, too. If her brother were alive, she wouldn\u2019t have to cope with all these painful decisions alone. She knew it was a fruitless thought, but she couldn\u2019t stop feeling that way. She wished she could be seventeen again, before the year that changed everything. The year of Doug\u2019s death and Jake\u2019s disappearance. If she was, she wouldn\u2019t think twice about eloping. More than that, she\u2019d leap at the chance. Oh, to be young again, to be in love with the fervor and intensity of youth. Only this time, she\u2019d defy her father, stand up to him and run away with the man she loved.</p><p>At six-thirty, Susannah pulled into Carolyn\u2019s long gravel driveway and, as if by magic, her unease left her. She\u2019d loved this house as a young teenager. Tucked against the foothills, it had a lush green lawn that sloped down from the tree line into a soft meadow. Many a late afternoon had been spent with Carolyn, listening to records in her upstairs bedroom and looking out her window, watching the deer graze.</p><p>The house itself was a brown-shingled two-story with a sweeping porch across the front. A profusion of roses bloomed in the beds nearby. It was a shame that Carolyn\u2019s mother and her own had never become friends, since they\u2019d shared a love of gardening. A large cement patio was positioned on the right-hand side of the house, complete with a set of matching outdoor furniture.</p><p>Susannah parked by the three-car garage and reached for her contributions: a package that contained the makings for a Caesar salad and a bottle of wine she\u2019d picked up at the grocery store on her way out of town. She felt a twinge of guilt about bringing something store-bought, but between packing up the house and visiting her mother, there hadn\u2019t been time to prepare anything.</p><p>The front door was open and the screen unlatched when Susannah approached.</p><p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d Carolyn called from the kitchen.</p><p>Susannah walked inside. Her friend was assembling an appetizer plate of cheeses, fresh green grapes and crackers, which sat on the marble counter.</p><p>\u201cI brought wine,\u201d Susannah said, holding up the bottle of white zinfandel. She placed the bag of Caesar salad fixings on the table.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Carolyn motioned toward the cupboard. \u201cWineglasses are on the top shelf. And you\u2019ll find a bowl in the bottom cupboard.\u201d</p><p>Susannah quickly prepared her salad. She\u2019d begun setting out wineglasses when the sound of two car doors closing interrupted her.</p><p>A moment later, two of Susannah\u2019s high school friends walked in together, each carrying a dish and a bottle of wine. From the way Lisa and Yvette looked around, it was clear they\u2019d never been inside the house. Susannah came forward to meet them, and as soon as they saw her, they both started screeching with delight.</p><p>Once they\u2019d put the desserts and the wine aside, Susannah was wrapped in a giant hug and questions were tossed at her in quick succession. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long will you be in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you at the last reunion?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer one question, another presented itself.</p> <p>\u201cGive her a break, will you?\u201d Sandy Giddings said as she entered the house. She plunked her bottle of wine and a pan of homemade brownies on the kitchen counter. Carolyn brought a huge spinach salad out of the refrigerator and tossed it, letting it wait on the table beside Susannah\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d eat outside,\u201d she said. Carrying the cheese platter, she led the way to the sliding glass door that opened onto the patio. The round table was covered with colorful place mats and the umbrella positioned to block out the setting sun.</p><p>The five women chatted and laughed nonstop through the appetizers, followed by a dinner of salads, creamy stroganoff with buttered noodles and fresh green beans. They lingered over their desserts\u2014Sandy\u2019s rich chocolate brownies, berry pie and warm apple crisp with ice cream. Then they cleared the table and returned outside with their glasses of wine, comfortable in the waning sun.</p><p>\u201cThis is so much fun,\u201d Yvette said with a contented sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the last time I had a ladies\u2019 night out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Sandy chimed in.</p> <p>They pulled their chairs into a small circle as they caught up with each others\u2019 news.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve got two children?\u201d Lisa asked, looking at Susannah.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI love your ring,\u201d Yvette commented. \u201cIs it from your husband?\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s gaze dropped to the emerald. \u201cJoe got it for me on our twentieth anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen and I go way back, too,\u201d Yvette said, tossing her long blond hair over her shoulder. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get an emerald ring on our anniversary.\u201d</p> <p>Susannah laughed and then frowned. The last she\u2019d heard, Yvette had married Kenny Lincoln shortly after high school. \u201cI thought you and Kenny\u2014\u201d</p><p>Yvette interrupted her. \u201cWe divorced two years later. Kenny got into drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Susannah didn\u2019t want to dredge up unpleasant memories.</p><p>Yvette raised her eyebrows. \u201cI knew he was experimenting with the stuff when we got married, but turned a blind eye to it. The last I heard, he was doing time in Shelton.\u201d</p><p>Susannah couldn\u2019t imagine the athletic Kenny Lincoln behind bars.</p><p>\u201cThankfully I was smart enough to get out of the marriage before we had kids. Then I married Ben in 1978.\u201d</p><p>They paused and sipped their wine.</p><p>\u201cJake Presley was your high school sweetheart, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Sandy asked Susannah.</p> <p>Funny that Jake\u2019s name would come up so easily. The truth was, she didn\u2019t want to think about him. Not right now. Not when he\u2019d been with her for weeks, taking over her dreams and her thoughts. \u201cYes,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he go out with Sharon Nance?\u201d Lisa asked.</p><p>\u201cThey broke up,\u201d Yvette reminded her.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Lisa nodded at the memory. \u201cAs I recall, she wasn\u2019t too pleased about it, either.\u201d</p><p>Sandy glanced at Susannah, her expression puzzled. \u201cSo what happened to Jake? Where is he now?\u201d</p><p>Susannah shrugged casually. \u201cI don\u2019t really know. He moved the year I was in France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201d Yvette said, clearly taken aback by the news. \u201cDidn\u2019t he write?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the beginning, but it didn\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she\u2019d left for France, Susannah had told her friends that when she returned she\u2019d be marrying Jake. It had sounded wildly romantic and she\u2019d meant it. Except that when she came home, Jake was gone.</p><p>\u201cI tried to find him,\u201d Susannah admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhat about his dad?\u201d Lisa asked. \u201cHe must\u2019ve known where Jake was. Or did he leave, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I can tell, they both moved out of town.\u201d She raised her wineglass to her lips. Feeling warm and relaxed, she murmured, \u201cI wish I knew where he went and why he never answered my letters.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhen I was seventeen, I was so sure that Jake and I were meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe path not taken,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cI think about that sometimes, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Susannah pointed at Lisa with her wineglass. \u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy untraveled path?\u201d Lisa looked away in embarrassment. Slowly she shook her head, as if she regretted bringing up the subject.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Susannah urged. \u201cYou\u2019ve got one. We all do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Sandy asked Carolyn.</p><p>Carolyn hesitated, then said, \u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell if you do.\u201d</p><p>Everyone turned to stare at Carolyn, who didn\u2019t seem especially confident. \u201cYou tell first and then maybe I will.\u201d</p><p>Susannah reached for the half-filled bottle of white zinfandel and replenished Carolyn\u2019s glass. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>They giggled as if they were sixteen again.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cLisa, you start, okay?\u201d</p><p>Lisa\u2019s face reddened. \u201cYou\u2019ll think I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d they all insisted.</p><p>Again Lisa looked away, then picked up her wineglass and drank the last two swallows. When she\u2019d finished she set the glass down. \u201cYou probably all think it\u2019s some dark secret and it isn\u2019t. I just wish I\u2019d gone to college, but I didn\u2019t have the marks to qualify for a scholarship.\u201d</p><p>She stared out into the distance, but Susannah was convinced that she wasn\u2019t watching the deer that wandered timidly down into the grassy meadow.</p><p>\u201cMy dad said if anyone in our family went to college, it would be my little brother. He was the one who\u2019d be supporting a family, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you just cringe every time you hear someone talk like that?\u201d Susannah muttered. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s such a dated idea but I\u2019m sure it still exists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I could\u2019ve gone. In my heart of hearts I know that Mom would\u2019ve fought to get me into a community college if I\u2019d asked. Instead, I got a job with the telephone company, where I still work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d Lisa explained. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I wanted the chance to learn and discover who I am. All I needed to do was tell my mother how badly I wanted to continue my education, and yet I didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Carolyn asked. \u201cDid you ever figure out what held you back?\u201d</p><p>Lisa nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about that a lot over the years. Mainly it\u2019s because I was eager to get out on my own and be independent. If I took the job with the phone company, I\u2019d have the freedom to make my own decisions about life. I wanted out of the family home and I didn\u2019t want to be under my parents\u2019 control anymore. I realize now that I wasn\u2019t gaining nearly as much as I was giving up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your brother?\u201d Susannah asked. She vaguely remembered Lisa\u2019s little brother. \u201cDid he go on to college?\u201d</p><p>Lisa nodded. \u201cHe attended the University of Washington for one year and flunked out.\u201d</p><p>Susannah groaned.</p><p>\u201cThe irony is that I\u2019m the sole support of my family. Bill died of cancer five years ago, and now it\u2019s just me and the kids. In another year it\u2019ll be me alone.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet as they all took this in.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d Lisa said, turning to Yvette.</p><p>\u201cYou already know the path I took. More of a detour, really. I wish I hadn\u2019t married Ken. When I think back, I knew it was a mistake, but I was so young and naive that I went ahead with the wedding, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I did,\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cI married the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is Jake Presley the path you didn\u2019t take?\u201d Lisa directed the question to Susannah.</p><p>Susannah leaned back in her chair and thought about her life. Despite her youthful love for Jake, she hadn\u2019t married the wrong man. Joe was a good husband and she had a good life. She loved her family, her home, her garden. She enjoyed teaching\u2014but then why was she counting the years until retirement? Still, that was a question for another day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she hedged, and then decided she should be honest with her friends. \u201cYes, I guess he is.\u201d She was silent for a moment. \u201cRecently I sometimes wonder if I should\u2019ve married Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t know where he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean after I returned from Europe, but before.\u201d She glanced around and saw that her four friends were staring at her with wide, questioning eyes. Smiling, she sipped her wine. \u201cThe night before I left, I sneaked out of the house to meet Jake. He begged me to drive to Idaho with him so the two of us could get married.\u201d She\u2019d had no idea that would be the last time she\u2019d ever see him.</p><p>Her friends squealed with shock. Everyone had heard about young lovers who\u2019d done exactly that. There was no waiting period in Idaho, and it was possible to go to a justice of the peace and be married by morning.</p><p>\u201cYou told him no?\u201d Yvette seemed to find that hard to believe even now.</p><p>\u201cI think every girl in school was half in love with Jake Presley,\u201d Lisa confided. \u201cHe was such a bad boy, and there wasn\u2019t one of us who wouldn\u2019t have given our eyeteeth to tame him.\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s voice was filled with regret. \u201cI tried to get him to wait, but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d All she had to do was close her eyes to remember how handsome Jake had looked in his black leather jacket. He was the epitome of cool.</p><p>\u201cYou never, ever heard from him after you came back? Not even once?\u201d Lisa asked.</p><p>\u201cI hoped he\u2019d search for me, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d Susannah confessed. At least not that she knew of. Susannah wouldn\u2019t put it past her father to lie about Jake. All through college she\u2019d waited, certain Jake would find her, certain he loved her, certain that eventually they\u2019d be together. When she reached her mid-twenties, she gave up and married Joe.</p><p>The silence nearly undid her. \u201cI have a wonderful husband, don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d she rushed to add. \u201cMy kids are great and almost grown up. This is the best time of my life.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t quite believe her own words, even though everything she\u2019d said should be true. Chrissie and Brian would soon leave and establish their own lives\u2014but just as she was about to relinquish one responsibility, she faced another.</p><p>Her mother needed her, depended on her. It felt as if Susannah had gone back to the days when her children were young, only in this instance the child was her mother.</p><p>\u201cCarolyn,\u201d Susannah said, getting to her feet, eager now to change the subject. \u201cLet me help you with the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember Mr. Fogleman?\u201d Sandy asked softly. Up until now, she\u2019d remained suspiciously quiet. Susannah sat back down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe algebra teacher?\u201d Susannah recalled that he\u2019d been strict and unbending. She\u2019d barely pulled a B in his class her junior year. One good thing about living in France was that she hadn\u2019t ended up in another of Fogleman\u2019s algebra classes.</p><p>\u201cI had the biggest crush on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Fogleman?\u201d Lisa gasped. \u201cOld Fogey Fogleman?\u201d She thrust out her wineglass. \u201cI need a refill.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn grabbed the wine bottle to replenish her goblet.</p> <p>\u201cI used to leave notes on his windshield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Sandy blushed. \u201cReally risqu\u00e9 notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou signed them?\u201d Yvette shrieked out the question.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe knew, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Sandy cupped her mouth with her hand to hide a smile. \u201cHe gave me an A\u2014when I deserved a D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She took a big gulp of wine. \u201cMom said a man called and asked for me shortly after I graduated and deep down I feel it must\u2019ve been Mr. Fogleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d Susannah noticed that the others had leaned forward, listening intently.</p><p>\u201cMom said it was a rather strange phone call. It almost seemed as if he was happy I wasn\u2019t home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever happened to Mr. Fogleman?\u201d Lisa wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cHe transferred to Spokane High School after that one year in Colville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should look him up,\u201d Lisa urged.</p><p>Sandy shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m a happily married woman, or at least I was until tonight.\u201d</p><p>More giggles followed. \u201cGood grief, here we are pining after the missed opportunities of our youth,\u201d Carolyn said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all around fifty and we\u2019re still afraid,\u201d Lisa added.</p><p>Only she wasn\u2019t, Susannah realized. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t look harder for Jake,\u201d she said, angry with herself.</p><p>\u201cYour dad would\u2019ve had a conniption,\u201d Carolyn reminded her.</p> <p>\u201cTrue, but by then I wouldn\u2019t have cared. I was eighteen and I could stand up to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about now?\u201d Yvette asked. \u201cWhat would you do if you ran into Jake now?\u201d</p><p>That gave her pause. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Carolyn insisted. \u201cI\u2019d march right up to him and ask why he stopped writing to you!\u201d</p><p>Susannah laughed with her friends, but she had to wonder what she\u2019d do if she did meet Jake again after all these years.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Susannah arrived home from Carolyn\u2019s house at close to midnight. The evening had given her exactly the infusion of energy she needed. The discontent she\u2019d been feeling for months was affecting her marriage\u2014and that might be one of the reasons she\u2019d started to dream about Jake.</p><p>Susannah sincerely hoped this time apart would revive her relationship with her husband. But right now, pleasantly tired and with her spirits high, she didn\u2019t want to think about her mother or Joe or anything else. She unlocked the front door and stepped into the dark house. Even before she turned on the light, she froze, instinct taking over. Flipping the switch, she quickly surveyed the room. Someone had been in the house. The first thing she noticed was that the pillows on the sofa weren\u2019t the way they\u2019d been left. Her mother had always propped them against the sofa\u2019s arms. Before she\u2019d gone to Carolyn\u2019s, Susannah had moved them to the top of the sofa. Both were back where her mother used to keep them.</p><p>She felt the same eerie sensation she\u2019d experienced the day she discovered Doug\u2019s high school track ribbons were missing. With absolute certainty, Susannah knew that once again someone had been inside the house. Every cell in her body relayed that message.</p><p>Susannah remained motionless, studying the immediate area for additional signs of an intruder. Her relaxed mood evaporated as her senses went on high alert. Her ears strained for any sound, but she heard nothing.</p><p>Other than the sofa pillows, nothing appeared to be out of place. Perhaps she was being unnecessarily suspicious or overdramatic, but she distinctly remembered moving those pillows. It\u2019d been a small act of defiance, foolish really. And yet it provided evidence that there\u2019d been an intruder. While Susannah was with Carolyn and her friends, reminiscing and sipping wine, a stranger had entered the house. Another thought suddenly occurred to her.</p><p>Whoever it was might still be inside.</p><p>The faintest of sounds\u2014the creak of a floorboard\u2014came from the direction of the hallway. Susannah\u2019s heart began a staccato beat that slammed against her chest. Her mouth went instantly dry.</p><p>Whoever had broken into the house was still there.</p><p>Hands shaking almost uncontrollably, she searched her purse for her cell phone and nearly groaned aloud when she remembered she\u2019d kept it in the car to recharge the battery.</p><p>Before she could decide on the best course of action, the bedroom door opened.</p><p>Terror gripped her. Dashing to the door, Susannah had her hand on the knob, ready to bolt, when a sleepy voice called out from behind her.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Susannah whirled around. \u201cChrissie?\u201d</p><p>It was her daughter!</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Chrissie rubbed the sleep from her eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer your phone?\u201d</p><p>Susannah hurried over to hug her daughter but had more than a few questions herself. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to help you with Grandma,\u201d her daughter said, covering her mouth in an attempt to hold back a wide yawn. \u201cWhat time is it, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith friends.\u201d Setting down her purse, Susannah walked into the kitchen and turned on the light. The message signal on the answering machine was flashing. \u201cI think we both need to sit down and talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to let you know I was coming,\u201d Chrissie said.</p><p>The flashing light was proof enough of that.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer your cell phone, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s charging in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even look at the phone when you got in?\u201d</p><p>Susannah shook her head. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her to check. Since she\u2019d spoken to Joe earlier in the day, she hadn\u2019t expected to hear from him again.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get to Colville, anyway?\u201d Susannah had one car, Joe another and Brian drove a clunker to and from work.</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s smile wasn\u2019t as confident now. \u201cCarley Lyons phoned this morning and said she was driving to Spokane. I figured if I was that close, there had to be a way to Colville. Carley said I could get a ride with her if I paid half the gas and I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you get from Spokane to Colville?\u201d Susannah had a feeling she wasn\u2019t going to like the answer.</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s shoulders heaved. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. Carley dropped me off at the bus depot. There are some really creepy-looking people there, you know. Besides, the next bus to Colville wasn\u2019t until the weekend.\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded, waiting for the rest of the story.</p><p>\u201cThen I thought of John Mussetter. He moved to Spokane a little while ago. You remember him, don\u2019t you? Really, how many Mussetters could there be in the phone book? I called him and he said he\u2019d drive me to Colville if I paid for his gas and time. I agreed to give him all the money I had with me, which wasn\u2019t as much as he wanted, so I told him you\u2019d pay him the rest and then you weren\u2019t here, so I owe him fifty dollars.\u201d</p><p>The story just got worse. Susannah resisted the urge to scold her daughter. She had other concerns. \u201cHow\u2019d you get into the house?\u201d After that episode with Doug\u2019s missing ribbons, Susannah never left without double-checking the doors and windows.</p><p>Chrissie grinned. \u201cI know where Grandma hides the spare key in case anyone needs to get in.\u201d</p><p>Susannah frowned. As far as she could recall, her parents had never hidden a key for easy access.</p><p>\u201cYears ago Grandma showed me the place.\u201d She smiled at Susannah. \u201cI was praying like crazy that the key would still be there behind the brick and it was,\u201d she said triumphantly.</p><p>As youngsters, Susannah and her brother had found a loose brick in the back of the house. The key fit behind it perfectly. Looking at the bricks, no one would suspect anything was hidden there. Susannah had completely forgotten about it and was surprised to realize their hiding place might still exist.</p><p>\u201cI put it back,\u201d Chrissie assured her.</p><p>Deciding she needed a cup of tea, Susannah stood and filled the kettle, putting it on the stove to boil. \u201cYour father knows you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cHe found out when he came home from work. I left him a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it was awful without you. Besides, I wanted to be here in the worst way. I love Grandma and I want to be with her. And you, too,\u201d she added as if in afterthought. \u201cAll Dad and Brian cared about was having me cook and clean for them. I was their slave. Even when I tried to make interesting dinners they complained. Okay, so the chicken curry didn\u2019t turn out like the one on the Food Channel, but at least I tried.\u201d</p><p>Susannah remembered her husband\u2019s reaction to the recipe, but Chrissie was right; she was making an effort and clearly it wasn\u2019t appreciated. She was right, too, about being close to her grandmother. It might be a real help to have her daughter here, if for no other reason than the closeness Vivian shared with her granddaughter.</p><p>Chrissie sat back in the chair and braced her bare feet against the edge so that her chin rested on her knees. Her hair fell forward, obscuring her face. \u201cI phoned Jason this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Considering how adamantly Chrissie had insisted she didn\u2019t want anything more to do with him, this was no small concession. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad. He said he wasn\u2019t seeing Katie, but I don\u2019t believe him. He also said he thought it\u2019d be best if we broke up. That\u2019s fine by me\u2014all he had to do was be honest.\u201d She sounded nonchalant but Susannah suspected that was merely a pose.</p><p>Susannah patted her daughter\u2019s forearm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie shrugged as if it wasn\u2019t important, but Susannah could tell that she was hurt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad at me for coming. Please, Mom, I just had to get away. I needed to talk to you and it isn\u2019t the same over the phone. I promise I won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d</p><p>After the last few days of frustration and backbreaking work, Susannah welcomed the help\u2014and the company.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Chrissie sounded so relieved. She tried to hide the fact that she had tears in her eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s Grandma doing? I\u2019m really worried about her without Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>Susannah struggled with her own emotions. \u201cShe\u2019s not adjusting as well as I\u2019d hoped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s doing everything she can to make sure she\u2019s miserable.\u201d Every conversation involved a litany of complaints. The food tasted terrible, the people were unfriendly, the rooms were too cold, and so on. Susannah had stopped listening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy being here will cheer her up,\u201d Chrissie stated with such confidence that Susannah believed her. \u201cThe thing is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie sighed audibly. \u201cI don\u2019t think Dad\u2019s going to be happy about the way I left.\u201d</p><p>That was no doubt an accurate prediction of Joe\u2019s feelings. Susannah suspected some of those messages were his. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll square it with him.\u201d She turned to her daughter. \u201cAs for you, now that you\u2019re here, I expect you to work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d Chrissie gave her a tired smile. \u201cThanks, Mom, you\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>The sad part was that Susannah didn\u2019t feel she was the best at anything. Certainly not at being a daughter or a wife. Not even being a mother...</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Vivian was delighted when her granddaughter showed up the next morning. She\u2019d just finished her breakfast\u2014the eggs were cold and the bacon greasy so she hadn\u2019t taken more than a single bite of each.</p><p>She was getting ready to work outside in her garden when Susannah and Chrissie tapped at her door. Not her garden, she reminded herself. She didn\u2019t live in her home anymore. For a moment, she was overwhelmed by a sense of loss.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>With the way her memory had been acting up lately, she felt obliged to ask, \u201cDid I know you were coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Grandma, this is a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Vivian hugged the girl and was astonished at how tall Chrissie had become since her last visit. When was that? Three or four years ago? \u201cSuch a beautiful young woman,\u201d she murmured, pressing her hands against Chrissie\u2019s cheeks, studying this girl she loved. But her granddaughter wasn\u2019t a girl anymore, she was a woman. The realization stunned her. \u201cYou look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look great, too.\u201d Chrissie\u2019s arms were gentle around Vivian, as if her granddaughter was afraid to crush her. Vivian didn\u2019t remember being that fragile. She was, though. She\u2019d changed, become feeble. Frail. What terrible words.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find my gardening gloves.\u201d Vivian was irritated. Her biggest worry about moving into this place was thievery. Hired help was not to be trusted; even Martha, who\u2019d worked for her for years, had turned into a thief. Obviously, someone had walked off with her gardening gloves. They were her favorites and well used. Why anyone would take them was beyond her.</p> <p>\u201cMother, what do you need gardening gloves for?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>As much as she loved her daughter, Vivian swore Susannah could annoy her faster than anyone on earth. Ever since she\u2019d arrived this morning, Susannah had tested Vivian\u2019s patience. \u201cSo I can trim my roses,\u201d she said slowly and deliberately.</p><p>Susannah\u2019s response was just as slow and deliberate. \u201cMother, the roses are at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d And she did. She remembered exactly where her roses were.</p><p>Susannah cast a look at Chrissie. \u201cBut you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy roses need trimming and I\u2019m determined to do it.\u201d Vivian wasn\u2019t letting anyone near her roses, especially Rachel Henderson. Her neighbor was no more trustworthy than anyone else.</p><p>Another glance passed between Susannah and Chrissie, but it was too hard for Vivian to read the look they\u2019d exchanged.</p><p>\u201cI could take Grandma back to the house,\u201d Chrissie suggested, \u201cso she can work in her garden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you like that, Mother?\u201d</p><p>This was the most ridiculous question Susannah had asked her yet. \u201cYes, of course I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Grandma, then let\u2019s get you a sweater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my gloves?\u201d Apparently both Susannah and Chrissie were willing to ignore the fact that someone in this abominable place had stolen her favorite gardening gloves.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at the house, Mom, on the back porch. The pruning shears are in the garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where those shears are.\u201d She hated to sound so impatient, but at times Susannah treated her as if she didn\u2019t have a brain in her head. Yes, she had a few problems with her memory now and then, but that didn\u2019t mean she was incapacitated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my jewels.\u201d</p><p>Susannah and Chrissie exchanged glances again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to leave this room when anyone could walk in and take my jewelry, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d Susannah seemed about to argue with her but then she didn\u2019t.</p><p>That was good, because Vivian had no intention of leaving her pearls behind, not when someone could easily steal them. She retrieved her brown purse, where she kept her favorite necklace, and looped the straps tightly over her arm. She put on a sweater\u2014she was often cold these days\u2014and reached for her red \u201ceveryday\u201d purse.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m finished with the roses, I\u2019ll take you both to lunch. My treat.\u201d If she stayed here much longer she\u2019d starve to death. In all her life, Vivian had never tasted blander food. These people obviously didn\u2019t know the purpose of a salt shaker or a spice rack.</p><p>She locked her room, tested the knob three times, and then they headed for the front door. Susannah stopped to talk to Rose, who ran the desk. Fortunately the staff wore name tags. She wished everyone did. It would help her remember the residents\u2019 names. Several had introduced themselves, but for the life of her she couldn\u2019t recall the name of a single one. Yes, everyone here ought to wear a name tag.</p><p>The instant they stepped into the house, Vivian felt distressed. Furniture had been moved and there were dishes stacked on the kitchen counter. Then when she walked outside, she was in for another shock. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been in my garden,\u201d she blurted. The roses were trimmed and there wasn\u2019t a single weed in sight. Everything was tied up and clipped back. There was almost nothing left for her to do. Someone had been in her garden, and it could only have been Rachel, her neighbor.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Susannah said, placing an arm around her shoulders. \u201cThe garden is lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Vivian muttered. She\u2019d come to recognize her daughter\u2019s tone and she didn\u2019t like it one bit. Just the way she said mother told Vivian Susannah thought something was wrong with her.</p><p>After ten minutes or so, Susannah disappeared inside the house, probably to make more calls on that little phone of hers. Vivian shook her head hopelessly\u2014Susannah seemed to be making a big mess of things. Frankly, she\u2019d taught her daughter to be a better housekeeper than this. But wanting to maintain the peace, Vivian said nothing.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long she and Chrissie worked outside, puttering about, moving a few annuals\u2014when had she put those begonias in? She really couldn\u2019t remember. Vivian noticed Rachel Henderson peering through the window a couple of times, but she tried to ignore her. The minute that busybody stuck her nose out the door, Vivian intended to tell Rachel to keep out of her garden, otherwise she was contacting the police.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Vivian announced after a while. It was the first real hunger she\u2019d experienced since her daughter had moved her to that godforsaken facility. It was a good feeling. She\u2019d lost interest in food, although heaven knew the best television these days was on the Food Channel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready for lunch, too,\u201d Chrissie told her, straightening.</p><p>All they had to do now was collect Susannah. Vivian knew where she wanted to go for lunch. Le Gourmand was new to Colville, and Vivian had heard that they served an incredibly good chicken salad. Her mouth watered just thinking about it. She missed going out for lunch; many an afternoon she\u2019d lunched with her two best friends, Barbara and June, but they were both gone now, God rest their souls. George, too.</p><p>\u201cThey have outside seating,\u201d Vivian said as Susannah held open the car door.</p><p>\u201cWho does, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLe Gourmand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where you\u2019d like to go for lunch?\u201d</p><p>Silly girl. She\u2019d already said so. Sometimes she swore Susannah simply didn\u2019t listen. \u201cYes. It\u2019s such a nice afternoon, let\u2019s eat outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect,\u201d Susannah said, helping Vivian into the front seat.</p><p>Vivian struggled with the seat belt. The car manufacturers made them so hard to reach these days. If not for Chrissie\u2019s handing it to her, Vivian would\u2019ve needed to be a contortionist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s new, but apparently their chicken salad is excellent. They add chopped walnuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLe Gourmand has been around for ten years,\u201d Susannah said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d They did a nice lunch business, but were closed for dinner.</p><p>Thankfully there were plenty of empty tables on the patio. Vivian watched as Susannah went inside to place their order. Vivian remembered that she wanted to buy their lunch, but all of a sudden she couldn\u2019t seem to find her purse. She twisted around in her seat, and her heart started to pound hard. George would be so upset if she lost her pearls.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Grandma?\u201d Chrissie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I did with my purse.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie leaned close and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s on your lap, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>Her relief was immediate. The red purse lay there, as peaceful as a sleeping kitten.</p><p>\u201cYour brown purse with the jewelry is in the trunk of the car, remember?\u201d</p><p>Actually, that little piece of information had slipped her mind. She was grateful for the reminder, although she wished Chrissie hadn\u2019t shared it with the entire world.</p><p>\u201cHere comes Mom now.\u201d</p><p>Susannah took a seat at the small round table. Vivian appreciated the umbrella that had been tilted to shade her face from the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cOur order should be ready in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get my tea?\u201d Vivian asked, but her question was drowned out by the roar of a truck engine as it pulled to a stop at the intersection. A long-haired young man turned to look at them. His window was rolled down and his dark hair fell into his face. He needed a shave, too. His tanned elbow rested on the window ledge, and he hadn\u2019t bothered to put on a decent shirt that morning. Instead, he wore a sleeveless T-shirt. While Vivian assessed him, he was making eyes at Chrissie. Such flirting was inappropriate and she was about to warn Chrissie when she noticed that her granddaughter seemed to be enjoying it.</p><p>He nodded in Chrissie\u2019s direction and to Vivian\u2019s horror, Chrissie nodded back. Vivian pursed her lips. He started to say something, but his gaze slid to her and he changed his mind, as well he should.</p><p>She needed a few minutes to recognize the young man, but her brain provided the answer the second he looked at her. It was Troy Nance, a known troublemaker.</p><p>The light turned green and Troy drove off with a burst of noise and exhaust.</p><p>\u201cWho was that, Grandma?\u201d Chrissie asked.</p><p>She hesitated, wondering if she should tell Chrissie, and then decided she would. Susannah\u2019s daughter was a sensible young woman and would see that Troy was completely unsuitable.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the son of that girl you went to school with,\u201d Vivian told Susannah.</p><p>\u201cI went to school with a lot of girls, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember her name.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Chrissie pressed.</p><p>\u201cTroy Nance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharon Nance\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Of course. Sharon hadn\u2019t been married, so she and her son had the same last name. Although hers might be something different now.... Vivian shook her head; she couldn\u2019t even imagine who the boy\u2019s father had been. Whoever he was, he certainly hadn\u2019t stayed in the picture long.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Sharon in years.\u201d</p><p>Not that Susannah was likely to cross paths with the other woman. The last Vivian had heard, Sharon was working at the Roadside Inn on the outskirts of town. She was the kind of woman George often saw in his courtroom\u2014the kind of woman he described as trouble looking for a place to happen.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d Chrissie murmured.</p><p>Susannah\u2019s eyes flew to Vivian\u2019s and this time the two of them traded a look. Vivian knew what that look meant, too.</p><p>It said Chrissie wasn\u2019t as levelheaded as Vivian had assumed and Susannah was well aware of it.</p> <p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>When Susannah took her mother back to Altamira, she could see that Vivian was exhausted. Still wearing her sweater, Vivian sat in front of the television and automatically put her feet up. Within minutes, she was sound asleep and snoring softly.</p><p>Susannah and Chrissie quietly left the room after securing her mother\u2019s purse with the jewelry in the bottom dresser drawer. As soon as they were out in the parking lot, Chrissie turned to her and said, \u201cGrandma hardly looks the same anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She\u2019s gone downhill so fast it\u2019s frightening.\u201d The difference was noticeable even to Chrissie, who tended to be self-absorbed, as were most girls her age.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do now?\u201d Chrissie asked as Susannah unlocked the car door. Chrissie couldn\u2019t bear not to have something planned\u2014usually something social. But she seemed genuinely willing to help. With Chrissie there, Susannah hoped to finish packing up her parents\u2019 house more quickly than she\u2019d expected, but the girl would probably wear her out, too.</p><p>\u201cI need you to help me finish loading everything up and into the storage unit,\u201d Susannah explained. Cleaning out each room was a tedious and heartbreaking process.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose that would be all right.\u201d Chrissie didn\u2019t sound enthusiastic and Susannah didn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>They went to Safeway, where the manager had set aside half a dozen cardboard cartons. Collecting boxes had become part of Susannah\u2019s daily routine. Her favorites were the reinforced ones used for fruit. Twice a day, Susannah would take whatever had been boxed up to the storage unit. The boxes were labeled and would wait there, neatly stacked, until she decided what to do with them. When that would be, she didn\u2019t know. She\u2019d merely deferred many of these decisions. She still had to figure out what she should keep, what should go to the kids, what could be donated to charity. Susannah was afraid she might discard something she would later regret.</p><p>When they pulled up in front of the house, she noticed a smartly dressed woman sitting in a car across the street. When they climbed out of the Crown Victoria and opened the trunk to remove boxes, the same woman emerged from her car.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the tall brunette said with a warm smile as she crossed the street. \u201cI\u2019m Melody Highland.\u201d She peeled a business card out of a small gold case and thrust it at Susannah. \u201cI work with the Colville Real Estate Company. I understand you\u2019re going to be putting your mother\u2019s house on the market soon.\u201d</p><p>Listing it now would be premature; Susannah realized she wasn\u2019t quite ready to take that final step. She accepted the card and was about to tell the real estate agent that, but before she could say a word, Melody continued.</p><p>\u201cColville Real Estate has an impeccable reputation in the community. I\u2019ve been with the firm eight years and I\u2019m their top salesperson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d Susannah couldn\u2019t think of any other response.</p><p>\u201cI have several clients who\u2019d be interested in a home such as this in a well-established neighborhood.\u201d</p> <p>Susannah stared at the card. Curious, she looked up and asked, \u201cHow did you get my name?\u201d</p><p>Melody smiled. \u201cColville is a small town. Word gets around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it Mrs. Henderson?\u201d</p><p>Melody hesitated and her cheery facade disappeared. \u201cActually,\u201d she said with reluctance, \u201cI heard about you through the storage unit place. They sometimes give me tips on possible listings.\u201d</p><p>That explained it, and Susannah was more than a little offended by this cozy sharing of private information. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not ready to list the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I could be of service in some way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but no.\u201d Susannah wasn\u2019t going to let this woman push her into acting before the time was right.</p><p>\u201cDo keep my card. I know we can get top dollar for your parents\u2019 home.\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded, slipping the business card into her pocket. \u201cThank you for stopping by, but we really need to get back to work now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I should be the one thanking you,\u201d Melody Highland said smoothly. \u201cI look forward to doing business with you in the near future.\u201d</p><p>Susannah and Chrissie started toward the house.</p><p>\u201cCan I check with you in a week or two?\u201d Melody called just as Susannah reached the front steps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer to contact you when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Melody said and marched back across the street to her car.</p><p>Susannah waited until she\u2019d driven off, then set down two of the boxes. \u201cMy goodness. She was eager, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Chrissie muttered, seemingly amused. \u201cI\u2019ll bet she\u2019s already got clients lined up to look at the house. I can imagine how those potential buyers would react if they saw the place now.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the house and Susannah had the feeling she\u2019d made a lucky escape. She wondered how many other real estate agents she\u2019d have to fend off before this ordeal was over.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like me to begin?\u201d Chrissie asked, standing just inside the living room. Hands on hips, she surveyed the area. Five days after moving her mother out, Susannah had made only a small dent in what needed to be done.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the bookcase in the living room?\u201d she suggested. When she had time, Susannah wanted to go carefully through all the titles. Her father had been an avid reader and there might be some first editions in his collection. Those books would be something to hand down to Brian one day.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Chrissie grabbed a box. \u201cI\u2019ll start there.\u201d</p><p>Many of her mother\u2019s personal things had been taken to her new apartment, but her father\u2019s office remained untouched. Until now, Susannah had avoided it, but she couldn\u2019t put it off forever.</p><p>Knowing her dad, he\u2019d kept meticulous records. She\u2019d have to sort through every file and drawer. Maybe she should wait until she was better able to deal with it emotionally. No\u2014this couldn\u2019t wait. She pulled out a stack of files and had just started to go through one of them when Chrissie called her.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d she shouted. \u201cCome here quick.\u201d</p><p>Susannah hurried out to the living room. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d Chrissie cried, brandishing a fifty-dollar bill. \u201cIt fell out of this book when I took it down from the shelf.\u201d She held up a history of the Second World War.</p><p>\u201cGood grief.\u201d Susannah realized there might be more money stashed in other books.</p><p>Chrissie reached for a second volume. Holding the book upside down, she splayed it open and two more bills fell onto the carpet. \u201cTwenty-dollar bills,\u201d Chrissie said. \u201cThese books are full of money.\u201d</p><p>Susannah groaned. She didn\u2019t know who had placed the bills there. It could\u2019ve been either her mother or her father\u2014perhaps both of them. Recently her mother had grown so distrusting of everyone that she\u2019d started hiding things all over the house.</p><p>\u201cBe sure and check inside each book,\u201d Susannah said. This was going to slow them down even more. \u201cMaybe I should help.\u201d Having to examine each volume individually would be time-consuming.</p><p>\u201cThis is like a treasure hunt,\u201d Chrissie said excitedly, taking down a copy of Gone With the Wind.</p><p>Before Susannah could respond, the doorbell rang. She wove her way through the cartons littering the room. If it was another real estate salesperson, she wouldn\u2019t be nearly as polite as she\u2019d been the first time.</p><p>She opened the door to a woman in her late sixties, possibly early seventies. \u201cHello, Susannah,\u201d she said pleasantly as if she expected Susannah to recognize her immediately.</p><p>Susanna didn\u2019t know this woman from Eve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Eve Sutter.\u201d</p><p>Eve? God does have a sense of humor, she thought with a glimmer of amusement. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, should I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your mother\u2019s mentioned my name. We\u2019re dear, dear friends.\u201d</p><p>Susannah couldn\u2019t remember her mother ever mentioning anyone named Eve. Not wanting to be rude, she held open the screen door so the other woman could come inside.</p><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019d moved Vivian over to Altamira,\u201d Eve said as she stepped into the house. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely facility, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. She didn\u2019t have time to waste with social chitchat. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I came to help you,\u201d Eve said, sounding surprised, again as if Susannah should intuitively know the reason for her visit. \u201cI understand how difficult it is to pack up an entire life. I\u2019m here to offer my assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very thoughtful, but...\u201d Susannah was about to explain that she didn\u2019t require this woman\u2019s assistance; however, she wasn\u2019t allowed to finish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s far more here than your mother wants or needs.\u201d Eve scanned the room, leaning to one side as she glanced down the long hallway that led to the bedrooms. \u201cThere are a number of things I\u2019d be willing to take off your hands. We wear the same size, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith so much to do, you must be looking for helping hands and here I am. Now, where should I start?\u201d Eve pushed up her sleeves in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter and I have everything under control, but thank you.\u201d Susannah walked over to the door and pointedly held it open.</p><p>Eve\u2019s head reared back as though she\u2019d been insulted. \u201cOf course. Well, I\u2019ll stop by later with a bucket of chicken and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already have dinner plans.\u201d Susannah opened the screen door, feeling less and less civil. If this so-called friend of her mother\u2019s was a friend indeed, Susannah distrusted her.</p><p>Eve nodded, smiled sweetly and walked out the door. Susannah closed it with a decisive bang.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe that woman?\u201d she yelped, her voice rising in outrage.</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the vultures have started circling overhead. First, that real estate woman and now Eve, my mother\u2019s dear friend,\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cWhom I never heard Mom mention even once.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chrissie laughed, but to Susannah this was no laughing matter.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mom, lighten up. She didn\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d</p><p>Susannah disagreed. Eve whatever-her-name was nothing but a freeloader.</p><p>The phone rang and they looked at each other, startled. Then Chrissie rushed into the kitchen to answer. Susannah suspected it was Joe; they\u2019d spoken that morning, and he was unhappy with Chrissie, but Susannah had smoothed the waters. Although she didn\u2019t approve of her daughter\u2019s deception, she was grateful for her presence.</p> <p>Chrissie was gone for several minutes. In the meantime, Susannah had unearthed another fifty dollars and packed up an entire row of books. Then\u2014of all things\u2014she found four teaspoons hidden behind the out-of-date encyclopedia. The very ones, no doubt, that Martha had supposedly stolen. Which reminded her\u2014she needed to call Martha.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe who that was.\u201d</p><p>Judging by the happiness in her daughter\u2019s eyes, Susannah\u2019s first guess was Jason, but she\u2019d let Chrissie tell her. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie nearly skipped over to the bookcase. \u201cIt was the guy in the pickup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat guy?\u201d Susannah asked before she remembered.</p> <p>\u201cMother! The guy this afternoon. He figured I was related to Grandma, so he took a chance and called the house. He asked me out.\u201d</p><p>Susannah was horrified. \u201cYou\u2019re not going, are you?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie laughed as if she assumed Susannah was joking. \u201cOf course I\u2019m going. This is the most exciting invitation I\u2019ve had in months. I\u2019m well over eighteen, so it\u2019s not like I have to ask your permission.\u201d</p><p>Yes, indeed, the vultures were out in full force.</p><p>Carolyn checked her watch and when she saw it was noon, she leaped out of her chair.</p><p>\u201cCarolyn?\u201d her assistant asked as she hurried past.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d go home for lunch today,\u201d she said, not stopping to answer questions. Her heart pounded as she reached her truck and got inside. When she\u2019d started the engine and backed out of her parking slot, she happened to catch her reflection in the rearview mirror. Her face was flushed and she was nibbling on her lower lip, which was a habit from childhood. She released her lip as if hearing her mother chastise her, switching between French and English. The words still rang in Carolyn\u2019s ears these many years later.</p><p>It was all that talk last evening about the paths not taken, she reasoned. Carolyn hadn\u2019t contributed much to the discussion. When she\u2019d gone to bed, she\u2019d lain awake most of the night, thinking. There\u2019d been a number of different paths in her life\u2014the ones she\u2019d taken and others left unexplored. One stretched before her now.</p><p>Dave Langevin.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been able to get him out of her mind. Her mother would be furieuse if she knew that her daughter was attracted to a lawn-maintenance man. Since her twenties, Carolyn had lived a solitary life. Thoughts of a relationship, any relationship, were best ignored. She was a woman in a world usually populated by men, and she didn\u2019t have the time or inclination for romance. It\u2019d been easy to ignore the fact that she was a woman until she met Dave. When she looked at him, for some unaccountable reason, she felt alive again. In the beginning she\u2019d tried to ignore the attraction, ignore the way he made her feel. It was uncomfortable at best and downright embarrassing at worst. She\u2019d told no one. Really, how could she?</p><p>As she turned into her driveway, she realized her timing was perfect. Just as she\u2019d hoped, Dave Langevin was working in her yard doing her regular maintenance. He\u2019d been there on an unscheduled visit the day before, adding beauty bark to her flower beds. Right now he was mowing the grass. With the sun beating down, he\u2019d removed his shirt, and his sun-bronzed torso glistened with perspiration. So intent was she on watching him that she nearly drove off the road. When it came to running the lumber mill, Carolyn was capable, competent, in charge. When it came to male-female relationships outside of business, she felt inept, clumsy and completely tongue-tied.</p><p>She parked her vehicle inside the garage and with trembling hands went into the kitchen, where she prepared a ham sandwich and added some coleslaw and pickle slices, although she didn\u2019t have the appetite for even a mouthful. After carrying it onto the patio, she sat down and made a show of eating.</p><p>Dave had his shirt on now and was pushing the mower to the side of the house, close to the patio.</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d she said as if it was the most natural thing in the world for her to hurry home in the middle of the day. \u201cYou\u2019re getting to be a regular fixture around here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not disturbing your lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Would you care to join me?\u201d While she might sound casual, nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dave said, flashing her a grin. His teeth were white and even. \u201cThey don\u2019t pay me to dine with the clientele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a glass of iced tea?\u201d she asked next.</p><p>He hesitated and then nodded. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>In her eagerness to get him a glass, she nearly toppled her own chair. Rushing into the kitchen, Carolyn drew a deep breath in a futile effort to slow down her hammering pulse. Inviting a man to join her for lunch was so out of character that it felt as if she\u2019d done something illegal.</p><p>She\u2019d thought about little else all day. As she dressed that morning, she\u2019d been putting together a plan of action. She wore her hair down instead of in her customary braid and opted for a white blouse with a lace collar rather than the cotton plaid that was her general uniform. Her jeans and boots were the same, but nothing else seemed to be\u2014including her mind. Gloria had noticed her change of outfit right away and might have made some remark if not for the look Carolyn sent her.</p><p>\u201cDo you take it sweetened or unsweetened?\u201d she called through the screen door.</p><p>\u201cUnsweetened.\u201d</p><p>She managed to pour the tea, then took it outside and handed it to him. Dave thanked her with a nod. He hadn\u2019t buttoned his shirt, and she had a hard time not staring at his muscular chest. A light mat of sun-bleached hair caught her attention. She felt like a schoolgirl, mesmerized by the sight, and resisted the urge to press her palm against his heart to see if his pulse beat as erratically as her own.</p><p>Dave drank the tea without stopping, then pulled off his hat and wiped his forearm across his brow.</p><p>\u201cThat tasted great. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn didn\u2019t know what to say next. Her tongue felt stuck to the roof of her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI came up from California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lived there for a while. Which part?\u201d she asked, trying to make conversation, anything that would let Dave know how much she wanted to be his friend. No\u2014more than his friend.</p><p>\u201cHere and there. I moved around a lot.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sank. In other words, he wasn\u2019t interested in telling her.</p><p>But then he surprised her. \u201cI lived in the Fresno area for a time,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get up here?\u201d she asked, trying again. It was a bit awkward, the two of them standing there, making stilted conversation. She gestured toward the chair. Dave declined, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t stay in one place for long,\u201d he said. \u201cI was never one to put down roots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have any.\u201d Sadness darkened his eyes and he looked away.</p><p>\u201cNone?\u201d she repeated slowly.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a wife?\u201d It was a bold question and she felt astonished at her own audacity in asking it.</p><p>\u201cI was never married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Carolyn could hardly believe it.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I wasn\u2019t one for roots.\u201d</p><p>She wondered what had happened to this man that kept him from living a normal life. Then it came to her. He\u2019d been in prison; he must have been. It was the only thing that made sense. He preferred not to discuss his past. He hadn\u2019t settled down anywhere. He was attractive and appealing and vital, yet he\u2019d never married.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d He spoke softly, almost as if he regretted asking the question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...My marriage ended a lot of years ago and well, I never\u2014you know\u2014I never met anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>She swallowed tightly. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have children, either.\u201d He retreated a couple of steps, apparently uncomfortable with the information he\u2019d shared. \u201cI should get to work.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn stepped back, too.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away and set the empty tumbler carefully on the table. \u201cThe tea,\u201d he said.</p><p>Carolyn had the distinct impression that his appreciation went beyond a glass of cold tea.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>\u201cI\u2019 m glad you came by,\u201d Susannah said as she held open the front door for Carolyn late Saturday afternoon. She\u2019d dreaded the thought of spending the evening alone. For the second day in a row, Chrissie had gone off with Troy Nance. Much to her consternation, her daughter seemed utterly enthralled by him.</p><p>Susannah had disliked Troy on sight, and every meeting since had confirmed her negative opinion of her former schoolmate\u2019s son. She didn\u2019t like the way Troy looked at her daughter, either, as though he was salivating over some tempting delicacy on a restaurant dessert platter. As far as she could determine, he was unemployed, smoked, drank and generally lived on the edge. She was afraid drugs might be part of that scenario, too.</p><p>\u201cI brought dinner,\u201d Carolyn said, holding up a plastic grocery bag. \u201cA few goodies that\u2019ll help us remember our time in France.\u201d</p><p>Susannah guessed it was a baguette, soft cheese and sun-dried tomatoes in seasoned olive oil. And, of course, Carolyn would include a bottle of red wine. As schoolgirls they\u2019d spent many a weekend afternoon in the Loire Valley, enjoying a repast just like that. Those picnics had always included chaperones, but they\u2019d been fun all the same.</p><p>When Carolyn left Colville as a high school sophomore, she and Susannah had been good friends. But during that year in the French boarding school, they\u2019d truly bonded. Susannah wasn\u2019t sure why they\u2019d let their relationship erode in the decades that followed.</p><p>\u201cSun-dried tomatoes?\u201d she asked and closed her eyes in ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cPlus fresh bread and ch\u00e8vre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite.\u201d Her stomach rumbled in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I\u2019d forget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do all this,\u201d Susannah said, although she was relieved to stay home. After an entire day of physically demanding labor, she was content to relax, enjoy this feast and simply talk.</p><p>They sat across from each other at the dining room table, and drank wine out of plastic cups. The bread, cheese and tomatoes were served on paper plates.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chrissie?\u201d Carolyn asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Susannah slowly shook her head. \u201cShe met Troy Nance yesterday and they\u2019ve barely spent a minute apart since then.\u201d Okay, that was an exaggeration, because Chrissie had helped Susannah for most of the day. She\u2019d been to visit Vivian, as well. But when she was with Susannah, she\u2019d talked nearly nonstop about how wonderful Troy was.</p><p>Carolyn didn\u2019t say anything but from her frown, Susannah deduced that her friend\u2019s opinion of this young man was the same as hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Carolyn shrugged. \u201cNot much. He worked at the mill, but he didn\u2019t last long. We have a drug-testing program\u2014because of all the heavy equipment\u2014and once Troy heard about that, he stopped showing up.\u201d</p> <p>Just as Susannah had feared, he seemed to be involved with drugs. Carolyn\u2019s story implied as much.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what Chrissie sees in him,\u201d she said. That was putting it mildly. \u201cShe recently broke up with her boyfriend from school and I suppose she\u2019s still feeling hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Troy must be balm to her wounded ego.\u201d</p><p>This was Susannah\u2019s take on the situation, too.</p><p>Carolyn sipped her wine. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably figured out that his mother is Sharon Nance. She\u2019s been married two or three times over the years, but still goes by Nance.\u201d</p> <p>Susannah did remember Sharon and while they\u2019d never been friends, they\u2019d been cordial. Sharon was hot-tempered as a teenager and had an unsavory reputation. At the age of thirteen, she\u2019d bragged she was dating twenty-year-old men. By comparison, Susannah had lived an innocent existence. Sharon came from a single-parent home\u2014a rarity in those days. Her mother had worked as a barmaid and now, so did Sharon.</p><p>Susannah sighed heavily, disappointed in her daughter\u2019s fascination with Troy. \u201cI assumed that one date would clue Chrissie in to the fact that Troy is no prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she went out with him last night?\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded and swallowed a sip of wine. \u201cShe was home early enough, before midnight, and claimed she\u2019d had an amazing time\u2014her word. But I don\u2019t think she\u2019d tell me if she hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Carolyn reached for a slice of bread and then for the cheese.</p><p>Discouraged, Susannah leaned back in her chair. She\u2019d failed Chrissie in this situation and wasn\u2019t proud of what she\u2019d done, especially because she knew better. \u201cI tried to warn Chrissie about Troy, but I might as well have saved my breath. It was a mistake to say anything because now she\u2019s determined to prove how wrong I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Troy\u2019s into hard drugs, if that\u2019s what concerns you,\u201d Carolyn said.</p><p>That was reassuring. But Troy definitely looked like a recreational drug user, and leaving his job at the mill confirmed it. \u201cI talked to my husband and he said we\u2019ve done our best raising Chrissie and at almost twenty she\u2019s capable of making her own decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you agree?\u201d Carolyn asked, skewering Susannah with a look. \u201cNever having had children, I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t, either,\u201d Susannah muttered. It would\u2019ve been so nice to spend these weeks with her daughter, just the two of them. They\u2019d been getting along well, and the last thing she wanted now was to be at odds with Chrissie over a young man who\u2019d be in and out of their lives within a few days.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m finding so difficult is all of this,\u201d Susannah said, gesturing around her. \u201cI\u2019m packing up my parents\u2019 lives and discovering all these bits and pieces of my own life. For instance, Mom saved the first baby tooth I lost. I also came across a file she kept with all my school papers from first grade on. She saved everything, and I do mean everything.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn nodded. \u201cI know what you mean. I didn\u2019t pack up my mom and dad\u2019s stuff, but I moved into their home. Everywhere I turned I was confronted by memories. It was a little eerie at first, you know?\u201d</p><p>Susannah did. Speaking of eerie...She leaned forward, wondering if she should say anything. \u201cI didn\u2019t mention this to Joe because I don\u2019t want to alarm him. Someone\u2019s been in the house recently.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn paused, her glass halfway to her mouth. \u201cSomeone\u2019s broken into the house?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s the crazy part. There\u2019s been no obvious break-in and nothing of value is missing. Well, some old sports ribbons and baseball cards. A few other things.\u201d She paused. \u201cIt\u2019s happened more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you spooked?\u201d Carolyn asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it\u2019s driving me crazy. Who would do that and why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea?\u201d</p><p>Susannah just shook her head.</p><p>Carolyn nibbled on her bread and cheese. \u201cDo you think the spirit of your father is still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The thought appalled Susannah. \u201cThat\u2019s not it at all. This is...different.\u201d Susannah grew quiet in an effort to put her feelings into words. \u201cThursday night after meeting with you and the others, I came back here and the moment I stepped inside the house, I knew someone had been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that when you found Chrissie had arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I still think it\u2019s more than that. True, Chrissie was there\u2014but I sensed someone else had come in, too. And I\u2019m pretty sure it happened again, maybe even today. That makes three times I know of. This afternoon, I saw that some of my father\u2019s papers were missing. I\u2019d just started going through his files and I\u2019d left some stuff on his desk. Then it turned up missing. Gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you didn\u2019t toss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive. I know it was there and then it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>Her friend was silent after that. \u201cAnything on your mind these days?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s gaze flew to hers, and her face immediately reddened.</p><p>\u201cCarolyn?\u201d</p><p>She blushed even more profusely, but didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She finally began, \u201cThere\u2019s this guy....\u201d</p><p>Susannah should\u2019ve known it had to do with a man. \u201cWhat guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to say anything. His name\u2019s Dave. He\u2019s with Kettle Falls Landscaping and he maintains my yard and the area outside my office. I can\u2019t stop thinking about him. At work I catch myself staring out the window, hoping for a glimpse of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? Is he married?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, he says he\u2019s never been married. I think...I think he might have a criminal record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely there\u2019s some way you can get that information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already looked on the Internet,\u201d Carolyn said, then blushed again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose he\u2019s using an alias?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shifted as if uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think he\u2019s been in prison?\u201d Susannah asked gently.</p><p>\u201cNothing, other than the fact that he\u2019s so private and much too beautiful never to have married or had a family.\u201d</p><p>Susannah smiled at her friend\u2019s use of the word beautiful. She didn\u2019t consider men in those terms, but apparently Carolyn did.</p><p>\u201cYesterday afternoon as he left my house, I saw him glance at me\u2014he didn\u2019t know I could see him. Ridiculous as it sounds, I got this happy, excited feeling because he was thinking about me. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true, but I felt it.\u201d She brought one hand to her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m too old to have these kinds of feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re breathing, you\u2019re not too old. It\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019ve met a man who makes you feel alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all he makes me feel.\u201d Two red spots brightened her cheeks. She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to get involved with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Susannah protested. She knew Carolyn, and her friend didn\u2019t give her heart away lightly. \u201cYou deserve happiness. It\u2019s hard enough to find without erecting unnecessary roadblocks.\u201d</p><p>Still, Carolyn looked uncertain. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Susannah could understand her dilemma. \u201cWhy do anything? Just let it happen.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, a slow smile spread across Carolyn\u2019s face. \u201cMaybe I will,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Sunday morning, Susannah, Chrissie and Vivian attended the second service at Colville Christian Church, where Susannah had gone from early childhood. Several people greeted Susannah and Chrissie and offered Vivian warm hugs.</p><p>During the sermon, her mother held her Bible in her lap. She appeared to be following intently, running her finger down a page in the Book of John. Pastor Nichols was preaching from the second chapter of James, but Susannah didn\u2019t have the heart to correct her.</p><p>Chrissie fidgeted throughout the service. As soon as the organist played the closing benediction, she hurried toward the door. She was waiting impatiently by the car when Susannah and her mother got to the parking lot.</p><p>Susannah drove her mother back to Altamira, and led Vivian into the dining room for lunch. The fact that her mother was joining the other residents for meals was progress. Until Saturday, Vivian had insisted on eating in her room. Susannah wasn\u2019t sure what had convinced her mother to reconsider but she suspected it had something to do with the fees charged to deliver meals.</p><p>Once they were back in the car, Chrissie glanced anxiously at Susannah. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind if I took the rest of the day off, would you?\u201d</p><p>Before Susannah could say anything, her daughter added, \u201cTroy and a bunch of his friends are going to Lake Roosevelt to ride Jet Skis. He invited me along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday. You weren\u2019t planning on packing today, were you?\u201d</p><p>As a matter of fact, Susannah had decided she could use a day off. Their morning had gotten off to a late start with church. Her mother would probably rest for most of the afternoon.</p><p>Susannah hoped to spend time with Vivian later to discuss some of the decisions that had to be made. Vivian\u2019s mental capabilities were clearly diminished, but Susannah felt the need to talk everything over with her, although it usually turned out to be a token effort.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you, Mom?\u201d Chrissie pressed.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that would be all right.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to disguise her displeasure that Chrissie was seeing Troy Nance again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like Troy, do you? You don\u2019t even know him, but you\u2019ve already judged him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost twenty years old, for heaven\u2019s sake! I\u2019m going to the lake this afternoon, whether you like it or not. Troy\u2019s picking me up in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s mind was already made up and Susannah wondered why her daughter had bothered to ask in the first place. The struggle between approval and independence seemed to be a difficult one for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sure enough, a few minutes later Troy drove up to the house. He climbed out of his truck as Chrissie dashed out the front door and down the front steps to join him.</p><p>Susannah stood at the living room window, her mouth pursed with disapproval. She watched Troy grab Chrissie around the waist, then drag her to his side as if staking claim to her sleek, young body. Troy\u2019s older pickup truck was scratched and dented, but the sound system seemed to be top of the line. It was loud enough to rattle the living room windows.</p><p>The couple disappeared, leaving a trail of exhaust in their wake. Her instincts told her he was trouble. Where that trouble would lead her daughter, Susannah was afraid to guess.</p><p>With Chrissie gone, the house seemed unnaturally quiet. Susannah figured she had maybe two hours during which to work or relax before returning to Altamira. She roamed around the house, looking for an unchallenging task, something that would help pass the time. She would\u2019ve called Joe, but he and Brian had gone salmon fishing for the weekend. Joe said he felt it was important that he bond with his son, in the same way Chrissie and Susannah were doing.</p> <p>Some bond. Despite Susannah\u2019s best efforts, most of her and Chrissie\u2019s conversations since Friday afternoon had revolved around Troy. And most of that was Chrissie defending him.</p><p>Walking down the hallway, Susannah paused in the doorway to her father\u2019s office. The old mahogany desk with the filing cabinet in one corner still needed to be cleared out. Her father had been dead for seven months now and other than the drawer she\u2019d emptied, that desk was exactly as she\u2019d seen it the day of his funeral.</p><p>Susannah sighed wearily. There seemed to be no better time to tackle his desk than now. She sank down in the chair where her father had routinely sat to pay bills. Opening the top drawer, she scooped up the first group of file folders. They turned out to be for the various utilities, in alphabetical order, followed by a file for the bank. It was filled with mortgage statements.</p><p>The house had been paid off long ago, but every statement could be easily located had anyone asked. She couldn\u2019t imagine where he\u2019d kept the last forty years of cancelled checks and knew without a doubt that she\u2019d stumble on them sooner or later. When she did, they\u2019d be categorized by day, month and year.</p><p>The desk would take her about two hours, she estimated, prepared to assume the task. With the shredder, a Christmas gift from her and Joe several years earlier, to one side, she sorted through each file.</p> <p>There seemed no good reason to hold on to all this paperwork. She flipped through the folders, giving them a cursory inspection, then shredded the contents. It was when she reached the last files in the top drawer that she discovered one marked Colville Natural Gas.</p><p>That gave her pause, since her parents\u2019 house wasn\u2019t heated by natural gas.</p><p>Sensing that she wouldn\u2019t like what she found, she opened it to examine the contents. The first sheet appeared to be a letter of some kind, dated January 1973. Susannah\u2019s gaze slid to the bottom of the page. She gasped.</p><p>She quickly scanned the text, and her outrage exploded when she realized what she was reading. She vaulted to her feet.</p><p>Her father had paid Allan Presley to leave Washington State\u2014with Jake. In exchange for five thousand dollars cash, Mr. Presley had agreed to move a minimum of five hundred miles from Colville. Allan Presley had accepted this cash with the understanding that he and Jake would not only leave Colville, but never return.</p><p>Even with the evidence in her hands she couldn\u2019t accept that her father would commit such an act of betrayal. She knew Jake\u2019s father needed money. As young as she\u2019d been at the time, Susannah remembered Jake\u2019s concerns about his father\u2019s financial problems. Knowing Allan\u2019s hand-to-mouth existence and his weakness for the bottle, her father had offered him money. He\u2019d paid the Presleys to get Jake out of Susannah\u2019s life. Because his father had agreed to this blackmail\u2014and that was precisely what it was\u2014Jake had honored his father\u2019s word. Although he loved her\u2014and Susannah believed that with all her heart\u2014he\u2019d walked away.</p> <p>Susannah crushed the sheet of paper in her fist as she fought to control her emotions. She\u2019d known. A part of her had always known it would be something like this. Her father had been desperate to keep Jake out of her life, desperate enough to send her to Europe. Desperate enough to manipulate Jake\u2019s life, Allan Presley\u2019s life and that of his only daughter. It was maddening. No, it was more than that\u2014it was wrong.</p><p>Unable to keep this to herself a minute longer, Susannah grabbed her purse and headed out of the house, taking the signed contract with her. She\u2019d smoothed out the crumpled paper, which was now neatly folded in her purse.</p><p>Her irritation had settled down but her stomach continued to roil as she found a parking space in front of Altamira. She hoped her mother had managed to rest, because Susannah needed answers and she needed them now. This letter wasn\u2019t the only thing she\u2019d uncovered. There\u2019d been some odd withdrawals from his bank account, too.</p><p>To her surprise, Vivian\u2019s door was open when she arrived. She walked in to see another woman visiting her mother.</p><p>\u201cSusannah,\u201d Vivian said, her eyes smiling with happiness. \u201cLook who\u2019s come to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Susannah said, entering the small apartment. Whoever this woman was, she didn\u2019t recognize her. She could only hope it wasn\u2019t another \u201cfriend\u201d like Eve. \u201cI\u2019m Susannah Nelson, Vivian\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally Mansfield,\u201d the woman said. She was about the same age as her mother, but seemed more...alert. More aware.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a friend of your mother\u2019s cousin Judy from California. Lloyd and I were passing through the area twelve or thirteen years ago in our motor home and we went to see your parents. We\u2019d had such a good visit with them when they drove out to California several years earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was the year...\u201d Whatever was on Vivian\u2019s mind didn\u2019t quite make it to her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou had a grandson born that year,\u201d Sally prompted.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, the year Brian was born. Remember? Dad and I took a road trip to California that summer.\u201d</p><p>Susannah did recall a summer excursion, but she\u2019d been busy at the time, with a toddler underfoot and a new baby. Her parents so rarely traveled that whenever they did, it was memorable.</p><p>\u201cAt any rate, Lloyd and I liked this area so much when we visited that we sold everything in California and moved to Washington. We bought property about twenty miles west of here.\u201d Her mouth turned down for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we got so involved with our place and our traveling that we just sort of...lost touch with your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLloyd died five years ago and I\u2019ve been alone ever since. I moved into Altamira two years back. I was absolutely delighted to learn that your mother\u2019s living here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the world of Sally,\u201d Vivian said, grinning shyly at the other woman. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how pleased I am that we\u2019ve met up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more pleased than I am.\u201d Sally gently squeezed Vivian\u2019s hand. \u201cI hope you\u2019re coming down to the fireplace room for the ice-cream social this evening.\u201d</p><p>Vivian nodded eagerly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>This was exactly what Susannah had prayed would happen. She\u2019d wanted her mother to find a friend so she wouldn\u2019t feel isolated. Here was Sally, and already Susannah noticed a crack in her mother\u2019s defenses.</p><p>The three chatted amiably for several minutes before Sally yawned and announced it was long past her naptime.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had my nap yet, either,\u201d Vivian echoed.</p><p>Susannah walked Sally to the door and whispered her gratitude. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you sought out my mom. She needs a special friend.\u201d</p><p>Sally\u2019s tired eyes shone with humor. \u201cWe all do. Now, don\u2019t you worry about your mother. I\u2019ll keep an eye on her for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Susannah said fervently. \u201cOh, thank you.\u201d</p><p>By the time she returned, her mother was in her favorite chair, feet propped up, her head resting against the cushion. She\u2019d closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave soon, Mom, but I have a question first.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes slowly opened. \u201cWhat is it, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about this?\u201d She handed her mother the creased letter.</p><p>Her mother read it quickly and frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an agreement between Allan Presley and Dad,\u201d Susannah said.</p><p>\u201cThat singer again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom. Allan Presley is Jake Presley\u2019s father. Remember, Jake was my high school boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Her mother nodded, but didn\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>\u201cDad paid Mr. Presley five thousand dollars to move Jake out of Colville.\u201d</p><p>Vivian shook her head. \u201cYour father would never do anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Susannah cried and because she was so upset and restless, she started pacing. \u201cYou\u2019re holding the evidence. Look at that sheet of paper and you\u2019ll see Dad\u2019s signature and Mr. Presley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a lot of money in\u2014\u201d she glanced at the date \u201c\u20141973.\u201d Her mother\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cWhere would your father get that kind of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sighed. \u201cHe was very good with money. He was such an intelligent man.\u201d</p><p>Susannah was in no frame of mind to think positive thoughts about her father. \u201cIt was underhanded and cruel.... I could hate Dad for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Susannah...\u201d</p><p>The distress in her voice must have broken through to her mother. Vivian eased her legs from the ottoman and leaned toward her. She stretched out her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m very upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut everything worked out for the best. You married Joe and you have two beautiful children. You and Joe have done so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but I could\u2019ve had a good life with Jake, too. I loved him, Mom, and it kills me to find out how my own father manipulated us.\u201d She struggled to make her mother understand why this was important. Yes, she did have a husband and family\u2014a husband and family she loved\u2014but she\u2019d never know what she might have had with Jake. She\u2019d taken the path that led to Joe because the path she would have chosen, Jake\u2019s path, had been closed to her. By her father.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, do you think I was involved?\u201d Vivian asked and then answered her own question. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I might\u2019ve been, but I have to say it doesn\u2019t sound the least bit familiar. That was a lot of years ago.\u201d</p><p>Susannah felt sick to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, dear,\u201d her mother said with the utmost sincerity. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to your father about this the next time he visits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge will remember. He was always good with details. He\u2019ll remember and when he tells me, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Susannah wanted to weep.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>At nine Chrissie still wasn\u2019t back, and Susannah was growing increasingly worried. She phoned home, but Joe and Brian hadn\u2019t returned from their fishing trip yet. Not that Joe would\u2019ve been able to do anything even if he had been there. The longer she paced and fretted, the more irritated she became. This date of Chrissie\u2019s was supposed to be an afternoon outing.</p><p>Still, Chrissie was almost an adult and Susannah had no choice but to allow her to make her own decisions. Nevertheless, Susannah had a bad feeling about this.</p> <p>At nine-thirty, she phoned Carolyn. It wasn\u2019t only Chrissie on her mind. The letter she\u2019d discovered in her father\u2019s filing cabinet that afternoon continued to bother her. She needed a friend, someone who\u2019d listen and sympathize.</p><p>Carolyn answered before the second ring.</p><p>\u201cAre you busy?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>\u201cNot particularly, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to meet at He\u2019s Not Here? I need to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Susannah was grateful for a friend willing to meet her at a moment\u2019s notice. As soon as she hung up the phone, she grabbed her purse and car keys. If Chrissie returned while she was out, fine. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to let her daughter worry about her for a change.</p><p>The parking lot outside the tavern was almost empty. Susannah chose a booth and ordered a Diet Coke while she waited for Carolyn, who showed up a few minutes later. She slid into the seat across from Susannah.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asked, getting directly to the point.</p><p>Susannah pulled the letter out of her purse, and in as few words as possible, told her what it was about. Then she added, \u201cI went to Mom to see if she knew anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d</p> <p>Susannah sighed. \u201cWell, if she ever did, she\u2019s forgotten it now.\u201d More and more Susannah realized that her mother had slipped into a fantasy world and had trouble identifying what was real and what wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think your mother would tell you even if she did know?\u201d</p><p>Susannah couldn\u2019t be sure and made a dismissive gesture. \u201cShe promised to ask my father the next time he visits.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn gave her a worried look. \u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She rested her chin on her hand. \u201cI said that was a good idea and that I\u2019d be eager to hear what Dad had to tell her. What else could I say? Sometimes, it\u2019s like my own mother is a stranger to me.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn nodded and ordered a glass of merlot when the waitress swung by. \u201cI imagine there are days when Vivian\u2019s a stranger to herself.\u201d</p><p>Susannah suspected that was true. Her mother didn\u2019t understand what had changed or why. At least some of the time, she recognized that her husband of nearly sixty years was dead, but at other times\u2014because she needed him, because it comforted her\u2014she brought him back to life.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how frustrating and painful it is to learn that my father would do something like this,\u201d Susannah cried, brandishing the letter. Her voice shook with emotion; she felt betrayed and sad and wronged all at once. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he could hurt me anymore after he died, but...he did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what are you going to do about it?\u201d Carolyn asked.</p><p>\u201cDo? What can I do? That was over thirty years ago. It isn\u2019t like I can turn back the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but...\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s eyes widened as the possibilities came to her. In her excitement she half rose from her sitting position. \u201cI could find Jake,\u201d she whispered. She\u2019d been toying with the idea for weeks and hadn\u2019t acted on it because...because she was afraid. Now she saw that she had the perfect justification, a real reason to seek him out.</p><p>Carolyn didn\u2019t immediately endorse the idea. \u201cYou\u2019re married,\u201d her friend reminded her. \u201cJake probably is, too. Are you sure this is a box you want to open?\u201d</p><p>Susannah recalled the ancient Greek story about Pandora and her box of troubles\u2014as Carolyn had no doubt meant her to. \u201cI don\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so important to find Jake?\u201d Carolyn asked next. \u201cThink about it, Susannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we were both betrayed by our parents,\u201d she said. \u201cHis father sold him out and my father offered Mr. Presley the one thing he couldn\u2019t refuse. Can you imagine how much money five thousand dollars would\u2019ve been to a man like Allan Presley?\u201d It hurt to know, to have proof, that every bad thought she\u2019d ever had about her father had turned out to be true. He was cunning, devious, heartless. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the only large check he wrote, either,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Susannah slouched down in the booth. She hadn\u2019t intended to say anything, but now that she had, she felt relieved. \u201cAs I was going over Dad\u2019s bank statements, I found that he\u2019d withdrawn several large sums of money through the years. All the checks were made out to cash, so there\u2019s no way of tracing what he did with the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvestments?\u201d Carolyn suggested.</p><p>\u201cIf so, I didn\u2019t find any evidence of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about vacations?\u201d</p><p>Susannah shook her head. \u201cMy parents rarely traveled.\u201d In fact, she didn\u2019t think her mother had flown more than a couple of times in her entire life. That driving trip to California was probably the only long vacation they\u2019d ever taken.</p><p>Carolyn was very quiet. \u201cThere might be another reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Susannah had been angry and upset with her father all day. His reasons for withdrawing so much money and doing it in such secrecy were incomprehensible to her. Susannah knew that, until recently, her mother had hardly ever written a check. She had no knowledge of managing finances or how her husband spent their money. She hadn\u2019t considered it her sphere of duty; it was his, while she handled household routines and entertaining.</p><p>Carolyn hesitated, and when she spoke her voice was low. \u201cI mentioned that my father asked to talk to me before I moved back to Colville, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he wanted you to take over the business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, but there was another reason. An equally important one.\u201d She straightened, avoiding Susannah\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou might have guessed that my parents\u2019 marriage wasn\u2019t a good one.\u201d</p><p>Susannah had wondered about it. She made a noncommittal sound, encouraging Carolyn to continue.</p><p>\u201cMom never adjusted to life in Colville. She hated it here and felt trapped, but almost everyone she loved had been killed in the war. My dad couldn\u2019t leave her. He wouldn\u2019t do that, so he made the best of it until...until I left home and then, well, he fell in love with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father had an affair?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn nodded. \u201cLily was his secretary for twenty years and his lover, too.\u201d</p><p>Susannah couldn\u2019t imagine why her friend would be telling her something so painful and so private. Unless...\u201cYou think my father...had a mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it might explain where the money was going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThousands upon thousands of dollars,\u201d Susannah whispered, shocked as she considered the possibility.</p><p>\u201cDad genuinely loved Lily,\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cWhen he knew he was dying, he called me home. He wanted me to look after her when he was gone.\u201d</p><p>Susannah was appalled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019d ask that of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for me, but I did it because I loved my father. I\u2019m fairly certain Mom never knew. Or if she did find out, she never let on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Lily?\u201d</p><p>Uncharacteristic tears clouded her friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe died last year. When I got to know her, I loved her, too. She was more of a mother to me than my own. I buried her next to my father. It was what he would\u2019ve wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on his other side.\u201d</p><p>The idea of her father having another woman was inconceivable to Susannah. But then, she was quickly learning that she really didn\u2019t know him. Not once had she suspected that he\u2019d paid off Jake\u2019s father. Just thinking about it made the anger race through her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find Jake,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI refuse to let my father get away with this. I don\u2019t care if he had a mistress. I don\u2019t want to know. But I do care about finding Jake. I\u2019m going to put his name in the computer and see what comes up.\u201d There had to be Web sites that let you search for missing people.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Joe?\u201d Carolyn asked.</p><p>For a moment, she\u2019d conveniently pushed all thought of her husband and his likely reaction from her mind. It was easy to do, easy to pretend he wouldn\u2019t disapprove. He was in Seattle and she was here in Colville, and they had never seemed so far apart.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll understand,\u201d Susannah said. Then, she added, \u201cI won\u2019t tell Joe, not unless I actually find Jake.\u201d Why upset him for no reason?</p><p>\u201cDo you want my opinion?\u201d Carolyn asked.</p><p>Susannah contemplated the question. She was interested in what her friend had to say, and at the same time she feared that Carolyn would tell her to drop this before she got in too deep. That would be good advice; unfortunately it wasn\u2019t what Susannah wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me to let go of this.\u201d Susannah wished she could. But she had to talk to Jake, if for no other reason than to apologize for her family\u2019s mistreatment of him.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. What I want you to remember,\u201d Carolyn said, leaning back and sipping her wine, \u201cis that time in France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I can forget? That year everything changed for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recall how you waited and waited for a letter from Jake. For weeks on end you defended him, made excuses for why he didn\u2019t write and then after a while you didn\u2019t talk about him anymore. It seemed like you no longer cared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I still cared, but I had other things to think about!\u201d</p><p>Carolyn agreed with a nod. \u201cDoug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d lost my brother and not hearing from Jake didn\u2019t seem important after that\u2014but I did ask about him when I got home. With no success, and now we know why.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn grew quiet again, then shook her head briskly, as if to chase unhappy memories away. \u201cWe\u2019re both reacting to the discussion we had with Sandy, Yvette and Lisa the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth?\u201d Susannah raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI...I decided to extend my flower beds at the house.\u201d Her friend blushed as she said it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you requested that landscaping guy,\u201d Susannah finished.</p><p>Carolyn gazed down at her wine. \u201cHe\u2019s going to stop by tomorrow afternoon to give me an estimate. I know I\u2019m being obvious, but Susannah, I can\u2019t stop thinking about him. It all started with that silly conversation and now I\u2019m wondering where it\u2019ll end\u2014for you and for me.\u201d</p><p>Susannah wondered, too. \u201cAll I know is that Jake\u2019s been on my mind for weeks, even before I learned what my dad had done. I\u2019m determined to find him, only...only...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Susannah sighed morosely. \u201cI don\u2019t have a computer here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Carolyn said, as if it was understood that she\u2019d help. \u201cCome back to the house with me. I\u2019ll log on to a couple of search engines and see what we can come up with.\u201d</p><p>A surge of energy shot through Susannah. She hadn\u2019t slept well the night before and was emotionally drained after confronting her mother this afternoon. Her concern for Chrissie wasn\u2019t doing anything for her peace of mind, either.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to do that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much a night person, anyway.\u201d</p><p>After paying the tab, Susannah followed Carolyn down the narrow country road. The night was dark, with moon and stars obscured by clouds. The porch light cast a friendly, welcoming glow.</p><p>When they arrived, Carolyn unlocked the door and turned off the alarm. She led Susannah into the house, to one of the back bedrooms, which she\u2019d converted into a home office. As soon as she flicked on the light, she settled into the desk chair and reached for her mouse. Within minutes she was logged onto the Internet and making her way through search engines with the confidence of someone who used computers regularly.</p><p>Although Susannah had access to a computer at school and at home, she was rarely online. There was only one computer in the house, and Brian hogged it most evenings. For her, the computer was a tool, and she didn\u2019t have the leisure time to explore its research or recreational potential.</p> <p>Susannah got a second chair, pulled it close to the desk and sat down, more than happy to let Carolyn do the work.</p><p>After several minutes, Carolyn leaned back with a satisfied grin. \u201cBingo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found him?\u201d It couldn\u2019t possibly be this easy.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be sure, but didn\u2019t you say his father\u2019s name was Allan?\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a Jacob Allan Presley. That sounds promising, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery promising.\u201d Susannah couldn\u2019t remember Jake\u2019s middle name, but it made sense that he\u2019d share his father\u2019s.</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s smile was contagious. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out. Phone him and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to wait until morning,\u201d she suggested, smiling.</p><p>Susannah was too excited to sit still. After all these years, all this wondering and regretting, it had taken nothing more than a few strokes of the computer keys to locate Jake.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Late that evening, Vivian woke, and instantly her heart was weighted down by the events of that afternoon. Rarely had she seen Susannah more upset. But whatever Susannah believed, Vivian knew George would never do anything to hurt his children. There must\u2019ve been some misunderstanding.</p><p>The room was dark, but her eyes quickly adjusted to the lack of light. She sat up in bed, trying to make sense of what Susannah had told her. If only George would come to her again. Then she could ask him about all this. He\u2019d explain everything, and Vivian would be able to tell Susannah and her daughter would understand.</p> <p>Except that George hadn\u2019t come and she\u2019d waited as long as she could before falling asleep.</p><p>Her husband was the one who\u2019d assured her that moving into the assisted-living center was the right thing to do. Yet not once since she\u2019d arrived had George come to visit. Now she was lonely...and disappointed.</p><p>Laying aside the sheet, Vivian reached for her robe and slipped her arms into the long sleeves. Her balance wasn\u2019t as good as it used to be. She had a cane, but hadn\u2019t wanted Susannah to know how much she sometimes needed it, because her daughter would make a fuss. Consequently Vivian hardly ever used it in front of her family. She needed her cane now, though, and retrieved it from the umbrella stand in the corner.</p><p>She hobbled around the darkened apartment from her bed to the living room chair. She couldn\u2019t remember where the light was.... But it seemed George always came to her at night, so perhaps if she sat up and waited for him, he\u2019d know how badly she needed to talk to him.</p><p>The dark and silence lured her, and it demanded effort not to drift back to sleep. Her head sagged to one side, startling her into wakefulness. Jerking upright, she felt her heart beat frantically until she remembered she was waiting for George. She had something important to ask him\u2014only she couldn\u2019t quite remember what. She reassured herself that she\u2019d recall it in a moment.</p><p>She tried really hard to think. Her question had to do with Susannah; that much she knew. But George still didn\u2019t come.</p><p>In an instant Vivian realized why. He must have forgotten she wasn\u2019t living at the house anymore. He was probably there now, wondering where she\u2019d gone. He must be terribly worried. There was no help for it; she\u2019d have to go to him.</p><p>Leaning on the cane, she raised herself to an upright position and was breathing hard by the time she was standing. Slowly, she shuffled toward the door. It felt as if someone had strapped ten-pound bags of flour to her feet. Lifting them and walking normally seemed impossible. Each step was a struggle, but she wasn\u2019t deterred.</p><p>Opening the door, she looked both ways and didn\u2019t recognize a thing. Heaven only knew where she was now. George would be upset with her.</p><p>Moving as fast as she could, she stepped into the hallway. Long and dimly lit, it resembled a hospital corridor, but Vivian knew that couldn\u2019t be right. She wasn\u2019t wearing a hospital gown and she didn\u2019t see any medical personnel. That didn\u2019t mean much, though, not these days. All the hospitals were understaffed. No one respected the sick. Old people were left to their own devices.</p><p>With labored steps, Vivian started down the hall. No one seemed to be around.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d</p><p>Not seeing anyone, Vivian stopped and glanced around.</p><p>\u201cIn here.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward the sound of the voice and found an elderly man standing next to a pool table. He wore a housecoat and had a pair of crutches. One crutch rested along the side of the gaming table. This was some fancy hospital, if it was a hospital.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cGeorge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d She was furious that some man would try to pass himself off as her sweetheart. \u201cI know my husband, and you\u2019re not him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my wife, either, but my name is still George.\u201d</p><p>Vivian stepped a bit farther into the room. \u201cI\u2019m looking for him.\u201d</p><p>George nodded and using his crutch as a pool cue, aimed at the black ball in the center of the table. With an ease that amused her, the ball rolled toward the corner pocket and slid effortlessly inside.</p><p>\u201cGood shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of practice.\u201d</p><p>Vivian began to leave the room. \u201cVery nice meeting you, but I need to find my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d he said, waving his crutch at her.</p><p>Vivian continued down the hallway. This was a hospital, all right. She recognized the nurses\u2019 station. It was deserted at the moment, which was probably for the best. Vivian didn\u2019t want anyone to stop her.</p><p>Two doors opened to the outside. This area was well lit and, supported by her cane, she started out. To her surprise, no matter how hard she pushed at one door and then the other, they wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cThey keep the doors locked,\u201d George said from behind her. He leaned heavily on both his crutches now. \u201cNo one can come in or go out until after eight in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. That\u2019s how they do things around here.\u201d</p><p>She was being held prisoner. \u201cThis is an outrage. I\u2019m telling my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Using both crutches, George swung forward. \u201cWon\u2019t do you any good. That\u2019s just the way it is. What\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you sleep?\u201d</p><p>Vivian was tired and confused. \u201cI need to talk to George. I told my daughter I would. She\u2019s going to be so disappointed that I didn\u2019t see him.\u201d This burden was almost more than she could carry.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit down and you can tell me all about it. I\u2019m a good listener and my name is George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell your daughter that we talked it over, and then you\u2019ll both feel better.\u201d</p><p>Vivian wasn\u2019t sure that would work. Susannah had been so rattled. Doing what this George suggested would be cheating, but she\u2019d promised Susannah.... Only she couldn\u2019t quite remember what she needed to find out.</p><p>\u201cHave we met?\u201d she asked, wondering if George was someone she should know. He must be; she\u2019d met so many people through the years.</p><p>\u201cNot until tonight. I take meals in my room. You\u2019re new, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cFairly new.\u201d That seemed like a safe answer.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you want to sit down and talk for a bit?\u201d He gestured with his crutch to the room off the lobby, the one with the massive stone fireplace. It was cozy and inviting, with a number of chairs and a sofa. A piano took up one corner and a bookshelf the other.</p><p>\u201cWill it help?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt might,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Since she couldn\u2019t get out of here, Vivian decided she might as well talk to this George. That was the best she could do for now.</p><p>Shuffling her feet, moving awkwardly, she made her way into the room and sat down in the big overstuffed chair next to the fireplace.</p><p>George used his crutch to push aside the ottoman in the chair next to hers and carefully eased himself down. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Vivian shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t rightly say. My daughter insisted I come.\u201d She should\u2019ve fought harder, she mused, and wished she had. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave my home, but George told me I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalvary Cemetery.\u201d</p><p>Her newfound friend bent forward and stared at her, as if seeing her for the first time. \u201cDead, is he?\u201d</p><p>Vivian nodded. \u201cBut he visits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Vivian hadn\u2019t told many people and thought perhaps it was a mistake to trust this man with her secret.</p><p>George studied her through half-shut eyes. \u201cYour husband only comes when he feels like it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know exactly how to explain. \u201cHe comes when he can. I need to ask him about Susannah. She\u2019s our daughter and she was upset this afternoon about something her father did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her you\u2019d discuss it with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but George didn\u2019t come and I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll think even worse of him.\u201d She was embarrassed to admit to this stranger that her husband and daughter hadn\u2019t always seen eye to eye.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Vivian rested the cane between her knees and planted both hands on top. \u201cThat\u2019s just it\u2014I don\u2019t precisely remember. He did something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! George loved his children. There\u2019s only Susannah now.... Our son was killed years ago. I\u2019m afraid George was never the same afterward.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled up in Vivian\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the same with us, either...after we lost Doug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The tears ran down her face and she used one hand to wipe them away.</p> <p>\u201cNow, you listen,\u201d George said gently. \u201cYou tell that daughter of yours that you talked to George\u2014and you did.\u201d</p><p>Vivian sniffled. She was willing to listen, but only because she was growing desperate. \u201cWhat should I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her that whatever your husband did was for her own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded emphatically. \u201cSure as anything. Will you do that?\u201d</p> <p>Vivian said, \u201cYes,\u201d in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d George gave her a satisfied grin. \u201cNow, I think it\u2019s time we both went back to our rooms.\u201d</p><p>Already Vivian felt better. Susannah would, too, as soon as they had a chance to talk.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>On Monday morning, right after her first cup of coffee, Susannah reached for the kitchen phone. With her fingers trembling and her heart beating frantically, she pounded out the long-distance phone number Carolyn had gotten off the Internet.</p><p>In less than a minute she learned that this Jacob Allan Presley wasn\u2019t the boy she\u2019d once loved. The retired telephone lineman who lived in Texas simply told her that the country was filled with Presleys. He wished her luck in locating the Jake she was searching for and that was the end of that.</p> <p>She replaced the receiver, figuring she was going to need a lot more than luck.</p><p>\u201cAny reason you\u2019re looking glum?\u201d Chrissie asked twenty minutes later as she strolled into the kitchen in her shortie pajamas. Without waiting for a response, her daughter walked over to the coffeepot and automatically grabbed one of the few mugs that hadn\u2019t been packed.</p><p>Not wanting to discuss the matter, Susannah shook her head and cradled her cup with both hands as if it was a source of needed comfort. This was not the way she wanted to start her morning. It was barely after eight and she was already depressed.</p><p>\u201cTroy asked me to ride into Spokane with him this morning,\u201d Chrissie said. She opened the refrigerator and took out a small carton of cream; standing there with the door still open, she added it to her coffee. She returned the cream and closed the door, all without glancing in Susannah\u2019s direction.</p><p>Chrissie was spending the day with Troy again? Objections stumbled over the tip of Susannah\u2019s tongue, but she bit them off. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d From the way Chrissie answered, Susannah could tell that her daughter wasn\u2019t asking permission. It was a foregone conclusion that she intended to go.</p><p>\u201cWhat time did you get in last night?\u201d As soon as the words were out, Susannah realized the question would have been better left unasked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d The disdain in Chrissie\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t even slightly disguised.</p> <p>Rather than argue, Susannah pointed out the obvious. \u201cI assumed you were in Colville to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my share. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d With that, Chrissie walked out of the kitchen, clutching her mug of coffee.</p><p>Susannah might not be a contender for any Mother of the Year award, but she knew her daughter and suspected Chrissie was up to no good with Troy. Chrissie was definitely feeling guilty about something. Susannah didn\u2019t want to consider what, although several possibilities loomed large.</p><p>After taking a moment to collect her thoughts, Susannah walked down the hallway to Chrissie\u2019s room. Tapping on the door, she opened it and found Chrissie cross-legged on the bed. She was staring blankly into space and didn\u2019t acknowledge her mother.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d Susannah asked, leaning against the doorjamb.</p><p>Chrissie kept her gaze trained away from Susannah. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>Susannah shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t usually snap at me this early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t usually drill me about my friends, either. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like Troy, Mom. But I do. In fact, I like him a lot. He\u2019s not like any other boy I\u2019ve dated. He\u2019s a man, and I\u2019m tired of dating boys.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie had that right; Troy was certainly no Jason O\u2019Donnell. It was clear to Susannah that Troy\u2019s attention was giving her daughter a way to cope with the pain and rejection she felt because of Jason. This wasn\u2019t a good situation and she needed to tread lightly, but before she could even suggest that Jason might be a factor, Chrissie said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to give me a hard time about driving into Spokane, are you?\u201d</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t have any choice other than to let her daughter go. She didn\u2019t like it, but she didn\u2019t have the energy to fight Chrissie. Joe seemed to think their daughter was old enough to make her own decisions. Although she usually agreed with him, in this instance she didn\u2019t. Still...</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is what you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d came her instant reply, \u201cand before you say anything about Jason and me, you should know this has nothing to do with him. Jason was a boy. Troy is a man.\u201d</p><p>Susannah opened her mouth, but the disdainful look was back in her daughter\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to guilt me into staying,\u201d Chrissie muttered. \u201cThis is the first fun I\u2019ve had all summer.\u201d</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t understand why everything had to be about fun. Chrissie would experience a rude awakening when she discovered that there was more to life\u2014that fun was meant to be a diversion, not the main activity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really that much help packing up Grandma\u2019s stuff, anyway,\u201d Chrissie added, as if that excused her behavior.</p><p>Without another word, Susannah walked out of the bedroom, gathered up clean clothes and quickly showered. Afterward, feeling refreshed, she dressed and blow-dried her hair and decided to talk to Chrissie again, but it was too late. Her daughter had already left the house.</p><p>So much for that.</p><p>At nine-thirty Carolyn phoned. \u201cWas it him?\u201d she asked after the briefest of greetings. Her enthusiasm for this project was just the solace Susannah needed, especially after her initial caution about looking for Jake.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cSomeone altogether different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a little time this morning. If you stop by the mill, I\u2019ll do some checking on the computer here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I get a chance to meet the lawn-maintenance guy you mentioned? You did say he\u2019d be mowing the grass outside your office, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she said mischievously.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Carolyn\u2019s response was adamant. \u201cAnd no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to be too snoopy.\u201d A renewed sense of hopeful anticipation filled her. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in about an hour.\u201d Susannah felt like dancing as she hung up the phone.</p><p>She hurriedly ate a piece of toast, then drove to Altamira to see her mother. Vivian was tired and listless, insisting she\u2019d spoken to George, who\u2019d apparently visited in the middle of the night. The conversation delayed her an extra ten minutes while her mother repeated word for word the entire exchange with her dead husband. When Susannah finally left the complex, Vivian seemed grateful to return to her morning nap.</p><p>On her way out the door, Susannah made an appointment with the nurse. She felt it was time to discuss the state of Vivian\u2019s mental health.</p><p>From the assisted-living complex, Susannah drove directly to the mill. She parked in front of the office in the vacant visitor\u2019s slot next to Carolyn\u2019s truck. As she parked, a battered pickup pulled out. It had to be the lawn guy. She tried to get a look at him, but failed.</p><p>Carolyn was waiting for her in the outer office.</p><p>\u201cWho was the guy I just saw leaving?\u201d she asked casually. \u201cIn the beat-up blue truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Dave,\u201d her friend said, glancing around self-consciously.</p><p>\u201cAny reason he stopped by?\u201d She wanted to hear every single detail. \u201cYou told me he wasn\u2019t working here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to get an update on Grady, the man who had a heart attack last week.\u201d She paused, taking a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to meet Dave later this afternoon to go over some ideas for my new flower beds.\u201d Carolyn said this stiffly, as if she regretted ever commenting on her plans. Then she got up from her desk and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cYou really are keen on him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>Carolyn hesitated. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, but I know you.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled sharply. \u201cCall me a coward, but I\u2019ve decided against the new flower beds. I...don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go through with it.\u201d</p><p>Susannah had hoped that Carolyn\u2019s attraction to Dave would overcome her shyness and her fears.</p><p>Carolyn sat down at the computer. Purposely changing the subject, she said, \u201cLike I told you, I had a few extra minutes this morning and logged onto the Internet. I found six other Jake Presleys.\u201d With her eyes on the computer monitor, she reached for her mouse and hit the print icon. The hum of the printer started immediately.</p><p>\u201cSix!\u201d Susannah felt exhilarated, despite her nagging concerns about Chrissie.</p><p>Leaning back in her chair, Carolyn gazed up at Susannah. Her eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cSo how\u2019s everything with you this morning?\u201d</p><p>Susannah merely shrugged.</p><p>Carolyn gestured for Susannah to sit down, which she did.</p><p>\u201cWhen we were in France,\u201d she said, \u201cI could always tell when you were unhappy. You get this look I can read a mile away.\u201d</p><p>Susannah couldn\u2019t see any reason to hide what was happening. \u201cChrissie and I had an argument this morning,\u201d she confessed. \u201cShe\u2019s spending the day with Troy. He\u2019s driving into Spokane and she\u2019s tagging along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re together again?\u201d Carolyn straightened, frowning slightly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all. I went to see Mom before I came here.\u201d She mentally reviewed the disturbing conversation. \u201cMom insisted she talked to my dad again last night. Apparently he had an important message for me. She claims my father loved me deeply. Mom said Dad would never do anything to hurt me. He wanted her to tell me it was because he loved me that he got rid of Jake.\u201d Susannah found it impossible to keep the sarcasm out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cAsk your mother to have him check up on my parents,\u201d Carolyn teased.</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou notice I\u2019m not laughing all that hard. In a few years that could be us, you know.\u201d</p><p>Susannah sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, reminding her that the mill was a busy place.</p><p>Carolyn grabbed the sheets from the printer tray and handed them to Susannah. \u201cGood luck,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d She walked out the door with a little wave. The fact was, Susannah already had an alternative plan, although she was keeping it to herself for now.</p><p>One thing was certain\u2014she intended to find Jake no matter what it took.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>None of the six Jake Presleys on Carolyn\u2019s list turned out to be the Jake Presley from Colville. Susannah and Carolyn spent Monday and Tuesday evening trying various Internet search engines, but to no avail. When she wasn\u2019t on Carolyn\u2019s computer or the phone, searching for Jake, she was making detailed notes about her father\u2019s cash withdrawals from the bank statements she\u2019d found. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least every other year, and sometimes more often, he\u2019d made these withdrawals, some large and some not. She also discovered that her father had taken frequent trips out of town. Not once had her mother mentioned these trips. They generally weren\u2019t more than a day or two. Business trips, noted in an odd sort of journal her father kept. All he\u2019d written down was the name of a city and a cash amount. In checking the bank statements against the journal entries, she saw that the money withdrawn was the same amount as listed in this pocket-size journal. The largest ones she made special note of.</p><p>August 23, 1973\u2014Dallas, Texas\u2014$13,000</p><p>March 2, 1978\u2014San Francisco, California\u2014$15,000</p><p>October 22, 1980\u2014Boise, Idaho\u2014$10,000</p> <p>April 19, 1993\u2014Portland, Oregon\u2014$12,000</p><p>If these were investments, as both Joe and Carolyn had suggested, she couldn\u2019t understand why the withdrawals were made in cash. Two possibilities occurred to her, and they seemed to take clearer shape with every day. Besides Carolyn, the only person she dared discuss them with was her husband. Her biggest fear was that, like Carolyn\u2019s father, he\u2019d had a mistress and was traveling with her. That night at the bar, she\u2019d told Carolyn it didn\u2019t matter to her if he\u2019d had a lover or not. But it did matter. For her mother\u2019s sake, she told herself.</p><p>Wednesday morning, Susannah woke to learn that Chrissie had already left the house. A quickly scrawled note was propped up against the coffeepot announcing that\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014she was with Troy. In less than a week, her daughter and that shiftless bum had become practically inseparable.</p><p>Susannah had a lot on her mind and wanted to talk to Joe about it. She reached him at home, having breakfast. After a brief greeting she launched into her concerns.</p><p>\u201cThe more I study my father\u2019s bank accounts, the more convinced I am that he was either being blackmailed or that he had a mistress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSusannah, you don\u2019t honestly believe your father would put up with a blackmailer, do you?\u201d</p><p>It seemed incomprehensible to her. As far as she knew, her father hadn\u2019t backed away from anything in his life. He didn\u2019t tolerate weakness in anyone, especially himself. He was a hard man, difficult to live with, difficult to know.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really picture him being blackmailed,\u201d she agreed. \u201cThen maybe he had a mistress.\u201d That idea seemed the more likely of the two.</p><p>\u201cWhat about gambling?\u201d Joe suggested.</p><p>\u201cIn Boise, Idaho?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d thought of that, too. If her father had made cash withdrawals and flown to Vegas, it would add up, but he hadn\u2019t. Instead, he\u2019d listed areas not known for that particular form of entertainment.</p> <p>\u201cIt had to be another woman,\u201d she insisted now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it,\u201d Joe said. \u201cYour father wasn\u2019t the kind of man who\u2019d cheat on his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never have thought Carolyn\u2019s father was the type, either.\u201d While the two men weren\u2019t good friends, they were associates through the service clubs in town. And they were well enough acquainted for George to get the information he needed to send Susannah to the same French boarding school as Carolyn.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re far too willing to find fault with him,\u201d Joe stated.</p><p>\u201cI am not. I have the evidence right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash withdrawals and cryptic notes about cities. That isn\u2019t evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was hiding something,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cI agree with you there. But you might never learn what it was. Why is it so important? Don\u2019t you have enough to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. In fact, I have far too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting much help from Chrissie, are you?\u201d</p><p>She rested one shoulder against the kitchen wall. Her father had been too cheap to buy a portable phone but he could waste ten thousand dollars on God knows what. \u201cShe\u2019s spending the day with Troy again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend her home,\u201d Joe said. \u201cIf she isn\u2019t helping you, which is the reason she claimed she was going to Colville, then send her back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably should,\u201d Susannah said.</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThe thing is, Chrissie\u2019s good with Mom.\u201d No matter how much time she spent with Troy, her daughter made a point of visiting her grandmother every day. Vivian thrived on Chrissie\u2019s visits, and proudly introduced her to the other residents. Chrissie\u2019s presence at Altamira relaxed Vivian and gave her something to look forward to. Her mother was beginning to adjust and even to socialize, and Chrissie was, in part, responsible for that.</p><p>\u201cSusannah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured into the phone. \u201cI was just thinking about Chrissie. I don\u2019t like Troy or the fact that she\u2019s spending so much time with him. But I think she\u2019ll come to see for herself what he is.\u201d Chrissie was immature, but Susannah still had hope that her daughter would recognize the truth about this new boyfriend of hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cNo recurrence of someone mysteriously breaking into the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Against her better judgment, she\u2019d mentioned the incidents to Joe a few days earlier.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d tell me if there were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere seems to be a lot going on in Colville. Maybe I should cancel Friday\u2019s appointments and visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cI really am fine. Chrissie is, too.\u201d They spoke for a few more minutes and then hung up with Joe promising to call that night.</p><p>Still feeling troubled, Susannah walked outside and into the garden her mother had loved. Even with the burden of packing, she tried to spend a little while tending it every day. Being in this lovely, quiet space usually calmed her, in the same way it had her mother. She wandered between the rows of blooming allium, which resembled giant purple dandelions with the heads growing four to five inches in diameter. The gladioli were in bloom, too, and the lilies, their scent perfuming the air. She sat on the stone bench near the small rose arbor and closed her eyes, raising her face to the sun.</p><p>When she got up to go inside, she noticed Rachel Henderson in her backyard with her cat in her arms. The tabby, named Mr. Bojangles, had free rein of Rachel\u2019s yard and those adjacent to it. Even though Vivian had frequently complained about her neighbor, she\u2019d never said a word against Mr. Bojangles. Mrs. Henderson waved from the other side of the fence and, smiling, Susannah waved back, but didn\u2019t stop for conversation. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to chat.</p><p>The sun was glorious and the sky a pure, bright shade of blue. She hadn\u2019t seen her mother since yesterday and before she resumed packing, Susannah decided to visit. Maybe they could take a stroll around Altamira\u2019s beautifully tended gardens.</p><p>Perhaps it was her frame of mind, but instead of driving straight to the assisted-living complex Susannah went to the cemetery. On her last visit, she\u2019d been so angry with her father\u2014and at the time, she hadn\u2019t known half of what she knew now. For reasons she couldn\u2019t explain, she walked over to her brother\u2019s grave.</p><p>The first thing she saw as she crossed the lawn was the display of flowers that marked the site\u2014a display that was similar to the one she\u2019d seen earlier, with roses again and peonies instead of lilacs. The roses had bloomed now. She couldn\u2019t imagine who\u2019d brought flowers to Doug\u2019s grave.</p><p>She missed her brother terribly\u2014more in these last seven months than in all the years he\u2019d been dead. Glancing at the flowers, she realized she wasn\u2019t the only one who missed him. She wondered if the person who\u2019d come to visit had also broken into the house and taken his track ribbons. A long-lost love, perhaps. He\u2019d been dating a local girl when he was killed. She tried to remember the girl\u2019s name. Pauline? Peggy?</p><p>Patricia! Her name was Patricia Carney. Susannah couldn\u2019t help wondering if Patricia still carried a torch for him after all this time. That was a distinct possibility, Susannah mused, bending down to run her fingers over his grave marker.</p><p>An hour later, after visiting her mother, who\u2019d been tired and unresponsive and uninterested in a walk, Susannah was back at the house. She continued packing, concentrating on the kitchen and dining room. When she\u2019d taken two carloads to the storage unit, she stopped for lunch, although she wasn\u2019t really hungry. She hadn\u2019t had much of an appetite for days.</p><p>And she knew it was because of Jake.</p><p>As she sat at the kitchen table, nibbling at a cheese sandwich, she returned to the half-formed idea she\u2019d had yesterday, when she\u2019d visited Carolyn at the mill. Hire a detective. With her limited resources and experience, plus her lack of computer skills, she needed professional help if Jake Presley was ever to be found.</p><p>Fortunately, she hadn\u2019t packed up or thrown out the Spokane telephone directory. She dug it out of the drawer and flipped through the Yellow Pages until she came to the listing for Private Investigators.</p><p>A quarter-page advertisement with a giant magnifying glass caught her attention. The name on the advertisement was Dirk Knight.</p><p>She had to bolster her courage to make the call. All the while she was punching out the number, Susannah prayed she was doing the right thing.</p><p>\u201cDirk Knight.\u201d The detective himself answered on the first ring. Susannah was afraid this might not be a promising sign. Either he was sitting at his desk with nothing to do, which wasn\u2019t a high recommendation. Or he couldn\u2019t afford office staff. Or both. His quick response flustered Susannah.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d the gruff voice continued.</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, she forged ahead. \u201cHello, my name is Susannah Nelson and I\u2019m calling to inquire about the possibility of locating someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA missing person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly missing. This is an old friend I knew over thirty years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA high school boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA relative?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014no, it isn\u2019t anything like that. This is someone from my hometown that I knew as a teenager.\u201d Susannah added a few of the pertinent details.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need a thousand-dollar retainer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand dollars?\u201d Susannah swallowed a gasp. That was out of the question. \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d She replaced the receiver and went down the list alphabetically, calling each P.I. listed.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Susannah had an appointment with a woman named Shirl Remington for three o\u2019clock that same afternoon. This woman, too, required a retainer\u2014in fact, every one of them did. From the detective novels Susannah had read, she should\u2019ve expected that.</p><p>Even with the appointment scheduled, she had some doubts, but she refused to let this go. Making an inquiry didn\u2019t cost a dime, so she could at least look into the possibility, see what she\u2019d get for her money.</p><p>At ten to three, Susannah located the Spokane address and discovered the agency was in a residential neighborhood. She parked at the curb, rechecked the address, then strode up to the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A woman answered. She was tall, willowy and very young. Susannah suspected she wasn\u2019t a day over thirty. \u201cYou must be Susannah,\u201d she said, stepping aside to invite her in.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Susannah nodded for emphasis, nervous and unable to hide it.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d The woman gestured toward the French doors leading to an office off the living room.</p><p>Susannah sat on the edge of a chair and fidgeted with the zipper on her purse as she waited for the other woman to walk behind the desk, sit down and reach for a pad and pen.</p> <p>\u201cHow exactly can I help you?\u201d Shirl asked.</p><p>Heaving a giant sigh to ease her nervousness, Susannah explained the situation as straightforwardly and honestly as she could. As she spoke, the private detective took notes. Her long brown hair repeatedly fell forward and she repeatedly pushed it back, looping it around her ear. Susannah tried not to be irritated by that. Why didn\u2019t the woman just wear it in a ponytail?</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know Jake\u2019s social security number, would you?\u201d Shirl asked hopefully, flinging back her hair as she looked up.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Unzipping her purse, Susannah withdrew two sheets of paper. She unfolded them and slid them across the desk. \u201cThese are all the Jake Presleys my friend and I found on the Internet. I\u2019ve talked to each one personally and can verify they aren\u2019t the Jake I knew.\u201d</p><p>Shirl nodded. \u201cGood. No need to go over ground that\u2019s already been covered.\u201d</p> <p>Susannah began to relax. Despite Shirl\u2019s distracting gestures with her hair, she liked the no-nonsense manner in which the woman conducted business. After a few more questions, Shirl laid down her pen.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you can tell me that might help me locate your friend?\u201d</p><p>Susannah couldn\u2019t think of a single thing. Then she remembered something she hadn\u2019t thought about in years. \u201cYes,\u201d she cried. \u201cJake had a benign tumor as a kid. He had to have it surgically removed and has a thin scar on his left side about two inches below his waist. In front,\u201d she added.</p><p>Her face turned twenty shades of red as she realized the other woman would guess how and when Susannah had viewed Jake\u2019s scar.</p><p>Thankfully the private detective didn\u2019t comment but merely noted this latest bit of information. Then she looked up again. \u201cAs I said over the phone, I\u2019ll need a thousand-dollar retainer.\u201d</p><p>Susannah swallowed and opened her purse. No one would consider the job for anything less than a thousand up front. If she was going to get the answers she needed, she had no choice but to spend the money.</p> <p>\u201cYou take credit cards, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked in a suddenly hoarse voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Shirl said, smiling across the desk at her.</p><p>With shaking fingers, Susannah withdrew her credit card and handed it to the private investigator.</p><p>Now all she had to do was find a way to tell her husband.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Carolyn stayed late at the mill. Production had closed down for the day and the crew had left the yard. The work site was uncharacteristically quiet. During the day, the office, too, was filled with constant activity; everything changed the minute the whistle blew, signalling the end of the working day.</p><p>By late afternoon, she was alone with her thoughts. Alone, period, and that was how it would stay.</p><p>Coward that she was, Carolyn had contacted Kettle Falls Landscaping and left a message canceling the additional work she\u2019d ordered for her front yard. She\u2019d be foolish to pursue a relationship with Dave Langevin. This attraction she felt unnerved her. She wasn\u2019t good at relationships; her failed marriage proved it. Her father hadn\u2019t done well in choosing his life partner and she hadn\u2019t, either. But unlike him, she wasn\u2019t willing to have an affair. Besides, how would it look for the owner of the mill to be seen with a yard man? That was a snobbish reaction, she knew, but it was what many townspeople would say and she couldn\u2019t ignore that. She had a duty to her family name. A duty to the community. Getting involved with Dave would only lead to unnecessary complications. Complications she could live without.</p> <p>Carolyn had accepted this responsibility long ago. Rather than dwell on how structured her life was, she tackled the paperwork piled on her desk. Because she was constantly interrupted during the day, she generally stayed late two or three nights a week to deal with memos, requests and other paperwork that demanded concentrated effort. Some of this she could have handed off to her personal assistant, but she didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t. Here, in these quiet moments, she gained needed perspective on the business. She tracked orders, kept an eye on inventory, became aware of any staff problems and more.</p><p>The still of the late afternoon slipped away. She worked steadily until eight. Then, sitting back in her chair, she turned off her computer and collected her purse, ready to call it a day.</p><p>After locking the office, Carolyn waved a friendly goodbye to Nolan, the security guard, and headed toward her vehicle, enjoying the warm evening air. Summer was her favorite season. Here it was, the end of June and it was still light. Maybe that was why she resisted the idea of going home. She decided to visit Susannah, instead, and was driving in that direction when she passed He\u2019s Not Here.</p><p>The local tavern was a regular hangout for many of the mill workers. A few cars were scattered across the parking lot now, but by this time most of the work crew had gone home to their families.</p><p>Then she saw it. The battered truck that belonged to Dave Langevin. Her heart started to beat erratically. By now he would\u2019ve gotten word that she\u2019d cancelled the extra work. He\u2019d know what that meant. She couldn\u2019t help wondering if he was disappointed.</p><p>Almost without volition, Carolyn found herself turning into the lot. She sat in her truck for at least five minutes trying to figure out what to do. Her hands were clammy, her stomach was jumping with nerves, and her heart raced. It felt as if a simple decision\u2014whether or not to go inside\u2014was one of the biggest of her life. Swallowing hard, she climbed out of her truck and walked toward the tavern.</p><p>The darkened windows barred the sunlight, and it took Carolyn\u2019s eyes a moment to adjust. She stood inside the entry and glanced around, looking for Dave.</p><p>The place was less than half-full and she saw him right away. He sat at a corner table, his back to the wall, nursing a beer. He glanced up and for the most fleeting of seconds, their eyes met.</p><p>Slowly, Carolyn stepped farther inside. The jukebox played a Reba McEntire ballad, and the scent of beer hung in the air. A few men sat at the bar and on the opposite side three or four others were involved in a noisy darts game. One couple, well past sobriety, clung to each other on the tiny dance floor.</p><p>Carolyn slipped into a booth that looked directly toward the table where Dave sat. The aching way he made her feel seemed to intensify. It was as if everything female within her sprang to life whenever she was near him. She\u2019d assumed those feelings had disappeared years ago, after her divorce. But Dave Langevin\u2019s mere presence had revived them.</p><p>Although they\u2019d occasionally talked, she knew next to nothing about him. He\u2019d revealed little of his past, little about himself. He was always courteous and polite. He\u2019d never even touched her and yet she felt his touch every time he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you, sweetie?\u201d the barmaid asked, strolling up to the booth with a tray in one hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a beer,\u201d Carolyn said, needing fortification. \u201cWhatever you have on draft.\u201d A cold beer would taste good after a long, hot day. On an empty stomach the alcohol would likely affect her more quickly, in which case she could order something to eat before she went home.</p><p>The woman returned with a frosty mug. The foam spilled over the sides of the thick glass as she thumped it down on the lacquered wood table. Carolyn took a long swallow. It went down just as smoothly as she\u2019d hoped.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished half her beer, she began to feel relaxed. With open curiosity she studied Dave, who didn\u2019t seem embarrassed by her interest. He met her gaze and slowly smiled. Her heart smiled back and her lips followed before she grew flustered and looked away.</p><p>After a few minutes, Dave stood up and seemed to be walking straight toward her. When he walked past her booth and over to the jukebox, she started to breathe normally again. The first tune, the same Reba ballad that had been playing when she arrived, echoed through the room. Then he went back to his table, pausing in front of her booth for just an instant. Just long enough to let her know he\u2019d wanted to ask her to dance, but changed his mind. The very way she\u2019d changed hers...</p><p>By the third number, a slow love song, Carolyn was ready to leave. She\u2019d made a mistake in coming here. All she\u2019d done was embarrass herself.</p><p>At that moment, Dave rose from his chair, his eyes holding hers. With her pulse nearly going crazy, she watched as he came toward her.</p><p>Had her life depended on it, she couldn\u2019t have looked away. Everything and everyone else in the tavern became a blur.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d he asked in a low voice, offering his hand.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anyone else on the dance floor; the drunken lovers had apparently gone home. She nodded and stepped out of the booth. When she placed her hand in his, Dave smiled down at her. The warm sensation of his touch rocked her, but she tried not to let it show.</p><p>Without another word, he led her to the other side of the room. When his arms circled her waist and he brought her close, Carolyn slid her hands up his chest and left them there.</p><p>The music played, but they barely moved as they continued to gaze at each other. Carolyn felt the strong, steady beat of his heart.</p><p>The electricity between them was volatile, threatening to burst into flames with the slightest provocation. Carolyn felt it with every breath she drew. The desire to slip her arms around his neck and urge his mouth to hers nearly overwhelmed her. She wanted him so badly that she closed her eyes, certain he\u2019d see what she was feeling\u2014certain she\u2019d act on it if he did.</p><p>The music stopped and a full minute passed before Dave let her go. When his arms fell away, she released the pent-up tension in a long, deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>All she could do was nod.</p><p>Together they returned to the booth. He waited until she was seated, then went over to the bar, paid his tab and walked out the door.</p><p>Carolyn retrieved her purse and slapped twenty dollars on the table. Unwilling to wait for her change, she hurried after him.</p><p>At first she didn\u2019t see Dave. The sun had set and the last light was disappearing at the edge of the sky. Then she found him, standing next to his pickup, the door already open.</p><p>\u201cDave,\u201d she called out, moving toward him. She didn\u2019t know what she intended to say, but she knew she couldn\u2019t just let him leave.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but waited for her to join him.</p><p>Carolyn approached him, more confused and uncertain with every step. As she came closer, she stared up at him, lost in her feelings.</p><p>All she really had to do was look in his eyes and see the tenderness there, the longing. No man had ever looked at her like that. Not even her husband.</p><p>Without a word, Dave lifted his hand and held it to the side of her face. His skin was callused and rough against hers. Carolyn closed her eyes and leaned into his palm, moving gently against it. Had she been a kitten, she would have purred with the sheer pleasure of his touch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou did the right thing,\u201d he murmured. It seemed to take great effort for him to speak.</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d she asked, not fully understanding what he meant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a drifter...I never stay in any town for long. You wanted me to work on your garden, but it was more than that and we both knew it.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and lowered her gaze.</p> <p>\u201cYou also know it isn\u2019t a good idea for us to get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel that way anymore,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He gave a deep, shuddery sigh. \u201cI thought it was for the best\u2014us not seeing each other, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d she asked boldly. \u201cIs that what you want\u2014to walk away from this...feeling?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her for a long time. \u201cYou tempt me, Carolyn, more than you know, but I can\u2019t...It wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI get restless. I always do. After a while, I move on. It\u2019s just the way I am.\u201d His eyes pleaded for understanding. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you and I know I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a decision I should make?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He glanced away and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll break your heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least I\u2019ll know I have one.\u201d Carolyn hadn\u2019t realized it was in her to be so honest or so daring.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll risk it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, Carolyn decided she might as well own up to the truth. \u201cThe only reason I came to the bar tonight was because I saw you were here.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as if that was what he\u2019d suspected. \u201cThe only reason I came was because I thought you might stop by.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn smiled; she couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be seen with me. I\u2019m a yard man, and you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who I am.\u201d She loved the way he cared about her, wanted to protect her. But appearances no longer mattered and the opinions of others had become irrelevant.</p> <p>His thumb grazed her lips, and his smile was sad and brief.</p><p>That was when she knew that whatever was happening between them should be explored. Susannah was right\u2014it was time Carolyn took a chance. An attraction this strong was a gift to be treasured, a joy to be savored.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the dance,\u201d he said. He kissed her ever so gently, his mouth barely touching hers.</p><p>He started to climb into his truck, but Carolyn stopped him. \u201cCome to my house Friday night after work.\u201d</p><p>He seemed about to refuse, but then he smiled. Nodded.</p><p>Carolyn stepped back, watching as he drove off. What had she done?</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>After learning Patricia Carney\u2019s married name from Sandy, Susannah picked up the telephone directory, which still lay on the kitchen table, and looked up Doug\u2019s old girlfriend. She lived in Kettle Falls with her husband and family. Patricia Carney, now Anderson, remembered Susannah and invited her over. Welcoming the distraction and hoping for some clues, Susannah agreed to meet her.</p><p>Patricia didn\u2019t resemble the girl Susannah recalled. She\u2019d gained quite a lot of weight, and her lovely chestnut hair had turned a salt-and-pepper gray. With many exclamations of pleasure, Patricia led Susannah to the back patio of her cozy rambler.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how surprised I was to hear from you,\u201d Patricia said as she pulled out a chair for Susannah. The pinewood table was covered with a red checkered cloth. Two glasses and a tall pitcher of lemonade sat on a tray, waiting to be poured. There was also a plate of still-warm oatmeal cookies. The patio was surrounded by lush greenery, including dogwood and lilac bushes, and an array of blooming lilies, peonies and roses. A large vegetable garden took up a good part of the backyard.</p><p>What Susannah had learned from their brief telephone conversation was that Patricia was a retired nurse and her husband still worked as a U.S. Forest Ranger.</p><p>\u201cYou have quite a green thumb,\u201d Susannah commented, glancing around. The profusion of fresh flowers made her heart quicken. Whoever was visiting Doug\u2019s grave had access to flowers, too.</p><p>Susannah was chagrined that she hadn\u2019t immediately thought of Patricia. She and Doug had been a couple from the time Patricia was a sophomore. Two years older, Doug had graduated and was working in town as a carpenter for a local builder. The war in Vietnam was in full swing then, and if Doug hadn\u2019t died in the car accident, it was likely he would\u2019ve been drafted. Susannah remembered conversations between Doug and their father about the war. Her brother, who hadn\u2019t been academically inclined, had refused to apply for college, much to their father\u2019s disappointment. He\u2019d wanted to enlist but Dad had been against it, insisting that Doug wait until he was drafted. The irony was that if Doug had gone into the service, he might be alive today.</p><p>\u201cActually, Tom\u2019s the one with the green thumb in the family,\u201d Patricia explained, breaking into Susannah\u2019s thoughts. She sat next to her and poured them each a glass of lemonade. Handing Susannah hers, she said, \u201cI heard about your father. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Susannah lowered her eyes and nodded. \u201cIt was very sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your mother doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout as well as can be expected. I just moved her into assisted living\u2014she\u2019s having a bit of a problem adjusting. But I\u2019m sure that eventually she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d Patricia leaned forward, pointing to the plate of cookies; Susannah smiled but shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI take it this visit is more than for old times\u2019 sake?\u201d Patricia asked.</p><p>Susannah appreciated not having to make small talk before she ventured onto the subject of her brother. \u201cAs I recall, you and Doug were dating at the time of my brother\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>A sad, faraway look came over Patricia\u2019s face. \u201cYour brother was my first love,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt broke my heart when he was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was out at Doug\u2019s grave recently.\u201d Susannah set her lemonade down on the pinewood table and studied Patricia. \u201cThere were fresh flowers on his grave.\u201d She eyed the flower garden, paying particular attention to the roses and peonies. \u201cWould you know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Patricia told her. \u201cThe only time I go to Calvary Cemetery is on Memorial Day. Tom and I put flowers on our parents\u2019 graves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t the one who put flowers on my brother\u2019s grave?\u201d</p><p>Patricia shook her head. \u201cOther than the day of his funeral, I\u2019ve never visited Doug\u2019s grave.\u201d</p><p>This was discouraging news. Susannah had assumed it must be Patricia, who had once loved her brother. If so, it might explain who\u2019d broken into the house, as well. \u201cI thought for sure it was you.\u201d</p><p>Patricia shrugged. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t help you. Make no mistake, I loved Doug, but that was many years ago.\u201d She stared into the distance, as if caught up in her memories. \u201cLife goes on. I married Tom after I graduated from nursing school. Doug was dead, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The tragedy had touched so many lives. In her heart Susannah believed Doug and Patricia would\u2019ve been happy together. \u201cI\u2019m grateful you weren\u2019t with him that night,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cActually, I might\u2019ve been, but he called and broke our date at the last minute. I was plenty peeved with him at the time because I\u2019d come home especially to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at nursing school in Spokane by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Susannah nodded.</p><p>\u201cDoug and I were supposed to get together\u2014it\u2019d been planned for weeks\u2014and then at the last possible second, he called and cancelled. Later, when I learned he\u2019d been killed, I was devastated. Devastated,\u201d she said again. \u201cAnd I felt so bad for arguing with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d As long as she lived, Susannah would never forget the phone call telling her that her brother was dead. Her father had tried to calm her. That day had been the most horrible of her life; being so far from home had made it even worse. Her parents had never understood how desperately she\u2019d wanted to come home. Her father hadn\u2019t allowed it. In a few months, she\u2019d be finished with her studies, he\u2019d said, and it was too impractical and expensive for her to fly home twice in that short period. No matter how many years passed, Susannah could never forgive her father for being so heartless.</p><p>\u201cMy mother kept saying I could\u2019ve been killed that night, too,\u201d Patricia continued, \u201cand she was right. If Doug hadn\u2019t called, I would\u2019ve been with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife takes some odd twists and turns, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Susannah murmured, sipping her lemonade.</p><p>Patricia nodded, then grew still for a moment. \u201cAfterward, I thought I\u2019d die, too. I\u2019d never suffered that kind of loss and I wasn\u2019t sure I could go on. I\u2019d always assumed Doug and I would get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always thought you would, too.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, and Susannah had the distinct impression that there was something the other woman wasn\u2019t telling her. She waited, hoping Patricia would reveal whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cI was planning to talk to Doug that weekend,\u201d Patricia finally said.</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d she asked softly, encouraging the other woman. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when I first left for nursing school, Doug called me every night and drove up to see me at least twice a week. After a while, he started phoning every other night, and then just once the week before he died. I asked my friends who were still in Colville, and they assured me he wasn\u2019t cheating on me. According to them, he wasn\u2019t seeing anyone else. I didn\u2019t understand what was happening between us. Something was. I could feel it. Unfortunately, I never found out what. And I still wonder....\u201d</p><p>Susannah wondered, too.</p><p>\u201cAll I know is that after I went to Spokane, nothing was quite the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there was someone else,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI was young and foolish, and I realize I\u2019d romanticized the relationship, but that\u2019s the truth. If he was seeing another woman, then my guess is she\u2019s the person who\u2019s leaving flowers on your brother\u2019s grave.\u201d She sipped her lemonade and added, \u201cBecause it isn\u2019t me, Susannah. It simply isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so her brother might\u2019ve been involved with someone else, although to Susannah it didn\u2019t seem likely that Doug would deceive Patricia that way. Granted, she\u2019d idolized her older brother, she\u2019d always turned to him for advice and had considered their relationship special. She\u2019d counted on him. In fact, before she left for France, he\u2019d promised to do what he could to help her work out the situation with Jake.</p><p>\u201cI have another question for you,\u201d she began, \u201cand I hope you don\u2019t mind my asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid my brother ever say anything about my father?\u201d</p><p>Patricia blinked as though the question took her by surprise. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, then exhaled slowly. \u201cDid he ever say anything that might lead you to believe my dad wasn\u2019t the upstanding citizen everyone thought he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Patricia sounded shocked. \u201cYour father was a judge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t perfect. He had flaws like everyone else.\u201d Because she felt she needed to explain further, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going through my father\u2019s things, and I\u2019m learning a lot about my family\u2014stuff I never knew. If you remember anything, it might help me connect all the pieces.\u201d Of one thing she was certain; her brother would never have condoned paying off Jake\u2019s family. He would\u2019ve been as outraged as she was.</p><p>Patricia\u2019s face went blank and she slowly shook her head. \u201cYour brother never said a word to me about your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the disappointment from her voice. She\u2019d hoped Patricia would have some answers to give her.</p><p>She finished her lemonade and set the glass down. \u201cI\u2019d better go and do some packing,\u201d she said, getting to her feet. \u201cThank you so much for seeing me.\u201d</p><p>Patricia stood, too. \u201cI was happy to do it.\u201d</p> <p>She walked Susannah to her car. \u201cListen,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you do find out who left those flowers at Doug\u2019s grave, would you mind letting me know? I\u2019d be curious to learn who it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Susannah promised and shut the door.</p><p>On the drive back to the house, she decided to stop at Safeway, since she needed a few groceries and didn\u2019t want to make a special trip later.</p><p>Walking into the store she felt someone staring at her and turned to find Sharon Nance, Troy\u2019s mother and her former classmate, a few feet behind her. The woman looked at least sixty. There was a hardness about her, evident in the wrinkled overtanned skin and heavily made-up eyes. She wore a short jean skirt that rode halfway up her thighs and a thin, purple sweater with lots of gold chains around her neck. She was smoking a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cHello, Sharon,\u201d Susannah said cordially.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Susannah Leary.\u201d Sharon tossed her cigarette on the asphalt and crushed it with the toe of her flip-flops.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nelson now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d she said in a bored tone.</p><p>\u201cYour son and my daughter seem to have hit if off,\u201d Susannah said, not letting on how much she disapproved of the relationship.</p><p>Sharon\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>Apparently Sharon didn\u2019t know, and Susannah was sorry she\u2019d said anything. She nodded and as they neared the front of the store, she reached for a grocery cart.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in town?\u201d Sharon asked, taking the next cart.</p><p>Rather than going into a long explanation, Susannah merely said she\u2019d come back to move her mother.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Sharon said with a sarcastic edge. \u201cI thought maybe you were here \u2019cause of Jake. I saw Yvette the other day, and she told me you\u2019re thinking of looking for him. She figured I might know where he is.\u201d</p> <p>Susannah didn\u2019t take the bait. \u201cThe subject of Jake did come up,\u201d she said, playing it low-key. And wouldn\u2019t Sharon love to know she\u2019d actually paid a P.I. to find him?</p><p>\u201cHe came back to me, you know.\u201d She shoved the cart alongside Susannah\u2019s. \u201cAfter you left for that hoity-toity French boarding school, he wanted to get back together with me.\u201d</p><p>Susannah let that comment slide and headed toward the produce aisle. She didn\u2019t trust Sharon for a minute.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I blame him,\u201d Sharon added, following close behind her. She carelessly tossed a small iceberg lettuce into her cart. \u201cI was here and you...weren\u2019t.\u201d She emphasized the last word.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll just bet you were available, too.\u201d Susannah didn\u2019t bother to disguise her scorn.</p><p>Sharon laughed. \u201cI always knew he\u2019d come back to me. You were fun for a while, but I was the woman he wanted. I will say he was bummed after you left, though. He showed me that St. Christopher medal you gave him.\u201d</p><p>Susannah made an effort not to reveal her shock. She\u2019d almost forgotten about that. She had given Jake the medal and couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d shown it to Sharon.</p><p>\u201cI heard from him not too long ago,\u201d Sharon said, pushing the cart past her. \u201cI might still have his number if you want it.\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s fingers tightened on the cart handle.</p><p>\u201cStop by the Roadside Inn some night and I\u2019ll see if I can find it for you,\u201d she said casually as she strolled by.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>Chrissie was already at the house when Susannah arrived. Hair flying, she ran out the front door the minute Susannah parked and surged down the steps with the energy reserved for the young.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d her daughter demanded.</p><p>That was an interesting question in light of the fact that Chrissie hadn\u2019t seen fit to enlighten Susannah about her whereabouts in two days.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get home?\u201d Susannah asked instead, remaining cool and collected as she headed up the steps and into the house, carrying her groceries.</p><p>\u201cYou had a phone call.\u201d Chrissie, it seemed, wasn\u2019t planning to answer any questions herself.</p><p>\u201cWho phoned? Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Chrissie walked backward in front of Susannah, her eyes flashing with irritation. \u201cA private investigator. You\u2019re having Troy investigated, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>That might not be such a bad idea. Susannah wished she\u2019d thought of it earlier. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she said bluntly. That denial appeared to mollify Chrissie\u2014for approximately two seconds.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Nothing that concerned her daughter, at any rate. Although she realized she might have wasted a thousand bucks, since Sharon seemed to know where Jake was, and all she\u2019d have to do was humble herself enough to ask for the information.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d her daughter cried, using the same voice she had as a five-year-old determined to have her way. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep this from me. Why did you hire a private investigator?\u201d</p><p>Susannah set her purse on the kitchen table, then opened the refrigerator and put the pint of cream inside. While she had it open, she took out a cold soda. Closing the door, she leaned against it, frowning as she saw the ring dangling from a long chain around Chrissie\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d Susannah asked, reaching out to examine the ring.</p><p>\u201cI found it in one of the bedroom drawers. It\u2019s kind of pretty.\u201d</p><p>Susannah sighed. \u201cIt belonged to my dad.\u201d The signet ring, bearing his law school crest, was the only jewelry her father had ever worn other than his wedding band.</p><p>Fingering the ring, Chrissie asked, \u201cIs it all right if I wear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Just be careful with it.\u201d She pulled the tab on her soda and took a deep swallow. \u201cNow, what did the investigator say?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie hesitated. \u201cFirst I want you to tell me what this is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-kay...\u201d Chrissie dragged out the word. \u201cAt least give me a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Susannah repeated irritably. The confrontation with Sharon was responsible for her mood. She hated knowing that Jake had gone back to his former girlfriend.</p><p>Chrissie paced the area in front of the kitchen sink. \u201cShe said you should call. You might not get her right away because she\u2019s going out of town, so she set up a two o\u2019clock appointment for Tuesday, after the holiday.\u201d</p><p>Susanna had completely forgotten this was the Fourth of July weekend. Knowing that if she didn\u2019t catch Shirl Remington right away she\u2019d have to wait, Susannah hurried to the phone.</p><p>Chrissie regarded her with a suspicious glare. \u201cAre you sure this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Troy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive.\u201d As she picked up the receiver, Susannah discovered that she didn\u2019t have the agency number on hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you so long?\u201d Chrissie asked again, this time without the defiant attitude.</p><p>Susannah sighed as she rummaged through her purse for the investigator\u2019s business card. \u201cIn Kettle Falls visiting my brother\u2019s old girlfriend and then I stopped at the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Chrissie mulled that over. \u201cAny particular reason you looked up one of Uncle Doug\u2019s old girlfriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d say hello. It was a social call. Why all the questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to know where you were.\u201d</p><p>Susannah found the card and her heart slowed. She would rather have put off calling until Chrissie was out of the room, but checking the clock, she dared not delay a second longer.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what the P.I. says?\u201d Chrissie asked as Susannah lifted the receiver again.</p><p>Susannah ignored the question and punched out the number. After five endlessly long rings, Shirl Remington\u2019s answering machine clicked on. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t take your call. I\u2019m either on the other line or away from my desk. Please leave a message and I\u2019ll get back to you at my earliest convenience.\u201d</p><p>Awash with disappointment, Susannah waited for the annoying sound of the beep. \u201cHi. This is Susannah Nelson returning your call. I\u2019m sorry I missed you. I\u2019ll see you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl Remington.\u201d The P.I.\u2019s voice broke in.</p><p>\u201cShirl, oh, hi.\u201d Susannah\u2019s heart rate soared. \u201cI\u2019m glad I caught you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on my way out the door. Your daughter gave you the message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Were you able to find...my friend?\u201d she asked, shooting a glance at Chrissie who was watching and listening intently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be able to tell you more when I see you. Does Tuesday afternoon work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, perfect.\u201d Susannah hoped the investigator wouldn\u2019t keep her waiting until then. \u201cCan you tell me anything now?\u201d She hated to reveal how anxious she was.</p><p>\u201cI managed to dig up one interesting bit of information. It\u2019s rather complicated so I\u2019d prefer to explain later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The frustration was killing her. \u201cI might have some information myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019m putting out some feelers in Canada. Hopefully I\u2019ll have more to tell you when we meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCanada?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything on Tuesday,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cRight...have a nice weekend.\u201d Susannah\u2019s head was spinning. Did Jake live in Canada?</p><p>\u201cHappy Fourth of July,\u201d Shirl said and, with that, the line went dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she tell you?\u201d Chrissie pried. \u201cWhat was that about Canada?\u201d</p><p>Still absorbed in her thoughts, Susannah shook her head. \u201cShe said we\u2019d talk on Tuesday.\u201d Until then, her stomach would be in knots. Instinct told her she was close to finding Jake. She could feel it. Although maybe that was merely because she so badly wanted to talk to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDad doesn\u2019t know about this, does he?\u201d Chrissie said, accusing her with a look of righteous indignation.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to him this afternoon, and he said he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Susannah scowled at her daughter, furious that she\u2019d mentioned this to Joe. \u201cThank you very much,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>Chrissie\u2019s jaw sagged as though she\u2019d been the victim of a great injustice. \u201cI beg your pardon. I thought my parents communicated with each other. Guess I was wrong. I suppose this has to do with that old boyfriend of yours. That\u2019s all you talk about, you know. Don\u2019t think I can\u2019t hear when you\u2019re on the phone with your friend\u2014it\u2019s Jake this and Jake that. I even heard some of your phone calls to those other Jake guys. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, you\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s face burned with anger and guilt. \u201cFor crying out loud\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better call Dad,\u201d Chrissie cut in. \u201cHe wants to know what\u2019s going on and frankly I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d Chrissie stormed out of the kitchen and disappeared down the hallway to her room.</p><p>Susannah grabbed the icy soda. Her hand shook as she brought the can to her mouth. Sooner or later, she\u2019d have to tell Joe about the thousand-dollar fee to the private detective.</p><p>After taking a few minutes to let her pounding heart settle down, Susannah tried calling Joe at the office. Her one hope was that he was in the middle of a complicated root canal and couldn\u2019t be disturbed. No such luck. He was between patients and eager to talk to her. He took the call in his office.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is happening there?\u201d he asked, clearly angry and worse than that, hurt.</p><p>Joe so rarely raised his voice that Susannah felt even guiltier. \u201cGood afternoon to you, too,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cSusannah, I only have a few minutes. Tell me what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking about the private investigator, I hired her to find Jake Presley.\u201d There, it was out with no embellishments, no explanations and no excuses.</p><p>The silence between them seemed to shout at her, echoing Chrissie\u2019s taunt. You\u2019re married.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t occur to you to talk this over with me first?\u201d he finally asked. \u201cHow would you feel if I decided to look up Donna Terry? She was my first love, but you don\u2019t see me paying good money to hire someone to find her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is different,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re upset about what your father did,\u201d he continued, \u201cand I get that, but this is carrying things too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Why go behind my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...because I knew you wouldn\u2019t want me to and\u2014well, okay, I knew how you\u2019d feel. I don\u2019t expect you to understand, but this is something I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you went through with it even though you were well aware that I\u2019d disapprove? My opinion doesn\u2019t count?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t answer that, can you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJoe, I\u2019m sorry. I was wrong. I should never have handled this the way I did, but I didn\u2019t feel I had a choice. I was afraid you\u2019d talk me out of it or make me feel guilty for wanting to track him down.\u201d</p><p>It was as if he hadn\u2019t heard her. \u201cI would hope you\u2019d trust me enough to discuss such an important matter with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know....\u201d Her words faded. She wanted to explain what had led to her hiring the detective, but Joe wasn\u2019t listening. She certainly couldn\u2019t tell him that the money might well have been wasted.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so important for you to find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just is\u2014for all the reasons I\u2019ve already mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t bother to find you. Doesn\u2019t that tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t, because Jake had to honor his father\u2019s agreement with hers. She was under no such obligation.</p><p>Another silence, filled with accusations.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to the detective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She was on her way out the door so we didn\u2019t have a chance to say much. I\u2019ve got an appointment Tuesday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re keeping the appointment?\u201d</p><p>Susannah frowned, feeling helpless in the face of her own regrets and his unyielding bitterness. \u201cI intend to, yes. Please, Joe, don\u2019t be angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your appointment,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to hear a word about it, understand?\u201d</p><p>Before she could agree or disagree, the line was disconnected.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>Chrissie went outside and sat on the top step to think over what was happening to her family. Her hand curled around the ring. It seemed that her parents\u2019 marriage was dissolving in front of her. The minute she\u2019d arrived home from college, she\u2019d sensed that things weren\u2019t right between her mom and dad.</p><p>Now her mother was hung up on this guy she\u2019d known as a teenager. Jake was on her mind 24/7. It was obvious. Hardly anything had gotten packed in the last couple of days because her mother was too busy doing her own investigative work, looking for her old high school boyfriend, talking about him constantly with Carolyn Somebody\u2014whom Chrissie hadn\u2019t even met.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t worry about her parents, though; Chrissie had concerns of her own. Troy was exciting and fun and\u2014she had to say it\u2014dangerous. Almost every afternoon she made a run into Spokane with him. She didn\u2019t ask what that was about, but she had her suspicions. He left her in the car while he went inside a \u201cfriend\u2019s house.\u201d These visits took all of five minutes and then they drove back to Colville. A couple of times they\u2019d stopped at Loon Lake for a swim. Once he\u2019d taken her for ice cream next to a video rental place.</p><p>They spent hours at his friends\u2019 homes. These guys weren\u2019t the type who attended college, either. If her mom knew about Troy\u2019s friends, it would freak her out.</p><p>Chrissie brightened as the familiar sound of his truck came from the end of the block. She was off the porch and standing at the curb by the time he roared to a stop.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He leaned out the window, elbow on the edge, and sent her a ready smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie shrugged. \u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to go for a ride?\u201d he asked, with the lazy certainty that she would.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She dashed around the front of the truck and climbed in.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get your purse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I need it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve never seen a woman who didn\u2019t drag her purse everywhere she went.\u201d</p><p>The problem was, Chrissie didn\u2019t want to go into the house. If her mother saw her with Troy, she\u2019d ask where Chrissie was going and what time she\u2019d be back. Chrissie could live without that particular form of harassment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Troy responded with a throaty laugh and grabbed her bare thigh, his fingers creeping under the hem of her shorts. She didn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>\u201cWe going to Spokane?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver been to Northport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Chrissie had heard of the small town close to the Canadian border. Now she\u2019d see it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie rested her head against his shoulder. \u201cEverything with you is fun.\u201d</p><p>Troy released her leg, shifted gears and they were off. Normally he racked up the volume on his sound system and let the music blare. This afternoon, he seemed to notice her mood and kept the screaming pitch down to a more moderate level.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Troy asked as they pulled out of the city limits. \u201cIs your mother on your case about me again?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie shook her head. \u201cWhat would you think if I moved to Colville?\u201d she asked, testing the waters. She couldn\u2019t imagine going back to school after this summer. Not with the Jason mess and her current indifference to academics. Moving here made a lot of sense. Her grandmother needed her, and that way they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about packing up the entire house in a few weeks. She could live there and take care of everything.</p><p>Besides, she\u2019d never had a relationship like this. With Troy, life was one big party and she was along for the ride and loving every minute of it.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you want to live with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>That would definitely freak out both her parents. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she said, but her parents weren\u2019t going to let that happen.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYour daddy would probably have me arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019m over twenty-one.\u201d It was a lie, one that slipped easily off her lips. So she\u2019d exaggerated a little.</p><p>Troy chuckled and gave her a knowing look. \u201cYou\u2019re not twenty-one, are you.\u201d He didn\u2019t make it a question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as long as you\u2019re not under eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Indignation caused her to straighten. \u201cI\u2019m not a kid!\u201d</p><p>He stroked her thigh again and laughed.</p><p>Then, because she was curious, she asked. \u201cHave you had girls live with you before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. They generally don\u2019t last long.\u201d His eyes momentarily left the road and connected with hers.</p><p>Chrissie lost herself in the sexual intensity of his gaze, and her breath caught in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that if we got together it\u2019d be different, though,\u201d Troy murmured.</p><p>Chrissie felt as if her heart would melt at his words. \u201cYou make me so happy.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to one side. \u201cBaby, you do the same for me,\u201d he rumbled in a low, sexy voice.</p><p>Chrissie ran her hand down his bare arm and smiled.</p><p>The highway curved, and Troy drove onto a little-used back road. \u201cThere\u2019s something else on your mind,\u201d he said, slowing the truck.</p><p>Chrissie stared out the window. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>Troy held her chin in one hand and turned her head so she couldn\u2019t avoid his gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She might as well tell him; he\u2019d get it out of her sooner or later. \u201cMy mom and dad are fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought your dad\u2019s in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. They were on the phone when you arrived. My mom lied to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were yelling over the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t fight like that. It\u2019s more these pauses when neither one of them\u2019s willing to talk, you know?\u201d</p><p>Troy grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it was in my house. Fights meant throwing things. A couple of my so-called uncles got physical with Mom. More than once, Mom and I ran in the middle of the night so we wouldn\u2019t get the crap beat out of us.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie gasped with horror.</p><p>\u201cHey, I survived and I\u2019m a better man for it.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie wondered about that. Her respect for his mother, whom she had yet to meet, wasn\u2019t high. She couldn\u2019t fathom any mother putting her child in that kind of situation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid my parents might get a divorce,\u201d Chrissie told him. That was one of her worst fears. It happened to other families; it could happen to hers, too.</p><p>\u201cHey, my mom and dad never bothered to get married. Does that shock you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d From what she knew about his mother, very little would.</p><p>\u201cMy daddy took off before I was born. The bastard.\u201d Troy\u2019s hoarse laughter followed. \u201cMy daddy was a bastard and he made me a bastard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, so get used to it.\u201d The humor left his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine growing up without my dad,\u201d Chrissie said, wanting to wrap Troy in her embrace and give him all the love he\u2019d missed as a child.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t go soft on me. There were plenty of men around,\u201d he said with a measure of irony in his voice. \u201cMy mother saw to that. She married twice before I was fifteen and after that she provided me with a series of interesting uncles\u2014none of whom stuck around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy, that\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTerrible? I\u2019m a survivor because of it. No matter how bad things got, I landed on my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d</p><p>He glanced away. \u201cShe\u2019s all right. Her life hasn\u2019t been easy, but she\u2019s made the best of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet her.\u201d</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t immediately respond. \u201cSomeday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wait?\u201d Chrissie asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bit too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit too virginal.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie elbowed him in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to change that,\u201d he said suggestively. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll let me before the end of the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d Chrissie giggled. Troy made her see life in a completely different way. It was about surviving, and surviving meant not taking anything too seriously, not getting in too deep.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>By late afternoon, Susannah was beside herself with worry. Chrissie had vanished without a word, without even leaving a note. The last time Susannah had seen her was while she was on the phone with Joe. She didn\u2019t know where her daughter had gone or with whom.</p> <p>Not that it was hard to figure out. Chrissie was more than likely with Troy Nance. The very least the girl could\u2019ve done was tell her. She had a cell phone. Why didn\u2019t she call?</p><p>After an hour of pacing, she\u2019d had it. She decided to escape the house. With a heavy heart, she drove to Altamira to visit her mother. Vivian was with friends, Sally Mansfield and two other women. Not wanting to interrupt her mother\u2019s visit, Susannah only stayed for a few minutes. When she returned to the house, she phoned Carolyn, hoping for a chance to get together.</p><p>\u201cYou sound upset,\u201d her friend said barely a minute into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Susannah admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve had a horrible day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on over and I\u2019ll commiserate with you. My day hasn\u2019t been that wonderful, either.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, Susannah pulled into the long driveway that led to Carolyn\u2019s home. The scene was picturesque in the early-evening light; soon, the deer would venture down into the wide-open field next door. If she wasn\u2019t so agitated, she\u2019d stop and appreciate the beauty of the countryside, with the surrounding hills standing guard. She envied Carolyn the tranquility of this lovely place.</p><p>The front door stood ajar, and after a courtesy knock, Susannah pushed open the screen door and let herself in.</p><p>\u201cI poured the wine,\u201d Carolyn announced from the kitchen. \u201cAfter the day I\u2019ve had, I need something stronger than iced tea.\u201d</p><p>Susannah echoed that sentiment. They sat down in the family room, where the air conditioner blew cool air from the vent overhead. The afternoon had grown unpleasantly warm and it felt good to relax. Had she been in Seattle, she would\u2019ve been preparing for a party to celebrate the holiday weekend. As it was, she\u2019d probably join her mother at Altamira for a barbecue.</p><p>Carolyn sat at one end of the sofa and Susannah the other. After a sip of wine, Susannah gestured to her friend. \u201cYou go first.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn gave a weak shrug. \u201cWith me, it\u2019s a bunch of small things that added up to one disastrous day. I didn\u2019t set my alarm, so I overslept, which I almost never do. Consequently I was late getting into the office. My entire day was off-kilter. I was rude to Jim although I didn\u2019t mean to be and after that, everyone avoided me. I often stay late at the office, but not today. I wanted out of there the minute the whistle blew and frankly I think everyone was just as glad to be rid of me.\u201d</p><p>Susannah could sympathize. \u201cI hate it when my day gets off to a bad start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be checking my alarm clock from now on.\u201d Carolyn tucked her bare feet beneath her as she made herself comfortable on the couch. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn closed her eyes. \u201cOkay, okay, I took the plunge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Dave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you, but we made...sort of a date. For today.\u201d Carolyn sighed. \u201cI ruined everything, though. He was weeding the flower beds this afternoon and I snapped at him and when I left work, I found a note on my windshield that said perhaps we should meet another night instead. Oh, Susannah,\u201d she moaned, \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that her friend had acted on her desires was encouraging news. \u201cYou actually approached him? Is that how you made your sort-of date?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn blushed. It was so wonderful to see Carolyn this excited that Susannah had to hold back a giggle.</p><p>\u201cDave and I...ran into each other,\u201d Carolyn explained. \u201cAt He\u2019s Not Here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much...We danced one dance and talked a bit. We decided to meet here tonight and then I had to make a complete mess of things.\u201d She picked up her wineglass. \u201cEnough about me. It\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>Susannah wasn\u2019t sure what to tell her first. The most current crisis was her daughter, so she started there. \u201cChrissie took off...again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Troy Nance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you considered talking to Sharon about him?\u201d Carolyn asked.</p><p>Chrissie would hate it if she went to Troy\u2019s mother, but Susannah was beyond caring. \u201cI saw her earlier today at Safeway. She says she has Jake\u2019s phone number and that the two of them got back together after I left for France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe her?\u201d</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t have any choice. She nodded. \u201cShe knew about the St. Christopher medal I gave Jake. I\u2019d forgotten about it, but she hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think she\u2019s telling the truth?\u201d Carolyn asked.</p><p>Susannah shrugged. \u201cI have to assume she is. Although she didn\u2019t seem to know that Troy\u2019s seeing Chrissie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows,\u201d Carolyn muttered. \u201cTrust me, she keeps close tabs on her boy. If you want to find out where Troy and Chrissie are, she\u2019ll be able to tell you.\u201d</p><p>As much as Susannah hated talking to Sharon twice in the same day, she had to do it. This ridiculous situation with Troy and Chrissie had gone on long enough. \u201cHow old is Troy, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be around thirty.\u201d</p><p>Susannah frowned. Not only was this guy completely unsuitable, he was far too old for Chrissie. Sooner or later, she\u2019d have to confront Chrissie about her relationship with Troy. When she did, she wanted her facts straight.</p><p>\u201cChrissie\u2019s got you down?\u201d</p><p>Susannah ran her fingers down the stem of her wineglass and lifted one shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s only part of the problem. Joe and I had an argument this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d Carolyn asked, then rushed to add, \u201cIf it\u2019s none of my business, just say so, but if you want to talk, then I\u2019m here to listen.\u201d</p><p>Feeling as wretched as she did, Susannah needed to share her dilemmas. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him I\u2019d hired a private eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, oh.\u201d</p><p>Susannah sighed. \u201cI know it\u2019s crazy. You can imagine how Joe felt when he heard what I\u2019d done\u2014from Chrissie, by the way, which just infuriated me. And yet it\u2019s my own fault for keeping it a secret. Joe was really angry with me, but he was at the office and couldn\u2019t very well vent with his entire staff listening in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so important for you to find Jake, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t completely understand it myself. I wish I could just leave everything the way it is, but Carolyn, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too late.\u201d She bent her head, eyes closed. \u201cJoe is my life raft, so why do I keep pushing him away? I can\u2019t seem to help it. I\u2019m risking everything for this, and when I consider what\u2019s at stake, I have to admit it\u2019s crazy. I can\u2019t undo the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happens next?\u201d</p><p>Susannah wished she knew. \u201cI have an appointment with the P.I. on Tuesday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she didn\u2019t tell you anything yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. She mentioned putting out some feelers in Canada. I don\u2019t have a clue what that\u2019s all about. She said she\u2019d tell me on Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have some news, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have asked for an appointment,\u201d Carolyn said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she has found him, what will you do?\u201d</p><p>Susannah hadn\u2019t decided. Yes, she wanted to talk to Jake and apologize for her father\u2019s actions. But that could be done over the phone. Seeing him again was something else entirely. Despite herself, her heart raced with excitement at the prospect.</p><p>This was wrong, so wrong. She reminded herself forcefully that she was married. Joe was her husband and he was a good man who deserved better than to have his wife hungering after some high school boyfriend.</p><p>Yet Susannah no longer felt in control of what she\u2019d set in motion. She couldn\u2019t stop the search for Jake now, even if she wanted to. And she didn\u2019t....</p><p>\u201cSusannah?\u201d Carolyn\u2019s voice broke into her reverie.</p><p>\u201cWhat will I do?\u201d Susannah repeated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d She took another sip of her merlot. \u201cChrissie, Jake, Sharon, Joe\u2014that\u2019s not the end of my hellish day, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Susannah said, trying to sound lighthearted without much success.</p><p>\u201cGo on. You might as well tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out something about my brother.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn straightened and leaned toward her. \u201cDoug? What did you learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went out to see Patricia Carney. Her name\u2019s Anderson now. You remember her, don\u2019t you? She and Doug were seeing each other.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn nodded, setting her wineglass aside. \u201cI remember the two of them were dating, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, but Patricia seemed to think there might\u2019ve been someone else in his life.\u201d She stared down at her wine. \u201cIn fact, the night he was killed, Patricia was going to confront him and then at the last minute he broke their date.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe night he was killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t cancelled, Patricia would\u2019ve been with him.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s eyes widened at the implication and when she spoke her voice was soft. \u201cShe might have died that night, too.\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cWe talked about the twists and turns life takes. I promised I\u2019d let her know when I find out who it might\u2019ve been.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold on, you just lost me. Who might\u2019ve been what? Are you talking about this other girl he was supposedly seeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but in addition to that, someone\u2019s been putting flowers on Doug\u2019s grave. I thought it was Patricia, but she swears it isn\u2019t, so I assume it\u2019s whoever else he was involved with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s telling you the truth,\u201d Carolyn whispered. She reached for her wineglass again and got to her feet. Walking back into the kitchen, she replenished her drink.</p><p>Susannah followed. \u201cHow would you know that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Carolyn stood on the other side of the counter, eyes downcast. \u201cBecause it\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou?\u201d Susannah asked numbly.</p><p>\u201cDoug and I were writing to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Susannah said, stunned by this revelation. \u201cWhile we were in France?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn nodded apologetically. \u201cSoon after you arrived in France, Doug wrote to ask me how you were doing. He knew how upset you were with your father, and he was worried. I wrote back and he answered. Pretty soon we were writing regularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never bothered to mention this to me?\u201d Susannah asked, angry that the woman she\u2019d considered her best friend had kept something so important from her. She\u2019d told Carolyn all about her feelings for Jake; Carolyn obviously hadn\u2019t returned the favor. Now that she thought about it, Susannah remembered how eagerly Carolyn had waited for the mail. She had, too. It was what she\u2019d lived for those months in France.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Carolyn shifted awkwardly. She didn\u2019t meet Susannah\u2019s eyes. \u201cI never meant to keep it from you. But the first time he wrote, Doug asked me not to tell you, so I didn\u2019t and then, well...well, one thing led to another and I just never did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe two of you fell in love through the mail? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I am.\u201d Carolyn looked directly at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember how frantic I was when Doug was killed?\u201d</p><p>Susannah shook her head. She\u2019d been so caught up in her own pain she hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>\u201cIn the last letter I got from him, Doug said he was going to tell Patricia about us. He planned to break up with her that night, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still put flowers on his grave?\u201d</p><p>They walked back and sat on the sofa again. \u201cEvery few weeks I put flowers on my parents\u2019 graves and Lily\u2019s. I leave some at Doug\u2019s, too. I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were writing,\u201d Susannah asked, \u201cdid Doug\u2014did he say Jake had gone back to Sharon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But then, he didn\u2019t write much about Jake.\u201d</p> <p>Susannah studied her friend. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that Doug was mad at him about something\u2014he just never said what it was.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>Vivian had her good days and her bad ones, and today was good. Many of the bad days were before Susannah and Chrissie had come. Vivian had done her best to hide how defeated she\u2019d felt. In fact, she hadn\u2019t realized how badly she was coping at home until she came to live at this prison place\u2014or hospital or whatever it was.</p><p>Not that she was complaining. The food was all right when she had an appetite, and she noticed the meals had improved since her first week there. Granted, most days she didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, but she made an effort to eat. She was growing used to the way they did things here. It worried her some when she discovered that they locked the doors at night, but her friend George\u2014not her husband, the other George\u2014had told her why. The doors were locked to keep the crooks out. She could believe that. She already knew the world was full of people eager to swindle an elderly widow.</p><p>Barring the doors to thieves was fine with Vivian, but it kept someone else out, too\u2014her George. She hadn\u2019t known locked doors were a hindrance to the dead, but apparently they were. He hadn\u2019t come to visit\u2014at least not until today. When she woke from her nap, he\u2019d been there, in her darkened room. Oh, he looked wonderful to her. Vivian had been overcome with joy. It\u2019d been so long since his last visit that she\u2019d nearly given up hope.</p><p>She asked why he\u2019d taken all those weeks to find her. He couldn\u2019t answer, but that was all right. None of that mattered when he was with her. For a while they sat and looked at each other in silence. Tears had come to her eyes and although they didn\u2019t speak, Vivian felt his love for her and their children.</p><p>Once she\u2019d composed herself, she told him how upset Susannah was, although she still couldn\u2019t recall exactly why. Poor George didn\u2019t know what to think. He\u2019d frowned and shaken his head, and Vivian wished she\u2019d kept it to herself. All too soon he was gone.</p><p>Invigorated by the visit, Vivian joined Sally and a couple of other women for dinner. Earlier in the afternoon, they\u2019d also met for tea, which was becoming a regular occurrence, and one she had to admit she enjoyed. Then she\u2019d had her nap, followed of course by dinner. Afterward as she started back to her suite, she felt disappointed that she hadn\u2019t seen her friend George, even though she knew he ate in his room. Vivian was proud of herself. She\u2019d finished her entire salmon cake and small salad, but she didn\u2019t much care for the rice dish. No flavor whatsoever.</p><p>Leaning on her cane for balance, Vivian walked past the pool room. Sure enough, her friend was there, using his crutch as a pool cue just as he had the first night she\u2019d met him. George glanced up when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d swing by,\u201d he said in that gruff way of his.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014here I am.\u201d</p><p>George made a dismissive grunt. \u201cWhat\u2019s put you in such a good mood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband visited this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>George lowered his crutch to the floor. \u201cDid he now?\u201d</p><p>Vivian nodded. \u201cHe stayed for a while, too.\u201d</p><p>The other man\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him.\u201d</p><p>That made perfect sense to Vivian. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. He only appears to me. He\u2019s dead, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, I forgot. I don\u2019t suppose he talks much, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. He\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>George rubbed the side of his face, as if testing to see whether he needed a shave or not. \u201cDid he let you know what he wanted?\u201d</p><p>The question gave Vivian pause. \u201cI think he was just checking up on me. I was mighty glad to see him, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you mention that business with your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, but it really bothered him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw her here earlier.\u201d</p><p>If this conversation was going to take much longer, Vivian would need to sit down. She made her way over to the sofa and slowly sank into the soft cushion. \u201cShe was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t stay long.\u201d</p><p>Vivian frowned, clutching her cane with both hands. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say, but she was here barely five minutes. I saw her when she was walking out the front door.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes, Vivian remembered now. \u201cMy friends were visiting and then I lay down to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Vivian wasn\u2019t sure, but she must have. \u201cDo you know who\u2019s looking after my roses?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll find out when the nurse comes with my pills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d George agreed.</p><p>Vivian started to get up, then changed her mind. She frowned. \u201cSusannah stopped by like you said, and I think she was upset again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your daughter have a problem with anger management?\u201d</p><p>Vivian took offense at that. \u201cWhat a horrible thing to say about my Susannah,\u201d she flared.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get huffy. It seems to be a family trait.\u201d</p><p>This conversation was declining fast. Vivian tried to get up but found she didn\u2019t have the strength. \u201cSomebody help me,\u201d she called out, ignoring George.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d George said, limping toward her with the aid of his crutches.</p><p>\u201cNot you.\u201d George had insulted Susannah and she wasn\u2019t going to stand for it. Or sit, either.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to help you up if not me?\u201d George asked.</p><p>He parked himself directly in front of Vivian, making it impossible for her to escape. \u201cGuard,\u201d she yelled at the top of her lungs.</p><p>George hooted with laughter.</p><p>\u201cThis is no laughing matter,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He offered her his hand.</p><p>A better woman would have refused, but Vivian wanted to get back to her apartment. She decided she\u2019d be willing to forgive him this one slight against her daughter. But only this one.</p><p>Using her cane for leverage and holding on to George\u2019s hand, she struggled to an upright position, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Damn fools shouldn\u2019t put useless furniture in these rooms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear your husband came by,\u201d George said as she headed toward the door.</p><p>\u201cHe was an important man, you know. A judge.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cGeorge sent a lot of men to prison. They deserved it, too. He didn\u2019t tolerate crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for him.\u201d</p><p>He sounded sincere, and Vivian was warmed by his approval. \u201cHe has to come during the day now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Of all people, George should know the answer to that. \u201cThey keep the doors locked after eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. I forgot.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, not believing that for a second. Vivian was halfway into the hall when George stopped her. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you told him about meeting me, did you?\u201d</p><p>Vivian shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIs he the jealous sort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband? Never\u2014well, maybe a little.\u201d</p><p>Her friend followed her a short distance. \u201cDo you play bridge?\u201d</p><p>Vivian shook her head again. \u201cI\u2019m not much good at that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I could use a bridge partner. What about gin rummy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to play that with the grandkids when they were little, but they outgrew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to give it a try one afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Vivian would\u2019ve liked that, but she was afraid she\u2019d lose track of the cards. \u201cMaybe. You play Scrabble?\u201d</p><p>George gestured with one of his crutches. \u201cI\u2019m not so good with words.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps they had more in common than she\u2019d realized. \u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>George grinned and she smiled back at him. \u201cThe shuttle bus is taking a trip to the Indian casino in Spokane tomorrow afternoon,\u201d he told her. \u201cHow would you feel about going along?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It would make for a long day but Vivian supposed she could manage it. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to go.\u201d</p><p>George seemed pleased.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night,\u201d George echoed. \u201cListen,\u201d he added, \u201cthe next time your husband stops by, you tell him he\u2019s got competition.\u201d</p> <p>Vivian blushed. \u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d she said over her shoulder.</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>Monday was the Fourth of July. After Susannah had attended the barbecue at Altamira, Carolyn accompanied her to the Roadside Inn five miles outside town. At first Susannah had dismissed her offer, but now as they approached the Inn, she was grateful not to be alone. One look at the seedy, run-down tavern was enough to convince her this was not an establishment she should walk into alone.</p><p>In fact, she had no desire to enter the Roadside Inn at all, under any circumstances. Had she been in any other mood, Susannah would have put this off, but she hoped to speak with Sharon, mother to mother, about Troy and Chrissie. And if Sharon had Jake\u2019s phone number, she wanted it.</p><p>When she picked Carolyn up, her friend was in a cheerful frame of mind\u2014and it didn\u2019t take Susannah long to discover why. Dave! He\u2019d come to see her on Saturday night. Carolyn hadn\u2019t described the visit in detail, but it seemed to have gone well.</p> <p>\u201cWould you stop,\u201d Carolyn muttered when Susannah reached the end of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking at me like you\u2019re ready to break into giggles at any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d Susannah confessed. \u201cYou just seem so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a romantic.\u201d</p><p>No question there. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know...I wish Dave wasn\u2019t so concerned about appearances.\u201d She made a wry face. \u201cI mean, I worried about it at first but I couldn\u2019t care less now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn shrugged. \u201cHe never stays anyplace long,\u201d she explained. \u201cI told him I accept that. When he\u2019s ready to leave he should just go. I certainly can\u2019t stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the possibility of him being an ex-con? That doesn\u2019t bother you anymore?\u201d Susannah felt she had to ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around men my entire life and I consider myself a decent judge of character,\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cDave\u2019s a good man. If he\u2019s ever been in jail it would surprise me.... Besides, I did a search in all the states he\u2019s mentioned and couldn\u2019t find any record of him in the justice system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn smiled, nodding.</p><p>\u201cYou enjoy his company, don\u2019t you?\u201d Susannah asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a wonderful time. Dave barbecued steaks, and we sat and talked for hours. I\u2019ve never felt this comfortable with any man. He\u2019s warm and funny and has this dry sense of humor that cracks me up. He\u2019s a completely different person when he\u2019s not on the job.\u201d</p><p>Susannah wondered if Carolyn understood the risk she was taking. And she wondered if she herself fully recognized everything she was risking in her quest to find Jake.</p><p>They were absorbed in their own thoughts as she drove the rest of the way to the Roadside Inn.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a rough crowd here,\u201d Carolyn said once Susannah had pulled into an empty parking space.</p><p>The lot was full of trucking rigs and broken-down vehicles. One pickup actually had the passenger door missing. Loud music blared from inside, and a few disreputable types clustered near the entrance. Paying them no heed, Susannah marched resolutely toward the tavern, Carolyn at her side.</p><p>They stepped into the room and onto the sawdust-covered floor. Cigarette smoke hung in the air like a dense fog. It seemed that every pair of eyes was staring at the two of them. The one good thing about the wailing jukebox was that they couldn\u2019t really hear the catcalls and jeering remarks aimed in their direction. Ignoring her discomfort, Susannah strode over to the bar tended by Sharon Nance. Two men scooted down to make room and Susannah thanked them with a curt nod.</p><p>\u201cWell, as I live and breathe, it\u2019s the Bobbsey twins,\u201d Sharon taunted as she strolled toward them from the other end of the bar.</p><p>\u201cHello, Sharon.\u201d</p><p>The other woman\u2019s heavily bleached hair was pulled tightly away from her face, leaving little to soften her sharp features. She planted both hands on the edge of the bar. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I didn\u2019t come in for a beer?\u201d Susannah asked calmly. She chose to disregard the other woman\u2019s hostility.</p><p>Sharon snorted as if to say she wasn\u2019t that easily fooled. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the type. Frankly, I doubt you\u2019re here to have a good time, either, although any one of these guys would be more than happy to accommodate you.\u201d</p><p>Susannah had hoped for something a little friendlier. She tasted disappointment in the stagnant and smoke-filled air.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Sharon said, glowering at Carolyn. \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Sharon,\u201d Carolyn said in the same cordial tone Susannah had used.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Daddy\u2019s little girl doing at the mill these days?\u201d</p><p>Several heads turned in their direction. A couple of the truckers picked up their beer mugs and left their stools at the bar, moving into the shadows.</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t know what that was about. Were they protecting Sharon\u2014or remaining uninvolved? She couldn\u2019t tell, but hoped it was the latter. This was uncomfortable enough without any further complications.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve met my daughter?\u201d Susannah asked conversationally. Her voice trembled slightly, betraying her. \u201cAs I told you, she\u2019s spending a lot of time with your son.\u201d</p><p>Sharon\u2019s responding laugh was devoid of any real amusement. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d want to meet your little girl? She ain\u2019t here, that\u2019s for damn sure, and if she was, it\u2019d be of her own free will, now wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded warily.</p><p>Sharon\u2019s black-rimmed eyes flared. \u201cI bet that\u2019s got you worried. But guess what? Troy\u2019s never even mentioned her. What my son does is his own business. I will say this, though. He\u2019s got a weakness for sweet young things. If I were you, I\u2019d keep your girl away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is Troy?\u201d Susannah was furious that she\u2019d allowed Sharon\u2019s attitude to get to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissie\u2019s only nineteen.\u201d She didn\u2019t add that Chrissie would turn twenty in another month.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to make trouble for my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Troy wants you to know how old he is, he\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t getting them anywhere.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Sharon asked, raising heavily penciled eyebrows. \u201cOh, yeah. This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you, but you might find it interesting.\u201d She folded her arms and smiled at Susannah.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>For an instant, the other woman seemed genuinely surprised. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d</p><p>Confused, Susannah glanced at Carolyn. \u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>Sharon\u2019s mouth twisted in a sneer. \u201cDon\u2019t you think Troy looks a lot like his daddy?\u201d</p><p>It took longer than it should have for the implication to sink in. \u201cAre...are you saying Jake is Troy\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>Sharon said nothing more and went back to tending bar. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>Now that she considered it, there was a resemblance between Jake and Troy. She felt sick to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cStill want me to get his phone number for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Reeling from shock, Susannah couldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Sharon laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s hand clasped her arm. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d Susannah didn\u2019t understand Sharon\u2019s animosity. She\u2019d never been friends with the other woman, but they\u2019d gone through eleven years of school together. While it was true that Jake had broken up with Sharon and started to date her, he\u2019d apparently had a change of heart after Susannah left for France.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so angry?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>Sharon\u2019s laugh was hoarse from years of smoking. \u201cThe only time you come around is when you want something. Your brother did the same thing. Any other day of the week I\u2019m not good enough for either of you.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t true. Susannah had never gone out of her way to avoid Sharon.</p><p>Crossing her arms and looking bored, Sharon muttered, \u201cSo, what\u2019ll it be? A beer or the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell us about Jake Presley?\u201d Carolyn demanded before Susannah had a chance.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she returned flippantly. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him yourself. If he wants to talk to Susannah, he\u2019ll find her. I\u2019ll let him know you were inquiring after his health,\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cActually, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not asking me about Doug Leary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he got to do with anything?\u201d Susannah asked, incensed that Sharon would even bring up her brother\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cI always found it amusing that your daddy was the law-and-order man and his own son was dealing. Some family you\u2019ve got there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother?\u201d Susannah cried. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what you want. I know what\u2019s true, and your brother was in big trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Carolyn said again, tugging at Susannah\u2019s arm.</p><p>She stumbled back a step. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say anything against my brother.\u201d Susannah was so upset she was trembling. Why Sharon would invent such fabrications, why she\u2019d hurt her this way\u2014it made no sense.</p><p>Sharon\u2019s gaze shifted to Carolyn. \u201cI\u2019m not lying.\u201d</p><p>Susannah shook her head furiously. The woman had to be lying.</p><p>\u201cHe was dealing,\u201d Sharon insisted. \u201cDid you know that the night he was killed, he was running from the law?\u201d</p><p>Too shocked to respond, Susannah stopped breathing. Sharon\u2019s story was more and more unbelievable. The only thing her father had told her about the accident was that Doug had taken the curve too fast and slammed into a tree.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Dalton was chasing my brother?\u201d she asked, just so she\u2019d be able to prove her wrong. She\u2019d simply get in touch with the former sheriff and see what he had to say.</p><p>\u201cNope. Feds were the ones after him.\u201d</p><p>Sharon certainly had plenty of details, but whether or not they were true remained to be seen. They couldn\u2019t be! \u201cThe federal government?\u201d This should be easy enough to disprove and once she did, she\u2019d sue Sharon Nance for slander.</p><p>\u201cBig mistake to mess with the feds.\u201d Sharon spoke in a somber voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more of these lies,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sharon snarled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Susannah glared at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I ever did to you that was so awful, but whatever it is, I suggest you get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Carolyn hissed.</p><p>\u201cDoug wasn\u2019t the only one, either,\u201d Sharon said loudly as Susannah stepped away from the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she yelled back.</p> <p>Sharon gave another of her guttural smoker\u2019s laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe a word of it,\u201d Carolyn said emphatically as she and Susannah walked out of the Roadside Inn.</p><p>\u201cSharon never even knew Doug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he ever say anything about this in his letters?\u201d Susannah asked.</p> <p>Carolyn hesitated.</p><p>\u201cCarolyn?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything directly,\u201d she told her. \u201cBut I could tell something was up, something he didn\u2019t want to discuss. I saved all his letters and on the anniversary of his death, I sometimes reread them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Susannah pressed. The structure of her entire family was crumbling. Her father might\u2019ve been having an affair and now she\u2019d learned that her brother, whom she\u2019d idolized, might have been dealing drugs.</p><p>\u201cThere were obscure hints in some of his letters,\u201d Carolyn continued as they neared the car. \u201cThings I didn\u2019t understand. At the time I figured it had to do with Patricia. He was definitely uneasy\u2014I assumed he felt guilty about breaking up with her. But then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was some kind of...incident. I think maybe it involved Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Susannah shook her head. She would\u2019ve known if Jake was doing drugs\u2014or selling them. He couldn\u2019t have been.</p><p>\u201cWhen Jake asked you to run away with him, did he mention finances?\u201d</p><p>In an effort to remember, Susannah stood there in the gravel parking lot, trying not to be distracted by the din from the bar. She closed her eyes and the scene in the moonlit garden played back in her mind as if it had happened only hours ago instead of years. Jake had cupped her face with both hands and stared intently into her eyes. He\u2019d asked her to run away with him and promised he\u2019d marry her as soon as they found a justice of the peace in Idaho. Every time she asked a question about where they\u2019d go after that, what they\u2019d do, he\u2019d cut her off with deep, probing kisses, kisses that comforted her and allayed her fears. She\u2019d asked about money. She didn\u2019t have much; her father had made sure of that. Jake had told her not to worry, though. He\u2019d take care of everything.</p><p>\u201cHe said I shouldn\u2019t worry about money,\u201d she whispered. Her heart ached as she looked at her friend. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere was he getting money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my suspicions,\u201d Carolyn said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cBut why would Doug get involved in anything like that?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s gaze met hers in the dim light outside the tavern. \u201cI don\u2019t know and I doubt we ever will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think that comment Sharon made about Doug not being the only one meant Jake was part of it, too?\u201d she asked. \u201cJake and Doug?\u201d Susannah broached the subject carefully, afraid of the answer. So many of the memories she\u2019d nurtured were being destroyed. Everything she\u2019d believed was turning out to be something else, and Susannah felt she no longer knew what was real and what wasn\u2019t. It gave her an unexpected insight into the kind of confusion her mother must feel.</p><p>\u201cSharon would say anything to upset you,\u201d Carolyn reminded her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much credit we should give any of the stuff she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Susannah agreed in theory. \u201cCould Troy really be Jake\u2019s son?\u201d she asked tentatively. When they\u2019d started dating, Jake had been wild and undisciplined\u2014the stereotypical bad boy. In contrast, she\u2019d been the good girl, and the attraction between them was powerful. She\u2019d made clear to Jake that if he wanted to be with her, he\u2019d have to change, and he\u2019d tried. He\u2019d loved her, and had tried to prove himself to her and her father. Except that the mighty Judge Leary had refused to talk to Jake, had refused to have anything to do with him.</p><p>Everything she\u2019d learned about Jake in these past few weeks had shattered the image she\u2019d held of him and now, it seemed, her brother, too. For the first time since she\u2019d arrived in Colville, she longed for her life in Seattle. Her summers there were peaceful, spent working in her garden and doing small projects around the house. The year before, she\u2019d taken an upholstery class and reupholstered the dining room chairs and then, in a burst of enthusiasm, wallpapered the kitchen. A one-week jaunt to Hawaii with Joe had been an added bonus. By comparison, this summer felt like a nightmare with no escape and no end.</p><p>Once inside her car, Susannah gripped the steering wheel tightly. \u201cI have to wonder exactly what the truth is. I have no idea anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely there\u2019s a way to find out.\u201d</p><p>Susannah wasn\u2019t convinced she wanted to dig up information that might best be left buried. She said as much to Carolyn.</p><p>But Carolyn shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave it there, especially if Sharon\u2019s implicating Doug in some kind of wrongdoing. And her hints about Jake\u2014don\u2019t you want to know if there\u2019s any truth to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh! Shirl Remington mentioned that she was inquiring about Jake in Canada. If he was in trouble, he might\u2019ve fled there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many young men went north to avoid the draft,\u201d Carolyn said.</p><p>\u201cI might never find him, then. Especially if he changed his name.\u201d It was a possibility Susannah hadn\u2019t considered before. \u201cAt this point I don\u2019t even care. He obviously isn\u2019t the boy I remember or the man I thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Her friend shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ve paid the investigator. You might as well listen to what she has to say.\u201d</p><p>Susannah started the engine and turned onto the highway that led back to town. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d she said reluctantly.</p><p>They rode in silence for a while before Carolyn asked, \u201cListen, would you mind if I went with you to that private investigator?\u201d</p><p>Whatever Carolyn\u2019s reason, Susannah was grateful for the company. \u201cThat\u2019d be fine. But...oh, Carolyn, I don\u2019t think I could stand it if Doug did anything illegal. I mean, that\u2019s not what Shirl\u2019s looking for, but if he was involved with Jake in some stupid scheme, it might all come out. I\u2019m really not sure I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if it\u2019s the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe any of this is happening. I wish I\u2019d never found that agreement between my father and Allan Presley. That\u2019s what got me into all this.\u201d In any case, it was what had intensified her need to search for Jake.</p><p>As Susannah drove the dark country road to Carolyn\u2019s home, she felt an overwhelming sense of discouragement. The road and the house looked much the same as they had when she and Carolyn were kids. And yet that sameness struck her as false. Nothing was as it seemed. Past and present seemed to blur, leading her to doubt the truth of her own history.</p><p>She turned down the long driveway and parked, and Carolyn climbed out of the car. \u201cWhat time do you want to leave tomorrow?\u201d she asked, sounding as casual as if they were meeting for some ordinary event.</p><p>Susannah bit her lip, calculating the distance. \u201cAbout eleven-thirty.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be at your house by eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. See you then.\u201d</p><p>Susannah waited until Carolyn was inside and the lights were on before she reversed her route and headed back into Colville.</p><p>As she drove, she considered calling Joe, despite the lateness of the hour. She didn\u2019t blame him for his unhappiness with her. They rarely argued, and she hated this. The problem was, Susannah didn\u2019t know what she could say other than to apologize and she\u2019d already done that.</p><p>When she reached the house on Chestnut Avenue, the lights weren\u2019t on, which told her Chrissie wasn\u2019t back from wherever she\u2019d gone with Troy.</p><p>Still wondering about calling Joe, she hurried up the front steps and unlocked the door. She left her purse on the small hallway table and flicked on the light. Hoping for a phone message from her husband, she moved toward the kitchen, then paused midstep at a noise coming from the back bedroom.</p><p>Perhaps Chrissie had returned, after all. \u201cChrissie, is that you?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Susannah froze. \u201cChrissie?\u201d she tried again, less certain this time.</p><p>When there was no reply, Susannah grabbed her purse, raced out the front door and quickly located her cell phone. Scrambling, her fingers hardly able to function, she pressed 9-1-1.</p><p>An operator\u2019s voice answered. \u201c9-1-1 emergency line. How might I assist you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an intruder in the house,\u201d she whispered frantically into the cell. She gave them the address. \u201cHurry, please.\u201d</p><p>The operator immediately advised her to get away from the house and to wait for the squad car. By the time Susannah made it halfway down the block, her knees were trembling so badly, she sank to the ground. That noise hadn\u2019t been her imagination. There was someone in the house\u2014but she was sure the intruder had heard her and would disappear before the police showed up.</p><p>Only minutes later, a squad car rolled down the street. Susannah jumped up and rushed to the curb as it parked behind hers. When two officers got out, Susannah jogged over to them. She read their name tags and didn\u2019t recognize either one.</p><p>\u201cI believe someone\u2019s in the house\u2014or was in the house.\u201d Her voice shook as she explained what she\u2019d heard.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll check it out.\u201d Shining a large flashlight, the first cop walked to the backyard and the other went through the front door, which Susannah had left open.</p><p>Susannah stayed where she was, grateful not to have to go back in alone. Standing by a streetlight, she couldn\u2019t help suspecting that all her neighbors were staring at her from behind their living room drapes. She resisted the childish urge to wave.</p><p>The shorter of the two officers joined her on the sidewalk. \u201cThe house is clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you go in and see if anything\u2019s missing?\u201d the other man asked.</p><p>She nodded and made her way toward the master bedroom. It was from this end of the hall that she\u2019d heard the noise. The lights were already on, and at first glance nothing seemed to be disturbed. Naturally. Her fear was that she\u2019d end up looking like an idiot. Or like one of those unbalanced people who called the police in a pathetic bid for attention.</p><p>The window beside the desk was raised two or three inches. She didn\u2019t remember leaving it open, but that was something she might easily have overlooked. Her father\u2019s desk appeared no different from when she\u2019d left it. Large cardboard boxes, some sealed and ready to be delivered to the storage unit and others that were only half-packed, littered the floor. Nothing seemed out of place there, either.</p><p>\u201cA cat might\u2019ve come through the window,\u201d the short officer suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Susannah said quietly. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been here.\u201d She couldn\u2019t say precisely what was out of place or how she knew, but she did. \u201cSomeone was in this room and then left when I arrived.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Chrissie stormed into the bedroom, coming to an abrupt halt when she saw the two officers.</p><p>\u201cWe had an intruder,\u201d Susannah said. Feeling shaky, she reached for her daughter and hugged her.</p> <p>\u201cMom, Mom, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Susannah shook her head and burst into tears.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>Carolyn got to the house shortly after eleven on Tuesday morning for their meeting with the investigator. After the events of Monday night, Susannah felt jittery and paranoid, certain that every creak of the floorboard, the slightest sound, was the intruder returning. None of the other break-ins had affected her like this\u2014maybe because whoever it was had actually been in the house when she came home. Chrissie had phoned Joe, and he was furious with Susannah all over again, as though she\u2019d purposely attracted their thief. On closer inspection, she\u2019d found several things missing. Random papers, a tiny clock, an old fountain pen and\u2014bizarrely\u2014the small journal with the entries her father had made regarding trips and money. The burglar had obviously scooped up whatever lay on the desk.</p><p>Joe had insisted on ordering a burglar alarm. Susannah had argued that she wouldn\u2019t be there much longer. A week, ten days at the most. She was eager to get back to Seattle, to see Joe and talk to him face-to-face. The whole episode with Jake embarrassed her; the strength of her feelings about him now seemed like something from the distant past. She was sorry she\u2019d pursued it at all. In fact, she regretted everything. At this point, all she wanted was to go home to her husband and family, to her safe and familiar life.</p> <p>\u201cYou look dreadful,\u201d Carolyn said, standing at the foot of the steps.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d But Susannah knew that wasn\u2019t an exaggeration. She hadn\u2019t slept all night. Dark circles shadowed her eyes. Whenever she\u2019d managed to drift off, some noise would jerk her awake, and all morning she\u2019d walked around in a sleep-deprived fog. Worries about Chrissie weighed on her mind, too. She hadn\u2019t said anything to Joe yet, but their daughter had dropped a bombshell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my purse.\u201d Susannah returned to the house, double-checked every window and door, then met Carolyn at the curb where her friend had parked.</p><p>Carolyn offered to drive, and Susannah was thankful. Because she was exhausted and in no mood to talk, she closed her eyes, unable to stop thinking about Chrissie. As soon as Susannah had calmed down last night and the police had left, Chrissie had announced that she was dropping out of college and moving to Colville.</p><p>Susannah was aghast. Her first thought had been to send Chrissie back to Seattle. She\u2019d immediately realized that wouldn\u2019t work. Chrissie had managed to get to Colville on her own before, and she would again. She claimed she was moving here to be close to her grandmother, but Susannah figured that being close to Troy had more to do with it. The situation had to be handled delicately and she wasn\u2019t sure she was the best one to deal with it, considering the arguments she\u2019d already had with Chrissie about that jerk.</p><p>Susannah felt Carolyn\u2019s gaze on her a few times, but neither spoke until they reached the outskirts of Spokane, when Carolyn needed directions to the detective\u2019s address.</p> <p>Parked outside Shirl Remington\u2019s place, Susannah found that her palms were sweaty. She wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d learn or if this was information she really wanted to hear. Enough of her illusions had been destroyed.</p><p>The front door was unlocked. Susannah and Carolyn rang the bell once, then, opening the screen door, they stepped inside. Shirl Remington was walking toward them. This time she wore her hair in a high ponytail.</p><p>Susannah introduced Carolyn, and the investigator shook her hand.</p><p>\u201cCome in, please.\u201d She motioned toward the French doors that led to her office.</p><p>While Susannah and Carolyn settled in the two guest chairs, Shirl went to her desk. \u201cThank you for coming this afternoon,\u201d she said as she pulled the top file from her tray.</p><p>Susannah slid closer to the edge of her chair. The oddest sensation came over her\u2014guilt and anxiety, dread and fear all at once.</p><p>Shirl opened the file folder, then leaned forward, hands clasped on her desk. All her actions seemed to be in slow motion. \u201cI\u2019ve done an exhaustive search,\u201d she said, meeting Susannah\u2019s eyes. \u201cAs far as I can determine, there is no record of Jake Presley beyond his life in Colville. There\u2019s no activity on his social security number. Nor has he filed income tax.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn frowned at Susannah.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s also no record of his ever having been incarcerated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould he have gone out of the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly Canada. No passport has been issued to Jake Presley. I did learn that he\u2019s got an outstanding drug trafficking charge against him. That\u2019s the reason I searched for him in Canada. But if he did move up there, it wasn\u2019t under the name Jake Presley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrug trafficking?\u201d she whispered. So Sharon had told the truth about that. Then perhaps everything else she\u2019d said was also true. It made Susannah heartsick.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the statute of limitations?\u201d Carolyn asked when Susannah remained silent. \u201cThat crime took place years ago.\u201d</p><p>Shirl shook her head, the ponytail swinging as she did. \u201cWith federal crimes there is no statute of limitations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guess is that he got into some kind of trouble with the law and fled into Canada, where he created a new name and a new life. Like I said earlier, I\u2019ve put out some inquiries with a couple of associates, but it might take a while.\u201d</p><p>Susannah felt as if she were in a trance. This also explained why Jake was in and out of Sharon\u2019s life. Every time he entered the United States, he was putting his freedom at risk.</p><p>Carolyn looked directly at the P.I. \u201cSusannah and I went to see an old schoolfriend of ours and Jake\u2019s. A woman called Sharon Nance. She claimed two things\u2014that Jake\u2019s visited her in Colville, and that Susannah\u2019s brother, Doug Leary, might\u2019ve been involved with him and...and the drug trafficking.\u201d</p><p>Shirl made a note in the file. \u201cLet me find out what I can about all of that.\u201d She straightened and leaned back in the chair. \u201cDid you learn anything else I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusannah interrupted an intruder in the house last night,\u201d Carolyn told her.</p><p>Susannah shrugged that off. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s connected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point, everything that happens is suspicious,\u201d the P.I. said, writing that down, too. \u201cWas anything taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA journal and some other papers. A clock and a pen. Of limited value to anyone other than family. Besides that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m staying in my mother\u2019s home,\u201d she explained, \u201cand I had several boxes packed up, waiting to be moved. Without going through each one, it\u2019s almost impossible to tell.\u201d Everything in those boxes was of sentimental value. There was nothing of real monetary worth, but the intruder wouldn\u2019t know that.</p><p>\u201cHas there been anything else out of the ordinary?\u201d Shirl asked.</p><p>Nothing had been ordinary since the day Susannah had come to Colville. \u201cI\u2019ve had an intruder on at least three other occasions. Again, the only things taken were personal\u2014some old track ribbons of my brother\u2019s, for instance.\u201d She paused. \u201cI told you about finding that signed contract between Jake\u2019s father and mine in Dad\u2019s files. That was what prompted me to hire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Carolyn bobbed her head. \u201cWe tried to locate Jake by ourselves but kept running into dead ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately I haven\u2019t had much success myself,\u201d the P.I. said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my daughter....\u201d On all fronts, this was the summer from hell. \u201cShe\u2019s linked up with...with a young man of questionable character who may be Jake Presley\u2019s son.\u201d Susannah couldn\u2019t prevent a deep sigh. \u201cThe reason I came back was to get my mother settled in assisted living, and Chrissie joined me here.\u201d</p><p>Shirl nodded sympathetically. \u201cCan you tell me about Jake and Doug\u2019s friendship?\u201d she asked next.</p><p>Not knowing how to answer, Susannah and Carolyn glanced at each other.</p><p>\u201cDoug and I were exchanging letters before he was killed,\u201d Carolyn began. \u201cLast night I read through them again in light of what we\u2019ve recently learned.\u201d</p><p>Susannah sat up straighter, hoping Carolyn had come upon some fact that would bring clarity to this whole sorry mess.</p><p>\u201cDoug never spelled it out for me, but reading between the lines I believe he was trying to help Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp him?\u201d Susannah cried. \u201cHelp him how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Carolyn murmured. \u201cWhat I suspect is that Jake got in over his head. We know now the FBI was on to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think he might\u2019ve said something to me,\u201d she said. Both her brother and Jake had written in the beginning. Jake had written frequently for a brief time, and then less and less and soon not at all.</p><p>\u201cHow do you want me to proceed?\u201d Shirl asked. \u201cI can keep looking for Jake Presley. With enough time and money, I can probably find him for you, if that\u2019s what you want. I can also look for a connection between your dead brother and Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, stop now,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cSharon Nance, our, uh, friend from school, says she has a phone number for Jake.\u201d What Sharon hadn\u2019t told her was that Jake was living under an assumed name, most likely in Canada. Her preoccupation with him had been emotionally as well as financially expensive. At every curve in the road, she was uncovering information she\u2019d rather not know, remnants of the past that shouldn\u2019t be exhumed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care anymore. Jake doesn\u2019t want to be found, and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m content to leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>When she returned from Spokane, Susannah wasn\u2019t surprised to discover that Chrissie was gone. Her daughter insisted she was moving to Colville. She\u2019d left no room for discussion; she\u2019d made up her mind and, as far as she was concerned, that was the end of it.</p><p>A quick check of Chrissie\u2019s bedroom revealed that her suitcase was still there. The last threat, when Susannah told Chrissie she couldn\u2019t live in the house after this summer, was a moot point. Apparently Troy had invited her to move in with him. Given no other option, she\u2019d accept his invitation, Chrissie said. Susannah wasn\u2019t about to let her daughter blackmail her. Unsure how to respond, Susannah decided to bide her time and visit her mother. She hoped Chrissie hadn\u2019t mentioned the possibility of staying in Colville to Vivian, who would like nothing better than having her granddaughter nearby.</p><p>When Susannah arrived at Altamira, Vivian was in her room watching television, transfixed by the screen. As usual, she had on a cooking program.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Her mother finally dragged her gaze away from the TV and a smile lit her face. \u201cJean, it\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More and more often, her mother had been calling Susannah by her aunt\u2019s name. Her dead aunt\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s Susannah.\u201d</p><p>Her mother frowned. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you up to talking for a few minutes?\u201d she asked, keeping her voice soft and patient.</p> <p>Vivian picked up the remote control and muted the television. Sitting back in her chair, she tilted her head to one side in anticipation. \u201cWhat would you like to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, can I ask you a few questions about Doug?\u201d This was hard.</p><p>Her mother blinked as if she didn\u2019t recognize the name. Then everything seemed to fall into place. Her eyes went liquid with grief, and a tear rolled down her cheek.</p><p>Susannah came to stand by her mother, bending to wrap one arm around her shoulders. \u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to bring up painful memories.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt happened a long time ago. I don\u2019t know how much I remember anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust answer what you can, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know about Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Doug.\u201d Her mother\u2019s short-term memory seemed to be declining, too. \u201cWas Doug in trouble when he died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d her mother repeated. \u201cWith whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe law.\u201d She kept her voice devoid of emotion, as if they were discussing something as mundane as the use of sea salt in a particular recipe.</p><p>\u201cDoug was a good boy. Everyone loved him.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing her father\u2019s penchant for keeping things from her mother, Susannah wondered how much she\u2019d known at the time, let alone what she recalled now.</p><p>\u201cNo mother should ever have to bury her son.\u201d Vivian grew quiet. She stared into the distance as if lost in memory. \u201cOh, Jean, I\u2019m so grateful you came to visit after Doug\u2019s funeral. Having you with me was all that kept me sane.\u201d</p><p>Again her mother had confused her with her aunt. Perhaps she resembled Jean more than she\u2019d realized. She patted her mother\u2019s hand. It would be impossible to get any information from her; it\u2019d been a mistake to try.</p><p>\u201cWho were Doug\u2019s friends?\u201d Susannah asked, making one last attempt. She crouched at her mother\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cThere was Ronny Pedderson.\u201d</p><p>Ron and Doug had been in Boy Scouts together, Susannah remembered.</p><p>\u201cRonny lives in Portland now. His mother told me all about him and his family. Doug never had a chance to marry.\u201d Fresh tears brimmed in her tired eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom, I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe and Scotty were good friends, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it anymore,\u201d Susannah murmured. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ask about Doug?\u201d Vivian was sobbing openly now. \u201cGeorge never let me talk about him, you know. Every time I brought up his name, he\u2019d get angry with me.\u201d She pulled a tissue from the pocket of her dress. \u201cI couldn\u2019t pretend we never had our son, but that was what George wanted. It was like everything gentle and good inside him died with Doug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were my only joy.\u201d Vivian lifted her hands to Susannah\u2019s face. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t get along with your father. I tried to make him see that his attitude hurt you both, but he wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please, let\u2019s not talk about it.\u201d Vivian was suddenly recalling things clearly, and that seemed even worse than her forgetfulness, because her memories brought pain.</p><p>Her mother nodded, sniffing a little.</p><p>Susannah left ten minutes later, filled with regrets. Every decision she\u2019d made this summer had created disastrous consequences. Restlessness had led her on this quest to find Jake; her need had become a foolish obsession. Now she was paying the price, and it was far too high. For everyone.</p><p>Sitting in her car, Susannah got out her cell phone and after the briefest of hesitations, called Joe at his office. He was with a patient, but Miranda, the receptionist, said he\u2019d contact her in about ten minutes.</p><p>Susannah parked in the shade at Colville City Park. The pool was at one end, with lawn and trees at the other. She sat and waited for Joe\u2019s call, watching mothers and young children at play, teenagers on bicycles, elderly couples strolling and holding hands.</p><p>Although she\u2019d been expecting the phone to ring, she was startled when it did.</p><p>Call display told her it was Joe\u2019s office. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, knowing this would be a difficult conversation.</p><p>\u201cI got your message.\u201d From his tone she could tell he was still upset with her.</p><p>Her nervousness made her stomach jumpy. \u201cI saw the private investigator this morning.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask for the results. He\u2019d said he didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t track down Jake and, frankly, I don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019ve been such an idiot. Joe, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cI\u2019ve made a terrible mess of everything, and...and now Chrissie\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Chrissie?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Susannah swallowed her tears and blurted out the ultimatum their daughter had given her. \u201cChrissie insists she\u2019s moving to Colville to take care of her grandmother and if we don\u2019t let her live in the house, then she\u2019ll move in with Troy Nance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Joe exploded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried sick about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her absolutely not, didn\u2019t you?\u201d The anger in Joe\u2019s voice was so unlike him, so out of character for her normally even-tempered husband. \u201cWhat the hell is going on over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I\u2019d talk to you about it. She\u2019s blackmailing us, Joe, and any argument I give her at this point will drive her straight into Troy\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><p>Joe was silent for a moment; he seemed to be mentally reviewing their options.</p><p>\u201cJoe, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She hadn\u2019t intended to tell him this way, but once she\u2019d heard her husband\u2019s voice, she couldn\u2019t stop herself.</p><p>\u201cHow should we handle the situation?\u201d she asked after a minute or so of silence.</p><p>\u201cI know Chrissie\u2019s close to your mother,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMaybe she really feels she can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s part of it, but I don\u2019t want her around Troy. It\u2019s not a good relationship.\u201d She bit her lower lip hard to keep from telling him that Troy was almost certainly Jake\u2019s son. No need to add fuel to that fire. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any visible means of support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means he\u2019s probably doing something illegal.\u201d</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t disagree. \u201cYou could talk to Chrissie, reason with her. She might listen to you,\u201d she told Joe.</p><p>\u201cShe stopped listening to me a long time ago,\u201d Joe said tersely.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let her quit college. Not only that, Troy Nance is completely wrong for her. This relationship could ruin her life.\u201d It didn\u2019t take much imagination to recognize trouble brewing. If Troy was a drug dealer, which everyone in town seemed to suspect, he could be arrested at any time, and Chrissie would be guilty by association.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you suggest?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve sent her home when she first showed up,\u201d Susannah muttered. \u201cI\u2019m the one to blame,\u201d she said wretchedly.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to cast blame,\u201d Joe said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019ve got to concentrate our efforts on Chrissie.\u201d</p><p>Susannah pressed her palm against her forehead, thrusting her fingers through her hair. She heard voices in the background. Joe said something she couldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cSuze, listen, I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but Joe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get back to my patient. I\u2019ll call you later, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The phone buzzed in her ear and Susannah shut it off. When she looked up, she noticed a couple in the park. She frowned as the man pushed the woman up against a tree and began to kiss her. His hands roved her body in what she could only describe as an X-rated manner; this display was completely out of place in public.</p><p>All of a sudden she recognized the man. Well, well, well. Darned if it wasn\u2019t Troy Nance\u2014with another woman. Susannah strained her eyes to be sure.</p><p>This was the perfect opportunity to show her daughter that Troy wasn\u2019t to be trusted. If Chrissie wasn\u2019t with him, which she most certainly was not, she was probably still at the house. All Susannah had to do was get her daughter, bring her to the park and let her see with her own eyes what kind of man Troy really was. Telling her would never work, since Chrissie wouldn\u2019t believe a word she said.</p><p>Starting the engine, Susannah barreled out of her parking spot and headed for the house, praying all the while that Chrissie was home.</p><p>Of course she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>Carolyn had dropped Susannah off at her mother\u2019s place after the trip to Spokane. From there, she\u2019d returned to the mill, where she called Kettle Falls Landscaping and left a message for Dave Langevin to get in touch. She wanted to ask him to come for dinner.</p><p>He\u2019d been to her house that one night, just that once, and it\u2019d been the sweetest, most romantic night of her life. She hadn\u2019t told Susannah much about their evening together. Carolyn didn\u2019t know how to explain that she\u2019d never felt more cherished. Yet Dave had hardly touched her.</p><p>Not for lack of wanting on either his part or hers. The attraction between them was explosive, and she knew his guardedness was no match for the pull he felt toward her.</p><p>Carolyn still had her own misgivings about an affair. By his own admission, Dave was a drifter. He\u2019d never said why he moved around as much as he did or the reason he\u2019d come to this area. Intensely private, he asked nothing of her, nor did he offer anything personal about himself. Nevertheless, she was drawn to him in a way she hadn\u2019t been drawn to any other man in years.</p><p>At the end of the workday, the whistle blew and the sound jolted Carolyn from her thoughts. Within minutes the men started out of the gates, their lunch buckets in their hands. Dave, too, would be getting off work and when he got back to the office he\u2019d receive her message. He didn\u2019t have a cell phone, otherwise she would\u2019ve contacted him directly.</p><p>But even if he did get the message, there was no way of knowing whether he\u2019d accept her invitation. She waited at the office for an extra half hour, wondering if he\u2019d get in touch with her there. When no call came, she decided to go home.</p><p>As she drove, Carolyn felt depressed. Needing a man in her life\u2014a particular man\u2014was an uncomfortable feeling. Dave had said that in the end he\u2019d hurt her, although that seemed to worry him more than it did Carolyn. She felt a sudden and unaccountable conviction that he wouldn\u2019t show. That he\u2019d already made his decision.</p><p>By seven she knew she was right. Barefoot and wearing red cotton capris and a sleeveless red-checkered shirt, she watered her garden, trying to focus on the sensual feel of the grass against her feet, the sun on her arms, the heavy scent of the old roses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two thick steaks sat on the kitchen counter, and the green salad made with lettuce from her garden and fresh tomatoes, green peppers and slivered carrots was in the refrigerator, ready for her green goddess dressing. The recipe had been her mother\u2019s and Carolyn hadn\u2019t prepared it in years.</p><p>Just as she was about to put everything away and make herself a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, she heard a vehicle traveling down her driveway. Walking around the house to the patio, she saw Dave\u2019s truck.</p><p>She watched as he climbed out, noticed that he\u2019d showered and changed clothes, wearing clean khakis and a black T-shirt. Standing beside his battered pickup, he didn\u2019t see her at first.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were coming,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He turned to her and his smile engulfed her. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was, either.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was racing. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, but I couldn\u2019t stay away.\u201d He moved toward her then, his steps making short work of the distance. When he reached her, it seemed the most natural thing in the world to walk directly into his arms. He embraced her, holding her close.</p><p>Carolyn raised her mouth to his and brushed his lips with her own. The kiss was moist and sweet and filled with longing. Dave lifted her braid and ran his fingers down the length of it.</p><p>He kissed her again, and again. Finally, with a reluctance that equaled her own, he released her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got steaks ready to grill,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to cook them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>They dined on the patio, drank wine with their meal and savored a second glass. They talked little. It was enough just to be together. As the sun set and the deer grazed in the meadow, they held hands. Every now and then, Dave would kiss her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never spent time with a woman like this,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain.\u201d He shook his head as if he hesitated to say more.</p><p>\u201cNo, tell me,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d he said.</p><p>An automatic protest rose to her lips, but she swallowed it and stood up with him. He kissed her, his arms tightening around her waist.</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s body ached for him and she knew he experienced the same intense desire.</p><p>His gaze held hers, in it she read pain and regret.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you that I own the mill?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, I wish you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The mill was part of who she was, her heritage. Bronson family blood flowed through that mill and she was the third generation to manage its operation. One day she\u2019d be forced to sell it because the Bronson line ended with her, but she wasn\u2019t ready to think about that yet. She had too many goals left to accomplish.</p><p>He shook his head again, unwilling to answer.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me that you\u2019re who you are,\u201d she said, knowing she sounded defensive. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt...it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She broke away from him and carried their empty plates into the kitchen.</p><p>Dave followed with the wineglasses. He took the dishes from her and set them on the counter. Carolyn\u2019s eyes locked with his and she nearly wept at the sadness she saw in him. Tentatively she raised her hand to his face. Her heart was pounding so hard, it felt loud enough to bring down the walls.</p><p>\u201cI knew this wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to tell myself I\u2019d do whatever was necessary to be with you. Damn the gossip, damn the speculation.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn was afraid of where this was leading. He was going to pull up stakes and leave Colville, and she couldn\u2019t bear it if he did. Her life had never felt empty until she\u2019d met him. Now the emptiness was there anytime he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Rather than allow him to continue speaking, she slipped her arms around his neck and brought his mouth down to hers. To her surprise and delight, she met with no resistance.</p><p>Dave took control of the kiss, his desire so strong it threatened to consume her. She grabbed his shirt collar, needing an anchor, something to hold on to while her senses went wild.</p><p>She gasped when Dave released her. They stood just inches from each other, their breathing harsh and ragged.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, Carolyn, I am who I am and you are who you are. I\u2019m basically an itinerant laborer, while you own the most important business in the area. I live in a second-hand camper, while you live here.\u201d He gestured around him. \u201cPeople will talk. They are already. You think there\u2019s anyone in Colville who doesn\u2019t know about us? They all do and the things they say are going to hurt you. I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gripped her shoulders to stop her. \u201cI\u2019ll put in my two-week notice tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Without a job, he\u2019d do what he\u2019d always done and simply drift away.</p><p>It seemed for a moment that he\u2019d reconsider, but then he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll find another job. Somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you support yourself until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have very few expenses. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who knows about us!\u201d</p><p>He touched her face gently. \u201cI care. I won\u2019t have you talked about around town.\u201d</p><p>She knew he meant what he said. Throwing her arms around his middle, she hugged him. \u201cI feel so selfish and guilty for wanting to be with you.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair and held her close. \u201cI want to be with you, too. I won\u2019t leave you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>She felt his smile against the side of her face. \u201cPromise,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>When the time came, she\u2019d let him go; she had no other choice. But she had to believe her love would draw him back.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>Wednesday morning, Susannah found herself wishing she could leave Colville, go home, be with her husband.</p><p>She\u2019d done a lot of thinking since she\u2019d talked to Joe. He\u2019d called again last night, and they\u2019d spoken for more than an hour. He\u2019d reminded her of her feelings earlier in the summer, of her restlessness. She\u2019d never divulged the dreams she\u2019d had about Jake and how the memories had returned, haunting her sleep and then later her conscience. As for Jake, she hadn\u2019t found him and didn\u2019t care if she ever did. He was probably living under an assumed name. It was much easier to create a false identity back in the early \u201970s than it was now.</p><p>Never had she thought that in seeking Jake, she would learn what she had about her brother\u2014if it was true. She still couldn\u2019t make herself believe Doug had been dealing drugs. That would have devastated her father. Devastated the entire family.</p><p>She could certainly visit the sheriff\u2019s office and ask a few questions. Although all of this happened more than thirty years ago, the county would have kept the records. Surely they\u2019d be online.</p><p>Not wanting to interrupt Carolyn at the mill, Susannah decided to use a computer at the library downtown. She left without speaking to Chrissie. Her daughter had come home late last night. Susannah hadn\u2019t said anything about seeing Troy with someone else; she\u2019d sit on that for a while and learn what she could about this other woman before confronting either Chrissie or Troy.</p><p>Susannah drove to the library and logged on to the Internet. However, even with the librarian\u2019s help, she wasn\u2019t able to get into the Colville sheriff\u2019s files.</p><p>Next she logged on to the local newspaper archives and did a name search for Jake Presley and found nothing. While she was there, she tried Doug\u2019s name; what came up was the article that reported his car accident. As she read it, tears filled her eyes.</p><p>If she\u2019d seen it years ago, she didn\u2019t remember. The newspaper said Doug\u2019s neck had been broken and he\u2019d died instantly. She breathed a sigh of relief that the car hadn\u2019t caught fire and burned. She hated the thought of anyone suffering that way. Self-consciously she reached for her purse and dug out a tissue.</p><p>Thanking the librarian for her help, Susannah left a few minutes later and crossed the street to the sheriff\u2019s office. The woman at the front desk, all too obviously watching the clock, seemed eager for her break.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Susannah said as she stepped up to the counter. The clerk was young and probably didn\u2019t remember her father, who\u2019d retired a number of years earlier.</p><p>The clerk looked up, glanced at the clock again, and frowned. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I\u2019d like to talk to someone about any charges filed against Doug Leary back in the early 1970s.\u201d She looked for any sign of recognition in the other woman\u2019s eyes but saw none.</p><p>\u201cWhen exactly?\u201d the clerk asked.</p><p>\u201c1973.\u201d</p><p>The woman shook her head, her short curls bouncing. \u201cAll paperwork before 1978 is stored in the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible to have someone get it for me?\u201d</p><p>The clerk stared at Susannah. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? We\u2019re already short-staffed with two people on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019ll be back soon, won\u2019t they?\u201d Susannah pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s got time to search through the archives unless it concerns a current investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has to do with my brother. He was killed in a car accident and I recently learned that he might\u2019ve been in some kind of trouble. I want to know what that was about.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, the clerk shook her head. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg Dalton was the sheriff in 1973, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d He\u2019d been a good friend of her dad\u2019s.</p><p>The clerk turned toward the wall, where a row of photographs was displayed. \u201cLooks like it. That was way before my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he still live in the area?\u201d</p><p>The clerk nodded and stood as another woman joined her. \u201cI believe so. I\u2019m taking my coffee break now. If you have any other questions I can call for a deputy\u2014if there\u2019s one handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>All Susannah needed to do was look in her mother\u2019s personal directory for the retired sheriff\u2019s address. He\u2019d played bridge with her father at least once a week for as long as Susannah could remember. She drove back to the house and, without too much difficulty, located the address\u2014Old River Road, a couple of miles out of town.</p><p>On the off-chance that he was home, Susannah drove there, then headed down the dirt driveway with the name Dalton printed on the rural route box. When she parked in front of the house, an older woman came to the screen door, holding it open. The house was small, the lawn green and well maintained. A creek flowed along the back of the property.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Dalton?\u201d Susannah asked as she climbed out of the car. She didn\u2019t recall her first name.</p><p>\u201cYes. Can I help you?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dalton was in her midseventies, a pleasant-looking woman with curled gray hair and a comfortably round figure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Susannah Leary. My married name is Nelson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusannah, of course. It\u2019s so good to see you! How\u2019s your mother doing? I wanted to get into town to visit after your father died, but I swear there just aren\u2019t enough hours in the day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Susannah smiled, and they exchanged a warm handshake. \u201cThank you.\u201d It was difficult to accept condolences even now; Susannah was never quite sure what to say. They exchanged pleasantries, and Mrs. Dalton invited her into the house.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if I asked Mr. Dalton a few questions?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cQuestions?\u201d the older woman repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve recently come across some information regarding my brother. You remember Doug, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, of course. I don\u2019t think your dear parents ever recovered from losing him.\u201d</p><p>Susannah swallowed hard.</p><p>Mrs. Dalton frowned. \u201cSusannah, I\u2019m afraid my husband\u2019s been ill for some time\u2014a heart condition. I don\u2019t want to overstress him.\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best not to.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dalton hesitated, as if gauging how much to trust her. Then she said, \u201cGreg\u2019s sitting out back, enjoying the sunshine. If you\u2019d care to join him, I\u2019ll bring us all something cool to drink.\u201d</p> <p>Susannah followed her into the kitchen, slid open the glass door and stepped onto the patio. Greg Dalton sat with his shoulders slumped forward and his hands on his lap, facing the creek. He appeared to be napping.</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t want to interfere with his rest, but when she reached for a chair, it made a slight scraping sound against the concrete. The old man\u2019s eyes opened and he glared at her accusingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Susannah told him. His eyes widened when she mentioned Doug\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cYou remember my parents, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy dad was Judge Leary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my brother? Doug died in a car accident many years ago.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dalton came outside carrying a tray with three glasses of pink lemonade. Susannah stood, taking the tray from her and setting it on the table.</p><p>\u201cWho was it you were asking about again?\u201d Mr. Dalton demanded.</p><p>\u201cDoug Leary,\u201d his wife returned. \u201cYou remember Doug, Judge Leary\u2019s boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you people would stop repeating yourselves. Yes, I remember Doug. He died\u2014what?\u2014thirty-some years ago.\u201d</p><p>Susannah caught Mrs. Dalton\u2019s grimace. \u201cWould you like some lemonade, Greg?\u201d</p><p>Her husband shook his head and closed his eyes, apparently resuming his nap.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mrs. Dalton said, \u201cbut I was afraid this would happen. Greg naps much of the day. Perhaps I can help you.\u201d</p><p>Susannah wished she hadn\u2019t come. She should\u2019ve left this alone. \u201cI moved Mom into an assisted-living complex,\u201d she explained, without discussing her mother\u2019s problems. She briefly described what she\u2019d unearthed that had led her to believe her brother might have been in some kind of legal trouble. Although it didn\u2019t seem possible, she explained, she wanted to check it out to be sure\u2014if she could. \u201cAs you\u2019ve probably guessed, all of this comes as a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was so long ago,\u201d Mrs. Dalton said uncertainly.</p><p>Susannah agreed. \u201cYou might remember I was in France that year. I\u2019m hoping to find out what I can about Doug and another friend I knew in high school by the name of Jake Presley.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dalton frowned sadly as she sat down next to Susannah. \u201cI don\u2019t remember much, but I do recall something about Doug. My goodness, my memory\u2019s bad. It just isn\u2019t what it used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cAny information you have would be appreciated.\u201d</p><p>The old sheriff woke suddenly. \u201cIt was a crying shame,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou remember what happened, Greg?\u201d his wife asked.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He scoffed at his wife. \u201cI\u2019m not likely to forget. Crying shame, that\u2019s what it was. I tried to help, but there wasn\u2019t a thing I could do. Those two young men stepped into a hornet\u2019s nest of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Susannah leaned closer, afraid any question she asked would break his train of thought.</p><p>\u201cDoug wasn\u2019t a bad boy. The other one, either. They got in over their heads and couldn\u2019t get out. They were in the wrong game\u2014hell, the wrong league\u2014for a couple of small-town boys. One of the players was an undercover agent. The two of \u2019em were in Idaho at the time and managed to get away. Problem is, they ran back to Colville and in the process crossed state lines. Once they did that, it became a federal crime.\u201d</p><p>Susannah wasn\u2019t clear on all the legalities. \u201cYou mean the local authorities\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Mr. Dalton said, cutting her off, \u201cthat they\u2019d be tried in a federal court with federal prosecutors. George was upset, very upset, and we talked it over. There was nothing I could do\u2014or him, either, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>Susannah shifted toward him. \u201cYou remember all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it was yesterday,\u201d the older man concurred. \u201cYour brother made a foolish mistake. His friend, too. Trouble like this wasn\u2019t just going to disappear. With the federal government involved, there wasn\u2019t much chance he\u2019d escape prosecution, despite his father being a judge.\u201d</p><p>Greg Dalton stared into the distance. \u201cI was the first one at the accident scene. He was already dead. Rammed into the tree. Smoke and steam coming from the engine. I pried open the driver\u2019s door and the boy slumped out, into my arms.\u201d The old man shook his head as if to say he didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.</p><p>\u201cGreg went to plenty of accident scenes over the years,\u201d Mrs. Dalton said in a low voice. \u201cBut Doug was the son of a good friend. He phoned me. In all his years of working as sheriff, that was the only time I\u2019ve seen my husband that distraught. He asked me to go and sit with Vivian while George identified the body.\u201d</p><p>A lump formed in Susannah\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cI think it nearly killed George to bury his only son,\u201d Mrs. Dalton added.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Susannah whispered. She stared down at her drink. She hadn\u2019t taken so much as a sip and doubted she could swallow if she did.</p><p>\u201cOut of respect for George and his position in the community, my husband did what he could to keep the federal charges out of the paper. The entire matter was as hush-hush as possible. Only a few people were aware of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what happened to Jake Presley?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dalton shook her head. \u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff cleared his throat and answered without opening his eyes. \u201cHe got away. Got clean away,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>This was what Susannah had suspected all along. She set down her glass.</p><p>\u201cDid I help you get the answers you need?\u201d the sheriff asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were most helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He dropped his chin against his chest, eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your time,\u201d Susannah said and got to her feet. \u201cIf I have any other questions, can I phone you?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dalton nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Susannah walked out to her car, surprised to find tears gathering in her eyes. She had the answers she needed, but they certainly weren\u2019t the ones she wanted.</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>Chrissie wasn\u2019t home when Susannah arrived, which was just as well. Her head was full of what she\u2019d learned and the idea of dealing with Chrissie right now overwhelmed her.</p><p>Although it\u2019d been hard to keep quiet, Susannah hadn\u2019t mentioned that she\u2019d seen Troy with another woman. It was doubtful that her daughter would believe her, anyway\u2014and definitely not without proof. Chrissie made her feel a sense of powerlessness that bordered on desperation.</p><p>The house was warm. After opening the front and back doors to create a breeze, she sat down in a garden chair and closed her eyes, trying to think everything through carefully.</p><p>She found herself drifting off to sleep under the shade of a pine. It was little wonder, considering that she was functioning on less than four hours from the night before and even less the night before that. Her mind was clouded with worries. What was wrong with her, anyway? She\u2019d always been levelheaded and sensible. It\u2019d all started last year, after her father died, but she\u2019d refused to believe Joe\u2019s theory that her depression was connected to his death. She was no longer sure of anything. Once she was home again, she hoped her life would return to normal.</p><p>Normal.</p><p>Normal meant that the way things seemed to be was also the way they were. No massive deceptions, no ugly secrets.</p><p>Normal would be a relief, despite her listlessness and her loss of enthusiasm.</p><p>Head back, eyes closed, Susannah could so easily picture the Jake of thirty years ago, dressed in his black leather jacket. Her heart sped up at that memory alone. As a girl, she\u2019d risked everything to be with him. Her parents would\u2019ve grounded her for life had they known how often she slipped out in the middle of the night. The garden was their favorite spot, hers and Jake\u2019s, especially the small rose arbor with its bench, hidden as it was from the house. He\u2019d called it Susannah\u2019s garden.</p><p>As sure as she drew breath, she\u2019d believed he loved her as deeply as she loved him. What he felt for her had been fleeting, however; she knew that now, and it stung. She\u2019d believed in him and the power of their love, which had felt invincible, especially that last night before she\u2019d flown to France.</p><p>Susannah had pleaded with her father, begged him not to send her away. She\u2019d wept and shrieked, but he\u2019d turned a deaf ear and insisted that one day she\u2019d thank him.</p><p>He\u2019d been wrong. She\u2019d never forgiven him for what he\u2019d done.</p><p>A car door slammed, and Susannah opened her eyes, her tranquility destroyed. She went to the front door as her daughter pranced toward the house, wearing tight blue jeans and a tighter top. Defiance flashed from her eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t stopping me, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d Susannah asked wearily, rubbing a hand across her eyes.</p><p>\u201cFrom moving to Colville. I already talked it over with Grandma and she wants me here. She said she\u2019d pay for my expenses until I can find a job. She needs me and I want to be here for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere we still discussing that?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter cast her a furious look. \u201cYou talked to Dad, didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s why he\u2019s on my case now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Did you want to tell him yourself? I hope I didn\u2019t ruin the surprise.\u201d She could be as sarcastic as her daughter when the occasion called for it.</p><p>Chrissie placed one hand on her hip and scowled. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>Susannah sighed audibly. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it would. So you\u2019re determined to do this, despite...\u201d She let her voice trail off.</p><p>\u201cDespite what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you aren\u2019t the only woman in Troy Nance\u2019s life.\u201d She was unable to stop herself. And once she started, she had to continue. \u201cI saw Troy in the park with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThat is so lame.\u201d</p><p>Susannah raised her shoulders in an elaborate shrug. \u201cThink what you want, but I know what I saw.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d do just about anything to keep me from seeing Troy, but I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him yourself,\u201d Susannah suggested, gesturing toward the kitchen phone.</p><p>Chrissie hesitated for a moment. \u201cFine, I will.\u201d She marched off with a righteousness fueled by certainty\u2014or at least the pretense of certainty.</p><p>Susannah followed her, curious to hear what Jake\u2019s son would say. And yes, she\u2019d reconciled herself to the truth of Sharon\u2019s claim that Jake was her son\u2019s father.</p> <p>Her back to the wall, Chrissie sat on the linoleum floor. She rested her face against her knees as she held the receiver to her ear. When Susannah entered the room, Chrissie raised her eyes, sparking with indignation.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said when Troy answered.</p><p>Susannah sat at the kitchen table and folded her arms, patiently waiting. Not for a second did she believe Troy Nance would tell the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t with someone else yesterday afternoon, were you?\u201d Chrissie asked, purring the question.</p><p>He took his time responding. Chrissie kept her eyes lowered, then something he said made her look up suddenly and glare at Susannah.</p> <p>\u201cAt the park,\u201d she said repeating his words. \u201cJenny Sandberg met you there.\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s stomach tensed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an old friend. Uh, huh. A good friend from high school. Uh, huh. You hadn\u2019t seen her in a while.\u201d Chrissie was echoing his responses for her mother\u2019s benefit, and Susannah sighed at her daughter\u2019s naivet\u00e9. Chrissie sounded so triumphant.</p><p>From the way Troy and this Jenny had been going at it, they were very good friends.</p><p>\u201cMom saw you and wondered,\u201d Chrissie said next. \u201cShe said you\u2019d lie to me and I said you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Not a word of that was true. All Susannah had suggested was that Chrissie ask Troy herself. She felt disturbed by the fact that these two were lying to each other, Chrissie no less than Troy.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I believe you,\u201d she insisted, continuing to glare at Susannah.</p><p>Unwilling to listen any longer, Susannah turned her back and walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I mind?\u201d Chrissie was saying. She lowered her voice. \u201cYes, I told her.\u201d</p><p>This apparently had to do with her daughter\u2019s moving.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any choice but to accept it,\u201d Chrissie said more loudly. \u201cI make my own decisions.\u201d</p><p>Susannah felt sick to her stomach. She went into the living room and sat down in the one remaining chair. A few minutes later, Chrissie left the kitchen, and started down the hallway to the bedrooms.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you talk to Dad?\u201d Susannah asked her. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon.\u201d Her daughter paused, not turning to face her. \u201cBut it\u2019s more important what Troy told me. He said my parents would do whatever they could to break us up and I should be prepared for that.\u201d</p> <p>Susannah arched her brows. \u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you just proved everything Troy said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was Troy. Fine, he was with another woman, an old friend. I\u2019m not the jealous type.\u201d</p><p>Susannah was far more interested in Joe\u2019s assessment of the situation than she was in Troy\u2019s. \u201cWhat did Dad say?\u201d She repeated her earlier question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate you running to him every time we disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve told Dad when I was ready.\u201d</p><p>Susannah straightened, worried now. \u201cChrissie, we need to work this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing you can say or do that\u2019s going to change my mind. You need to understand that I\u2019m an adult and I have the right to decide what I want. If it\u2019s any of your business, I love Troy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hardly even know him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know enough.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter was determined to make one of the biggest mistakes of her life.</p><p>Sick at heart, Susannah watched as Chrissie grabbed her purse and slammed out the door. A few minutes later, the distinctive roar of Troy\u2019s muffler and the blaring of his revved-up sound system rattled the windows. She looked outside to see Chrissie clambering into his truck.</p><p>The house was quiet again once her daughter had left. Susannah walked back to her room and sat on the edge of the bed, burying her face in her hands.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see the sheet of paper propped on her desk until she glanced up. Her eyes widened and she leaped up to seize it. Her breath caught in her throat as she read the message.</p><p>MEET ME IN THE CEMETERY AT 7 TONIGHT.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Carolyn asked, closing her truck door and trotting toward the house. Susannah waited on the front steps.</p><p>She had frantically phoned, not knowing who else to call after finding the note. Whoever had broken into the house must have left it; maybe she just hadn\u2019t noticed it last night. Why that person wanted to see her remained as much a mystery as everything else.</p><p>Carolyn joined her on the steps. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard you sound so panicky.\u201d</p><p>Susannah got up and led her inside, directly to her childhood bedroom. \u201cRead that,\u201d she said, pointing to the small desk where the message still lay.</p><p>Walking slowly into the room, Carolyn advanced toward the desk.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who wrote this?\u201d she asked, glancing over her shoulder at Susannah.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea.\u201d She\u2019d considered nothing else in the ten minutes it\u2019d taken Carolyn to drive into town.</p><p>Susannah sank down on the edge of the bed, her heart racing and her palms sweaty. She felt light-headed and realized she hadn\u2019t eaten since that morning. The thought of food, however, made her want to gag.</p><p>\u201cThe cemetery,\u201d Carolyn said. The mattress dipped as she sat down beside Susannah.</p><p>\u201cAt seven.\u201d Thankfully it would still be light then, although Susannah hadn\u2019t made a decision yet. Should she go? Or not? She tried to work out the consequences of each action.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it might be Jake?\u201d Carolyn asked in a hushed voice.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think who else it would be.\u201d Sharon had said she\u2019d get in touch with him; apparently she had.</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense,\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cWe now know why he left and, more importantly, why he didn\u2019t come back to Colville when you got home.\u201d</p><p>Shocking though it was, all this information about Jake\u2019s problems with the law explained a great deal. After her return from France, the only address he had would\u2019ve been the family home. Knowing what her father had already done to keep them apart, he might well have avoided any contact, for his own protection and hers. If, by chance, he had written, she could easily believe that George Leary had destroyed the letter.</p><p>\u201cJake must\u2019ve heard that you\u2019ve been looking for him,\u201d Carolyn suggested.</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cSharon told him. She said she would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding! I thought this was what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did at one time. Now...I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Indecision gripped her and she plowed her fingers into her hair. \u201cLife can get very complicated,\u201d she said with a beleaguered sigh.</p><p>\u201cIf it is Jake, he\u2019s taking a tremendous risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d If word of this got out, Jake would immediately be arrested and sent to jail. He could very well end up in a federal prison.</p><p>Feeling shaky, Susannah moved into the kitchen, followed by Carolyn. She put on water for a pot of tea.</p><p>\u201cYou look pale,\u201d Carolyn commented. \u201cYou\u2019re really worried about this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the note, it\u2019s Chrissie, too,\u201d Susannah said, dropping teabags into the two mugs still unpacked. \u201cI saw Troy with someone else yesterday afternoon and confronted Chrissie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t go well?\u201d</p><p>Susannah snickered. \u201cYou could say that. I have no idea what Chrissie sees in him. I wish I trusted her judgment, but I don\u2019t.\u201d What bothered Susannah most was that she recognized how easy it would be to treat her daughter the same way her father had treated her. In fact, Chrissie\u2019s accusations were an eerie echo of the things she\u2019d said to her own father. Here it was\u2014her youthful rebellion staring her in the face, as though her teenage self was being channeled through her daughter. Susannah had a glimpse of the frustration her father must have felt. Even worse, even more ironic, the man in question was Jake\u2019s son....</p><p>The whistle blew as the water on the stove reached a boil. Susannah filled the mugs and set them aside to steep.</p><p>\u201cWould you go with me?\u201d Susannah asked. \u201cThe note didn\u2019t say anything about going alone.\u201d The prospect of going at all filled her with a mixture of excitement and guilt\u2014the guilt because she\u2019d be keeping this secret from Joe.</p><p>One meeting. Just one. She\u2019d apologize for her father\u2019s behavior and leave it at that. The only other thing she needed to do was obtain some assurance that despite her father, Jake had had a good life. With all her heart, she wanted him to be happy. She\u2019d ask about Troy, too; perhaps he had some influence with his son. Yes, Jake might be able to help her.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to go with you?\u201d Carolyn shook her head. \u201cEven if the note didn\u2019t say anything about it, I\u2019m sure he expects you to go by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d Susannah said reluctantly. \u201cHe\u2019d probably figure it\u2019s safer for him if I\u2019m there alone.\u201d</p><p>Susannah removed the teabags and took a carton of milk from the refrigerator. \u201cI find the cemetery a curious choice, don\u2019t you? Like those Gothic romances we read in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Carolyn agreed, stirring milk into her tea. \u201cThe ones with the heroine on the cover, wearing a nightgown and holding a candle. It\u2019s always dark and there\u2019s usually a cliff.\u201d</p><p>Susannah smiled. \u201cAnd she\u2019s following the directions of an anonymous note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA note that leads her to the cemetery,\u201d Carolyn said with a grin. \u201cPerhaps this is Jake\u2019s way of telling you the relationship is dead.\u201d</p><p>They both sat at the kitchen table. Susannah suspected he\u2019d chosen the site because it was unlikely they\u2019d run into anyone who might recognize him at the graveyard. She told Carolyn this and they both laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cDead men don\u2019t tell tales.\u201d</p><p>Briefly, Susannah wondered how many other chances Jake had taken over the years, risking imprisonment by coming down to the States. She assumed he\u2019d come back for Sharon or perhaps she\u2019d occasionally gone to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you can do this alone?\u201d Carolyn asked worriedly. \u201cI\u2019d offer to wait at the entrance but he hasn\u2019t said where you\u2019re supposed to meet him. It might be right at the gates, and if that\u2019s the case, he might disappear if he sees me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Anyway, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She would tell Joe about it, she resolved. Her husband deserved to know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here at the house until you get back,\u201d Carolyn said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Someone needs to know where you are. Besides, I\u2019m dying of curiosity.\u201d She giggled then, sounding just as she had in high school.</p><p>At twenty minutes to seven, Susannah took time to freshen her makeup and brush her hair. Her nerves were on edge and she considered changing clothes, wearing something more feminine than her jeans and black cotton sweater. She examined herself in the hallway mirror, sucking in her stomach. No doubt about it, she wasn\u2019t seventeen anymore, but then Jake wasn\u2019t, either.</p> <p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d she asked, twirling around for Carolyn to comment.</p><p>\u201cYou want the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Susannah had already decided it must be bad. She tucked her hair behind her ears and realized she was trembling.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to throw up.\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, Susannah admitted, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I feel.\u201d</p> <p>The phone rang, startling her. Susannah moved toward the kitchen with leaden feet, almost afraid to answer.</p><p>It rang again.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to pick it up?\u201d Carolyn asked after the third ring.</p><p>Susannah\u2019s instincts said to ignore it, but too much was at stake and she reached for the receiver just before the answering machine clicked on.</p><p>\u201cLeary residence,\u201d she announced stiffly.</p><p>\u201cIs this Susannah Nelson?\u201d a crisp female voice asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I caught you. This is Michelle Larson from Altamira. I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but your mother\u2019s taken a bad fall. We\u2019re transferring her to Memorial Hospital.\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s heart leapt into her throat. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure. It looks like she\u2019s broken her hip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to our records, you have power of attorney. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d If they were asking Susannah this, it probably meant her mother was unconscious.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need you to sign the forms at the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in five minutes.\u201d Susannah banged down the phone and automatically headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cSusannah!\u201d Carolyn raced after her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mom. She\u2019s fallen\u2014they\u2019re taking her to the hospital.\u201d She scrawled a note for Chrissie, scooped up her purse from the hall table and had just opened the door when Carolyn stopped her again.</p><p>\u201cWhat about meeting Jake?\u201d</p><p>For a fleeting second, Susannah had completely forgotten. \u201cYou go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Carolyn flattened her hand against her chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any choice. Mom needs me.\u201d She hated to ask this of Carolyn, but there was no one else.</p><p>Slowly, her friend nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you,\u201d Susannah said, and rushed out the front door.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Carolyn said, following her. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>The gate leading into Calvary Cemetery was closed.</p><p>\u201cOh, great,\u201d Carolyn muttered as she parked the car on the road and climbed out. There was space enough for her to squeeze through and walk onto the cemetery grounds, which she did.</p><p>Glancing around, she searched the area for any other parked vehicles and saw none. Being in a cemetery by herself was a little...well, scary\u2014even if she wasn\u2019t a woman who scared easily. The note hadn\u2019t told Susannah exactly where she should meet Jake\u2014or whoever her mysterious visitor was. Although Calvary Cemetery didn\u2019t have extensive grounds, it was large enough to hide in if someone wished not to be seen.</p><p>With her arms hugging her middle, Carolyn marched down the center of the paved roadway. The most logical place to wait, she supposed, was George Leary\u2019s grave. After a quick search, she located it. His marble tombstone noted his birthdate and the day he died and nothing else. Like her own father, he\u2019d been a frugal man. Any added adornments, any words of comfort\u2014a quote or a Psalm\u2014were not desired.</p><p>Sighing, Carolyn looked up. The cemetery was dead silent. Carolyn grimaced at her unintended pun. No one, not even the groundskeeper, was anywhere in sight. There didn\u2019t appear to be any other visitors.</p><p>\u201cThis could be a very long night,\u201d she mused aloud, checking her watch. Five to seven.</p><p>Pacing up and down the row of tombstones, she glanced at her watch repeatedly. Each minute seemed to drag interminably. This was obviously a waste of time and she grew disheartened.</p><p>Walking over to the site where her own parents had been laid to rest, she crouched down and ran her hand over the large marble headstone. She\u2019d last visited only a few days ago. The flowers she\u2019d brought for them, for Lily and for Doug had gone limp by now and been removed.</p><p>Many of the grave sites were adorned with artificial flowers. She preferred a fresh-cut bouquet from the garden her mother had planted all those years ago. It seemed a fitting gesture.</p><p>By seven-thirty, she knew Jake wasn\u2019t coming. He\u2019d probably seen her waiting and decided not to make an appearance. He didn\u2019t trust Carolyn, and there was no reason he should. She assumed he wasn\u2019t willing to risk his freedom for the opportunity to meet with her. It was Susannah or no one.</p><p>To be on the safe side, Carolyn waited another fifteen minutes, then returned to her truck. She hated to be the bearer of disappointing news but there was no help for it.</p><p>When she got back to the house, she noticed that Susannah\u2019s car wasn\u2019t parked outside, which meant she was still at the hospital. Not bothering to park, she drove directly to Memorial.</p><p>The hospital, a three-story brick building two blocks north of Colville City Park, was the tallest structure in the county and the pride of Colville. Carolyn had only been five or six at the time of the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and she remembered every detail. The high school band had played and there\u2019d been a tour of the facilities that included cookies and juice for the kids. That, in particular, had made an impression on her.</p><p>She parked and walked into the hospital foyer. The volunteer at the information desk directed her to the second floor, where Carolyn found Susannah in the small waiting room.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your mother?\u201d she asked, joining her friend.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in surgery.\u201d Susannah chewed on the end of her fingernail. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad break\u2014her bones are fragile and the doctor said he might end up doing an entire hip replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d That kind of surgery wouldn\u2019t be easy on a woman of Vivian\u2019s age.</p><p>\u201cDid he show up?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>Carolyn shook her head.</p><p>Susannah shrugged. \u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d hoped?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again.</p><p>Carolyn knew her friend had mixed feelings regarding this meeting, so perhaps his not showing was just as well.</p><p>\u201cYou feel someone\u2019s been in the house several times recently, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cAnd some things have been taken.\u201d She pressed her lips together. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anymore that these were random thefts, although at least one was made to look that way. It had to be Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps he\u2019s hiding in the area. He might\u2019ve come to the house, hoping to see you, and then realized you weren\u2019t staying there alone. He couldn\u2019t compromise himself by letting Chrissie see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Susannah paused as she considered this possibility.</p><p>Everything was beginning to add up for Carolyn, and she guessed that the end of her friend\u2019s search was near. Susannah was paying the private investigator to track Jake down, but all this time he\u2019d been practically under their noses.</p><p>Carolyn sat down on one end of the sofa and reached for a magazine\u2014a six-month-old issue of Reader\u2019s Digest. It was hard to wait alone and although Susannah didn\u2019t appear interested in conversation, Carolyn had no intention of leaving her.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d They could hear Chrissie\u2019s high-pitched voice from the elevator lobby.</p><p>So this was Susannah\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cChrissie!\u201d Susannah dashed out of the room, and Carolyn watched as mother and daughter hugged.</p><p>\u201cIs Grandma okay?\u201d Chrissie demanded, tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou got my note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014how\u2019s Grandma?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cGrandma\u2019s in surgery, but it seems to be going well.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Grandma.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn put aside the Reader\u2019s Digest and stood. Now that Chrissie was here with her mother, she wasn\u2019t really needed.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it happen?\u201d Chrissie seemed to be badly shaken.</p><p>\u201cI talked briefly to the nurse from Altamira. She stopped by the hospital and explained that Mom had been playing pool with one of the other residents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPool?\u201d Carolyn repeated incredulously.</p><p>A quick smile curved Susannah\u2019s mouth. \u201cMom was using her cane as a pool cue and lost her balance. She broke her hip, but Michelle, the nurse, seems to think she also hit her head on the edge of the pool table when she went down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Chrissie covered her mouth in horror.</p><p>\u201cWhoever she was playing with was extremely upset and had to be sedated.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn knew Susannah hoped her mother would adjust to life in the assisted-living complex. In the beginning Vivian had been full of complaints; lately Susannah hadn\u2019t said much about her mother\u2019s dissatisfaction. It seemed to Carolyn that if Vivian was socializing with the other residents, that was surely a good sign. Now this.</p><p>\u201cI think I should go back home,\u201d Carolyn said, preparing to leave.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014forgive my bad manners. Carolyn, this is my daughter, Chrissie. And Chrissie\u2014this is one of my best friends in the whole world, Carolyn Bronson.\u201d Chrissie murmured a polite hello, but Carolyn saw the speculative look on her face.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d Susannah said fervently as Carolyn started to leave.</p><p>\u201cWhat are friends for?\u201d she teased.</p><p>They hugged goodbye and Carolyn left the hospital. It\u2019d grown dark\u2014not surprising since it was now ten o\u2019clock. On the off-chance that Jake might have shown up after all, she drove past Calvary Cemetery, which was in the opposite direction of where she needed to go. Just as she\u2019d expected, the cemetery gates remained closed and there wasn\u2019t a car in sight.</p><p>Turning around, she drove back into town, reversing her route to get home. The evening was hot and humid. Carolyn preferred not to use her air-conditioning, so she kept the windows down. As always, she breathed in the scent of fresh-cut wood as she neared the mill, savoring it. Huge stacks of timber filled the yard, the sprinklers spraying them with water.</p><p>Carolyn wished she had a way of reaching Dave; she would\u2019ve liked to talk to him, tell him what had happened. That wasn\u2019t possible, though, and she told herself not to count on his presence. He\u2019d be leaving town soon. Leaving her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once past the city\u2019s outskirts and the mill, she increased her speed, but was quickly passed by another vehicle, driving well above the posted limit. She recognized the truck\u2014and its driver\u2014almost right away.</p><p>It was Troy Nance, and he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s headlights revealed two people in the truck\u2019s cab. The passenger was a woman with short blond hair, her head resting on Troy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Earlier Susannah had mentioned seeing Troy with someone else. A blonde, she\u2019d said. Not that it was any of her business, but Carolyn was curious. Maintaining a discreet distance, she followed Troy to the Roadside Inn. He parked, and the moment the blonde climbed out of the cab, it was abundantly clear that they were more than friends.</p> <p>While Chrissie waited at the hospital for word on her grandmother\u2019s condition, Troy was out with some other woman.</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>\u201cDoes Dad know about Grandma?\u201d Chrissie asked, sitting down on the waiting-room sofa.</p><p>Susannah shook her head. She\u2019d tried to reach him but Joe wasn\u2019t home and apparently he\u2019d turned off his cell phone. She\u2019d left a message, and that was all she could do for now.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should tell him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll call as soon as he gets my message.\u201d She took out her cell, then noticed the sign on the wall warning against the use of cell phones in the hospital. Luckily there was a pay phone down the hall. Chrissie walked with her and stood by while Susannah called collect. Brian answered and accepted the charges.</p><p>\u201cHidy, ho,\u201d Brian sang. \u201cHow come you\u2019re calling collect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. Is your dad home yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Apparently her son hadn\u2019t listened to the message.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to your dad,\u201d she said without explaining.</p><p>Her son asked, \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p> <p>Susannah lowered her gaze and tried not to look at Chrissie, who was examining her like a biology specimen under the microscope. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d And it would be once she spoke to Joe. He was her touchstone, and she needed him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Joe?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom, hold on, I hear him in the garage. He was at some get-together with his dentist friends.\u201d Brian put down the phone with a clatter.</p><p>Susannah could hear her son talking in the background, and a minute later, Joe picked up.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said softly, loving him so much she wanted to weep. This time apart was wearing on her, wearing on him, too. \u201cMom fell and broke her hip,\u201d she said without preamble.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Joe asked, immediately concerned.</p><p>\u201cChrissie and I are at the hospital. Mom\u2019s in surgery now....\u201d Susannah\u2019s voice faltered.</p><p>\u201cSusannah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe might need to have a hip replacement.\u201d Stifling a sob, she waited a moment before continuing. \u201cJoe, she hit her head on a pool table, of all things, and was knocked unconscious. Altamira took care of everything. I can\u2019t imagine what might\u2019ve happened if she\u2019d been at home or by herself.\u201d These scenarios had played through Susannah\u2019s mind ever since she\u2019d arrived at the hospital.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to come over and be with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Susannah knew how difficult it was for him to get away at the last minute. \u201cI...I think it\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019ll have a better idea once Mom\u2019s out of surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Needless to say, the more notice I have, the better, but I\u2019ll leave right now if you want me to.\u201d</p><p>His willingness to drop everything for her touched Susannah. She wanted him to know how much she appreciated this, appreciated him, yet all she managed to choke out was a simple, \u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you need? Anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She felt oppressed by her worries\u2014Vivian, the situation with Jake, the revelations about Doug, the conflict with Chrissie. Susannah was tired, so tired of feeling responsible for all of it. Tired of making decisions\u2014and mistakes.</p><p>Soon afterward, the surgeon appeared, still in his green surgical gown. He explained what he\u2019d done and the anticipated outcome. Her mother would likely spend several days in the hospital recuperating, and would be temporarily moved to a nursing home, where she\u2019d receive the care she needed. Progress would be slow, but Vivian had come through the ordeal well.</p><p>Relieved by the news, Susannah and Chrissie drove back to the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came to the hospital,\u201d Susannah told her daughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I did, too,\u201d Chrissie said. \u201cWhen I read your note, I freaked. Troy drove me to the hospital, thank God. I asked him to come in with me, but he says he can\u2019t stand the smell.\u201d</p><p>Susannah bit the inside of her lip to keep from commenting. If Troy loved Chrissie as much as she believed, then wouldn\u2019t he want to be with her?</p><p>\u201cI hate the thought of Grandma in pain,\u201d Chrissie added. \u201cI don\u2019t think I realized how much I love her until I found out she\u2019d been hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d But bad as it was, the accident could have been so much worse.</p><p>The house was dark and quiet when they got home. Chrissie immediately turned on the hallway lights, and they both listened, breath held, for any alien sounds. There was nothing. The only thing out of the ordinary was a real estate business card tucked in the screen door; this was the third one. She was nowhere close to getting the house on the market. Susannah tossed the card, as she had the others, annoyed by the aggressiveness of the agents.</p><p>She hurried to her bedroom and surveyed it carefully, looking, she supposed, for another message from Jake. He couldn\u2019t possibly know what had kept her away from their meeting.</p><p>\u201cMom, Carolyn\u2019s on the phone,\u201d Chrissie yelled from the kitchen.</p><p>Susannah hadn\u2019t even heard it ring.</p><p>\u201cI understand you just got in,\u201d Carolyn said when she answered. \u201cHow\u2019s your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine. She\u2019s out of surgery and in recovery. The hospital said they\u2019d phone if there was any change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d When Susannah murmured her thanks, Carolyn said, \u201cListen, I know this is absolutely none of my business, but I saw Troy Nance on my way home. He\u2019s out at the Roadside Inn and he isn\u2019t alone, if you catch my drift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was an hour ago, so I can\u2019t promise he\u2019s still there.\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s eyes swung toward her daughter and then to the digital readout on the microwave. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie quickly noticed that the conversation somehow concerned her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Carolyn tell you?\u201d she burst out the instant Susannah replaced the receiver.</p><p>\u201cWould you be interested in a short drive?\u201d Susannah asked instead. She wouldn\u2019t mention what Carolyn had said unless or until it was necessary.</p><p>\u201cA drive, this time of night?\u201d Chrissie stared at her skeptically.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fooling me, Mom. This has something to do with Troy, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d She got her purse and car keys and, without waiting for Chrissie, walked out the door.</p><p>Chrissie seemed about to stay behind, but after a moment stomped out to the car, resembling nothing so much as a pouting eight-year-old.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d she muttered when she climbed in beside Susannah.</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d Susannah inserted the key and started the engine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving to Colville to be with Troy and to help Grandma, and nothing you say is going to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said a word,\u201d Susannah told her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Chrissie gazed out the side window at the darkened street.</p><p>Silently they drove to the Roadside Inn. Susannah nearly clapped her hands with delight when she saw Troy\u2019s truck in the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this supposed to prove?\u201d Chrissie demanded when Susannah parked next to it.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I feel like a drink. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please....\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you go in on your own. I can wait here.\u201d Susannah leaned back in her seat, feigning a relaxed position.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect me to find?\u201d</p><p>Acting innocent, Susannah shrugged. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. Why don\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see here, so let\u2019s just go home. Troy and I had a long talk this afternoon, after you tried to discredit him. He doesn\u2019t like his women jealous. He said I was his girlfriend, and if I didn\u2019t believe that, I shouldn\u2019t be in his life.\u201d</p><p>Susannah sighed as if bored. \u201cCheck it out,\u201d she said and gestured toward the tavern.</p><p>Without responding, Chrissie got out of the car and slammed the door.</p><p>Susannah winced at the anger in her daughter. All she could do now was wait\u2014and hope that Chrissie would actually see what should be right in front of her face.</p><p>Five agonizing minutes passed before the tavern door opened. Out strolled Troy and Chrissie, arms entwined around each other.</p><p>Troy yanked open the passenger door and leaned inside the car. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a real problem, Mrs. Nelson,\u201d he said, shaking his head sadly. \u201cWhy are you so paranoid? Chrissie\u2019s the only one for me.\u201d He glared at her in unmistakable challenge. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d Turning, he bestowed a smile on Chrissie.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she reiterated. \u201cMy mother isn\u2019t going to break us up. I won\u2019t let her.\u201d</p><p>Great, just great. Susannah had gambled and lost. Now she just looked vindictive in Chrissie\u2019s eyes\u2014vindictive, unreasonable and, as Troy had said, paranoid.</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>In the morning, the first thing Susannah did was phone the hospital to check on her mother\u2019s condition, which had improved. After she\u2019d spoken to the nurse, she made a pot of coffee, desperate for a caffeine boost.</p><p>Chrissie hadn\u2019t said a word to her during the entire ride home from the Roadside Inn. She sat there, arms crossed, shoulders back and her chin tilted as if being in such close proximity to her mother was more than she could endure.</p><p>Now, sitting at the kitchen table drinking her coffee, Susannah wondered if her daughter\u2019s attitude had softened. She didn\u2019t have to wait long to find out.</p><p>At eight, Chrissie came out of her bedroom, fully dressed. She entered the kitchen and stopped abruptly when she saw Susannah.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Susannah said in a neutral voice.</p><p>Her daughter ignored her.</p><p>\u201cChrissie, listen, this has got to end.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter scowled defiantly in her direction. \u201cIt\u2019s my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you obviously don\u2019t know,\u201d she muttered. \u201cTroy and I are in love.\u201d</p><p>That made Susannah feel like gagging. \u201cYou met him less than two weeks ago!\u201d</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t want to argue. Then why are you starting off the day doing exactly that? You undermine every decision I make. Nothing I say or do satisfies you\u2014or Dad, either. I\u2019m constantly under your thumb and I hate it. I hate school. Meeting Troy\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to me. And now you want to take him away from me, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTroy isn\u2019t the right man for you,\u201d Susannah began.</p><p>\u201cYou never even gave him a chance.\u201d Chrissie\u2019s voice quavered, and she sounded close to tears.</p><p>Susannah drew in her breath and slowly counted to ten before responding. \u201cGive me one reason I should like Troy,\u201d she said as calmly as she could.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love him,\u201d Chrissie insisted, her hands in tight fists at her sides.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t a valid response in Susannah\u2019s opinion. She tried to point out some of his more blatant faults, in the hope that Chrissie would understand her position.</p><p>\u201cTroy doesn\u2019t have a job, he\u2019s irresponsible, and on top of that he\u2019s too old for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please...\u201d</p><p>According to Carolyn, Troy was around thirty, but as Susannah had discovered, he had the maturity of a teenager. Little wonder, she thought darkly, that the two of them got along so well.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter if he worked or not,\u201d Chrissie countered. \u201cYou\u2019d make up an excuse to hate him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate Troy.\u201d Susannah didn\u2019t understand why it was so hard to talk to her daughter. Why wasn\u2019t Chrissie capable of seeing any point of view except her own?</p><p>Chrissie threw up her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible!\u201d</p><p>Susannah felt the same way about her. Her daughter hadn\u2019t been the easiest child in the world; that stubborn, willful streak had shown up at the age of two and grown stronger every year.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk to you anymore.\u201d Chrissie bolted from the room, forgoing her usual morning coffee.</p><p>With a heavy heart, Susannah sat at the table, her emotions tangled. It didn\u2019t seem very long ago that she\u2019d had the identical argument with her father over Jake. The results had been disastrous, and her relationship with him had been forever ruined. She didn\u2019t want that to happen between her and Chrissie. At the same time, she had a whole new appreciation of how her father must have felt toward Jake. Yes, he was a hellion and he\u2019d had a juvenile record, but it had been expunged at age eighteen. She\u2019d believed she was helping him straighten out his life, make a fresh start. But Susannah no longer knew if her faith in Jake would\u2019ve been borne out in later years.</p><p>Her arguments with her father could\u2019ve been Chrissie\u2019s arguments with her. It was a shocking realization, and although she now had a glimmer of her father\u2019s reasons\u2014whether they were right or wrong\u2014she saw that he\u2019d made a critical mistake. George Leary hadn\u2019t given Jake an opportunity to prove himself. He\u2019d been quick to find fault, eager to dismiss him as unfit for his precious daughter, despite the fact that Susannah loved him. Everything he\u2019d said and done had only driven her closer to Jake.</p> <p>Susannah refused to repeat those mistakes.</p><p>Swallowing her pride, she walked down the hallway to Chrissie\u2019s bedroom and knocked politely on the door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d her daughter asked distractedly, as if it could be any one of ten different people.</p><p>Susannah rolled her eyes. \u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie jerked the door open, keeping her hand on the knob, implying that with one wrong word, she\u2019d slam it shut. \u201cWhat are you going to tell me now? That I\u2019m too young to know what I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cYou\u2019re right\u2014I haven\u2019t given Troy a chance.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s eyes narrowed as though she expected this to be a trick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to make him feel welcome the next time I see him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will?\u201d Chrissie still sounded skeptical, but was visibly mollified. \u201cHe\u2019s really a great guy, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you love him, then he must be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love him. Troy\u2019s wonderful. He knows everyone in town, and everyone knows him. We can\u2019t go anywhere without people coming up and talking to him.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter was crazy about this guy because he was popular? The urge to walk away in disgust nearly overpowered her. The reason everyone was Troy\u2019s friend was that he was the local drug dealer. She suspected these so-called friends were looking for a hit of whatever Troy sold. Once again, Susannah was disappointed that her daughter could be so blind.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to invite him to dinner tonight? We can order pizza and chat for a while.\u201d If Chrissie saw that she was making a serious effort, maybe, just maybe, her eyes would be opened to the truth about Troy.</p><p>Chrissie smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ll ask, but you know, Mom, Troy isn\u2019t the kind of guy who enjoys sitting around the table and shooting the breeze.\u201d She offered her a tentative smile. \u201cBut I\u2019ll ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be offended if he refuses. All I really want is for him to know I\u2019m trying.\u201d In truth, Susannah would be grateful if he declined. She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d be able to keep her mouth shut for more than five minutes.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said as graciously as she could.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Grandma this morning?\u201d</p><p>Susannah repeated what the nurse had told her earlier.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I\u2019d go to the hospital and see her,\u201d Chrissie said.</p><p>Susannah would\u2019ve liked to go with her, but the home security company Joe had contacted was scheduled to install the burglar alarm between eight and twelve. \u201cTell her I\u2019ll be up this afternoon, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll know more about her condition after the doctor visits,\u201d Susannah said, unable to conceal her worry.</p><p>\u201cI can stay with her until he does and then report back to you,\u201d Chrissie said.</p><p>Susannah could see that her daughter was trying, too, and she appreciated it. \u201cThat would be great. Thanks, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Soon afterward, Chrissie left for the hospital, driving Susannah\u2019s car. Susannah returned to the kitchen to finish her coffee and gave herself an A for effort. Had her father done half as much, it might have changed the course of both their lives.</p><p>Chrissie had been gone only ten or fifteen minutes when the doorbell chimed. Susannah had begun to pack away pots and pans in the kitchen. She abandoned the carton she was working on and got up, assuming the home security people had arrived early.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t the service company. Troy Nance stood on the doorstep, wearing a stained T-shirt, jeans and motorcycle boots. His hair was pulled back in a ponytail. He was Jake\u2019s son; she was sure of it. She saw the resemblance more and more.</p><p>\u201cHello, Troy.\u201d Susannah did her best to sound friendly and welcoming. If he was surprised, it didn\u2019t show. \u201cChrissie\u2019s at the hospital visiting her grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she told me. You\u2019re the one I wanted to talk to.\u201d</p><p>Susannah faltered a moment but recovered quickly. \u201cOkay.\u201d She held open the screen door, but he ignored the invitation to come inside.</p><p>\u201cOut here.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and followed him down the steps to the walkway. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked, folding her arms.</p><p>\u201cChrissie phoned and said you\u2019d had a change of heart about me.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t entirely true, but she\u2019d keep her opinions to herself\u2014for now. \u201cThanks for coming by, Troy.\u201d She wondered why he was here.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His eyes were like chips of ice.</p><p>\u201cWhat will it take for the two of us to be friends?\u201d she asked, moving forward.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like me,\u201d he sneered, \u201cand pretending you do isn\u2019t going to help, so let\u2019s get that straight up-front.\u201d</p><p>At least they both knew where they stood. \u201cI\u2019m willing to try,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>Nothing less than the truth would satisfy him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my daughter over you.\u201d</p><p>He let the comment hang for a few moments and then smiled as if her answer had pleased him. \u201cI might be able to help you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be good,\u201d Susannah said, grateful they\u2019d been able to find common ground.</p><p>He paced to the end of the walk, then turned on his heel. \u201cChrissie said if you don\u2019t let her stay in the house\u2014\u201d he gestured at the front door \u201c\u2014she\u2019d move in with me.\u201d He paused. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>Susannah wanted to hug him, she was so thankful.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told her, of course, but I figured you weren\u2019t that thrilled about the idea yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact is, Chrissie\u2019s a bit of a drama queen.\u201d</p><p>Susannah sighed. \u201cShe does have a tendency to overreact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s spoiled, too.\u201d</p><p>Again Susannah didn\u2019t have much of an argument, although she recognized how odd it was to be discussing her daughter\u2019s flaws with this man. The man Chrissie thought she loved...She studied him carefully. \u201cIs there something you\u2019re trying to tell me?\u201d</p><p>His mouth curled into a sarcastic half smile. \u201cSo you finally caught on, did you?\u201d His cold eyes met hers. \u201cIf I asked, Chrissie would move in with me like that.\u201d He snapped his fingers as if she needed a demonstration.</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d she said curtly.</p><p>\u201cYou just asked what it would take for the two of us to be friends, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded warily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored with Chrissie,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cShe isn\u2019t much fun and she makes too many demands, but I could easily string her along\u2014for however long it took.\u201d</p><p>A chill raced down Susannah\u2019s arms. \u201cHowever long what took?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Susannah frowned, not sure she understood.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your daughter\u2019s happiness worth to you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could make her happy or I could break her heart. You choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Susannah could feel the outrage rising inside her. This had to be a distasteful joke, although she certainly wasn\u2019t laughing.</p><p>\u201cConfidentially, I\u2019m experiencing something of a cash flow problem. I was thinking you might be able to help me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to pay you?\u201d Susannah couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing.</p><p>\u201cIf you want me out of Chrissie\u2019s life, I could make that happen for as little as five thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s mouth flew open. He was serious. Five thousand dollars. The same amount her father had paid Allan Presley.</p><p>\u201cThis is a one-time offer. It won\u2019t be repeated and you have to decide now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr like I said, I string her along for a while and introduce her to a few of my friends. I\u2019m sure you get the picture.\u201d</p><p>Susannah thought she was going to be sick. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about her at all, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. She was a nice diversion for a while.\u201d He grinned nastily. \u201cMom said you were a stuck-up prig in high school and it was fun getting a rise out of you.\u201d</p><p>Susannah stared at him, unable to say a thing.</p><p>\u201cWell? Are you game or not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Game. This entire episode was a game. He was playing with Chrissie\u2019s heart and it meant nothing to him. Now it was up to Susannah to decide what to do.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of money here.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shoulder in a half shrug. \u201cThen get it from your husband and do it fast.\u201d</p><p>Susannah\u2019s mind raced. Joe would never give in to blackmail. She knew without even asking that he\u2019d flatly refuse. \u201cHe won\u2019t agree to this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen the deal\u2019s off.\u201d Troy started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried. She took him at his word\u2014this was a one-time offer. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to get the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your rich friend?\u201d Troy suggested.</p><p>Susannah shook her head. \u201cI\u2019d never borrow money from Carolyn.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows in a cynical expression. \u201cNot even for your daughter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting at the Roadside Inn tonight at seven. Either you\u2019re there with the money or no deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I might not have it by then,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, his voice as hard as steel, \u201cis your problem.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>Susannah paced the house, figuring out ways to come up with the money. She couldn\u2019t go to an ATM\u2014there was a thousand-dollar limit on withdrawals. She and Joe had a joint account, and she doubted she could take out that amount, anyway, without his permission. A credit card advance? She went over and over the possible solutions until Chrissie returned with the car. Her daughter, in high spirits, was full of chatter and good will.</p> <p>\u201cGrandma looked great,\u201d Chrissie assured her. \u201cShe was almost like her old self, except...\u201d She giggled. \u201cShe thought I was you. The nurse said that\u2019s common and I shouldn\u2019t worry about it. She\u2019ll be herself in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the doctor say?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie stopped to think. \u201cNot much, really, just that Grandma\u2019s making progress.\u201d</p><p>Susannah prayed her mother would make a full recovery. Otherwise, they\u2019d be looking at a hip replacement. From various friends she\u2019d learned how serious that could be with the elderly.</p><p>Chrissie studied her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Grandma, Mom. She\u2019s doing really well.\u201d</p><p>Nodding seemed to require a monumental effort.</p><p>\u201cIs something else bothering you?\u201d Chrissie asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cNot really...It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve got an errand to run and I have to wait for the home security people.\u201d She\u2019d decided to see Carolyn\u2014to at least discuss this with her.</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d she urged. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter\u2019s willingness to help added a sense of urgency to Susannah\u2019s mission. Without a hint of regret, Troy would destroy Chrissie\u2019s life. Paying him off might solve the problem, but she wasn\u2019t convinced Troy could be trusted. She didn\u2019t dare give him all the money up front, or she\u2019d have no insurance. But even half of $5000 was hard to produce on such short notice.</p><p>Carolyn was busy with a buyer when Susannah arrived. Waiting in the small reception area, she gazed out the window over the massive yard, stacked with row upon row of timber. The noon whistle blew, and the work crews broke for a thirty-minute lunch. The saws went silent.</p><p>Susannah watched as the men poured out from various places and congregated together. In the distance they looked alike, some short, some tall, but all dressed in the same style coveralls. These men were the fathers, husbands, brothers of many people in Colville, and Susannah was visibly reminded of the mill\u2019s importance to the community.</p><p>The door to Carolyn\u2019s office opened then, and Susannah heard her friend exchanging farewells with the buyer.</p><p>\u201cSusannah?\u201d Carolyn said behind her. \u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>Tearing her gaze away from the window, she turned to her. \u201cDo you have a few minutes to talk privately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Carolyn led the way back into her office; Susannah followed and closed the door.</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s eyebrows went up as she rounded her desk and reclaimed her chair. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Sitting down opposite her, Susannah nodded. \u201cI had a visitor this morning.\u201d She swallowed hard, then continued. \u201cTroy Nance came to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it this wasn\u2019t a social call?\u201d</p><p>Susannah made a derisive sound. \u201cHardly. I took Chrissie out to the Roadside Inn last night, but it didn\u2019t do any good. He knows I\u2019m on to him, so he came to tell me that for a mere five thousand dollars he\u2019d break off his relationship with Chrissie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d what?\u201d Carolyn yelped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not even the worst of it. Troy claimed the reason he got involved with her is because his mother thought I was\u2014and I quote\u2014a stuck-up prig in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Carolyn sounded as shocked as Susannah had been. \u201cWe both know that Jake broke up with her because of you and she never got over it.\u201d</p><p>Susannah agreed. Sharon had been caustic the evening they\u2019d driven out to the tavern, claiming that Jake had gone back to her. She\u2019d taken pleasure in informing Susannah that Troy was his son.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. My gut tells me to pay him the money and be done with it.\u201d It occurred to her then that she was doing almost the same thing her father had done. Another thought hit her and with it her stomach twisted.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Carolyn asked in alarm.</p><p>Susannah shook her head numbly. \u201cWhat if...what if Jake\u2019s father approached my dad and demanded money?\u201d she whispered. It had never entered her mind that Allan Presley might have done exactly that. Now she wondered. In her heart she knew it hadn\u2019t been Jake\u2019s idea, but she\u2019d assumed her father was the one responsible.</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cI never thought of that.\u201d</p><p>The sinking sensation didn\u2019t leave her. Her mind whirled with the possibility and she didn\u2019t immediately realize Carolyn was speaking.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Joe say?\u201d</p><p>Susannah looked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn frowned at that. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know my husband and he\u2019d never agree to this. He\u2019s probably right, but I have to do something... I\u2019m desperate. My daughter\u2019s future is at stake.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s frown darkened. \u201cDo you think keeping Joe out of this is a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d Her voice shook with near hysteria. That wretched man was risking Chrissie\u2019s future, without conscience, without regret and without a qualm. His threat hadn\u2019t been subtle\u2014he\u2019d introduce her to his friends. Susannah could easily guess what that meant. His friends had to be big-time losers. Even more disturbing was the implication that Chrissie would be hanging around with...with drug addicts and given cocaine or who knew what.</p><p>Now Susannah had no choice but to broach the subject of money with Carolyn. Drawing in a deep breath, she leaned toward her friend\u2019s desk. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem. I don\u2019t have five thousand dollars just lying around.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for Carolyn to comment, fearing what she\u2019d say. \u201cI suppose I could get a cash advance on the credit card, but I\u2019d rather not tell Joe about this if I can possibly keep it secret.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s chest rose with a harsh sigh. \u201cTroy is blackmailing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should talk this over with your husband.\u201d</p><p>Susannah wanted Joe at her side more than ever, and yet she knew beyond a doubt that he wouldn\u2019t agree to this. She couldn\u2019t risk it, even at the cost of her marriage. When everything was settled, when Chrissie was safe, she\u2019d tell him, but not before\u2014otherwise they might lose their daughter.</p><p>\u201cGoing behind Joe\u2019s back isn\u2019t right,\u201d she agreed, \u201cbut for now and for Chrissie\u2019s sake, it\u2019s my only option.\u201d Opening her purse, Susannah set out the emerald ring Joe had given her on their twentieth anniversary. He\u2019d paid twenty-five hundred dollars for it. In addition, she had her mother\u2019s pearls, which Vivian had given her for safekeeping. Taken together, she believed their value would total at least the amount she needed to borrow.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping,\u201d she said, the words barely making it past the constriction in her throat, \u201cthat it would be possible to get a loan from you.\u201d Asking to borrow money was even harder than she\u2019d imagined. Her face burned with mortification. \u201cThese are worth more but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to write you a personal check for the five thousand,\u201d Carolyn said.</p><p>Susannah hung her head. \u201cThe jewelry\u2019s the collateral.\u201d</p><p>After a short pause, Carolyn slowly straightened and opened a drawer, pulling out her checkbook. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing the right thing in keeping this from Joe, but you\u2019re the one who has to make that decision.\u201d</p><p>Weak with relief, Susannah nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d rest easier if at some point you told your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, I promise, just not yet.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn wrote the check and handed it to Susannah. Then she turned to her computer and typed up a simple IOU. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take the jewelry. You keep it. The note is enough.\u201d</p><p>Susannah thanked her, signed the note and took back the ring and pearls. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate this,\u201d she said, on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cI just hope Chrissie appreciates what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>God willing, she\u2019d never find out. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell her?\u201d</p><p>Susannah shook her head emphatically. \u201cNo way! She\u2019d never forgive me. Sure as anything, she\u2019d blame me for this. I can\u2019t take that chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Troy comes back for more money later on?\u201d</p><p>Susannah had considered this. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will. He said Chrissie\u2019s become a drag. He\u2019s bored with her.\u201d</p><p>The look on Carolyn\u2019s face was one of disgust. Susannah shared her opinion.</p><p>Before she left, she thanked her friend profusely.</p><p>Chrissie was busy packing up the hallway linen closet when Susannah got back to the house. \u201cThe alarm guy was here,\u201d she said, still on her knees, a stack of pillowcases in her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s the same alarm system we have at home. I gave him your birthdate, month and day, for the code.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Susannah mumbled. Now that the problem of finding the money had been solved, she should feel good. She didn\u2019t; if anything, she felt worse. Carolyn disapproved of the risk Susannah was taking, but she hadn\u2019t offered any alternatives, either.</p><p>\u201cMom? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>It was the second time that day her daughter had asked that question. Susannah forced a smile. \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie set the pillowcases neatly inside a carton. \u201cThis is about Troy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The mention of his name startled Susannah, until she reminded herself that Chrissie couldn\u2019t possibly know what it was about Troy that had upset her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really trying, and Mom, I want to tell you how grateful I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my best.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter impulsively scrambled to her feet and hugged her. \u201cYou won\u2019t be sorry, Mom.

She couldn\u2019t tell what time it was. Afternoon, she assumed. She vaguely remembered a lunch tray, which she hadn\u2019t touched. It was all she could do to keep her eyes open. She thought George might come; that was why she had to stay awake. She felt certain her husband would know how badly she needed to see him.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she fought the waves of fatigue.</p><p>\u201cVivian?\u201d a gruff male voice called to her.</p> <p>Vivian opened her eyes to find George Wakefield from Altamira standing next to her hospital bed. He leaned heavily on his crutches and stared down at her, a look of worry creasing his face.</p><p>\u201cGeorge.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the George she\u2019d been longing to see, but this George was good, too.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>She gave a weak smile. Seeing him, she remembered she\u2019d been with George playing pool when she\u2019d fallen. It must\u2019ve been quite a shock for him.</p><p>\u201cI broke my hip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they said. I told you not to take that shot with your cane. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou used your crutch. Fair is fair.\u201d</p><p>He nearly grinned, which would\u2019ve been a first. This George was as stingy with smiles as her husband had been.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get here?\u201d Vivian asked. The assisted-living place kept close tabs on everyone. Getting away without one of the staff noticing couldn\u2019t have been easy.</p><p>\u201cI signed myself out.\u201d</p><p>Vivian hadn\u2019t known she could do that. Anytime she\u2019d left, it\u2019d been with Susannah. \u201cBut how\u2019d you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Vivian laughed softly. \u201cI should find out, in case I decide to make a break for it.\u201d</p><p>This time he did smile and it cheered her immeasurably.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I took the Altamira Shuttle. All you have to do is order it at the desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Vivian wondered if it was time for another pain pill.</p><p>\u201cAny more visits from your dead husband?\u201d George asked. Resting his crutches against the wall, he sank down onto the lone chair in the room and made himself comfortable.</p><p>Vivian shook her head sadly. \u201cI thought for sure he\u2019d come and see me, but he hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be more difficult these days. They have restrictions on the other side, you know?\u201d</p><p>Vivian had guessed as much. All she knew of heaven was in the pages of her Bible, and the descriptions there were somewhat limited. George hadn\u2019t told her anything, but then he\u2019d never spoken. That apparently went against the rules.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone ask about me?\u201d Vivian inquired. \u201cAt Altamira?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral folks. Your friend Sally. None of the nurses knew how you were doing, so I decided to find out for myself.\u201d</p><p>Vivian blushed; his attention flustered her. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He gently patted her hand, and she felt herself grow warm. Oh, my. This George was a handsome man and she\u2014</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Susannah stood in the doorway holding a vase of roses. She wore the oddest look, as if she wasn\u2019t quite sure she should trust her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSusannah!\u201d</p><p>George struggled to his feet.</p><p>\u201cGeorge, this is my daughter, Susannah,\u201d Vivian said, rushing the words in her embarrassment. That look of her daughter\u2019s made her feel guilty, although she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.</p><p>\u201cHello, George,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cHave we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but your mother\u2019s mentioned you many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Susannah set the flowers down on the bedside stand and leaned close to kiss Vivian on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cGeorge isn\u2019t my boyfriend or anything,\u201d Vivian said firmly. She wanted that understood right away. Boyfriend was such a silly word. In her day it would\u2019ve been suitor. Or maybe gentleman caller.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d George said, and to her delight he sounded downright disappointed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d George concurred. \u201cFriends.\u201d</p><p>Susannah seemed to be in a good mood if that smile on her face was any indication.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019d best be getting back to Altamira,\u201d George muttered, reaching for his crutches.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave on my account,\u201d Susannah said.</p><p>\u201cThe shuttle driver\u2019s waiting. I told him I wouldn\u2019t be staying long.\u201d He patted Vivian\u2019s hand one last time. \u201cYou take care, you hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised and then because she wanted to be sure he wouldn\u2019t disappear the way her George sometimes did, she stretched out one hand and touched his face.</p><p>Surprise filled George\u2019s eyes. \u201cHurry back home,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI miss you.\u201d Then, expertly wielding his crutches, he swung out the door.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cYou do have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly don\u2019t,\u201d Vivian denied hotly. She rolled her head to the side to examine the flowers. \u201cIt\u2019s very thoughtful of you to bring me roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re avoiding the subject.\u201d</p><p>Vivian sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be upset with me.\u201d</p><p>Susannah stepped closer to the bed. \u201cWhy would I be upset?\u201d</p><p>Lowering her lashes, Vivian felt it was time she told the truth. \u201cYou were so angry with your father not long ago, although I don\u2019t remember what it was about....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think I might have misjudged Daddy,\u201d Susannah said in a low voice.</p><p>It gladdened Vivian\u2019s heart to hear that. \u201cI told you I\u2019d ask your father, but he didn\u2019t come. I waited up half the night, and then I was afraid he didn\u2019t know I\u2019d moved.\u201d She spoke quickly in her eagerness to confess what she\u2019d done. \u201cI wanted to talk to him so badly and he didn\u2019t come.\u201d She dared to glance up and to her astonishment, Susannah had tears in her eyes. This was what she\u2019d feared most, that Susannah would be upset with her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Vivian murmured.</p><p>\u201cSorry about what, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told George\u2014the George you just met\u2014that you were angry with your father and that I was waiting for him to visit. When your father didn\u2019t show up, he suggested I tell you I\u2019d spoken to George, which I had, of course, only it was a different George, and that anything your father did was because he loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did love me, Mom.\u201d The tears in her daughter\u2019s eyes glistened. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it took me so long to understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you understand now?\u201d</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot in the last few days....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a real lie. I did talk to George,\u201d she said, returning to the subject of her small deception. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t George, your father, but George my friend.\u201d</p><p>Susannah offered her a gentle smile. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mom. I\u2019m not angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Vivian was tired then, really tired. After waiting most of the day, she had to assume her husband wasn\u2019t coming. Maybe tonight, but she wasn\u2019t holding out much hope.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll close my eyes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou go right ahead, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be here when I wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m not, it\u2019s because I have an errand to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, dear. Go ahead and do your errand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Vivian smiled, glad she\u2019d told the truth. She felt so much better now that Susannah knew.</p><p>She must have drifted off then, because when she woke, the room was dark and silent. The night-light shone from the bathroom.</p><p>She sensed she wasn\u2019t alone and turning her head, she realized she was right. George stood beside the bed.</p><p>Her George. Defying death, he\u2019d come when she needed him most.</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p><p>Araucous country-and-western song was booming from the Roadside Inn when Susannah drove into the gravel parking lot. She\u2019d left her mother, who appeared to be resting comfortably; now she was about to meet Troy. She had the money to pay him off. It was with more than a little trepidation that she\u2019d decided to play his game.</p><p>As before, the tavern was filled with truckers. The smoke was thick and the odor of booze and stale perspiration permeated the place. Troy sat at a table with the same blonde Susannah had seen earlier. He\u2019d told Chrissie this \u201cold friend\u201d was named Jenny something. The woman looked adoringly up at Troy, her arm wrapped tightly around his waist. She wore a skimpy halter top and her breasts threatened to spill out.</p><p>Troy turned and stared at Susannah as she walked through the door. He said something to the blonde and disengaged himself from her embrace. His gaze holding Susannah\u2019s, he motioned with his head toward the bar.</p><p>As on her previous visit, Sharon was bartending. Susannah saw her former classmate stiffen at the sight of her. Susannah went rigid, too, still not sure she was doing the right thing.</p><p>Troy moved down to the far end and Susannah met him there.</p><p>\u201cYou have the money?\u201d he asked coolly.</p><p>Clutching her purse close to her body, she nodded. \u201cI have a few concerns we need to discuss first.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he studied her. \u201cDon\u2019t try to screw me over,\u201d he said in a heated whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. You\u2019re asking for a lot of money and I want some guarantees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you won\u2019t contact Chrissie at a later date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cI\u2019ve got other fish to fry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you make a practice of this sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said as though her questions bored him. \u201cI\u2019m tired of her. What\u2019s that old saying\u2014out of sight, out of mind? She\u2019ll go back to Seattle and that\u2019ll be the end of it.\u201d</p><p>This was what Susannah hoped would happen. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee Chrissie will leave Colville,\u201d she said.</p><p>Troy dismissed her concern with a shake of his head. \u201cShe will.\u201d</p><p>Susannah wasn\u2019t convinced. Her daughter was stubborn and might just decide to stay. In which case, everything could explode in Susannah\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAre you changing the ground rules?\u201d Troy asked, leaning one elbow against the bar.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I want Chrissie to go home where she belongs.\u201d She paused. \u201cMore precisely, I want her back in school.\u201d</p><p>Troy shrugged indifferently. \u201cWorks for me. I sure don\u2019t want her hanging around here. She\u2019ll go home, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Susannah was worried. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know anything about this, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d tell her?\u201d</p><p>Susannah had the feeling Troy would do whatever it took to get whatever he wanted. If that meant disclosing the fact that Susannah had paid him off, she wouldn\u2019t put it past him. She couldn\u2019t help wondering if her father had experienced the same doubts when he\u2019d paid off Jake\u2019s. Had he wondered if he was doing the right thing? Had he questioned his own judgment? Like her, she suspected he had. \u201cI don\u2019t want Chrissie finding out I was involved in any way,\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>\u201cFine. Now give me the money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I don\u2019t have time for this crap. Give me the money or I\u2019ll screw up your sweet little girl for the rest of her life.\u201d</p><p>Susannah didn\u2019t take his threat lightly. She sensed that Troy would derive real pleasure from hurting Chrissie out of spite.</p><p>Figuring any further discussion would do more harm than good, Susannah set her purse on the scuffed bar and unzipped it. Taking out a stack of twenties and fifties, she handed it to Troy.</p><p>He grabbed the money and thumbed through the bills. A minute later, he raised his hard eyes to lock with hers. \u201cThis is only half of what we agreed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe other half is at the house. You\u2019ll get it after Chrissie leaves for Seattle.\u201d</p><p>He clearly wasn\u2019t happy about it, but he didn\u2019t have any choice. Susannah wasn\u2019t about to give him everything at once and risk being cheated. This was the only recourse she had and she intended to use it.</p><p>He seemed to deliberate, then slowly nodded. \u201cFine. But you better come through.\u201d He stuffed the money in his wallet, which was connected to his jeans by a chain. Without another word, he walked back to the table where he\u2019d been sitting and pulled on the blonde\u2019s arm. Hands linked, the couple walked out of the tavern. Jenny, if that was her name, swayed her hips provocatively. Susannah would\u2019ve been embarrassed if that was her daughter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a handsome man, my son, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Sharon sauntered up. \u201cHe looks more like his father every day.\u201d</p><p>Susannah ignored the comment. While it was true that Troy did resemble Jake, he lacked every other quality Susannah felt was important in a man\u2014dignity, honor, character. All were missing in Troy and apparently in Jake, too. That made her more sad than angry. She\u2019d honestly felt they\u2019d shared something special. She\u2019d been far too stubborn\u2014not unlike her own daughter\u2014to realize how right her father had been to get him out of her life. All the years she\u2019d harbored this resentment against him and now...now she understood and it tore her apart. She\u2019d wasted all those years, bitter and angry about the way he\u2019d manipulated her life, and here she was, doing the same thing. She was doing it out of love, just as her father had.</p><p>\u201cThe minute you left for France, Jake came to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t true.\u201d For her own sake, Susannah wanted to believe otherwise\u2014wanted to believe what his letters had implied.</p><p>Sharon laughed contemptuously, but Susannah didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cJake was never interested in you. Not like you were in him.\u201d She held her ground, unwilling to let Sharon rattle her.</p><p>\u201cThink what you want,\u201d Sharon said, as though it was of little concern. \u201cTroy is all the proof I need.\u201d</p><p>The woman had a point, although Susannah would never concede it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to lash out at others, Sharon,\u201d she said. \u201cJake must\u2019ve hurt you very badly.\u201d Then she turned and walked out the door. By the time Susannah got to the car, her hands shook so badly it was difficult to push the remote that would unlock the vehicle.</p><p>Troy, of all people, had taught her one of the most valuable lessons of her life. She was her father\u2019s daughter.</p><p>As she inserted the key in the car\u2019s ignition, Susannah recognized that she\u2019d risked her own relationship with her daughter in doing this. Her marriage, too. Having gone behind Joe\u2019s back again, she wondered how he\u2019d react once he learned what she\u2019d done and why. All she could do was hope he\u2019d understand.</p><p>This summer she\u2019d begun to view their relationship with fresh eyes. Through the years, Joe had proven himself. They\u2019d shared hopes, made plans and borne each other\u2019s sorrows. He\u2019d seen her at her best and her worst. Joe was the one who\u2019d always been at her side. Not Jake. He was a fantasy, a long-lost love, a dream that had turned out to be false.</p> <p>Considering all these revelations, Susannah drove home. The house was dark\u2014did that mean Troy had already made good on his word? Was Chrissie with him? It struck her then that she\u2019d paid this dreadful man twenty-five hundred dollars to break her daughter\u2019s heart. Just like he said he would...</p><p>Somehow, Susannah made it up the steps and into the house. Her eyes swam with tears and she could barely see. All those years she\u2019d carried her anger toward her father, like a shield that could never be pierced. She\u2019d held him off, refusing to let him close. Even recently, at the cemetery, she\u2019d ranted at him, charging him with not loving her. But he did love her, more than she\u2019d ever known, as much as Susannah loved her own daughter.</p><p>She\u2019d been wrong about so many things.</p><p>Her father had loved her and she loved him. Joe had been right all along. As hard as she\u2019d tried not to have any feelings for him, she did. Because of her anger toward him, she\u2019d been unable to grieve normally. Instead, she\u2019d revisited that time in her youth, reliving her outrage, her sense of injustice. Was that so she wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the emotions surrounding his death?</p><p>She missed her father, she loved him, and she was sorry. So sorry. Now she\u2019d give anything, anything, to tell him how deeply she regretted her refusal to see his side. She buried her face in her hands and cried until there were no tears left.</p><p>When she felt she could speak again, she walked into the kitchen and reached for the phone. Thankfully, Joe answered.</p><p>\u201cSusannah, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I need you. Please come...I can\u2019t do this without you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her husband didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019ll leave within the hour.\u201d</p><p>His simple acceptance of her need, not asking a single question, tore at her. \u201cJoe, oh, Joe, I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Suze. I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, I\u2019ve done something so foolish. Please hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll discuss everything when I get there.\u201d</p><p>The road back to herself, to the person she used to be, wanted to be, led directly to her husband, Joe Nelson.</p><p>CHAPTER 42</p><p>Susannah had composed herself by the time Chrissie returned. As she expected, her daughter was devastated. Sobbing, Chrissie ran into the house and without a word flew into Susannah\u2019s waiting arms. With all her heart, Susannah prayed her daughter would never learn of her part in this.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, cradling Chrissie\u2019s head against her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d Chrissie managed between gasping breaths.</p><p>\u201cWith Troy?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter nodded, hugging Susannah close.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie shook her head. \u201cI want to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved him. First Jason, and now Troy. There must be something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t honestly think that,\u201d she murmured soothingly. She stroked the back of her daughter\u2019s head and made soft reassuring sounds as she told Chrissie that she was a lovely young woman and would meet the right someone soon.</p><p>\u201cTroy kept putting me off about helping if I moved to Colville and now I know why. Mom, oh Mom,\u201d she cried. She leaned away from Susannah and covered her face with both hands. \u201cHe\u2019s got a woman living with him. It\u2019s that Jenny\u2014the one he said was an old friend. She\u2019s been there all along.\u201d</p><p>This didn\u2019t come as any surprise to Susannah; foolishly the other woman was willing to ignore Troy\u2019s indiscretions.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d Chrissie sobbed.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be better once you\u2019re home.\u201d Home sounded good to Susannah, too. A month earlier she\u2019d been eager to escape. Her marriage had felt stale, her life in a rut. Now it would take several large volumes to list all her blessings.</p><p>\u201cHow will I get there?\u201d Chrissie sobbed more loudly now.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s driving over tonight.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie wiped the tears from her cheeks. Her eyes were bright and moisture clung to her long lashes. \u201cDad\u2019s coming?\u201d This was apparently the best news she\u2019d heard in some time, because she gave Susannah a wobbly smile.</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cDad and I will finish the packing, and we\u2019ll hire Martha to do the cleaning. I\u2019ll go home with him, and you can drive my car back if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Then everything\u2019s better between you and Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, much better. He was upset with me and rightly so. We all make foolish mistakes, Chrissie. The thing is, we need to learn from those mistakes and move forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to,\u201d she vowed.</p><p>Susannah hugged her again. \u201cLike mother, like daughter.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s attempt to laugh sounded more like a cough. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>Susannah hadn\u2019t meant it to be.</p><p>Sniffling, Chrissie retreated into her bedroom. A short while later, Susannah heard her talking on her cell phone and was half afraid Chrissie had contacted Troy. She needn\u2019t have worried. Within a few minutes, she realized her daughter had called a girlfriend in Seattle.</p><p>At ten Susannah noticed the light was off in the bedroom and a quick check assured her Chrissie was asleep.</p><p>Susannah stayed up and waited for Joe to arrive, which he did at two-thirty in the morning. As soon as she heard his car pull up, she opened the door, clutching her housecoat around her.</p><p>Joe got out of the car and Susannah couldn\u2019t wait a moment longer. She raced barefoot down the steps, throwing herself into her husband\u2019s arms. As soon as she was safe in Joe\u2019s grasp, she spread kisses over his face, letting him know without words how grateful she was to see him, to be married to him, to love him.</p><p>Joe\u2019s arms tightened around her waist. \u201cTo what do I owe this warm welcome?\u201d he asked, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Joe Nelson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so. We\u2019ve been married for nearly twenty-five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I really love you. I didn\u2019t even know how much until these last few weeks. Oh, Joe, I have so many things to tell you.\u201d Not all of them would please him, but Susannah vowed she\u2019d hold nothing back.</p><p>Because he was keyed up from the long drive, they sat side by side on the sofa with a glass of wine and talked for another hour. Joe had been able to reach a retired dentist friend, who\u2019d agreed to step in while he helped settle everything in Colville.</p><p>Susannah began to relate the events of the past weeks.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d Joe moaned when she told him about paying Troy the blackmail money he\u2019d demanded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be looking for the extra twenty-five hundred in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHe\u2019s not getting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her husband shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of this. I have a few things to say to him, and if I have to bring in the sheriff, I will.

It was a joy to rest on his support and his love. She should never have tried to deal with this on her own. They were a team and she shouldn\u2019t have forgotten that.</p><p>Joe wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cFirst thing in the morning, return the rest of the money to Carolyn and give her a check for the other twenty-five hundred. I\u2019ll have the bank transfer the funds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Joe put his arm around her shoulders. \u201cI wish I\u2019d come with you.\u201d</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, Susannah bit her lip. \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore?\u201d He sounded worried and Susannah couldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should save this for another time?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cDoes it have to do with the P.I.?\u201d</p><p>Susannah shook her head. \u201cWith Jake.\u201d</p><p>Joe leaned back on the sofa and slowly exhaled. \u201cAh, yes, Jake, the love of your life.\u201d There was a hint of irony in his voice, and she couldn\u2019t blame him for that, either.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted, holding her hands against his cheeks, \u201cthe love of my life is you. It\u2019s always been you and only you. For a while, I\u2019d forgotten that.\u201d Tucking her legs beneath her, she laid her head on his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell me.\u201d</p><p>For her, it really was the end as far as Jake was concerned. \u201cSharon Nance, Troy\u2019s mother, told me Jake is his father.\u201d</p><p>Her husband gave a low whistle.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to have been in regular contact with him. I don\u2019t think I can believe everything she says, but she knew about the medal I\u2019d given Jake years ago, so I tend to believe her on this.\u201d</p><p>Joe frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sure she was trying to upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t care anymore. I have you, and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d And Susannah meant it.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for bed?\u201d he asked, yawning.</p><p>Susannah nodded. \u201cMore than ready. I\u2019ve been without my husband for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Joe chuckled and helped her off the sofa. With their arms around each other\u2019s waists, they walked to her bedroom, next door to where Chrissie slept.</p><p>Their daughter must have heard them talking, because the bedroom door opened and Chrissie appeared in the hallway. \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, sugar bear.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie hugged her father close and Susannah noticed that her eyes were red and swollen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Chrissie said, looping her arms around her father\u2019s middle the way she had as a little girl.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Susannah asked, wishing there\u2019d been some way to protect Chrissie from this pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay.... I just want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can leave in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Chrissie returned to her room, shutting the door.</p><p>Joe took Susannah\u2019s hand and led her into the bedroom. He made a disgruntled sound when he saw that she slept in a twin bed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll cuddle close together,\u201d she told him, nuzzling his neck.</p><p>\u201cReally close,\u201d he said with a laugh. Then he abruptly went still.</p><p>Susannah lifted her head. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Joe released her and walked over to the dresser. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been here and left you a message.\u201d</p><p>Whirling around, Susannah noticed the single sheet of paper taped to her dresser mirror. It read:</p><p>MEET ME AT 10 A.M. IN THE CEMETERY.</p><p>CHAPTER 43</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201d Joe asked the next morning as they held each other in bed. They\u2019d slept that way for most of the night, as though they couldn\u2019t bear to be apart for even a moment. Their love was fresh and new and they\u2019d rediscovered their appreciation for each other. Joe was her salvation, her constant, and she was horrified at what a dangerous thing she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cYes. I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did someone get in here?\u201d Joe had been brooding about this since the night before. \u201cIf it was that Jake guy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake isn\u2019t important to me.\u201d All the desire she\u2019d had to connect with him, to apologize for what her father had done, was gone. Whether he was Troy\u2019s father or not didn\u2019t matter to her. Jake belonged to the past, a past that couldn\u2019t be altered or relived. She\u2019d idealized him in her mind, canonized him, but he was no saint, then or now.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered, hugging Joe, clinging to the husband who\u2019d loved her and stood by her throughout her temporary insanity.</p><p>Slipping his hand beneath her chin, Joe raised her face so that her eyes met his. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll always regret it, always wonder. Get this completely out of your system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go with me?\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s chest rose as he considered her request. Finally he nodded.</p><p>That changed everything. Susannah could face Jake with her husband at her side. With Joe, she could look her former boyfriend in the eye and tell him that her father\u2019s arrangement was the best thing George Leary had ever done for her. Only now did she understand that because of Jake, her father had lost both his children. Doug to whatever drug deal the two of them had been involved in and Susannah to anger.</p><p>By eight, Chrissie was up and packing. Susannah sat on her bed and they talked. \u201cI really thought I loved him, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart.\u201d She bit her tongue to keep from reminding her daughter how unworthy Troy was of her love.</p><p>\u201cI guess I thought my love would change him.\u201d</p><p>Susannah had believed that about Jake, too. \u201cWhat you loved was the man you knew he could be,\u201d she said, drawing up her knees and clasping her arms around them.</p><p>Joe brought them each a cup of coffee and seeing that they were talking, promptly left.</p><p>\u201cI was so angry with you because you couldn\u2019t see Troy the way I did, and now I realize I should\u2019ve been looking at him through your eyes.\u201d</p><p>This was a giant step toward maturity for Chrissie, and Susannah had faith that it wouldn\u2019t take her daughter nearly as long to recognize the truth as it had her.</p><p>\u201cEverything I did was out of love,\u201d she told Chrissie.</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears as her daughter walked over to the bed and hugged her. \u201cI know that now,\u201d Chrissie said.</p><p>At nine-thirty, Joe carried her suitcase to the car, and after a quick stop to see her grandmother, Chrissie would leave for Seattle. Once she\u2019d spoken to her mother regarding the situation, even Vivian agreed that Chrissie\u2019s living in Colville wasn\u2019t a good idea. Susannah and Joe, arms around each other, stood on the sidewalk and watched their daughter drive off.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Joe said. \u201cThis has been a tough lesson for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d Susannah murmured. Growth was a painful process\u2014as she well knew.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cWe should probably leave for the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be ready for this confrontation. \u201cPromise me that no matter what happens, you won\u2019t leave my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d Joe assured her. \u201cIf this clown thinks he\u2019s going to walk away with my wife, he\u2019s got another think coming.\u201d</p><p>Susannah pressed her head to Joe\u2019s shoulder and smiled, amused that he could even consider it a possibility. The man who held her was everything she would ever want or need in a husband.</p><p>They took the road out of town, neither of them in the mood to talk. The cast-iron gate leading into the cemetery was open when they pulled off the highway. As before, the note hadn\u2019t mentioned where they were to meet. Joe parked near her father\u2019s grave, which was close to the mausoleum, and they waited in front of the car, holding hands. It was still early; they had five minutes to spare.</p><p>Before, when Susannah had visited her father\u2019s grave, she\u2019d felt nothing but anger, venting her frustration at him. Her attitude was vastly different now. She smiled down at the gravestone, her heart filled with renewed love for him, and a sense of loss for the wasted years.</p><p>Joe\u2019s hand tightened around hers. When she glanced up, she gasped. It seemed as if her heart had suddenly stopped. The world started to spin. No, this couldn\u2019t be right\u2014she must be seeing things. It was because she\u2019d been thinking about her father....</p><p>Stepping out from behind the mausoleum and walking toward her was...George Leary. Only he was younger, handsomer.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d she whispered, her voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cSusannah,\u201d Joe said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s Doug, your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoug?\u201d Tears flooded her eyes and her knees went out from under her. Her brother had been dead for over thirty years. She would have collapsed onto the freshly mowed lawn if Joe hadn\u2019t grabbed her waist and kept her upright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to shock you,\u201d Doug said, rushing forward, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know any other way to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...why...when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should go back to the house and talk about this,\u201d Joe suggested.</p><p>Doug frowned, looking uncertain. \u201cYour daughter\u2019s staying with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone back to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Doug nodded. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Susannah continued to tremble once they were inside the car. \u201cHe looks so much like my father.\u201d Then it came to her. \u201cOh, my goodness, Mom...\u201d Her mother had repeatedly told Susannah that she\u2019d seen George, and she had seen him, a younger version of her dead husband. Her son. With her mind befuddled by grief and disorientation, Vivian must have believed that George had come back from the dead to be with her. It explained so much of what her mother had told her. How quick Susannah had been to dismiss her claims.</p><p>Doug arrived at the house five minutes after Susannah and Joe, and surreal though it seemed, introductions were made. Susannah brewed a pot of strong coffee. She needed it. Had it been later in the day, she would\u2019ve reached for a shot glass. There were times the body needed that kind of jolt to cope with shock.</p><p>Doug was about to take a seat at the table when Susannah began to speak. \u201cI thought Jake was the one who left me the notes,\u201d she told him. \u201cHow did you get into the house the last time? I had the security alarm on.\u201d</p><p>Her brother smiled apologetically at her. \u201cI turned off the alarm. The code was easy enough to figure out. You used your birthdate, and I had the key from inside the brick.\u201d</p><p>Of course. That was how Chrissie had gotten inside the house that first evening. Chrissie had put it back and neither of them had ever checked again. Susannah had forgotten all about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d think it was Jake,\u201d he went on. \u201cContacting you like this was a rotten thing to do, and I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but if you\u2019re alive, is anyone buried in your casket? And what was in the house that you kept trying to find? It was you all these times, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Doug put up his hand to stop her. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d better tell this from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Joe said, gesturing toward the kitchen table. They all sat down.</p> <p>Doug, who faced the window, stared sightlessly into the distance. \u201cIt started just before you went to France, Susannah, when Jake came to me. He needed money and needed it fast. He was desperate to keep you from leaving, and he\u2019d gotten involved in a drug deal to make some quick cash. He ended up in Idaho, where he got into trouble with some not very nice guys, and asked me for help. I don\u2019t know what he thought I could do, but I went back with him in the hope of straightening everything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you selling drugs?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Doug returned adamantly. \u201cI had no idea what I was getting into. Jake, either. By the time we knew, it was too late. We were part of a sting operation designed to catch the big-time suppliers, the guys Jake had gotten himself mixed up with. We were just some of the little fish caught in that net. But both of our names were on the arrest warrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you fled.\u201d Susannah didn\u2019t understand why, if he was innocent, her brother hadn\u2019t simply faced the authorities.</p><p>\u201cJake and I hightailed it out of Idaho, and it was the stupidest mistake of my life,\u201d her brother said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that when I returned to Washington, a minor drug bust became a federal crime. All I could think of was to get to Dad and ask for his help.\u201d</p> <p>Susannah nodded, but she still didn\u2019t grasp how the situation had gotten so quickly out of hand. \u201cI was ready to give up, take my punishment,\u201d he said. \u201cI even had a date with Patricia the night we got home, but then Jake panicked and went to Sharon Nance. Apparently she couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t help him, so he stole my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Jake resume his relationship with Sharon while I was in France?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Doug said.</p><p>\u201cLater then. He must have if she had a son by him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Doug told her again. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t have been time. As I said, he stole my car and made a run for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd got himself killed,\u201d Joe supplied, figuring that part out before Susannah did.</p> <p>\u201cJake is...dead?\u201d Susannah was having trouble taking this in. \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible! Sharon said he\u2019s Troy\u2019s father and that she\u2019s been in touch with him.\u201d</p><p>Her brother\u2019s smile was grim. \u201cShe lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe obviously resented you,\u201d Joe said, reaching for her hand and gently squeezing her fingers. \u201cFor some messed-up reason of her own. She refused to help him\u2014and never saw him again. This summer, when she learned you were looking for Jake, she told you all those lies. She obviously wanted you to think the worst of him. And Suze\u2014it means he wasn\u2019t Troy\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>Susannah could barely take that in, but her heart lightened. Jake had been true to her, true to the end of his life.</p><p>Doug sipped his coffee and went back to his story then. \u201cWith Jake dead, it all came down on me. Proof of my innocence had been destroyed. Dad had got hold of Sheriff Dalton before we learned about the accident. He knew he could trust his friend, but because everything had been turned over to the FBI, there was nothing the sheriff could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Dad\u2019s idea to bury Jake in my stead.\u201d He spoke in a low voice. \u201cHe knew the chances of me getting off were slim, despite my innocence. After all the men he\u2019d sent to prison, he feared it would be hell on earth for me there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Jake\u2019s father? Did he ever know?\u201d</p><p>Doug shook his head. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, he didn\u2019t. He took the money Dad gave him, and from what I understand, Jake and his dad had a falling out before the move. His father was living in Oregon, and Jake said he was finished with him.\u201d Doug paused for a moment. \u201cAllan was the one who went to Dad, you know. When Jake found out, he was furious. Jake tried to be the man you wanted him to be, Susannah. Unfortunately, things didn\u2019t work out for him.\u201d</p><p>Despite Allan Presley\u2019s inadequacy as a father and a human being, she found it sad that he never knew his only son was dead.</p><p>\u201cHow did they ever manage to bury Jake and pass him off as you?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Dalton had Jake placed in a body bag at the scene of the accident, and he took him to Uncle Henry\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Henry?\u201d Joe asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s brother owned the town mortuary,\u201d Susannah said. \u201cHe died years ago and it was sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe funeral was closed casket,\u201d Doug went on, \u201cand that was understandable with the type of accident it\u2019d been. No one questioned any part of it. Jake was buried, and I was dead to my family.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cDad was able to get me new identification papers, and a social security number. He had the connections.\u201d He stared down at his hands. \u201cDad found out about a baby born the same year I was, a baby who died at six months of age. David Langevin. That\u2019s who I became.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this time Mom thought you were Dad.\u201d</p><p>Doug\u2019s sigh revealed his chagrin. \u201cYes, I know. But there was nothing I could do except let her assume that. I guess I do look a bit like Dad these days. Or at least the way he looked in middle age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know the difference,\u201d Susannah said.</p><p>\u201cI never intended to show myself to her. I found her by the park one night, sitting on a bench, and she was clearly lost. I had to help her, but when she saw me she assumed I was Dad. I didn\u2019t speak for fear she\u2019d figure it out. I didn\u2019t want to confuse her any more than she already was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came back to see her again?\u201d</p><p>Her brother nodded. \u201cI visited her at the hospital once, and at Altamira. It seemed to comfort her. She never knew what really happened to me. Dad made the decision not to tell her I was alive. It would\u2019ve been too hard on her, he said, keeping this kind of secret, so he felt it was best to cut all ties. I agreed at the time but later I wished I hadn\u2019t. He came to see me through the years and brought me money. I worked menial jobs in various states.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute,\u201d Susannah said, stopping him. Once again she\u2019d misjudged her father. \u201cI found a small journal he\u2019d kept of those trips. I thought Dad might\u2019ve had a mistress and he was wining and dining her instead of our mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found it, too,\u201d Doug told her. \u201cI was afraid of what you might think, so I took it. Apparently too late,\u201d he added ruefully.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Susannah covered her eyes with both hands. She\u2019d wrongly accused her father at every turn.</p><p>\u201cAt the time everything had to be decided quickly and I know Dad had his regrets after the fact. I did, too, but I couldn\u2019t set things straight because of what might happen to him. He was instrumental in setting this up and there would be ramifications for him because of it. I was trapped and so was he.\u201d</p><p>If the fraud had been discovered, Susannah realized, her father, her uncle and the sheriff would\u2019ve been charged and possibly imprisoned. Naturally, her brother couldn\u2019t risk that.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe Mom when she told me she\u2019d seen Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself for that,\u201d Joe said, giving her hand another reassuring squeeze. Then nodding at Doug, he said, \u201cContinue with what happened to you after the accident.\u201d</p><p>Doug looked sadly down at his coffee. \u201cDad gave me what cash he could and I crossed into Canada. I lived in British Columbia for a number of years under my new identity. I even worked in mills in a couple of B.C. towns. You remember I once had a summer job at Bronson\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never married, never had a family?\u201d</p><p>Doug shook his head. \u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t drag innocent people into this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Doug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually I came back to the States and worked at different places around the country. I drifted from city to city, state to state, never staying in any one place for long. I did what I could to make a decent life for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come back to Colville?\u201d</p><p>Doug cupped his hands around his mug. \u201cIt was probably a crazy risk to take, but after all these years I figured everyone had forgotten about me. My appearance had changed quite a bit\u2014as you can tell. Anyway...Dad and I had a complicated communications system and when he didn\u2019t respond last spring, I was afraid of what might have happened. I came to find out.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cI\u2019m tired of running, tired of looking over my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been hiding all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t, actually. I\u2019ve been working at Kettle Falls Landscaping.\u201d</p><p>Susannah stared at him. \u201cDavid\u2014what did you say? Langevin? Do you call yourself Dave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He gave her a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Dave! Carolyn\u2019s Dave!\u201d Susannah was hit with yet another shock. She gasped and leaned back in her chair to absorb this revelation.</p><p>Doug grinned, rubbing the side of his face. \u201cWhen Carolyn didn\u2019t recognize me, I knew I was probably safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness\u2014does Carolyn know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t tell her before I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been in Colville?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout four months. Carolyn and I started seeing each other recently.... It probably wasn\u2019t a good idea for either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d Susannah cut in. \u201cShe\u2019s crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her,\u201d Doug said simply. \u201cAll these years, I haven\u2019t allowed myself to feel about a woman the way I feel about her. She deserves far better than me, but she\u2019s hard to walk away from. I gave my notice and didn\u2019t intend on seeing her again, but...I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you identifying yourself now?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause of Carolyn and because of what was happening with you.\u201d He looked at Susannah as he said this. \u201cShe told me about your search for Jake and I was afraid you\u2019d stumble upon the truth. I decided it was best to confront it now and be done with it. I have to trust you and Carolyn and make some decisions about the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time she knew, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Susannah said, eager for her friend to discover the truth. Before Doug could protest, she walked over to the wall phone and dialed the mill. In the past two weeks she\u2019d called Carolyn so often, she\u2019d memorized the number.</p><p>\u201cCan you come to the house right away?\u201d Susannah asked when Carolyn answered.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you get here.\u201d She could barely keep the excitement from her voice. \u201cJust hurry.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, proving again what a good friend she was, Carolyn said, \u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d disclosed his identity, Doug looked nervous. He stood up and walked around the table. \u201cAre you sure this is the right thing to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sure. I\u2019d trust Carolyn with my life. Besides, she loves you.\u201d</p> <p>Doug\u2019s head came up. \u201cShe told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t need to. It\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never did explain why you broke into the house,\u201d Joe said, distracting Doug with his question. \u201cI can understand why you wanted to get the journal your dad kept of his visits but what about the other stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was stupid,\u201d Doug said. \u201cBut I\u2019d given up so much, I was trying to collect small pieces of my former life\u2014when I was still Doug Leary, when I still lived in this house. I took the ribbons I won in track and my letterman jacket, along with some of Dad\u2019s things. He had a ring I always wanted. I was looking for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, Chrissie\u2019s got it! She asked if she could wear it around her neck and I said okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo wonder I couldn\u2019t find it.\u201d Doug smiled, shaking his head. \u201cActually, I enjoyed going through the boxes of stuff you\u2019d packed. You have no idea how good it was to look over the memories of my childhood. It gave me the connection I\u2019ve been lacking all these years. I knew I was risking discovery every time I ventured close to the house, but even that wasn\u2019t enough to keep me away.\u201d</p><p>Susannah could only imagine what might have happened if she\u2019d come across him. \u201cOh! You were the one tending Mom\u2019s garden, too.\u201d</p><p>Doug nodded sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019d seen you? Or if Rachel next door had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was close the night you phoned the police,\u201d Doug admitted. \u201cBut I just couldn\u2019t stay away. Even when you installed the alarm, I returned.\u201d</p><p>They talked a few minutes more while waiting for Carolyn. Joe brought out the pictures he carried in his wallet, using them to update Doug on the family. Her brother was getting more nervous by the minute, and when the doorbell rang, he jerked to his feet.</p> <p>\u201cYou might prepare her,\u201d Joe suggested.</p><p>Susannah agreed, and when she\u2019d answered the front door, she kept Carolyn in the living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about?\u201d Carolyn looked terrible, her face pale and ravaged, as if she\u2019d been crying for hours.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Susannah asked.</p><p>Fighting tears, Carolyn sat down on the one remaining chair and wiped her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m an emotional mess. Dave\u2019s leaving. He gave his notice. I thought I\u2019d try to reason with him. I tried to call him, but I couldn\u2019t get through. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s already gone. I\u2019m having trouble dealing with it. I\u2019ll be all right. It\u2019s just that I so badly wanted this to work....\u201d</p><p>Squatting in front of her, Susannah reached for her friend\u2019s hands and held them in her own. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve got to tell you has to do with Dave Langevin.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn was instantly alarmed. \u201cHas something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere?\u201d Carolyn looked around and not seeing him, turned questioning eyes to Susannah.</p><p>\u201cDave is an assumed name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Carolyn\u2019s gaze bore into hers.</p><p>\u201cHello, Carolyn,\u201d Doug said, coming to stand in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cDave?\u201d she gasped.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou probably remember me as someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you as Dave. What\u2019s going on?\u201d she demanded, glancing from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cMay I introduce you to my long-lost, once-dead brother, Doug,\u201d Susannah said, slipping her arm around his waist.</p><p>The blood drained from Carolyn\u2019s face and she brought her hand to her mouth. \u201cDoug?\u201d she repeated in a hushed whisper. \u201cDoug?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. \u201cI wanted to tell you. I\u2019m so sorry to let you find out like this.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn didn\u2019t wait to hear more. She rushed into his arms and soon they were locked in a tight embrace.</p><p>Joe stood next to Susannah, his arm around her shoulders. Jake was dead and that saddened her, but Doug, her beloved brother, Doug, was alive.</p><p>Susannah had returned to her childhood home, confused, uncertain and in many ways lost. Over the course of the last month she\u2019d found her way home\u2014to her true home, her true self. She didn\u2019t know what the future held for her brother and Carolyn, but she\u2019d let them work that out themselves. Whatever Doug decided was fine by her; she\u2019d stand by him. And, it went without saying, so would Carolyn.</p><p>\u201cAre you still feeling shocked?\u201d Joe asked, whispering close to her ear.</p><p>She had been at first, but the thing about finding your way home was that while the path might be familiar, it sometimes took unexpected twists and turns. Doug\u2019s return was one, the happiest of endings; her new knowledge of her father was another. And so was her rediscovered vision of Joe and their marriage.</p><p>CHAPTER 44</p><p>Now that she and Doug were alone, Carolyn couldn\u2019t stop crying. They\u2019d driven to her home, where they could talk without the fear of constant interruptions. They\u2019d barely made it to the laundry room off the garage when Carolyn broke down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, so sorry,\u201d Doug said, bringing her into his arms. \u201cI would\u2019ve done anything to spare you this shock, but I couldn\u2019t tell you before I told Susannah and her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d She buried her face in his shoulder, clinging to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Nothing felt as good as the way Doug ran his fingers through her hair, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of the feel of her, as if he couldn\u2019t bring her close enough.</p><p>\u201cI have always loved you.... I still have the letters we exchanged. When I found out you\u2019d been killed, I wanted to die, too. If Susannah hadn\u2019t been in France with me, I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d come to love you, too,\u201d Doug whispered, kissing her temple. \u201cI felt bad about what I was doing. Patricia and I had dated for quite a while and I hated the fact that I was writing to you and still seeing her. I felt guilty about both of you. I planned to break it off with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote you almost every day,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I treasured every letter.\u201d His hold tightened briefly. \u201cAt first I thought there might be a way for me to get to Paris, find you, convince you to go into hiding with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve done it.\u201d She knew it was true. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t come...you didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>Doug shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you or your parents. If I loved you, and I did, Carolyn, with all my heart, I couldn\u2019t do anything to hurt you. I couldn\u2019t take you into this hell with me.\u201d</p><p>Although she knew he was right, it was hard to forget about the years they\u2019d lived apart.</p><p>\u201cI told myself when I came back to Colville that I wouldn\u2019t get involved with you.\u201d She felt his smile against her forehead. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the hell I went through when I was assigned lawn care at the mill and then later at your home. The minute I saw you, I knew all the resolve in the world wouldn\u2019t be enough to keep me away.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn stroked his back through the thin T-shirt, so grateful he was with her and unwilling to relinquish even one moment with him. \u201cThis morning when I discovered you hadn\u2019t shown up for work, I was so afraid you\u2019d left town. All morning I had the same horrible feeling I did when I heard that you\u2014Doug\u2014were dead. As if nothing mattered anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>Emotion thickened her throat. \u201cOh...I don\u2019t even know what to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDave. I\u2019m accustomed to it now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been Dave far longer than he\u2019d been Doug, she realized. Burrowing into his arms, she trembled with the joy of what she\u2019d learned.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d she cried, panic taking over. No one must learn the truth. No one must suspect.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got everything figured out yet,\u201d Dave admitted. \u201cI know I can\u2019t leave you, though. I\u2019m through with running.\u201d</p><p>That was reassuring but also threatening. They had to go someplace he\u2019d be safe, where no one could possibly guess. That meant she couldn\u2019t stay in Colville. \u201cI\u2019ll sell the mill and we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His response was adamant. \u201cI won\u2019t let you. Don\u2019t even think like that. I\u2019ve lived as Dave Langevin for the last few months without anyone in town suspecting. Doug is dead and buried. He\u2019s no longer a threat to either one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a risk we have to take. None of this can come to light, Carolyn. There\u2019s Sheriff Dalton to consider and my mother, too. A shock like this might be more than she could handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dave, I feel so bad for your mother. I know we can\u2019t tell her but I promise you this\u2014I will visit her and care for her on your behalf.\u201d</p><p>He raised her fingers to his lips. \u201cThank you. And if I am found out, then so be it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely. After Mom and Sheriff Dalton are both gone, I\u2019ll contact an attorney and see what can be done to straighten this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Carolyn had strong feelings on the matter. \u201cI won\u2019t risk having you go to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been there for the last thirty years one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs your future wife, I should have a say in this.\u201d</p><p>Dave went completely still and stepped back, holding her at arm\u2019s length. \u201cMy future wife?\u201d he asked hesitantly.</p><p>Her eyes brimmed with tears as she met his gaze. His wonderful face swam before her. Lifting her hands to his jaw, she smiled shyly and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m proposing, and if you have a lick of sense you\u2019ll accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited for you my entire life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarolyn, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I said?\u201d she cried. \u201cI love you and I\u2019m not taking no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and a look of sadness settled over him. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a pot to piss in. About all I own is that broken-down truck and my camper.\u201d</p><p>He was going to make this more difficult than she\u2019d expected. So she did the one thing that might convince him. Wrapping her arms around his neck, she kissed him, using her mouth, her tongue, her fingers, her whole body to show this man how much she loved him. He was breathless by the time she\u2019d finished, and so was she.</p><p>Dave placed his hand on the washing machine, as though he needed to hold on to something solid to maintain his balance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have any other arguments?\u201d she asked and marveled that she could have one of the most important conversations of her life in the laundry room.</p><p>Dave frowned and it looked as if he still had some fight in him. \u201cCould you seriously leave me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>A half smile lifted the edges of his mouth. \u201cProbably not,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNext question. How much longer will we manage to stay out of the bedroom? Don\u2019t answer, because I can tell you right now, it won\u2019t be long. You know it and so do I.\u201d</p> <p>Dave threw back his head, laughed and then swept her back into his embrace. \u201cCarolyn, oh, Carolyn, I love you so damned much. There isn\u2019t a solitary reason on God\u2019s green earth that you should marry a felon like me, but if you want me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I want you all right. I want you so much I wonder if I can last the three-day waiting period after we apply for the license.\u201d Only then did she start to laugh, too. Tears ran down her cheeks and she was laughing and crying at once. The man who\u2019d been dead was now alive. No\u2014that wasn\u2019t exactly right. Doug was dead, but Dave was alive. Alive and in love with her.</p><p>Joe and Susannah parked in the Memorial Hospital lot and went up to Vivian\u2019s room, where they found her eating lunch with every appearance of appetite. The color was back in her cheeks and she looked better than she had in weeks.</p><p>Susannah had been anticipating this visit. She\u2019d had a long heart-to-heart talk with her husband, and together they\u2019d reached a major decision. She\u2019d begun to feel trapped in her job and now acknowledged that this phase of her life was coming to a natural end. A new one was about to begin.</p><p>\u201cShould we tell your mother?\u201d Joe asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes. I think she\u2019ll be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d she said, coming all the way into the room and bringing Joe with her. \u201cLook who\u2019s here. And look what I brought.\u201d She held a vase filled with white and pink roses from the garden and carefully placed it on the windowsill.</p><p>Vivian brightened and set aside her fork. \u201cJoe!\u201d She held out her arms for a hug. She sounded more and more like her old self. \u201cChrissie said you were in town. It\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d</p><p>Joe folded Vivian in his arms and gave her a gentle hug. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter now that you\u2019re here.\u201d Her gaze went from Joe to Susannah. \u201cThe flowers are lovely, dear.\u201d She raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou have the same look you always did as a little girl when there was something you were dying to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d It wasn\u2019t any wonder; Susannah was giddy with excitement, giddy with joy.</p> <p>\u201cYou might as well tell her right away,\u201d Joe said, sliding his arm around her waist. He smiled down on her, his eyes alight with love.</p><p>Susannah drew in her breath and blurted it out. \u201cMom, I\u2019m going to buy a flower shop.\u201d</p><p>Vivian\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA flower shop. Joe and I talked almost all night. I need a career change. I\u2019m burned out as a teacher. In fact, it\u2019s only been during these last few weeks that I recognized what was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA flower shop,\u201d her mother repeated as though testing the idea. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn downtown Seattle, on Blossom Street. Joe was there this week and he saw the For Sale sign at Fannie\u2019s Flowers. He stopped in to investigate and ask her some questions. I haven\u2019t talked to the owner myself yet, but the terms seem very reasonable. It feels so right, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Vivian looked at Joe. \u201cThat stubborn daughter of mine needs you, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep telling her that,\u201d Joe said, winking at Susannah.</p> <p>Susannah nudged him in the ribs with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the doctor today, Mom?\u201d she asked quickly.</p><p>Vivian nodded. \u201cHe says I\u2019ve got a ways to go, but I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will,\u201d Joe said, \u201cand Susannah and I will visit often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Bring some of those flowers when you do.\u201d She reached for her napkin. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy giving up my home, but I realize now it was the best thing for me. Changing careers will be good for Susannah, too.\u201d Her mother sounded more clearheaded than she had all summer.</p><p>\u201cI think so, too, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you this happy in...in years, Susannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy, Mom. I feel wonderful.\u201d Her mother might be experiencing memory problems, but her intuition was in excellent working order. Although Susannah hadn\u2019t said a word about her father, she knew that Vivian sensed she\u2019d made peace with the past and was looking forward to her future.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her mother nodded once. Using the napkin to dab her mouth, she casually said, \u201cGeorge was by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Susannah asked, sharing a secret smile with her husband.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, my friend George from Altamira. He didn\u2019t get to stay long, but it\u2019s nice to have company.\u201d Her mother blushed as she said it. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing romantic about it, mind you. George is my friend. He told me there\u2019s a big bingo pot building and I should hurry back before someone else gets it.\u201d Then she abruptly switched gears. \u201cFannie\u2019s Flowers? Will you keep the name?\u201d</p><p>Susannah hadn\u2019t thought about that yet; the idea was still being born. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you have a suggestion?\u201d</p><p>Her mother nodded, eyes twinkling. \u201cCall it Susannah\u2019s Garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusannah\u2019s Garden,\u201d she repeated slowly. She liked the sound of it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a yarn store next door,\u201d Joe added. \u201cThey apparently offer classes.\u201d</p><p>This was good news. Her mother had taught her to knit years ago, but Susannah hadn\u2019t picked up her needles in far too long. She\u2019d love to take a class if she could fit it into her new schedule.</p><p>Vivian lay back against the pillow, looking tired.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you rest now, but we\u2019ll be back later,\u201d Susannah said.</p><p>Her mother accepted Susannah\u2019s kiss on her cheek. Grabbing hold of her arm, Vivian whispered, \u201cJoe loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I love him, too,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>As they approached the elevator, Joe stole a kiss before he pushed the call button.</p><p>Stepping into the elevator, she moved into Joe\u2019s arms. \u201cI hope you know how very much I love you.\u201d</p><p>Joe backed her into the corner and kissed her passionately. They hardly noticed that the elevator had come to a stop and the doors slid open.</p><p>\u201cLook, Mom, newlyweds,\u201d a young girl squealed from the hospital lobby.</p><p>Embarrassed, Susannah and Joe disentangled their arms and self-consciously walked onto the marble floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you newlyweds?\u201d the youngster asked.</p><p>Joe chuckled. \u201cIn a manner of speaking, we are,\u201d he told her, reaching for Susannah\u2019s hand.</p><p>She\u2019d found her husband again this summer\u2014the summer that changed everything. </p> </body></html>"]
