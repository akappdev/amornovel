It\u2019s called a frittata.\u201d Sorrow scooped her egg, potato, and bacon creation onto a plate and held it out to her father. \u201cIt\u2019s the same food you just ordered, just a different shape. See?\u201d She prodded it with a fork. \u201cBacon, eggs, and hash browns, only all mixed up.\u201d</p><p>Bear Bailey gave it a quick, skeptical examination. \u201cMangled up, more like. Nothing beats Sully\u2019s scrambles.\u201d He gave their fry cook a conspiratorial wink. \u201cAin\u2019t that right, Sully?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Sully spared him a sharp nod before getting right back to work, his entire focus on a griddle jammed full of pancakes. The man found ways to express his independence, but going against his employer wasn\u2019t one of them. Sorrow supposed you could take the man out of the military, but you couldn\u2019t take the military out of the man.</p> <p>\u201cMore for me then.\u201d She stepped around Sully, but at the last minute, snuck a bit of her frittata onto a plate for him, giving the man a pointed look.</p><p>What her father didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt him. He\u2019d never change the menu at his Thirsty Bear Tavern, but Sorrow\u2019s life would be dull if she didn\u2019t steal her moments of quiet rebellion.</p><p>Sully just shook his head. He\u2019d witnessed some version of this same father-daughter argument for years.</p><p>Speaking of arguments...\u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d Sorrow asked, plopping onto a stool next to her dad. She\u2019d overheard him railing on about something the night before, and it hadn\u2019t exactly sounded like a two-way conversation. The silence from her mother had been deafening\u2014she might as well not even have been in the room. Not that her father was prone to yelling. Bear Bailey just liked to...hold court.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at the front desk,\u201d he said, swabbing a piece of bacon in a puddle of syrup. We got two guests coming in this morning. Young couple from Sacramento. Snowshoe types, most like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll need a helluva lot more than snowshoes if this keeps up.\u201d Sully wiped his hands on his apron and leaned against the pass-through between kitchen and tavern.</p><p>Sorrow followed the direction of his gaze. What had started as a light dusting of snow that morning had thickened into dense flurries in the past half hour.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really coming down now,\u201d her father said, swiveling on his stool to look out the window. \u201cLooking like a slow one for business today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so.\u201d She felt light at the prospect. Maybe things would be calm enough for her to roast a nice cut of meat for dinner. Maybe even bake a pie for dessert. Her dad wouldn\u2019t be able to complain about that.</p><p>Helping run her family\u2019s lodge and tavern wasn\u2019t exactly Sorrow\u2019s dream come true, but her older sister and brother had fled the nest, and then her father had his stroke, and she\u2019d been left holding the bag. Though her mother was a definite help, by no means was she strong enough to do all the work on her own. It was Sorrow\u2019s opinion that her mom too often let Dad call the shots anyhow.</p><p>With her siblings gone, family dinners gradually became a thing of the past, and increasingly it was Sully who served up their meals. For Sorrow, what\u2019d started as an aversion to the man\u2019s \u201cTurkey Loaf\u201d blossomed into a passion for cooking.</p> <p>It started slowly with tricks she picked up on TV cooking shows. Pasta dishes that relied on more than a jar of Rag\u00fa. Soups came next\u2014she still marveled how you could add some meat, salt, and veggies to a pot of water and end up with the tastiest dinner ever.</p><p>Soon the kitchen became her refuge. She loved the creativity of it. Loved the different flavors. She was stuck in a small town, living with her parents, helping run their inn, but when she was in the kitchen, she could make enchiladas and take off for Mexico. Or whip up a simple bruschetta and whisk herself off to Italy. Though one of these days, she\u2019d settle for whisking herself off to a fancy restaurant in the city, with white tablecloths and big goblets of wine.</p><p>She loved cooking so much, she could even imagine doing it professionally\u2014and what a dream that would be. Not that she\u2019d ever get the chance.</p><p>Alone in the kitchen, her problems dropped away. Cooking demanded focus\u2014stirring before something burned, chopping the veggies just right\u2014and it always managed to push all other concerns from her mind. And she had a lot of concerns.</p><p>Stupid stuff nagged her, and she hated all of it. Housekeeping issues, plumbing issues, money issues...all the issues that cropped up in the running of a creaky old lodge in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains.</p><p>\u201cYou sure I can\u2019t make you a side of bacon?\u201d Sully\u2019s voice startled her from her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d she asked, catching him watching her.</p><p>\u201cBacon. I can make it crispy. You used to like that.\u201d</p> <p>She gave him a warm smile. \u201cGood memory.\u201d</p><p>Sully had arrived in Sierra Falls when she was a kid, rolling into town on a Harley. He was a quiet sort, a restless and rambling soul, but theirs was a very live-and-let-live sort of town, and he\u2019d taken to the place.</p><p>He stayed on as cook for the tavern attached to her family\u2019s Big Bear Lodge. Folks shortened his name from Tom Sullivan, so as not to confuse him with Tom Harlan, who ran the hardware store across town. And like that, it was as though Sully had been in Sierra Falls forever.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t exactly prone to sharing\u2014Sorrow knew he\u2019d done time in Vietnam and that he\u2019d been married a few times, but that was about the extent of it. Even so, he was a good man, and she\u2019d come to think of him as an adoptive uncle figure.</p><p>She shook her head. Time to get going. It was already 8:30, and her days didn\u2019t so much begin, as they tended to explode out of control. \u201cI\u2019m good, Sully. But thanks.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow scraped the last of her breakfast to the center of the plate so she could mash it into the tines of her fork and savor every last bite. Next time, she\u2019d try adding tomatoes\u2014maybe sun-dried, so the eggs wouldn\u2019t get too runny.</p><p>She pushed away from the counter and bussed her dishes, catching sight of the conditions outside. \u201cI should get going.\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t had much snow over the holidays, but now that it was January, winter seemed to have begun in earnest. It was accumulating fast out there. While a light dusting was great, too much snow on the road became a hassle, and she worried this was headed toward hassle territory.</p><p>Being in the foothills, they didn\u2019t get as much weather as Lake Tahoe to the northeast, but still, there was snow and ice aplenty, and it plagued her. Keeping the lodge standing was trouble enough\u2014keeping the place warm and weatherproofed through the winter months consumed her. \u201cDuty calls,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cThe floor\u2019s all yours, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Sully dinged the small bell on the window between tavern and kitchen. \u201cOrder up.\u201d</p><p>Bear looked around for the woman who worked as their bartender and waitress. \u201cWhere\u2019s Helen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet she\u2019s stuck in this mess.\u201d Sorrow shook her head sympathetically. \u201cShe\u2019s got three kids at two different schools, and if it\u2019s a snow day...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, someone\u2019s gotta do her job.\u201d Her father began to stand.</p><p>She put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou sit, Dad. I got this one.\u201d Ever since the stroke, Bear hadn\u2019t moved around as easily, and Sorrow would just as soon give him the chance to finish his coffee in peace.</p><p>She grabbed the plates from the pass-through and served their handful of diners, all of them locals. Visitors to Sierra Falls were few. It was a small gold rush town, too remote to take advantage of the Tahoe resort area, and too far from Route 50 to catch any tourists coming from Sacramento or the San Francisco Bay Area. It was too out there to be on the road to anywhere, really.</p><p>If her family hadn\u2019t owned the lodge and restaurant outright, they probably would\u2019ve gone under years ago. They saw the occasional hikers, hunters, and fishermen, or folks who\u2019d gotten stuck on the snowy mountain pass and been forced to double back and stay the night. But other than that, the Bailey family income relied mostly on serving predictable meat-and-potatoes dishes to the residents.</p><p>She served Sheriff Billy Preston last. He looked up from the morning paper as she approached. \u201cMorning, Sorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff.\u201d She softened her greeting with a smile.</p><p>She liked the man\u2014there was something quiet and maybe even a bit haunted in his eyes. She\u2019d heard he was a widower, and she tried to meet those eyes whenever they spoke, tried to give him a genuine smile to compensate for whatever demons the man was harboring.</p><p>The sheriff hadn\u2019t lived there long, and time would tell if his troubled look ever went away. She hoped it would. She wished the man well. He\u2019d gotten on her good side from the start by being one of the few whose first words to her hadn\u2019t been to remark about her name. Sorrow was a family name, but sometimes she felt saddled with it, as though in being called a thing, she might be fated to a life of it, like her hard-luck ancestors before her.</p><p>Her father always prattled on about those ancestors\u2014grandmother, great-, and great-great-grandmothers Sorrow. They\u2019d known hard lives that, according to Dad, she herself was destined to relive if she didn\u2019t marry right, or dress better, or hell, if she didn\u2019t clean out the garage and call the plumber.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you before, it\u2019s Billy.\u201d Though his words were gruff, his tone was polite, in that way that seemed unique to men in uniform. He took his plate from her hands, lightening her load. \u201cLooks good.\u201d He added in a low voice, \u201cBut I\u2019d have liked to try that frittata.\u201d</p><p>His conspiratorial tone surprised her. That he\u2014or anyone\u2014wanted to try her food was a kick. She smiled a real smile then. She\u2019d love to cook for people someday, and how kind of Billy to sense it.</p><p>She gave him a piercing gaze\u2014was he truly sad or was it just a trick of those dark eyes? His smiles were genuine, and though they lit his face she wondered if they truly shone any light on his heart.</p><p>Those dark eyes narrowed, and she realized she\u2019d been staring. She gave a little shake to her head. \u201cIf you want frittatas, you\u2019ll have to take it up with the man.\u201d She tilted her head toward her father. He was still seated at the bar, yammering at Sully about something, and he\u2019d likely be in the same spot when she returned at noon for lunch. \u201cBear Bailey isn\u2019t a fan of change.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t know Billy Preston well, and she wasn\u2019t interested in him in that way\u2014she had a boyfriend after all\u2014but she enjoyed how they always exchanged a few words. He\u2019d been a lieutenant in the Oakland PD before being recruited as sheriff for Sierra Falls, and she loved his occasional mention of big-city life.</p><p>An idea hit her. \u201cHold on,\u201d she said, and darted back into the kitchen. She\u2019d baked bread the night before, and the last thing she needed was that many carbs lying around.</p><p>She returned, handing him a small foil-wrapped bundle. \u201cIt\u2019s not a frittata, but my apple cinnamon bread is a close second.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he deadpanned, patting his belly. \u201cWe law enforcement officers only eat donuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Biting back a grin, she pulled the bread out of his reach, doing her best to look offended. \u201cSee if I ever try to feed you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn second thought, it smells too good.\u201d He laughed and snatched it from her hands. \u201cGive me that.\u201d</p><p>She laughed with him, not caring that the others were looking. It was gratifying that she\u2019d been the one to draw out the humor. For the first time that day, the muscles in her shoulders felt like they might relax.</p><p>A hideous sound caused her to seize right back up again.</p> <p>Outside, there was the long whine of creaking timber, followed by a loud crash.</p><p>She and the sheriff locked eyes. For the flicker of a moment, a feeling of comfort cut to her heart, and Sorrow was grateful she wasn\u2019t in it alone.</p><p>Which was crazy, of course. She didn\u2019t even know the man.</p><p>But those thoughts came and went in the blink of an eye, and she was dashing out the door, Billy and the rest of their patrons hot on her heels.</p><p>Two</p><p>Billy Preston\u2019s first thought was that somebody had crashed a car into a tree. His second was of his wife.</p> <p>Every other thought was.</p><p>Only this time, he felt almost guilty when the memories of her slammed back into his mind. He\u2019d been sharing a few friendly jokes with a pretty woman\u2014as though he\u2019d forgotten his past and were a regular guy.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t a regular guy. Three years ago, his wife had been struck and killed by a bus while biking to work. And he hadn\u2019t been there for her.</p><p>There was never any predicting what would return him to that day. No knowing when the odd questions would creep in to haunt him. Things like, what had she eaten for breakfast that day? Had she looked at the newspaper before she\u2019d left that morning? And a desperate curiosity would seize him, plague him.</p><p>This time, it was the sound of crashing from outside that called her back.</p><p>Normally, he held a shield in place through the daylight hours. It let him deflect those bad thoughts, hoarding them for the wee hours. But he\u2019d met Sorrow\u2019s eyes, and the raw connection there startled him. It shattered his guard, sending his mind spinning for an instant.</p><p>Spinning back to those days when he drove his wife to work every day. Every day except for that day. He\u2019d been up late the night before with paperwork\u2014police did reams more of it than they showed on TV\u2014and Keri had insisted he snag the extra twenty minutes of sleep.</p><p>A beat cop delivered the news hours later, just as he was racing out to grab a bite for lunch. It\u2019d taken that long to identify Keri, to track him down as her next of kin.</p> <p>While he\u2019d been showering, and swilling back the rest of his tepid coffee, contemplating whether or not he could get away with skipping his morning shave, his wife had been on the side of the road, dying. While he\u2019d been bitching to the guys about paperwork, she was already gone.</p><p>He\u2019d endured six months of personal leave, a few years of phoning it in, and countless hours at the gym lifting till the muscles in his arms trembled, before an old buddy hooked him up. The small town of Sierra Falls had lost the sheriff they\u2019d known for decades, and did Billy want to step in to fill his shoes? Like that, he was tapped for the ballot, running uncontested, and before he knew it, he was packing up his belongings and heading to the mountains.</p><p>He\u2019d been anxious to get away from the city, from the reminders that lurked everywhere, and now, living in the shadow of the Sierra Nevadas, a part of Billy was able to find some peace.</p><p>The other parts, he simply shut down.</p><p>Sharing that moment with Sorrow had unsettled him. He\u2019d had the eerie feeling that, locking eyes as they had, she could see into his soul, reading his guilt, his pain.</p><p>Billy shoved such silly notions to the back of his mind. He bolted up from his booth. Ran out the door.</p><p>Sheriff once more.</p><p>He and Sorrow stood shoulder-to-shoulder, and it took only a second to realize what\u2019d happened. A tree branch had crashed through the roof of the Big Bear Lodge.</p><p>Billy shook his head slowly. A goodly chunk of the roof had caved in, and it was now one devastated mass of snow, timber, and roofing. If he craned his neck just right, he could see through the hole clear to the attic window on the other side.</p><p>\u201cOh, shh\u201d\u2014Sorrow swallowed the tail end of the curse\u2014\u201csugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and say it. Looks like you could use a good round of swearing.\u201d It seemed the woman managed most every aspect of her family\u2019s business. He guessed this would fall square on her shoulders, too.</p><p>Her arms were crossed tightly across her chest, like she might fly apart if she let go. \u201cIt\u2019s the Sorrow thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d If she was speaking about herself in the third person, maybe she was more upset than he\u2019d realized.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my luck. The Sorrow luck. All the women in my family who\u2019ve been named Sorrow have had atrocious luck. With men. With money. With pretty much everything. Why they keep using that damned name is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>Edith Bailey burst from the lodge, a crocheted shawl clutched at her chest. \u201cWhat on earth\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe roof.\u201d Sorrow spared the briefest glance for her mother then looked back at the devastation. \u201cHow much is this going to cost?\u201d</p><p>They all stepped closer. Billy rested a hand on the pine towering overhead. Peering up into the branches, he said, \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve got some dead branches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew we needed to trim the deadwood.\u201d Sorrow pinned her mom with a look. \u201cI told him we needed to trim the deadwood.\u201d</p><p>Billy didn\u2019t need to ask to guess that by him she\u2019d meant her father, but he knew to mind his own business. Instead, he backed up, shaking clumps of snow from a row of low branches. \u201cThis is some wet snow. And on top of last week\u2019s storm? Too heavy, even for this gorgeous old giant.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow\u2019s mother remained silent, chewing on her thumbnail.</p><p>He hardly knew the Bailey family, but at that moment, her tense presence seemed like the last thing Sorrow needed. Putting his hand at Edith\u2019s back, he gently guided her back toward the door. \u201cYou\u2019re going catch a chill, ma\u2019am. I can help your daughter while you go find yourself a proper coat.\u201d</p><p>Edith stopped in her tracks. \u201cOh good Lord, the hope chests.\u201d In a panic, she called to Sorrow, \u201cYour grandmother\u2019s trunks. The attic will get soaked. You\u2019ve got to go take care of all the trunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Billy continued to herd her back inside, then returned to Sorrow\u2019s side. \u201cWhat trunks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s ten tons of junk in the attic. As if I don\u2019t have enough on my plate.\u201d She turned, trudging toward the lodge entrance.</p><p>The woman looked suddenly so drawn, so alone, Billy couldn\u2019t help himself from falling into step with her. \u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>As she opened her mouth to reply, the wind gusted, enveloping them in a cloud of white. He instinctively reached for her, taking her arm to stop her. It was silly\u2014the cars in the lot were parked, there were no more snow-laden branches overhead, it was perfectly safe\u2014but he couldn\u2019t stop himself.</p><p>They stood like that for a frozen moment. Sunlight caught the snow and it sparkled as it swirled around them. It kissed the fabric of his shirt, damp and clinging to his shoulders.</p><p>When the cloud settled, he found Sorrow\u2019s gaze on him. Watery light cut through the branches and reflected off the snow, and he saw that her eyes were more green than blue.</p><p>Guilt speared him, and he pulled his hand back abruptly. He felt like he was cheating on his wife. Logically, he knew that was ridiculous, but something in his chest told him otherwise.</p><p>There was a brief, awkward silence, and then they both spoke at once.</p><p>\u201cWhat do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is\u2014\u201d</p><p>They each huffed out a humorless laugh. He tried to smile, but suspected he didn\u2019t quite manage it.</p><p>Crossing her arms over her chest, she gave a self-deprecating shrug. \u201cJust my luck, huh?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, anxious to be back to business. \u201cIt might not be so bad.\u201d</p><p>They studied the damage. Snow was still falling, steady and quiet, drifting into the attic in a way that seemed almost diligent.</p><p>\u201cOr not,\u201d he said, correcting himself.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Pain flickered across her face, before she schooled it to a careful, bland half smile. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda bad.\u201d</p><p>He put aside his own pain for a moment, confronted with hers. \u201cSeriously, Sorrow. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cComplaining won\u2019t stop the snow.\u201d</p><p>She was no nonsense. He appreciated that. Just then, he didn\u2019t think he could deal with an overwrought female. \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re a roofer, there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d She bit her lip, deep in thought. Something about it made her seem so alone. \u201cDamien\u2014he\u2019s my...friend\u2014he\u2019s got contacts.\u201d</p><p>Damien. Billy recognized the name and guessed it was the good-looking guy he\u2019d seen around with her. He\u2019d spotted the two of them doing things like eating lunch, or driving in his car, headed out of town.</p><p>Clearly, more than friends.</p><p>Billy wanted to help. He almost offered to help her sort through the attic. But he reminded himself it wasn\u2019t his place. Sorrow already had a man to help her, while Billy had work to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They said their good-byes, and he headed back to the tavern. He needed to pay his bill and get back to it. And then he\u2019d push this strange episode from his mind.</p><p>Three</p><p>Sorrow had sent the sheriff on his way. Something about the look on his face made her feel pitiable, and she hated that feeling. She might need help, but she wasn\u2019t helpless.</p> <p>She especially didn\u2019t want him thinking of her in that light. Billy Preston was once a big shot police lieutenant in a major city, and she hated feeling like she might be a small-town yokel in comparison.</p><p>And anyway, she had a man in her life already, and he loved to help. Maybe it was because Damien was stuck in a suit, sitting behind a desk at his family\u2019s business, but he seemed to relish coming to her aid as much as any knight of old had loved crusading on a white horse.</p><p>Whatever the reason, he was always happy to roll up his sleeves and do things like chop wood, or fix a clogged drain, or perform any of a variety of manly man tasks she might need. Sometimes he was a little too happy about it, smothering her with his manly manness when she didn\u2019t necessarily need it.</p><p>Though there was one task she liked him to perform, and she blushed to think of it. A wistful sigh escaped her. She sure could use a heaping dose of that sort of help right about now. But she pushed the thought aside\u2014this latest crisis was a doozy. She barely had time to shower these days, much less canoodle with Damien, no matter how yummy he looked in his suit.</p><p>She sat on an old stool. Staring blindly at the attic wreckage, she phoned him.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Bailey,\u201d he said, answering his cell the way he always did when she called. He had a smile in his voice, and it was a relief to hear him, even though she never did love his penchant for calling her by her last name. But it was a habit he\u2019d started in middle school, and those things died hard.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d She heard background noise, like the sound of wind and gears shifting. She frowned. \u201cAre you driving?\u201d</p><p>He paused, hesitated. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Damien, you know I hate when you talk and drive.\u201d Even as she said it, she hated even more the naggy sound of her own voice. But he could be so reckless sometimes, acting the bad boy, and she had enough troubles without him wrecking his car. \u201cGod forbid,\u201d she muttered, putting such thoughts to rest.</p><p>\u201cRelax. I\u2019m using that ear thing you got me.\u201d</p><p>She held her tongue for a moment, and decided she\u2019d pretend to believe him. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up? We\u2019re still on for tonight, right?\u201d</p><p>She heard the sounds of spitting gravel and the whine of a rapidly downshifting engine. He drove like an eight-year-old playing with Hot Wheels, but she\u2019d vowed not to henpeck. Instead, she told him, \u201cIt\u2019s the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what, babe?\u201d He cut the engine, and she heard the dinging of the opened car door. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the focus in Damien\u2019s voice, she completely forgave and forgot his crazy driving. He\u2019d work his magic and save the day. She knew a momentary pang\u2014was she taking him for granted?\u2014but she nudged away the feeling. Sorrow was strong and could handle what came her way, but finding a roofer willing to work in this weather was another thing entirely. And Damien, with one phone call, always managed to pull a rabbit out of his hat.</p><p>\u201cThe roof,\u201d she repeated, getting up and wandering to the center of the attic where she could stand fully upright. Snow was blowing in, and she shielded a hand over her eyes, squinting against it. \u201cA branch from that old pine smashed through, into the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was dumping pretty hard this morning,\u201d Damien said, and she heard his car door slam. \u201cI told your dad he needed to cut back that tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. But what Bear wants\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear gets,\u201d he finished, with an irreverent laugh.</p> <p>Everyone in Sierra Falls loved her father, but they also knew how set in his ways the man had become. As far as Bear Bailey was concerned, there was only one way to run the Big Bear Lodge and Thirsty Bear Tavern, and it was his way.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry,\u201d Damien said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have you patched in time for happy hour. What\u2019s the damage?\u201d</p><p>She spun in a circle, assessing. Thankfully the snow was slowing, but the sun was coming out and the temp was rising, and snowmelt had already begun to drip in a steady plop-plop on the attic floor.</p><p>Sometimes she didn\u2019t want her boyfriend to keep swooping in to save the day\u2014but this was definitely not one of those times.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d Snow piled in little drifts around the room, while the lodge\u2019s ambient heat had puddles forming in random cracks and valleys along the warped timber-plank flooring. \u201cI called Jack Jessup, but he said he\u2019s booked solid and can\u2019t come out till next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d he said, and she knew that was enough to settle it. Damien Simmons was the son of Dabney Simmons, CEO of Simmons Timber, a company that provided the bread, butter, and livelihood for much of their town. The Simmons clan owned much of the land in Sierra Falls\u2014if someone in the family wanted a roof patched, it got patched.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Damien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, Bailey. I\u2019ll be sure to get my reward later.\u201d</p><p>He laughed suggestively just as he clicked off, and the sound reverberated in her belly, her body\u2019s response instant. It wasn\u2019t love she felt for him\u2014at least she didn\u2019t think it was\u2014but that didn\u2019t matter. If she ever wondered why she was with the guy, all she had to do was see him in person, and...yowza.</p><p>Damien had a knack with women\u2014he\u2019d had it as a teenager, and he had it in spades now. And though it felt wonderful to be the center of his attention, there was something about it she didn\u2019t trust. Maybe it was leftover from high school, when he hadn\u2019t spared her the time of day.</p><p>But he was hot, she was lonely, and besides, everyone in the town expected it. He\u2019d been out of her league for years, but now that she was one of the few from their class who either hadn\u2019t left town or wasn\u2019t married, everyone expected her to fall head over heels for \u201cthe Simmons boy.\u201d</p><p>Everybody knew him, of course. He was the pride and joy of the Simmons family. Oddly, that was one of the things that appealed to her. Not that he had money, though she sure could\u2019ve used a whole lot more of that in her world. But Damien understood family expectations and responsibilities, and she liked that. Sorrow had family obligations coming out of her ears.</p><p>She just wished he weren\u2019t so heavy-handed with her sometimes. He took care of business for his family, but she didn\u2019t necessarily like the feeling that she was an obligation for him to deal with, too.</p><p>She raked a hand through her hair. \u201cDamien, Damien,\u201d she murmured, not quite sure what to do with him. But now it was time to get back to business.</p><p>Knowing Damien, the roofer would be there within the hour. In the meantime, she might as well do as her mom asked and rifle through the generations of old junk not valuable enough to have a place in the rest of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat a disaster.\u201d She kicked at one of the old trunks. It was the \u201chope chest\u201d of one of the women on her dad\u2019s side. If it\u2019d belonged to one of the Sorrows in his family tree, it was no wonder the thing was still filled with dusty and forgotten hopes.</p><p>She nudged it from the wall to see how even after death, these women had bad luck. The sides were already rippling and peeling, the wood turning cherry-red with damp. Getting ruined on her watch.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, Grandma Sorrow. Or old Auntie Sorrow. Or whoever you were.\u201d Sinking to her knees, she jiggled the old hinge, trying to unfasten it despite years of rust.</p><p>\u201cToo bad they didn\u2019t name Laura after you,\u201d she grumbled. Why her parents hadn\u2019t saddled her big sister with the name Sorrow was beyond her. If they had, maybe Laura would be the one kneeling there in a freezing puddle. \u201cIf I\u2019d had a different name, then maybe I\u2019d be the one off gallivanting around California. I\u2019d be the one with the fancy job and car.\u201d</p><p>But no, her siblings hadn\u2019t been able to run out of Sierra Falls fast enough, abandoning her with things like leaking roofs and rotting trunks. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll find some treasure and then I can have my turn.\u201d</p><p>She finally pried open the lid, and was hit by a wave of mildew and mothballs. \u201cOh, jeez.\u201d She rubbed at the twinge in her nose, looked up at the bright hole in the roof to catch a sneeze. She was going to be sneezing all day, she knew it.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she muttered, digging through the contents in search of whatever needed saving first. \u201cGotta start somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Family photos, important papers\u2014she went through each trunk, systematically setting aside anything that couldn\u2019t be washed or replaced. Most of it was junk, though. Her father had inherited the lodge from his father, who got it from his father, and so on, and much of this stuff was the forgotten, meaningless bits of life that accumulated when you weren\u2019t paying attention. Old ledgers, musty afghans, mildewed picture frames, a warped guitar...she hoped to convince her parents to toss it all in the Dumpster, but knowing Bear and Edith, she feared it was a pipe dream.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she exclaimed as she opened an old Kinney shoebox, revealing stacks of ancient receipts. She shoved the whole thing into a paper bag, planning to sneak it and the rest of the worthless papers to the recycling center in Silver City. \u201cDo they seriously need this stuff?\u201d</p><p>What she saw at the bottom gave her pause, though. The prettiest lace shawl, with ivory crewelwork, yellowed to a color that told her it\u2019d been at the bottom of the trunk for a long time. She pulled it out, afraid the cheap wood might bleed color onto it.</p><p>Something tumbled from the shawl, and she scooped it up. A stack of letters. She held them up to catch the light. \u201cHello there.\u201d</p><p>They were as yellowed as the linen, but otherwise miraculously spared of damage, still bound by a strand of rickrack gone crispy with age. The handwriting was old-fashioned spidery loops, and she got a shiver, knowing in her bones that she held a piece of history. A very intimate piece of history. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carefully, she slid off the ribbon and unfolded the first page. The writing was dense, but two lines at the end popped out:</p><p>Sincerely, and ever your Loving,</p><p>Sorrow</p> <p>\u201cWell, what do you know?\u201d She\u2019d known all her life that hers was a family name, but seeing it written by the owner\u2019s own hand felt thrillingly personal. \u201cWhich Sorrow were you?\u201d</p><p>She plopped onto her bottom. An icy puddle seeped into the seat of her jeans, but she didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d read the date at the top of the letter\u20141851. This could be from none other than her three-times great-grandmother, the first and saddest Sorrow of them all, Sorrow Crabtree.</p><p>Four</p><p>Marlene Jessup sat behind the wheel of her Ford pickup, shaking. She\u2019d skidded off the road right into a snowbank.</p><p>The old truck acted light as a feather\u2014or at least the back end of it did\u2014and it had the nasty habit of fishtailing all over the road at the first hint of flurries. By the end of winter, there was always a bed full of snow to weigh her down, but these early season dustings were always tough.</p> <p>She\u2019d have loved a nice car, something fancy and European-sounding like Volvo or Audi, but when her husband left, he\u2019d taken half of their already lean bank account and stuck her with the pickup.</p><p>He and his new squeeze lived in Pinole now, in some well-to-do development, probably driving some fancy new pickup. The hell of it was, his new wife wasn\u2019t even that much younger. It would\u2019ve stung less if he\u2019d left for some fresh-faced bimbo\u2014she could\u2019ve pointed the finger in blame. But Frank had left her for some late-fifties professional type\u2014something to do with pharmaceutical sales\u2014and soon they\u2019d both retire, at which time they\u2019d probably buy that boat Marlene and Frank had always talked about, and they\u2019d travel the world.</p><p>Some other woman was getting her boat.</p><p>And Marlene was left with the old Ford, two elderly aunts, and an ailing mother to care for, haunted by questions of where she went wrong.</p><p>Not going there, as her grandson would say. She put the truck into reverse, willing her hands to stop shaking. It wasn\u2019t even that cold, dammit. She hit the gas, and there was a horrible whirring sound, her tires spinning uselessly.</p><p>Damned pickup. It had one of those mini backseats that took forever to wrangle her aunts into. She\u2019d wanted a sedan, but Frank had insisted. She slammed her hands on the wheel. She had no use for a damned pickup.</p> <p>If she couldn\u2019t get unstuck, she\u2019d be late to pick up the ladies. Her aunts and mother were a trio, the famous Kidd sisters, Emerald, Pearl, and Ruby, the youngest a spry eighty-two.</p><p>And if she was late to pick them up, they\u2019d all be late for the historical society meeting, and then she\u2019d never hear the end of that. The ladies lived for their meetings.</p><p>Marlene had enough trouble on that front, as it was. She\u2019d stupidly taken on the role of chairwoman, and they were a day late and a dollar short planning and funding the annual Sierra Falls festival.</p><p>It was one of the many quirky events Northern California was known for. Gilroy had their Garlic Festival. Other towns had cherry blossoms, chili cook-offs, art walks, and quilt shows. For Sierra Falls, it was the Spring Fling held every May. It was just January yet, but their coffers were empty. They could host town hall bingo till they were blue in the face, and it wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover a pie-throw much less a whole festival.</p><p>No, she needed to get to that meeting. She petted the dashboard, coaxing, \u201cCome on, girl. Just back us out of here, and I\u2019ll buy you a nice set of snow tires.\u201d</p><p>Marlene hit the gas only to hear that horrible, high-pitched whirring again. With a heavy sigh, she sank her forehead against the wheel.</p><p>She\u2019d have to call one of her boys, but which one? Though Jack and Eddie lived the closest, she\u2019d hate to bother them\u2014they\u2019d started Jessup Brothers Construction and had been running around like one-armed paperhangers ever since.</p><p>There was always Jack\u2019s wife, Tina, but she was never around during the day. Or maybe her daughter-in-law only seemed to disappear whenever Marlene needed her. God only knew how the woman occupied her daylight hours\u2014their son was a senior in high school and almost completely independent, so it wasn\u2019t that she was toodling around, driving carpools. Regardless, Marlene wasn\u2019t about to call her.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t call Mark either\u2014he was a doctor in Silver City, and as she recalled, this was his on-call day.</p><p>That left Scott. He worked as a park ranger for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy\u2014his truck would surely be able to get her unstuck. He was her second oldest, her easy, smiling boy.</p><p>She rifled in her purse for her phone. Where had the years gone? Her boy had turned thirty-four on his last birthday.</p><p>It was getting real cold, real fast in the cab of the truck, but she had to pull off her gloves to dial, and her fingers fumbled over the tiny cell phone buttons.</p><p>There was a rapping on the window, and Marlene jumped about a foot off the seat. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>She wiped the condensation off with her sleeve, revealing the new sheriff. He was a big man, filling her view, and adrenaline exploded in her chest. She glanced at the rearview mirror and, sure enough, he\u2019d pulled his sheriff\u2019s SUV right up behind her, the white four-wheel drive looming on the narrow shoulder.</p><p>Why did the sight of a police car make her panic? She told herself to calm down\u2014she couldn\u2019t have been speeding, she hadn\u2019t even been moving. Marlene rolled down the window. \u201cDid I...is there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, Mrs. Jessup?\u201d Billy Preston\u2019s eyes were warm and concerned.</p><p>She put a hand to her chest, relieved. She wasn\u2019t in trouble\u2014he was worried about her. This new sheriff was a nice young gentleman.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cCall me Marlene. Jessup was my husband\u2019s name. There\u2019s another Mrs. Jessup now.\u201d That last bit had come out a bit snappier than she\u2019d meant it to.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Marlene,\u201d he said slowly. His eyes went to her hands, and she realized they were shaking even more than before. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I am...I don\u2019t know. Maybe not.\u201d She wriggled her fingers, then tried to put her gloves back on. Why was her body not cooperating? \u201cIt\u2019s hell growing old. Beats the alternative, I suppose.\u201d She gave a shake to her head. Maybe the cold was getting to her\u2014she was rambling like a crazy woman.</p><p>The sheriff opened the door and escorted her out. \u201cLet\u2019s get you in my truck. You warm up, I\u2019ll shovel you out, and we\u2019ll get you on your way.\u201d</p><p>She looked back over her shoulder at her pickup. The snowbank wasn\u2019t high, but she\u2019d managed to get her front wheels firmly entrenched. \u201cThe darned thing was skidding all over the place,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Cars whooshed by as they walked along the shoulder, and she found her legs were trembling, too.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Marlene.\u201d He chafed warmth into her arm.</p><p>She leaned into him, a reassuringly solid man at her side. \u201cI think I\u2019m just cold is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll blast the heat. You\u2019ll feel better in no time.\u201d He settled her in the front seat, and as promised, he cranked the heat all the way up.</p><p>She put her hands over the vents, relieved to feel the hot air blowing up the sleeves of her coat. How had she gotten so jittery? She wasn\u2019t a jittery sort of woman. She breathed deeply, trying to calm down.</p><p>\u201cSomething sweet is what you need.\u201d Billy pulled a foil-wrapped sack from atop the dash. \u201cApple cinnamon bread. Still warm from the oven.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, eyes wide. \u201cYou cook?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNot me, no. I got this from Sorrow Bailey, down at the lodge. She baked it.\u201d Seeing that she took a bite, he gave her a firm nod, and shut the car door.</p><p>Marlene chewed slowly. It was good bread, just a little bit of sweet, yet substantial, too. Now the question was: how did the sheriff end up with homemade bread from the Bailey girl\u2019s kitchen? Sorrow was with Damien, and a young girl would be a fool to step out on the rich and handsome Simmons boy. She\u2019d pelt Sorrow\u2019s mama with questions next time she saw her, that was for sure.</p><p>A bite of food spiced with a bit of speculation perked Marlene up, both in body and spirit.</p><p>Billy grabbed a bag of gravel and a small shovel from the back of his SUV and set to work freeing her front wheels. It was a testament to the Sierra Falls community that the sheriff\u2019s snow shovel got more action than his sidearm ever did.</p><p>He bent down to spread the gravel evenly at the base of the tire. Marlene tilted her head...my, my, but the man had a fine set of shoulders. He was built like a bull. A strong, solid sort of man.</p><p>Fishing another slice of bread from Billy\u2019s stash, she nestled deeper in the front seat, nibbling at the snack like it was popcorn at the movies. The sheriff shoveled and spread gravel, got into her truck, and sure enough, he was able to back it out. Marlene was almost disappointed to see the thing freed from the embankment.</p><p>Billy opened her door. \u201cFeeling better?\u201d His cheeks were flushed and damp from the cold and flurries.</p><p>There was nothing like seeing a man after a job well done. If only she were thirty years younger.</p><p>Marlene gave him a broad smile as she let herself out of his truck. \u201cMuch.\u201d</p><p>He returned her smile, wary surprise in his expression.</p><p>She thought she must look like a loony bird and toned down her grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve been too kind, Sheriff Preston, and I thank you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I get to call you Marlene, then you\u2019ve got to call me Billy.\u201d He gave her a wink, and her heart thumped in a way that had her wishing she had a daughter she could foist onto the man.</p><p>\u201cThen thank you, Billy.\u201d Marlene handed him the aluminum foil. She\u2019d folded it into a careful square. \u201cHomemade bread is good for what ails you, I always say. Sorry I didn\u2019t leave you any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry,\u201d he said as he walked her back to her truck. \u201cI had my fill earlier. Once you start eating the stuff, it\u2019s hard to stop.\u201d He opened her door, and the old hinges creaked. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re all right to drive?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She checked her watch. \u201cI\u2019m sure I won\u2019t be all right if I\u2019m late to our monthly meeting.\u201d</p><p>He ushered her into her seat, a true gentleman. \u201cMeeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe historical society.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Spring Fling women. The last festival happened just before I moved into town. Can\u2019t wait to go to my first\u2014your BBQ cook-off is the stuff of legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there even is a festival,\u201d she grumbled. He raised his brows, waiting for more explanation, so she continued, \u201cWe\u2019re broke. I swear, sometimes it feels like the town\u2019s dying. We can hold bake sales and bingo nights till the cows come home, and it won\u2019t be enough to cover our expenses.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the open door, looking thoughtful. \u201cWell, if there\u2019s any way to save the tradition, my money\u2019s on you ladies to find it.\u201d</p><p>Marlene smiled as she drove off. Money or no money, the festival budget needed to include one of those strength testers\u2014she bet their new sheriff would be one of the few who\u2019d be able to pick up the sledgehammer and ring that bell.</p><p>Five</p> <p>Sorrow sat on one of the attic trunks, ignoring the flurry of activity around her. She\u2019d been sneaking peeks at the letters all morning, reading snatches of lines here and there. She couldn\u2019t wait to dig in that night. The one she was reading looked like a love letter, written to someone who\u2019d left her ancestor behind.</p><p>She could certainly relate to that\u2014her siblings and just about everyone she\u2019d gone to school with had left town, abandoning her in Sierra Falls.</p><p>Scooting her feet out of the way of one of the roofers, she flipped through the stack. Were they all love letters? It was so frustrating\u2014all she wanted to do was curl up with a cup of tea to read them, but she was stuck with a bunch of careless construction guys instead.</p><p>A horrible slam tore her from her reading. She flew up, scuttling across the attic, hunching so as not to hit her head on the low sloping ceiling. \u201cNo! I mean...please. Oh! Watch the dollhouse.\u201d</p><p>The guys had shown up like bats out of hell, Jack Jessup\u2019s crew more interested in getting the job done than in having a care with any of the Bailey family possessions. She stood protectively in front of the dollhouse from her childhood. \u201cI\u2019d just like to move some things aside, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Apparently the men did mind, as they continued to barrel up and down the stairs, managing to tromp gritty, blackened snow throughout the place. They\u2019d cut away the damaged portion of the roof, and big wet clumps of snow had fallen straight into an opened trunk. So much for her careful piles\u2014between the swirling wind and all the activity, her neat stacks were in shambles.</p> <p>Tucking the letters inside her jeans at the small of her back, she grabbed an armful of what looked to be vintage dresses and hustled them to her room and out of harm\u2019s way. There was still a trunk she hadn\u2019t gone through, and she was wrestling it to the far corner when Damien\u2019s head appeared at the top of the attic stairs.</p><p>\u201cBailey,\u201d he greeted her, but his eyes went straight to the roof and widened. \u201cHoly crap, you weren\u2019t lying. The roof caved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t cave in,\u201d she snapped. \u201cA dead branch crashed through. And your guys are doing a bang-up job at destroying the rest of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa.\u201d He practically leapt up the remaining stairs, his fit body effortlessly closing the distance between them to pull her in his arms. \u201cEasy, babe. What do you need? You want me to help clear this stuff out of the way?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow let herself sink into him, her body shuddering in a big sigh. She should hold her tongue\u2014Damien was there to help. She nodded.</p><p>Keeping one firm arm around her, he shouted at the crew to haul every single trunk, suitcase, and box downstairs. He pulled her out of the way as they jumped into action. Naturally, the place cleared before her eyes.</p><p>She put a hand on his chest, pushing away to look up at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He pinched her chin. \u201cAnything for a lovely lady in distress. And they\u2019re not my guys,\u201d he added with a laugh. \u201cThey\u2019re Jack\u2019s guys, and they\u2019re doing me a favor. They want to patch it up and get out of here as fast as you do.\u201d</p> <p>He hugged her close, then pushed back again, snaking his hand up the back of her sweater. \u201cWhatcha hiding?\u201d</p><p>She playfully swatted his arm away, self-conscious about Jack\u2019s crewmen looking on. \u201cCome downstairs. I\u2019ll put on a pot of coffee and show you.\u201d</p><p>The Bailey family kitchen was sunny and warm, heated by an old woodburning stove that probably broke all manner of environmental laws. The yellow walls and gingham curtains had the feel of something that was in need of a modern renovation, but it was Sorrow\u2019s favorite room in the house, and if anyone wanted to touch it, they\u2019d have to go through her first. Good thing her dad didn\u2019t like change.</p><p>Of course, it had undergone some changes since she was a kid. The tavern was separate from the main lodge, and to keep up with codes, they\u2019d needed to revamp the restaurant kitchen in the nineties.</p><p>Sorrow had been much younger then, but even as a teenager she\u2019d seen her opportunity, and had convinced her dad to upgrade a few of the family\u2019s appliances while they were working on the tavern. Their avocado-green Amana fridge became a nice GE one with ice and water in the door, and the ancient stove had become a decent model, with six burners and a griddle option.</p><p>It was her refuge.</p><p>She prepared Damien\u2019s coffee the way he liked it\u2014black, with just a splash of half-and-half\u2014and brought it to him at the table. Loud crashing and scraping sounds came from above, and she gave his shoulder a distracted squeeze. \u201cCan I get you something to go with that? I made my apple cinnamon bread.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip and, putting his cup down, stood to embrace her. He nestled his face in her neck, his hand sweeping down to cup her backside. \u201cI know what I need, and it\u2019s not food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Damien.\u201d She pushed away with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re a machine.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her back. \u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>For some confusing, illogical reason, she pictured the sheriff again.</p><p>Unsettled, she stepped away. Needing something to do with her hands, she pulled the letters from where she\u2019d tucked them. \u201cI wanted to show you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you something.\u201d He reached for her again.</p><p>She flinched away, annoyed. She was feeling a total disconnect. They had a physical connection, and the sex was always good, but more and more it wasn\u2019t as satisfying. There was just something missing. It made her feel ungrateful, because he really was a great guy. He was always there for her, especially lately.</p><p>Mustering her patience, she tried to make herself heard. \u201cPlease listen, Damien. For once, I\u2019ve got something to think about besides the lodge.\u201d</p><p>He traced a finger along her collarbone. \u201cYou know what I think about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious.\u201d She walked to the counter and began slicing her bread.</p><p>\u201cI am serious,\u201d he said, and she felt him stand behind her. Looking over her shoulder, he spotted what she was doing. \u201cHey, I wasn\u2019t kidding. No bread. I\u2019ve been feeling loose in the cage.\u201d He patted his already hard belly. \u201cI\u2019m cutting out bread and beer for the week.\u201d</p><p>She put her knife down. \u201cLoose in the cage? The only thing loose on you are a few screws.\u201d</p><p>The guy was all discipline\u2014except when it came to nookie. She turned and saw the hunger in his eyes, and scooted to avoid him. \u201cDamien.\u201d She attempted a playful laugh, but there was an edge to it. \u201cI really want you to see this. I\u2019m excited about it. Besides, you cannot expect me to get\u201d\u2014she lowered her voice\u2014\u201cyou know, in the mood, with all this going on.\u201d She pointed at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat better time?\u201d He fingered a slice of the bread, considering it, then shoved it away decisively. \u201cAll that hammering, babe. You could make all the noise you wanted, and nobody would even hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m showing you what I found.\u201d She sat at the table, effectively putting an end to his seduction, and settled the stack of letters before her.</p><p>Damien sighed and sat across from her. \u201cOkay, Bailey\u2014shoot. What\u2019d you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetters.\u201d She untied the quaint rickrack and sifted through to find the one she was looking for.</p><p>He squinted at them in disbelief. \u201cI\u2019m being denied a booty call for a bunch of old letters? Come on, Bail.\u201d He reached across to take her hand and swept his thumb in circles along her palm. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta get back soon. We\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p><p>Normally, her blood would heat at that touch, but she had things on her mind. She tugged her hand free. \u201cNo, really. They\u2019re not just any old letters. They\u2019re from my great-great-great-grandmother, Sorrow Crabtree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor woman,\u201d he said, tapping his fingers on the table.</p><p>His tone drew her eyes up. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorrow Crabtree...that\u2019s some name.\u201d There was a short bzz-bzz sound, and he pulled his cell phone from his pocket. He considered it for a second before putting it on the table.</p><p>\u201cNo, listen. There\u2019s a story behind it.\u201d She\u2019d heard it since birth. She guessed it was the consolation prize\u2014she got a weird name but a good story. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason behind the name. Her father had loved his wife so much, that when she died in childbirth, he named their child Sorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Is that what\u2019s in the letters?\u201d Damien reached distractedly for them, and something about the gesture had her feeling protective.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, scooping up the stack before he did. She needed to make him understand the importance. She wanted somebody to get it\u2014she\u2019d tried to explain to her mom, but she hadn\u2019t wanted to listen either. \u201cLet me read a bit. Get this: it\u2019s dated April 1851. Can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d he said automatically, but it didn\u2019t sound like he meant it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut wait. That\u2019s not the crazy thing. Listen.\u201d Scanning down the page, she found the line she wanted and read, \u201c\u2018You may be fancy, Mister Buck Larsen, but my mama told me to stay away from men like you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him expectantly and caught him stealing a surreptitious glance at the screen of his cell, checking the time. Apparently Damien had a lot more time for sex than he did for old letters.</p><p>\u201cBuck Larsen,\u201d she repeated, emphasizing every syllable. In the ranks of Old West legends, Buck Larsen was right up there with men like Kit Carson, or Davy Crockett, or Daniel Boone even. Pioneer, frontiersman, and later, author and statesman\u2014he was a California legend. She jabbed the table with her finger. \u201cHe lived here. In Sierra Falls. During the gold rush. Before he became, you know, Buck Larsen.\u201d</p> <p>A light finally clicked on in Damien\u2019s eyes. \u201cCool,\u201d he said, and this time it sounded like he meant it.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sorrow said triumphantly. \u201cBut it gets better.\u201d She rifled through the pages. \u201cEvery single one of these is written to him, from Sorrow Crabtree. I guess she was too chicken to send them. Ah\u201d\u2014she placed one sheet at the top\u2014\u201chere\u2019s where it gets really good. \u2018If I\u2019d told you the boy was yours, would you have come back to me?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, they had a kid? That is pretty cool, Bailey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just any kid,\u201d said Sorrow. \u201cDon\u2019t you get what this means? It means I\u2019m related to Buck Larsen.\u201d</p><p>Her mother appeared at the door. \u201cShe tell you her news?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, Edith.\u201d Damien stood to greet her, as well-mannered and articulate as his parents. Dabney and Phoebe Simmons were the Sierra Falls answer to royalty, and they\u2019d raised their prince right. \u201cYour daughter was just telling me. Very exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know before, who the father was.\u201d As Sorrow spoke, she watched Damien pocket his phone in a way that told her he was about to make his escape.</p><p>She felt an unexpected breath of relief, and the reaction surprised her. But she wanted to be alone to finish her work so she could curl up with her great-great-great-grandmother.</p><p>Her mom noted the same thing, and said, \u201cOne favor before you leave, hon?\u201d</p><p>Damien tipped an imaginary hat. \u201cAnything for you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m late for my hair appointment, but the car won\u2019t start.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrow shook her head, marveling. First the roof, now this. \u201cWhen it rains, it pours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got cables in my car,\u201d Damien said at once. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>As her mom went for her coat, Sorrow repeated a thank-you. Damien seemed in the business of saving her family\u2019s collective hides.</p><p>\u201cNo prob. I\u2019m happy to jump-start the car, seeing as I\u2019m not getting jumped in here.\u201d He winked and gave her a quick kiss. \u201cSeriously, Bailey. It\u2019s all good. Congrats on those letters\u2014pretty cool. Don\u2019t forget us little people when you\u2019re a famous California icon.\u201d He shouldered into his coat. \u201cYou need anything\u2014and I do mean anything\u2014just give a call.\u201d</p><p>And with that last flirty comment, her boyfriend breezed out the door.</p><p>Six</p><p>Unloading all this meat in the slushy parking lot was a pain in the neck. Or in the lower back, to be precise.</p><p>Sully hauled another side of beef from the trunk. He\u2019d driven the Jeep to Reno for his monthly stocking up, and he supposed he should be thankful he could still do this at his age. There were plenty of men who couldn\u2019t. Look at Bear, shuffling around with his bum leg after that stroke.</p> <p>Still, sometimes he wanted to get back on his bike and ride off. It felt like he\u2019d wandered for years, searching for something, but he could spend his whole life waiting and that mysterious something would never appear.</p><p>Damien breezed out the door, with Edith on his heels. They spotted him at the same time, calling out their hellos.</p><p>Edith stopped short and faced Damien. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Sully was back. I\u2019m sure he can give me a jump. I don\u2019t want to trouble you.\u201d</p><p>Sully had plenty on his plate already but kept his mouth shut. He knew as well as Edith that her offer had been merely a formality. Lately, Damien seemed to take every opportunity he could to help anyone even remotely related to Sorrow. The kid was worse than a rent collector, coming around like he did. The thing of it was, Sully had begun to wonder just how much the girl even wanted his help.</p><p>Sure enough Damien told her, \u201cEdith, you know helping you is never any trouble.\u201d</p><p>He certainly was a smooth operator. But Sully was happy enough to be left out of it all. He hid his amusement as he pulled a pallet of bread and buns from the back and carried it to the tavern.</p><p>Granted, Sully appreciated the fact that someone was looking out for Sorrow, giving her a hand. But there was something that wasn\u2019t perfect about the fling those two were having. And by the way some of the women acted around Damien, you\u2019d have thought things would be perfect.</p><p>He supposed a girl wouldn\u2019t exactly be overwhelmed with dating options in a small town like Sierra Falls. Especially someone like Sorrow, who was too busy to get to nearby Silver City to experience any sort of nightlife.</p><p>His eyes cut back to Damien. He liked the kid well enough, but he was a smidge too suave. Maybe that was why, when Sully saw the two of them together, he just didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>Damien popped Edith\u2019s hood. \u201cDid you leave the lights on? That\u2019ll burn out the battery in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never do. It beeps if I try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the interior lights,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019ll burn through the juice, too, if they\u2019re left on all night.\u201d</p><p>Sully heard Bear\u2019s heavy step and turned to find him staring at Damien and Edith.</p><p>Bear\u2019s cheek jumped, just a little tic. \u201cThat boy\u2019s got the town charmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your women seem to be at the top of the list,\u201d Sully said, but his comment made Bear scowl, so he added, \u201cHey, Sorrow could do worse. It\u2019s nice for a woman to have a man around. Buy her dinner, tell her she\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>Bear\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cMy fool daughter seems to want to cook her own dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. A girl likes to feel appreciated.\u201d Sully grew serious, thinking how appreciation should start at home. \u201cShe\u2019s a special girl. Good on Damien that he noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat damned sheriff seemed to be doing some noticing earlier. He\u2019s been coming around more than usual.\u201d</p><p>Sully pondered that. \u201cYeah, I suppose I have seen his eyes on her once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know if I should encourage it or punch the man,\u201d Bear said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s never wise to hit a lawman.\u201d</p><p>Edith\u2019s car engine roared to life, and Damien hit the gas a few times to rev it.</p><p>\u201cLooks like Superman saved the day.\u201d Bear said it with a bitterness that sounded like he still wanted to be Edith\u2019s Superman. At least to Sully\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cNo surprise there,\u201d Sully said. Whatever he thought about Damien Simmons, the guy was capable.</p><p>Bear turned his attention to the Jeep, peering in the back. \u201cHey, Sergeant, these groceries ain\u2019t going to unload themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Major to you.\u201d Shouldering past Bear, he hauled a couple of beef tenderloins from the back. When Bear bent to help him, he saw the man\u2019s hands tremble and gave him a sharp look. \u201cAnd I\u2019m ordering you to get your hands off my ground round.\u201d</p><p>A cloud darkened Bear\u2019s features. \u201cSeems to me, I paid for it, and I\u2019m perfectly able to carry it, too.\u201d</p><p>Sully counted to ten in his head. Bear hadn\u2019t been the same since the stroke\u2014no man would be after such a thing. But he fought his weaknesses, as well as everyone else who was there to witness them.</p><p>Edith scurried over. \u201cBear, I need you.\u201d</p><p>That got his attention\u2014the woman knew her husband, that was for certain. Bear raised his brows in silent question.</p><p>She said, \u201cDamien says we need to keep the car running for a half hour to recharge the battery.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would you do it, honey? Sit in the car for me? I\u2019m so chilly, and these gloves aren\u2019t doing anything.\u201d Edith flexed her fingers to prove her point. \u201cI need to go in and find my good driving gloves. The lined ones make all the difference.\u201d</p><p>Sully saw what the woman was doing and wondered if Bear did, too.</p><p>The man scowled. \u201cCan\u2019t we just let the damned car run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of leaving it on with nobody in it. Come on, I turned on the radio, so you can listen to the game while you wait. I\u2019ll just be a second.\u201d She paused significantly. \u201cUnless you\u2019re cold, too?\u201d</p><p>That got him. \u201cI don\u2019t get cold easy, you know that.\u201d</p><p>Bear shuffled to the car, and Edith caught Sully\u2019s eye and winked. She did a good job keeping her husband busy, making him feel needed in little ways.</p><p>He got back to unloading the Jeep. He\u2019d wasted too much time jawing with Bear, and now telltale wet spots were starting to form on some of the cardboard boxes as food began to thaw.</p><p>Tucking a couple of tenderloins under his arm and a case of corn dogs in the other, Sully thought how he genuinely didn\u2019t mind the work. Physical labor was good for a man. It cleared the mind. And with three tours in Nam under his belt, there\u2019d been a lot of memories to clear.</p><p>Besides, he liked helping the Bailey family. Truth was, he\u2019d come to love them. He\u2019d been kicking around there long enough\u2014he\u2019d have to be one hard-hearted son of a bitch not to love someone like Sorrow as his own kid.</p><p>There was Bear Junior, too, though he was away on his second tour in Afghanistan. Sully had felt as proud as Bear Senior on the day the boy announced he was going ROTC, and even more so when the kid made the cut and joined the Corps after graduation. Though, as an Army man, Sully could never resist getting in a ribbing around the annual Army-Navy game. Hooah. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They didn\u2019t see Laura enough either. The eldest Bailey girl sure did have piss and vinegar running through her veins. Even though her apartment in San Francisco was just four hours away, she didn\u2019t visit all that often. And when she did, she had a habit of waking up after a few days with eyes like a trapped animal, ready to cut and run back to life in the city.</p><p>But cutting and running was something Sully understood. Just passing through had been his motto when he arrived in Sierra Falls a few decades back. He\u2019d been a lethal combination of aimless but exhausted, roaming the country on his bike, trying to make sense of what\u2019d happened between the years 1968 and 1972. Or maybe just what\u2019d happened to him. He\u2019d gone straight from West Point to Vietnam, and when the time came for the \u201ccoming back\u201d part of hell and back, it was a whole other world he found waiting for him.</p><p>A couple of wives. A couple of motorcycles. A couple dozen jobs and a couple thousand miles later, he\u2019d rolled into Sierra Falls. Something about the place had made it hard to leave.</p> <p>He slammed the Jeep doors shut. His eyes went to Bear, sitting in the car, peering at that radio like he might be able to alter the destiny of the San Francisco Forty-Niners. The Baileys had come to be like family to Sully, up to and including that grumpy old son of a bitch.</p><p>As Sully made his way back into the tavern, he breathed in deeply. The mountains had air so pure he felt cleaned down to his soul. He always thought he\u2019d leave Sierra Falls, but he kept putting it off until one day he realized he had a job. A place to live. A place.</p><p>After the war, he\u2019d cut himself off from the world. But here he was, caught up in life again, and it felt good. He didn\u2019t know when it\u2019d happened, but he\u2019d woken up one morning to realize he had friends. Family.</p><p>Sully hoped some good would come of those letters that had Sorrow so jazzed. The girl needed something to spur her out of the rut she was making for herself.</p><p>And then there was Bear Junior\u2014he owed the kid an e-mail. BJ had heard about Damien and wanted to make sure he had good intentions. What would the boy think if he found out the sheriff had also been sniffing around his sister?</p> <p>There was another person who\u2019d been coming around the lodge a lot lately. Marlene Jessup.</p><p>Pausing at the door, Sully shook his head in appreciation. Sassy eyes, shapely legs, and a mouth that could bring a man to his knees. Now there was a person he\u2019d like to get friendly with.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Billy closed his cell phone and sat in the SUV, parked along the thin, gravelly strip that was the tavern lot. He and Scott Jessup were supposed to meet for an after-work beer, but the ranger just canceled last minute.</p><p>Scott was an unexpected mix of thoughtful and boisterous, a good man with an easy laugh. They\u2019d first met several months ago, both called in on the same missing person report. When it turned out to be nothing more than a stoned, wandering hiker, they\u2019d gone for a beer.</p><p>He\u2019d been one of the few with nerve enough to ask about Billy\u2019s late wife\u2014for some reason, most other people avoided the topic altogether, as if it might\u2019ve slipped his mind otherwise. But Scott received the story with a heartfelt word and an unwavering eye, and the sheriff had held him in high regard ever since.</p> <p>Friday night beers had become their routine. Except tonight Scott couldn\u2019t make it. Something about a bear breaking into someone\u2019s garage, devouring everything in their chest freezer.</p><p>He peered over at the main lodge but couldn\u2019t see the roof from where he sat in the car. Had it been fixed? He kept putting it out of his mind, but something about the Bailey girl kept popping it back in his head again. For an instant, she had looked so desolate. Had her boyfriend helped her? Had she been able to seal off the attic? It\u2019d been just yesterday when the branch fell through, but if nobody had helped her yet, the whole house would be freezing by now.</p><p>How was she? There was something about her that seemed forgotten, or overlooked. Like people noticed her, but didn\u2019t really see.</p><p>He slammed his hand on the steering wheel. What was his damned problem? \u201cWhat the hell,\u201d he grumbled, cursing himself. Sitting there thinking about some girl.</p><p>He\u2019d had his girl. He\u2019d married her. And now she was gone.</p><p>Billy put his key back in the ignition. Buckled his seat belt. With Scott canceling, there was no need to go inside. He\u2019d drive home, back to the place he\u2019d rented, and get in a good workout. He had a bench and free weights in the garage, and a killer session was always good for keeping the ghosts at bay. Maybe he\u2019d top it off with a beer in front of the tube. Nursing a cold one in front of late-night television until he was too tired to think was sometimes the only way he could get to sleep.</p><p>He hoped the Bailey family could sleep with the wind howling through a gaping hole in their roof.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d He unbuckled again. Got out and slammed the door shut.</p> <p>It was just a friendly visit, to satisfy his curiosity. To make sure everyone was safe and sound. It was something a sheriff would do, and he liked being sheriff. He liked feeling part of this community.</p><p>He knew in his gut he\u2019d done the right thing leaving Oakland for Sierra Falls, shoveling cars out of snowbanks instead of working crime scenes. There was peace to be found in small-town life. It felt right to make a difference in little ways, helping good people, like Marlene or the Baileys.</p><p>He pocketed his keys. He\u2019d just pop in, say hi, see how things were coming along. Maybe have a club soda.</p><p>With so much work to do, Sorrow probably wouldn\u2019t be around anyway. And if she was, he\u2019d keep it formal with her, of course.</p><p>A pack of young twenty-somethings spilled from the tavern, and Billy got out of his vehicle to give them a hard stare. Most folks in search of burgers and beer gathered at the Thirsty Bear, but the younger crowd always migrated to Chances, a noisy bar across town. That was probably where they were headed now.</p><p>His eyes narrowed on the kid taking the driver\u2019s seat. Billy had zero tolerance for drinking and driving. The lone cell at the sheriff\u2019s office was empty. His deputy, Marshall McGinn, was still on duty and would be all too happy to process a DUI offender for the night. But then the kid bid him good evening, and Billy\u2019s shoulders relaxed\u2014he was clearly sober.</p><p>Entering the tavern, he was greeted by a blast of warm air and classic rock coming from the jukebox. He looked around, registering the familiar faces\u2014he believed recognizing people was part of his job. He noted Jack Jessup with some guys from his crew. Helen was behind the bar. Sully was off duty, sitting next to Bear, who looked like he hadn\u2019t moved since yesterday.</p><p>Sorrow didn\u2019t seem to be there, and the brief stab of disappointment caught Billy off-guard. Guilt came on its heels, and he tamped it down. Just a friendly visit\u2014nothing to feel guilty about.</p><p>Helen stopped wiping down the counter to lean against it, cradling her breasts in the fold of her arms. \u201cEvening, Sheriff. What\u2019s a man like you drink after a hard day?\u201d</p><p>He darted his eyes away\u2014to the bar behind her, to the kitchen pass-through, anywhere but at her. \u201cJust a club soda please.\u201d</p><p>The woman was a flirt, and it made him uncomfortable. It wasn\u2019t just that she was too over-the-top for his tastes, but she was married, with a few young kids, too. He imagined she\u2019d probably been something else when she was a teenager, but hers was the sort of cute that didn\u2019t age gracefully. Or at least, not in a way that appealed to Billy. By the slack jaws of several of the other men, he guessed his opinion was in the minority.</p><p>He turned his attention to Sorrow\u2019s father. \u201cHow\u2019s that roof coming along?\u201d</p><p>Bear spun on his barstool and tipped his bottle of Bud toward Jack in a toast. \u201cFixed up, nice and tight. Marlene\u2019s boys know their business. Too bad the other two Jessup brothers didn\u2019t join Jack and Eddie. They\u2019d be rich.\u201d</p><p>Billy couldn\u2019t picture Scott Jessup as anything other than a park ranger, outside all day, beholden to no man. And he didn\u2019t think the fourth brother, Mark, was hurting for money working as a doctor in Silver City. \u201cEither way, you\u2019re lucky. Getting someone to patch a roof in this weather? I don\u2019t care how many Jessups there are to choose from, that\u2019s some feat.\u201d</p><p>Bear puffed his chest. \u201cDamien\u2014he\u2019s my Sorrow\u2019s boyfriend\u2014he\u2019s got his fingers on the pulse here. You\u2019ll learn, if you haven\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>Was Damien\u2019s power in the town what appealed to Sorrow? Billy found himself asking, \u201cWhere is Sorrow this evening?\u201d</p><p>Just being friendly.</p><p>\u201cWhere she always is. The kitchen.\u201d Bear scowled, pausing for emphasis. \u201cWhere she doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>The comment caught him off-guard. \u201cNow there\u2019s a twist. You a forward-thinking man, Bear? Because isn\u2019t the old-school line that a woman\u2019s place is in the kitchen?\u201d Billy chuckled at the thought of Bear Bailey as a women\u2019s libber, but by the look on the man\u2019s face, he didn\u2019t seem to think it was funny.</p><p>\u201cThe girl\u2019s got her mind on things.\u201d Bear took a long pull from his bottle of Bud. \u201cShe always cooks when that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a man who\u2019s eaten one too many Marie Callender\u2019s meals this month, I\u2019ve got to ask: how is that not a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she made some real food, things might be different,\u201d Bear grumbled. \u201cGod only knows what it\u2019ll smell like when I get home. I have to sleep in that lodge, too, you know. Last time she had her mind on something, the place smelled like curry for a week. Disgusting.\u201d He polished off the rest of his beer, and with a nod to Helen had a fresh one almost instantly.</p><p>Billy considered him. The man\u2019s main source of pride appeared to be that Sorrow had landed Damien for a boyfriend. It made him feel defensive on her behalf. \u201cYou should be proud,\u201d he said, even though he knew better than to goad. \u201cShe is something in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Bear went on alert. \u201cWhen\u2019d she cook for you? Sully\u2019s in charge of cooking around here. Nobody makes a better fried chicken. All Sorrow wants to do with chicken is put weird sauces and mushrooms on it. They grow those things in shit, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNah, it wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d Billy said. \u201cShe gave me a few slices of her apple cinnamon bread before I went on patrol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought cops only liked donuts.\u201d</p><p>The comment had been grumpy, but instead of annoying Billy, it gave him a laugh. \u201cI like donuts, too, sir. I just like Sorrow\u2019s bread more. Have you tried it? You put it on the menu, I guarantee it\u2019d make you a small fortune. Best bread I\u2019ve had in some time.\u201d</p> <p>Bear only grunted hmph in reply. He seemed to be formulating a fervent reply, but when he turned in his stool to deliver it, his foot caught and he stumbled sideways off his seat.</p><p>Billy reached out, catching his elbow to steady him. \u201cEasy, sir.\u201d</p><p>The man flinched away, impatience wrenching his features. \u201cI had a stroke. I\u2019m not an invalid, boy.\u201d</p><p>He understood the flare of anger. He guessed Bear had once been as fierce as his name\u2014such a man wouldn\u2019t appreciate growing feeble.</p><p>But the behavior also worried him. The man had tottered on his feet. Was Billy witnessing one too many Budweisers or something else? He was well-versed in first aid\u2014all sheriffs were\u2014and he was particularly on alert where a history of stroke was concerned.</p> <p>He decided to keep the man talking to assess. \u201cWhat\u2019s on her mind then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Bear settled back on his stool, leaning both elbows on the bar.</p><p>The man had a startled look on his face, and Billy knew a wave of sympathy. He kept his voice light and easy. \u201cYou said your daughter has things on her mind. What\u2019s got her so preoccupied she was forced to retreat into the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>The man sniffed. \u201cShe found some letters and has it in her head we\u2019re all related to Buck Larsen.\u201d</p><p>The unexpected turn in the conversation took a moment to register. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Who knows with that girl?\u201d Bear\u2019s expression softened. He spun his bottle around and around on the counter, shaking his head. \u201cShe found some old letters in the attic, and now has a bee in her bonnet about the whole thing. Says my great-granddad was the natural child of Buck Larsen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Buck Larsen?\u201d</p><p>Bear shrugged, but the faint smile on his face said maybe, just maybe, there was indeed something about Sorrow that made him proud. \u201cShe\u2019s at the house, doing her stirring and chopping. Go see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>She dried her prized butcher knife till it gleamed. It was German, used by professional chefs, and had cost her a pretty penny. She hated when even the most minor of water spots marred the surface. Sorrow tilted it up to the light, wondering if it could use a sharpening. After all, a chef was only as good as his\u2014or her\u2014sharpest blade.</p><p>\u201cRemind me not to cross you.\u201d</p><p>The voice in the doorway startled her. Her knife froze, midair.</p><p>Sheriff. The man filled the doorway, those broad shoulders making her pounding heart skip a beat.</p><p>She darted her eyes back to her task, giving it her whole focus. The sauce was simmering, and she\u2019d taken a moment to clean up. A dirty kitchen was one of her pet peeves. \u201cYou know better than to surprise a woman wielding a big knife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s safer than a woman...\u201d His eyes flicked in the direction of the tavern as he made a funny, frightened sort of face. \u201cWell, never mind that.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cBeen at the bar, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, sliding her tools back into the knife block. She knew what he\u2019d been about to say. Helen worked as their part-time waitress and part-time bartender, but she was a full-time flirt. Billy Preston was a fine man\u2014the woman had probably been on him like white on rice. The thing with Helen was, most men seemed to run to her. All except for her husband. And that, Sorrow guessed, was the crux of the issue. But it wasn\u2019t her place to gossip.</p><p>Although she did file in the back of her mind the fact that Billy appeared the sort of man who ran away from such a woman.</p><p>He wandered closer and gave her knives an appreciative nod. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>She loved her knives and had to temper her smile as she thanked him.</p><p>He glanced around the kitchen, quietly taking it all in, and Sorrow wondered what he might be thinking. \u201cYour mother let me in,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me showing up so late in the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary.\u201d The sound of a rapid boil startled her from her thoughts, and she jumped to turn down the burner. She stirred her sauce, relieved it hadn\u2019t burned. She used an arm to brush the hair from her brow. \u201cYour timing is perfect. You\u2019re just in time to clean out that dish for me.\u201d</p><p>He gamely jumped into action, shrugging out of his coat and rolling up his sleeves. \u201cWhat are we making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeef bourguignon.\u201d</p><p>He scraped bits of onion and bacon fat from the casserole into the sink. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean boeuf?\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, she tapped her spoon clean. \u201cImpressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I saw that Julia Child movie.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her hands on her apron then grabbed a sieve from a cabinet under the island. \u201cSo that means you won\u2019t complain if I ask you to hold this for me?\u201d It was time to strain the sauce into the casserole dish, and balancing everything always gave her arms a workout.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do you one better.\u201d He took up both sieve and saucepan with an easy confidence that surprised her. \u201cI\u2019ve got this, you just scrape.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but think of Damien, who was so powerful and in control in other aspects of his life, but magically turned useless whenever he got near a kitchen.</p><p>Billy added, \u201cI\u2019ll only complain if you don\u2019t let me eat it when it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>She raised a brow. Taken aback, but not in a bad way. \u201cSorry, Sheriff. If you saw that movie, you\u2019ll know this sucker doesn\u2019t go in the oven till tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled deeply. Straining the sauce had spread the rich aroma into the air even more than before. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just have to take a rain check. I\u2019d cross an ocean for a good beef bourguignon.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow paused at that. \u201cWould you really?\u201d</p><p>He gave a hearty nod. \u201cI love Sierra Falls, but...good restaurants? That\u2019s the one thing I miss about living in the city. No offense to your tavern,\u201d he added quickly.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cBelieve me, no offense taken. I\u2019d rather...I don\u2019t know...set my hair on fire than eat Sully\u2019s \u2018Prospector\u2019s Pie\u2019 one more time.\u201d</p><p>Billy\u2019s laugh was loud and deep. \u201cWhat on earth is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeat pie,\u201d she said, scrunching her face.</p><p>\u201cHey, sounds good to me. What kind of meat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll kinds.\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cJust how many kinds can there be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d be surprised.\u201d She brought the casserole dish to the refrigerator.</p><p>He jumped to open the door for her. \u201cIs that why you learned to cook? An aversion to mystery meats?\u201d</p><p>She bumped the fridge door shut with her hip. \u201cNecessity is the mother of invention.\u201d But as she washed the dirty sieve, she found herself giving him a real answer. \u201cIf I can\u2019t whisk myself off to another country, well, cooking is a way to bring other countries to me. It lets me travel to other places in my head.\u201d</p><p>Wiping her hands, she turned around, and her smile faded. He stood so close, his body a commanding physical presence suddenly so near, in her private space, the kitchen.</p><p>The silence hung.</p><p>She racked her brain for words and automatically asked, \u201cCan I get you something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I think...\u201d His stomach took the opportunity to rumble, and they both laughed, the awkward moment passed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d said Sorrow.</p><p>\u201cIf your apple bread and the smell of that sauce are any indication, I must confess, I\u2019d love a taste of what you\u2019re serving.\u201d A look washed over his face, and it gave his words a double meaning. \u201cI mean...if you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t want to be an inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I have to eat, too.\u201d She ducked back into the fridge, rifling more than was strictly necessary. The cool air was a relief on her warm cheeks. What was wrong with her? \u201cHow do you feel about pasta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel good about pasta.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Finally a man who didn\u2019t shy away from carbs. \u201cI can pull together a quickie Aglio e Olio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fancy.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the olive oil and made sure there was enough garlic. \u201cIt\u2019s just Italian for \u2018garlic and oil.\u2019 Nothing to it.\u201d</p><p>Billy reached up to grab her colander and big spaghetti pot from their hooks. He held them up in silent question.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said, a little surprised. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He began to fill the pot with water. \u201cWhile the pasta\u2019s boiling, you can tell me about those letters.\u201d</p><p>She froze for the merest second. \u201cYou know about the letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad told me.\u201d</p><p>And he was interested in hearing more about them? Disbelieving, she poured olive oil in a saucepan and added a decent glug of a Pinot Grigio she\u2019d had in the fridge. Her arm hovered in the air a moment. What the hell? She showed him the bottle. \u201cDo you want a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not.\u201d He seemed surprised he\u2019d said it. And a little uncomfortable, too.</p><p>She gave him an extra glug for good measure. She knew she needed one herself. She was feeling a little uncomfortable, too, but in an excited-uncomfortable way. Because she kind of liked having the sheriff in her kitchen.</p><p>The sauce was reducing, the water put up to boil, and it was time to wait. As she joined him at the table, he put a careful fingertip atop the small stack of letters. \u201cAre these the ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d she said. \u201cDated from the 1850s, from my three-times great-grandmother.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head at that, marveling. \u201cWhen I see something that old, it\u2019s impossible not to imagine the person who owned it. Them picking up this paper\u2014it probably cost a lot back then. And then taking their pen in hand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d voiced thoughts she\u2019d had a hundred times herself. Mostly she burned to know exactly who this woman was, this first Sorrow. She was a family mystery. A woman who\u2019d given birth to at least one child out of wedlock, at a time when such things weren\u2019t to be considered. A story had been woven through the generations\u2014but had Sorrow Crabtree really known as hard-luck a life as the tale went?</p><p>Photography wasn\u2019t common back then, and she couldn\u2019t even summon a mental picture of the woman. Sorrow had found a couple of old dresses in the attic and fantasized they\u2019d belonged to her ancestor. A dress did much to describe the woman who wore it, and this woman had been curvy\u2014not unlike herself\u2014with a penchant for low necklines and tight bodices. They were the sorts of dresses a lady didn\u2019t wear on a stagecoach. Instead, they were for dancing, or for shots of whisky at a saloon. For bawdy jokes and hands of poker.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what kind of pens they used then,\u201d Billy said, calling her from her thoughts. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled to herself. \u201cI\u2019d like to find all that stuff out, I think.\u201d</p><p>He skimmed a finger along the side of the stack, and she appreciated his care. \u201cAre they really written to Buck Larsen?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid he write back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing.\u201d She inhaled deeply, back in the moment, and reached for them, taking a few from the top. \u201cMy great-great-great-grandmother Sorrow never sent them. From what I can tell, Buck Larsen lived here, then took off for the capitol, and well, you probably know the story from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and every fifth grader in California.\u201d His eyes caught hers, and there was a look of amazement there. \u201cNow, what they don\u2019t teach is how he left his pregnant lover behind...\u201d</p><p>Sorrow felt a flare in her belly as she locked eyes with this man, heard the word lover come from his lips. She cleared her throat. \u201cLooks that way. I\u2019m reading the rest of them, but it\u2019s slow going. The handwriting is pretty tricky to make out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMay I?\u201d He reached his hand out, and she handed him a random letter. Billy studied it for a moment. \u201cHandwriting is a lost art.\u201d</p><p>She leaned in to look, and he edged toward her, moving the page to where she could see. The movement had been automatic, as had the way she\u2019d scooted closer for a look. Only now their shoulders were touching, and Sorrow found she couldn\u2019t focus on the words.</p><p>But apparently Billy could. She was grateful when he laughed, pointing to a spot low on the page.</p><p>\u201cShe sure does give him what for,\u201d he said. \u201cListen to this: \u2018I\u2019m nothin but a Grass Widow, left for dead. Folk been sayin how grand you are now, living in Sacremennto. I say your nothing but a coward, Buck, runnin like you did.\u2019\u201d Billy leaned back. \u201cHoo-boy. She must\u2019ve been something else, your great-great-great-grandmother. Them\u2019s fightin\u2019 words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. \u2018Grass widow?\u2019 I\u2019m not even sure what that means.\u201d</p><p>He carefully picked another few from the stack, rifling through. \u201cThis is remarkable. Have you read all of them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She realized the excitement buzzing through her was from having another person actually show some enthusiasm. \u201cSo, you\u2019re interested? I mean...you think they\u2019re interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, the letters?\u201d Billy shot her a look. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d</p><p>Damien. Her dad. Her mom. Pretty much everyone else. \u201cI wonder if there\u2019s a way to use these to bring more business to the lodge, but I\u2019m not sure how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should take them to the historical society.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d come from out of the blue, and a quick laugh escaped her. \u201cWhat do you know about the historical society?\u201d Generally, the only person she heard discuss such things was her mother. The other members probably discussed their society ad nauseam during their weekly bridge night, but Sorrow always steered clear, terrified she might get pulled into a round.</p><p>He scooted his chair to face her, looking earnest. \u201cSeriously, they\u2019d probably be able to help leverage the Buck Larsen connection. And answer other questions for you, too, like about pens, and grass widows, and such. I was talking to Marlene just yesterday\u2014\u201d</p><p>Now she really did laugh. \u201cYou were talking to Marlene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was talking to Marlene.\u201d His eyes twinkled, and Sorrow wondered if she and the sheriff were flirting. \u201cApparently they\u2019re having financial trouble. This would be of great interest to them. I take it you\u2019re not a member?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe? No way. That many older women in one room\u2014it\u2019s like a cabal. Each woman\u2019s sole goal to introduce me to their grandson, or grandnephew, or paperboy or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaperboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve known me forever,\u201d she said, waving that one off. She sipped her wine, thinking. \u201cYou know, though...you might actually be on to something. I\u2019ll have Mom bring it to the Kidd sisters.\u201d At his puzzled look, she clarified, \u201cMarlene\u2019s maiden name was Kidd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarlene has sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d She gave a grand shake to her head. \u201cI forget how new you are around here. Marlene has aunts. Two of them. And her mother\u2019s still alive, too. They\u2019re all in their eighties.\u201d</p><p>Billy\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d know if you had. Emerald, Ruby, and Pearl. The grandes dames of Sierra Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She shared a smile with him. Suddenly she realized how intimate it all felt. Suddenly she wondered what it\u2019d be like if he lowered his lips to hers and kissed her.</p><p>He looked like maybe he was wondering that as well.</p><p>Her heart beat hard in her chest.</p><p>The angry sound of water boiling over and sizzling onto the burner broke the moment. Sorrow shot to her feet. She ran to the pot and tossed in some linguini.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled secretly over the stove. \u201cYou seem like a man with an appetite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d He picked up his wine and joined her, looking over her shoulder into the pot. \u201cExcept that might even be too much for me. Though I\u2019ve always believed nothing beats leftover pasta in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her agreement. Nodded, and found herself wondering what it might be like to serve this particular man breakfast.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Marlene surreptitiously smelled her wrist. She hoped she wasn\u2019t wearing too much perfume. She hadn\u2019t thought it\u2019d been too much, but when she\u2019d walked into the tavern, so full of the aroma of beer and fried things, she\u2019d begun to worry that her Est\u00e9e Lauder stood out.</p><p>She hated having to worry about such nonsense. One would think a sixty-three-year-old woman would have a little confidence by now. But the divorce had thrown her.</p><p>One would think a sixty-three-year-old woman didn\u2019t have to worry herself with nonsense like blind dates, but there she was.</p><p>Her eyes adjusted to the dark, and she sensed the slightest lull in conversation as folks turned to see who\u2019d come in. Cheeks burning, she walked to the first empty table that was neither too conspicuously close to the door, nor tucked too secretively in the corner.</p><p>Normally she wouldn\u2019t have chosen the Thirsty Bear\u2014it meant meeting her prospective beau in front of everyone and their brother, for goodness sake\u2014but she\u2019d hoped to grab a word with Edith. There were no secrets from anybody in Sierra Falls anyway. She could\u2019ve driven all the way to Sacramento to meet the man, and still folks would\u2019ve heard about it.</p><p>Pulling off her scarf, she smoothed her hair into shape. She dyed it and had regular blowouts, but no matter how much money she threw at it, gray hair had a life of its own. She hated that almost as much as the lines that seemed to etch themselves on her face overnight.</p><p>\u201cMarlene!\u201d Edith caught her eye and waved.</p><p>She waved back, giving her friend a smile that she had to force. Edith looked as effortlessly attractive as ever\u2014Edith never had to work at it, and Edith\u2019s husband clearly wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Marlene only hoped the dim tavern lighting was working the same magic on her.</p><p>Edith gave one last word to Helen behind the bar before scampering over to join her. \u201cI\u2019ve ordered us a couple of glasses of wine,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that sauvignon blanc for you, right?\u201d</p><p>Marlene half stood to offer her cheek for a quick air-kiss. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d And of course it was\u2014her friend seemed to remember everything about everyone.</p><p>She\u2019d been a conundrum to Marlene since they\u2019d met as girls. Edith always silently watching the world, noting everything. And just when she thought the woman was as passive as a lamb, she\u2019d roar like a lion. Not that she needed to do much roaring\u2014Edith and Bear had been together forever, and he did his fair share of bellowing for the two of them.</p><p>Helen came over with two glasses of white wine, looking put out that she had to step from behind the bar. The two women shared a quiet chuckle as the bartender walked away.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a piece of work,\u201d Marlene whispered. \u201cFlirts with everything in pants. And then\u2019s a witch with a capital B to the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Edith sighed, watching Helen get back to work behind the bar. \u201cShe is, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why not cut her loose?\u201d Marlene didn\u2019t understand why she kept the woman around. There were any number of people in their town who\u2019d do backflips to get some extra work.</p><p>\u201cWe all of us have our troubles,\u201d Edith said mysteriously.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t it the truth.\u201d Marlene raised her glass to toast that bit of obvious wisdom. She took a big sip, but the wine suddenly tasted too tart. Her friend\u2019s relentlessly forgiving and openhearted outlook made Marlene feel jealous and small. She tried to be kinder in her thoughts, adding, \u201cTo women with troubles.\u201d</p><p>Edith sipped, but shook her head. \u201cHow can you say you have troubles when you\u2019re looking so pretty?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marlene smiled, not expecting the compliment. \u201cOh, Edith,\u201d she replied with grudging honesty, \u201cit\u2019s you who\u2019s looking pretty. As always.\u201d</p><p>Edith had blond good looks, and she\u2019d given them to her daughters, too. Weren\u2019t fair-skinned women supposed to age more quickly? Marlene touched her own forehead\u2014she wondered how that Botox stuff worked. She was certain there were any number of doctors in Reno or even in nearby Silver City who worked with it. Maybe it was time to give it a try.</p><p>\u201cEnough about me. So\u201d\u2014Edith leaned close to whisper\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re meeting a man here tonight? How exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Hardly. She remembered her blind date and smiled stiffly, nodding. Exciting wasn\u2019t the word she\u2019d use. What would be exciting was if she\u2019d already met the man, and he\u2019d been a classy, gentlemanly sort of fellow. Someone who\u2019d had a good, respectable career. A widower judge, perhaps. Or maybe a retired doctor. Someone who was kind, with a full head of hair, a healthy nest egg, and a nice sedan. Something foreign maybe, with a leather interior that was a color named something like ebony or champagne. She could put this Internet dating nonsense behind her.</p><p>And the next time Frank visited Sierra Falls, he\u2019d see her, and see how well she was doing, and how spoiled she was, and he\u2019d be jealous and realize what a fool he\u2019d been to leave her.</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you worried about this online stuff?\u201d Edith asked, pulling her from the fantasy. \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories.\u201d</p><p>Marlene had heard them, too, and a big part of her was terrified about all the crazies out there. But instead she made herself sound bravely nonchalant. \u201cOh no, it\u2019s perfectly safe. All the singles are carefully screened.\u201d She hoped. \u201cAnd what other choice do I have? I\u2019ve lived here my whole life, and as far as I know, there aren\u2019t any retirees zipping around Sierra Falls in any sports cars, looking for wives.\u201d</p><p>Edith slumped at that, unable to muster a rebuttal. \u201cForget men, then. How are you?\u201d</p> <p>Marlene sipped her wine, considering. How was she?</p><p>She was a sixty-three-year-old woman on a blind date. She was struggling to keep hold of her dignity. The last time she\u2019d dated, she hadn\u2019t needed to figure out how to balance her reading glasses on her face in order to put on eye makeup. The last time she\u2019d dated, it\u2019d been with boys she\u2019d grown up with, nice boys her parents knew, not a bunch of strangers who might or might not be kooks.</p><p>She\u2019d gone straight from raising four kids\u2014four boys\u2014to taking care of two elderly aunts and an ailing mother who was in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s. She shouldn\u2019t be sitting in a bar drinking Bear Bailey\u2019s crappy sauvignon blanc.</p><p>That\u2019s how she was.</p><p>What she said instead was, \u201cI\u2019m plugging along, Edith. You?\u201d</p><p>Edith glanced around then leaned in close, looking conspiratorial. \u201cI have news.\u201d</p> <p>Marlene leaned close. The best cure for depression was gossip. Her friend looked happy\u2014it was good news then.</p><p>Dark thoughts were replaced with a flurry of speculation. A smile crept across Marlene\u2019s face as she realized what it must be. \u201cIt\u2019s Sorrow, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She slammed her hand on the table, a lightbulb going off. \u201cShe and the Simmons boy finally got engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d Edith looked momentarily puzzled. \u201cOh, no, not that. But it does have to do with Sorrow. She found letters.\u201d</p><p>Marlene deflated. Letters wasn\u2019t nearly as exciting as engagement. \u201cLetters?\u201d she asked, trying to sound intrigued.</p><p>When Edith got to the word affair Marlene perked back up. Turned out, Bear\u2019s great-great-grandmother had a child out of wedlock with Buck Larsen, of all people. She\u2019d written, but never sent, a stack of letters that featured some pretty juicy details.</p><p>Edith\u2019s face was lit up in a way that Marlene hadn\u2019t seen in some time. \u201cIt\u2019s just what the town needs.\u201d</p><p>Marlene hated to play devil\u2019s advocate\u2014why was she always the one to put a damper on things?\u2014but she couldn\u2019t keep herself from asking, \u201cHow do you know they\u2019re real? I mean, those letters must be over a hundred years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver one hundred fifty years old.\u201d Edith beamed proudly, adding definitively, \u201cThe woman had no reason to lie.\u201d</p> <p>Marlene still didn\u2019t buy it. It was a woman who\u2019d connived her Frank out of a marriage that\u2019d spanned almost four decades. Who knew what women had been capable of back then? \u201cAll the more reason she could\u2019ve made any old thing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she go and do something like that? Especially since she never even sent them.\u201d Edith waved away the notion. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? It means we can turn our Spring Fling into a Buck Larsen Festival instead. Get some publicity, some new tourists.\u201d</p><p>That gave Marlene pause. Edith did have a point. The town sure could use some livening up\u2014and not just financially. This discovery could bring new people into Sierra Falls. And with the average age of their historical society hovering somewhere around seventy, their group could use some fresh blood, as it were. Maybe it\u2019d even bring in a wave of older, single men. Visions of tweedy historical types flitted through her mind.</p><p>Finally convinced, Marlene smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see their faces when I tell them.\u201d</p><p>Edith didn\u2019t have to ask to know the \u201cthem\u201d in question were Marlene\u2019s mother, Emerald, and her two aunts, Ruby and Pearl. Three women whose preacher daddy had scared away enough boys that they\u2019d aged into thick-as-thieves spinsters. Marlene\u2019s mother had been the wild one of the group, running off as a girl, but she\u2019d returned home with a belly full of baby and a mouth full of secrets and had never left town again. They were the backbone of the historical society and a permanent fixture in Sierra Falls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them going on a special gold rush quilt,\u201d Marlene said.</p><p>\u201cWe could have a raffle!\u201d</p><p>Marlene nodded, her mind spinning. If they played up the gold rush aspect, they could really milk it. \u201cWe could make a book of old California recipes.\u201d</p><p>Edith\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWe could put on a show, too. From the look of the dresses we found, Sorrow\u2014that was her name\u2014was a dance hall girl. We could have a performance, maybe an exhibit, too.\u201d</p><p>Edith bustled off, anxious to start her list of to-dos.</p><p>Which left Marlene alone again, waiting for Mister Wonderful, who had yet to make his appearance. She checked her watch for the umpteenth time. She\u2019d come a little early, but now he was starting to feel a little late. She nursed her wine as slowly as possible\u2014she didn\u2019t want to sit there with nothing to sip on, nor did she want to order another drink. This one was hitting her too much already.</p><p>Edith\u2019s news had been exciting, and Marlene was feeling residual optimism. Maybe she\u2019d have a great time on this date. Maybe he\u2019d be The One.</p><p>She adjusted her shirt, waiting. Why hadn\u2019t she worn a sweater? It was chilly, and she\u2019d sat too close to the door. Damned old age\u2014most days, she was either too hot or too cold. Well, it was too late to move now, it\u2019d just look funny.</p><p>Rubbing warmth into her arms, she decided she knew full well why she hadn\u2019t worn a sweater. She ran a mental catalog of what was in her drawers, and it was all ancient cardigans. Sure, they were well-loved, having been hand-knit by her mother once upon a time, but all of a sudden they seemed too frumpy for something like dating. Too fusty.</p><p>She resented that feeling. She loved those sweaters\u2014why weren\u2019t they good enough? Did it mean she wasn\u2019t good enough? That got her thinking about Frank again. This was all his fault.</p><p>Her optimism was fading fast. Her nerves getting more jangled by the minute. Where was this man?</p><p>\u201cA woman like you...\u201d A male voice said from behind her.</p><p>Marlene turned to find Sully standing behind her. There was a devilish light in his eyes that brought a quick smile to her face. That, she knew, was her vanity, pure and simple. Sully was a quiet man, but he\u2019d always had a word or two for her, and as the years passed, her ego appreciated the attention more and more. \u201cA woman like me what, Tom Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>He put a glass of something sparkling on the table in front of her. \u201cA woman like you shouldn\u2019t be kept waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman like me should do lots of things. Take this, for example,\u201d she said, pushing away the glass. \u201cI definitely shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He edged it back toward her. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s just a club soda with a twist.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled, the knot in her chest easing a bit. A club soda with a twist sounded perfect right about then. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were wearing a hole in the table, spinning your wineglass all around. Thought you could shift that nervous energy to a nice cocktail straw instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nervous.\u201d Did she really appear nervous? And how\u2019d he known?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss.\u201d He gave her a mysterious smile. But he didn\u2019t leave, and he didn\u2019t sit down either.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t he just sit down? She narrowed her eyes on him. \u201cIf anything\u2019s making me nervous, it\u2019s you hovering over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m hovering,\u201d Sully said, \u201cit\u2019s because you haven\u2019t invited me to join you.\u201d</p><p>Would Sully really join her if she asked, or was he just ribbing her? Did she want him to join her? Why was he being friendly? He couldn\u2019t be interested in her, could he?</p><p>She dismissed the possibility at once. A man like Tom Sullivan would attract someone saucier and wilder. An older, big-bosomed version of that attractive bartender they had. She wouldn\u2019t be his type.</p><p>Not that she knew who he ran around with\u2014she\u2019d never heard that sort of gossip about him. The only rumors about Tom Sullivan were about his past, how he\u2019d come back from Vietnam a changed man and had spent years on the road like something out of Easy Rider. It was probably all romantic speculation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting somebody,\u201d she said. With a subtle shift of her shirtsleeve, she checked the time again. She needed a rich man, not someone who flipped burgers for a living. A wealthy retiree who\u2019d buy her a sedan. A silver fox. She was in search of a classy boyfriend. Not someone who rode around on a motorcycle, looking too young for his age.</p><p>Tom didn\u2019t get the hint. \u201cSeems he\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>Marlene bristled at that. Even though it was true, it was a presumptuous thing to say. She took in his tight, white cook\u2019s T-shirt, the Army infantry tattoo on his forearm. He sure did look strong. Not a silver fox at all, but vital and vigorous. And when had she started thinking of him as Tom? She took a sip of that bubbly water.</p> <p>His tattoo put a thought into her head. She was anxious to change the subject anyway. \u201cThey say you went to war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did,\u201d he replied, his tone wary.</p><p>The pain that flickered across his face told her to tread carefully. \u201cWould you talk to my grandson?\u201d His face crumpled into something that looked highly skeptical, and she continued quickly, \u201cHe wants to enlist right out of high school.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, pinned on her. Goodness, but they were a dark and vivid blue, like indigo. It put her on the defensive.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get that look with me, Tom Sullivan. Hear me out. I had a cousin from my grandmother\u2019s side who served\u2014you should know that. You were here when we flew to Arlington to bury him, may he rest in peace, and if you don\u2019t remember, you just need to listen to Ruby and Pearl for half a minute to hear his memory invoked.\u201d She grew half concerned that the wine had made her too emotional, but pressed on, anxious to be understood. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019d make me prouder than to see Craig serve his country. But I get nervous that he doesn\u2019t see that side of it. The service side. I\u2019d love to see the boy shape up and put on a uniform, but for the right reasons. He doesn\u2019t understand how seriously it should be approached. How hard he\u2019ll need to work. I worry he thinks it\u2019s just a chance for him to appear in one of his video games.\u201d</p> <p>Sully was silent for long enough she began to worry. But finally he nodded. \u201cI understand. Bring him by, Marlene. I\u2019ll be happy to talk to the boy.\u201d</p><p>She unclenched something she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d clenched. \u201cThank you, Tom.\u201d</p><p>A gust of wind blew in as the door opened. Sully looked up and that stony look was back in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d he muttered. His dark blue eyes locked with hers. \u201cThis date of yours had better pay. I see him try any nonsense like splitting the check, I might need to come back over.\u201d</p><p>Marlene felt her cheeks blush. And Good Lord, when was the last time she\u2019d blushed?</p><p>Ten</p> <p>\u201cSorrow!\u201d she heard her mom call from the hallway a moment before she appeared in the doorway of the laundry room.</p><p>Mom had that tone\u2014the one that told Sorrow she was going to be assigned another duty she didn\u2019t want. Whatever it was, it had to be better than ironing linens. She hated ironing.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me, Sorrow?\u201d Her mother had a white-knuckle grip on her purse, and that alone had her putting down the iron. Her mom never looked that tense. \u201cI need you to call your friend again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? You mean Damien?\u201d</p><p>Edith nodded. \u201cThe road is closed. I thought he could make some calls. Get it plowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, our road is closed?\u201d The lodge was on Irish Camp Road, an old mining road off Route 88. It wasn\u2019t exactly a major thoroughfare, but it wasn\u2019t a small street either. \u201cI\u2019m sure it was plowed hours ago. Why would Caltrans close it?\u201d</p><p>As far as Sorrow was concerned, Caltrans\u2014aka the California Department of Transportation\u2014were the unsung heroes of their area, plowing through the night, clearing rockslides, and managing avalanche control in the higher elevations. They might be experiencing the first real weather of the season, but it was nothing compared to what Caltrans could handle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the snow,\u201d Edith said. \u201cThere\u2019s something blocking the road.\u201d</p> <p>What was she supposed to do about something blocking the road? Why did everything fall on her shoulders? Why couldn\u2019t her mother call Caltrans? Better yet, why wasn\u2019t her sister around to enjoy this indentured servitude, having to deal with things like ironing the tavern\u2019s tablecloths? Or how about her brother, for that matter?</p><p>She felt a pang of guilt at that last thought. BJ was deployed in Afghanistan...ironing was a walk in the park compared to what he was going through.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll call Caltrans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should call Damien.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow hesitated, reluctant to ask for his help on this one, especially since she\u2019d been having inappropriate thoughts about another man. She felt guilty about Billy and heating things up in the kitchen\u2014because the things she wanted to heat up had nothing to do with food. \u201cCaltrans will take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Mom pleaded. \u201cIt\u2019s just that, I think Damien would be able to call someone in charge over there and get it cleared faster than you could.\u201d</p><p>She turned off the iron, defeated. It was unlike Mom to get this impassioned about something. \u201cOkay, sure. I\u2019ll call Damien.\u201d She reached over to unplug it\u2014the way her luck was going, the whole lodge might burn down otherwise. She edged past her mother in the doorway in search of the phone.</p><p>Edith followed right on her heels. \u201cThis is very important, Sorrow.\u201d</p><p>She had to chuckle at the uncharacteristic intensity. \u201cI said I\u2019m on it, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to present your letters to the historical society. Marlene thinks that it might be just the thing to breathe some life into this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said distractedly. Girding herself, she dialed and put a hand up to signal quiet.</p><p>Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t need to keep quiet for long. Damien was in a meeting and not to be disturbed. Sorrow had a good guess what the meeting was about, and if her hunch was right, he\u2019d be unavailable for some time. Simmons Timber was ready to thin several overstocked acres, clearing debris in a fire-prevention effort, a huge concern in the Sierras. The problem was, his father was trying to use the program as an opportunity to clear more acreage than necessary.</p><p>The stance felt a bit uncharacteristic for the kindly Dabney Simmons, but she supposed you didn\u2019t get to be rich without being aware of the bottom line. And for a timber company in a paperless era, that bottom line was getting progressively smaller. As a result, father and son were butting heads more often than not, with Damien increasingly outspoken about the responsibility they owed to the environment, while Dabney was preoccupied only with keeping food on his employees\u2019 plates.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unavailable, and...oh, crap.\u201d Sorrow shut her eyes as she hung up, turning her head heavenward to take a deep breath. A road closure had much bigger implications than her mom missing the historical society meeting. If their road was closed, nobody could drive to the lodge or tavern. It would mean a day\u2019s business lost. \u201cCrap,\u201d she repeated vehemently. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two groups of hunters coming in tonight, and I already bought a few sides of salmon to serve in the tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell Sully can\u2019t cook it,\u201d Edith said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t even made it in yet. That fool man insists on riding a motorcycle at his age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe drives the Jeep in this weather, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what are we going to do?\u201d There was an edge to her mother\u2019s voice that she didn\u2019t often hear. \u201cI don\u2019t want your father getting upset. And I especially don\u2019t want him going out in the car to check on it himself.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow grabbed her coat and scarf from a hook in the mudroom off the garage. \u201cDon\u2019t borrow trouble. I\u2019ll check on it and see what\u2019s going on. Dad\u2019s still watching the headlines\u2014he won\u2019t even know I\u2019m gone.\u201d Her father\u2019s CNN addiction came in handy at times like these. The constant hum of the television was aggravating, but she knew he was safely ensconced in his den, apart from the lodge\u2019s public area.</p><p>She was slipping on her snow boots when she heard the main entry door open. It was a slow creak followed by a tentative knock\u2014someone polite enough to realize that, even though it was a lodge, a family lived there, too.</p><p>\u201cAnybody home?\u201d a man called.</p><p>She recognized Billy\u2019s voice, and found herself putting a hand to her hair. She\u2019d tugged it back that morning into a messy ponytail. So much for looking presentable.</p><p>Why should she care anyway? He was just a man like any other.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t just a man. He was Billy.</p><p>She pulled out the elastic and gave her head a shake as she finger combed some life into her waves. And then she went out to greet him. \u201cHi, Billy.\u201d</p><p>Something in his face softened. \u201cHi, Sorrow.\u201d His eyes went to her snow boots. \u201cYou know your road\u201d\u2014he stopped, seeing the look on her face\u2014\u201cyou do know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. The road is closed.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, frowning. \u201cThere are signs posted, but somehow nobody notified Caltrans. I called it in, and it should be cleared by this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis evening?\u201d So much for their guests.</p><p>\u201cBut I need to get to my meeting,\u201d Edith said.</p><p>That again. The historical society meeting was the last thing on Sorrow\u2019s mind. All she could think about was a hundred dollars in salmon that wouldn\u2019t freeze well.</p><p>Edith began to sound frantic. \u201cI told Marlene I\u2019d drive her and the Kidd sisters. All she has is that pickup. You know the women hate climbing into that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry.

I guess I\u2019ll just have to wait for that Prospector\u2019s Pie.\u201d He looked back at Sorrow and winked.</p><p>A zing of excitement stabbed her chest. \u201cI can do you one better,\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cYou like salmon, Billy?\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Marlene\u2019s date had gone south fast. She\u2019d had plenty of time to contemplate that sad fact, seeing as he\u2019d sat across from her, this total stranger, talking at her the whole time. There was not one single question he had to ask her. The blasted man just droned on and on about fishing. And he hadn\u2019t even called it fishing\u2014he\u2019d corrected her every time she dared say the word. \u201cAngling, Marlene. It\u2019s called angling.\u201d</p> <p>He started in on \u201cbite indicators,\u201d and that was when she\u2019d tuned out completely. She\u2019d already had a man who\u2019d chewed her ear off about fishing, and look how that had turned out. She certainly didn\u2019t need to go out and find herself a new one.</p><p>But the whole situation had made her think. All these men had their leisure activities\u2014watching sports, going fishing, playing golf. So what were her passions? Some days it felt like she\u2019d gone straight from raising four young boys to caring for three elderly women. Unless she counted dusting and laundry among her pastimes, she had a sad absence of interests in her life. Interests that were hers and hers alone.</p><p>Sometime during the bite indicators conversation, she made her decision. She\u2019d forget men for the moment and pour her heart and soul into the historical society instead.</p><p>That was how she came to be early, prepared, and waiting when folks started to arrive at the town hall for their weekly meeting. It\u2019d been some feat getting her elderly aunts and mother ready sooner than usual.</p><p>Now that they had these letters, the meeting promised to be a rip-roaring one. She hadn\u2019t yet told the ladies the news about how Buck Larsen had spent time in Sierra Falls and was making a great show of a grand secret to be revealed. So with promises of high drama ahead, she\u2019d managed to wrangle Ruby, Pearl, and Ma into their coats.</p><p>The drama began even before they got to the meeting. Marlene heard an unfamiliar car outside and opened the door to find Billy Preston parking in their drive.</p> <p>\u201cOh, good heavens.\u201d Her aunt Ruby\u2019s eyes widened, seeing the big sheriff\u2019s SUV. \u201cThe law is here.\u201d</p><p>Pearl sidled into the doorway. Her gloved hand had a death grip on Marlene\u2019s arm. \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d</p><p>Ma piped up, \u201cDid he find out about that lipstick I took?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hush Emerald. That was back in 1946.\u201d</p><p>Marlene spotted Edith in the front seat and patted Pearl\u2019s hand. \u201cI think what happened is Edith had car trouble again.\u201d</p><p>Billy hopped out of the car. \u201cYou\u2019re all looking lovely today.\u201d He bounded up the porch stairs, taking an aunt on each arm. \u201cYour chariot awaits.\u201d</p><p>Marlene locked up the house and, taking her mother\u2019s arm, followed him to the car. \u201cSheriff, you probably have a dozen other important things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but this was at the top of my list.\u201d With a smile, he helped her climb into the additional row of backseats. \u201cYou going to be okay back there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She settled herself, but her mind was churning. Now here was a considerate man. She\u2019d sensed it the day he\u2019d helped free her car from the snowbank. This was a man who wouldn\u2019t chew off a woman\u2019s ear about bait lines. She wasn\u2019t used to getting help, though, and twice in a row from the same man no less. She felt bad putting him out. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drive us old biddies to our meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any biddies here.\u201d He gave Pearl a wink.</p><p>The moment she was buckled in, Ruby leaned forward to study the complicated control panel that was nestled between the front seats. The police radio crackled to life, and distant, unintelligible chatter filled the SUV.</p><p>The ladies gasped. Marlene had a chuckle to herself. They\u2019d be talking about this for weeks.</p><p>They talked about it now, seated in the Sierra Falls Town Hall, waiting for the meeting to come to order. She and Edith sat at the front, and she could sense that her friend was dying to gossip about the sheriff, but Marlene silenced her with a look. They were the heads of the historical society, and it was up to them to project an official air.</p><p>As chairwoman and de facto treasurer, Marlene was the one who got to use the gavel, and she banged it. \u201cTime to get this meeting to order. First item of business is our budget.\u201d</p><p>They addressed their dwindling bank account, and as was often the case with money talk, the discussion dissolved into grumbling and fretting.</p><p>Edith shushed them, and Marlene\u2019s head swiveled to give her friend a startled look. \u201cMarlene and I think we have a solution,\u201d Edith said. \u201cWe found letters.\u201d</p><p>Marlene gave a quick pat to her friend\u2019s hand. It wasn\u2019t like Edith to put herself out there like that. It looked good on the woman.</p><p>\u201cLetters?\u201d a woman in the back asked. \u201cHow are a bunch of letters going to help us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re historical letters,\u201d Edith said.</p><p>Other voices chimed in. \u201cWhat kind of historical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re just old.\u201d</p><p>June Harlan spoke louder than the rest. \u201cHow do you know they\u2019re real? It\u2019s impossible to date things with the naked eye.\u201d</p><p>Pearl turned in her seat. \u201cYou listen up, June, and let her tell it. If Marlene says she has letters, there are letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, where\u2019d she find them?\u201d</p><p>Marlene banged the gavel again. \u201cThe Bailey family found them.\u201d</p><p>Edith gave a proud smile. \u201cAnd we think our next festival should be a Buck Larsen festival.\u201d</p><p>June was looking frustrated. She turned to Pearl, asking in a loud whisper, \u201cDid she say Buck Larsen?\u201d</p><p>Ruby spoke up, sounding confused. \u201cBuck Larsen\u2019s dead. He can\u2019t come to the festival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cHe wrote the letters. Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re saying, Marlene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Marlene regretted not telling this news to her aunts and mother in advance. She\u2019d thought it\u2019d be a fun surprise, but the real surprise was how the meeting was crumbling into chaos. \u201cThe letters were written by Sorrow Crabtree.\u201d</p><p>Emerald turned to Ruby. \u201cIsn\u2019t that Edith\u2019s child?\u201d</p><p>Ruby nodded and piped up, \u201cWhat\u2019s that about Sorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorrow wrote letters.\u201d Pearl was hard of hearing, and her whisper had echoed down the aisles.</p><p>\u201cNot our Sorrow,\u201d Edith said, exasperated. \u201cOur Sorrow found the letters, from her great-great-great-grandmother.\u201d</p><p>As understanding dawned, female voices swept across the hall like a sigh. \u201cAhh.\u201d</p><p>Marlene put down her gavel. \u201cTurns out, Buck Larsen was one of the pioneers of our town. If we theme our next festival around Buck Larsen and the gold rush, we might draw more tourists.\u201d</p><p>Edith leaned in to add, \u201cMore tourists means more money for Sierra Falls.\u201d</p><p>Ruby got it and nodded enthusiastically. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying Buck Larsen is Bear\u2019s kin.\u201d</p><p>Emerald looked aghast. \u201cBear skin?\u201d</p><p>Pearl patted her sister\u2019s hand. \u201cBear Bailey. They\u2019re talking about his ancestors.\u201d</p><p>Marlene couldn\u2019t take the circus anymore. What this crowd needed was a spectacle. She cleared her throat and spoke in her best assembly voice. \u201cSorrow Crabtree was one of the early residents of Sierra Falls. It looks like she had...an affair. With Buck Larsen. She had his baby.\u201d She paused dramatically to let that sink in, and sure enough, another wave of female oohs and ohhs swept the room.</p><p>The meeting fell apart from there, the excitement too great to get any more business done. Marlene spotted Billy Preston waiting at the back of the hall and quickly wrapped it up.</p><p>Standing to put on her coat, she turned to Edith. \u201cYou never did tell me what the sheriff was doing at your house to be offering you a ride.\u201d The buzz in the hall drowned out her voice, and she leaned close to speak into her friend\u2019s ear. \u201cSeems Billy Preston has an awful lot of business to tend at that tavern of yours.\u201d</p><p>Edith puffed up. \u201cHe just happened to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Marlene buttoned up. \u201cLucky you. Or should I say, your lucky daughter.\u201d</p><p>Edith was winding her scarf around her neck, but her hands froze in midair. \u201cSorrow, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Marlene said impatiently. \u201cSorrow.\u201d First she caught the sheriff toting around her apple bread and now this. \u201cSeems to me like I\u2019ve seen the two of them together a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, not him,\u201d Edith said. \u201cHe\u2019s a widower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a silly thing to say. It\u2019s his wife who died, not him.\u201d They both studied the man. He stood like a cop, straight and tall. His sheriff\u2019s jacket made his broad shoulders look even broader. \u201cSeems to me, he\u2019s still a young man. Not hard on the eyes neither.\u201d</p><p>Edith made a little hmm sound. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not hard on the eyes, is he?\u201d</p><p>Marlene squinted her eyes to focus better. \u201cHe reminds me of...I don\u2019t know...a cowboy from a TV movie.\u201d</p><p>Edith finished tying her scarf around her neck. \u201cNot as handsome as Damien, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d said Marlene. \u201cThough he makes Damien look like a kid in comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamien isn\u2019t a boy. He\u2019s Sorrow\u2019s age, and I say twenty-three is old enough to start thinking about settling down.\u201d Edith\u2019s eyes drifted back to the sheriff. \u201cAre you saying he\u2019s looking to remarry?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say marriage.\u201d Marlene abruptly began to gather her papers into her handbag.</p><p>All this talk of spouses made her think. If she\u2019d been a widow, would she have remarried? Would the pain have been this deep? Sometimes, when she was feeling small-hearted, she wished she were a widow. That her husband had died instead of divorcing her. In her low moments, she told herself that burying him would\u2019ve been easier to bear than the shame of his leaving.</p><p>Pearl approached the table. The woman wore a contented smile\u2014the meeting had been as dramatic as promised. \u201cAre we leaving now?\u201d</p> <p>The other two Kidd sisters were close behind, still bundling up. Marlene\u2019s elderly mother was having trouble with her coat sleeves, but before she could help, Billy appeared at the woman\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this for you,\u201d he said, guiding Emerald\u2019s arms into the sleeves. \u201cYou got all turned inside out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a gentleman,\u201d Ruby exclaimed.</p><p>Edith met Marlene\u2019s eyes, a significant question there. Was there something between Billy and Sorrow?</p><p>Marlene studied him. Whether or not he was a widower, whether it was Sorrow or somebody else, someday, some lucky woman would find herself turned inside out by this sheriff.</p> <p>Twelve</p><p>Billy felt kind of awkward. He\u2019d gone home to change\u2014nobody wanted their guest to show up for dinner wearing a sidearm\u2014but he worried he looked as though he were trying too hard. He refused to think on the fact that simply thinking on such things was the very definition of trying too hard.</p><p>Was he trying?</p><p>Of course he wasn\u2019t. The last time he\u2019d tried with a woman had been with Keri. For years, they\u2019d been colleagues, then friends, and it was a slow courtship that\u2019d turned them into lovers. He\u2019d bought flowers. Symphony tickets. Dinners at the latest in restaurants. Things he didn\u2019t necessarily enjoy but had thought his wife would. Sitting through a three-hour avant-garde opera? Now that had been trying.</p><p>No, this was a friendly visit, all part of small-town living. Sorrow\u2019s mother led him into the lodge\u2019s private living quarters. He\u2019d never eaten in the lodge before\u2014tourists and lodgers ate at the tavern\u2014and he was looking forward to seeing how the family interacted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking handsome this evening,\u201d Edith told him as they joined Sorrow\u2019s father in the den. The man sat in his recliner, watching a college basketball game on mute.</p> <p>Billy had settled on wearing jeans with a sweater, but seeing Bear\u2019s scowl, he\u2019d begun to regret the absence of that sidearm.</p><p>\u201cBear\u201d\u2014Edith nudged her husband\u2014\u201csay hello to Billy. If it weren\u2019t for him, I\u2019d have missed my meeting.\u201d</p><p>The older man nodded a greeting then turned back to the game.</p><p>\u201cEvening, sir.\u201d Billy\u2019s eyes went to the action on TV as he settled onto the giant sectional couch. Its old brown leather was as comfortable as it looked. \u201cKentucky came out strong this year.\u201d</p><p>Bear\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou a Kentucky fan?\u201d</p><p>That seemed like a minefield if ever there was one. For all he knew, Kentucky fans weren\u2019t allowed in the Big Bear Lodge.</p><p>\u201cI went to Colorado State,\u201d Billy said, sidestepping the question. A topic change seemed in order, so he added, \u201cIt\u2019s where I discovered my love of the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy go all the way there?\u201d Bear was skeptical, obviously not the sort of man who thrived on travel.</p> <p>\u201cFootball scholarship.\u201d</p><p>Bear pulled his eyes from the screen to study him. \u201cReally now?\u201d</p><p>Billy sat up straighter, feeling a little uncomfortably checked out. \u201cRunning back,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cAhh.\u201d A smile spread across Bear\u2019s face. He nodded thoughtfully. \u201cYeah, I see it. You got that stocky sort of look of a man who played ball. I played ball, too, once upon a time. It was different then. We didn\u2019t much bother with nonsense like pads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou play in college?\u201d</p><p>Bear was quiet for a second. Finally, he said, \u201cNah, didn\u2019t go. Didn\u2019t need it. I played high school ball, then played around here. Town stuff.\u201d</p><p>They watched the game for a few minutes, then the older man surprised him, saying out of the blue, \u201cI appreciate you driving Edith. I\u2019m sure you got better sheriff duties to tend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Billy said, and he meant it. It\u2019d been a break from his routine and a pleasure to boot. In fact, small favors like that were how he kept it together these days. By being relentlessly friendly and occupying himself with the needs of others, he could keep the ghosts\u2014one particular black-haired ghost\u2014at bay.</p><p>When he\u2019d doubled back to drive the women home, they\u2019d invited him in and plied him with a lot of coffee and Danishes, but surprisingly few questions. He could tell they wanted to ask more and couldn\u2019t blame their curiosity\u2014a young widower like himself? He imagined the average Sierra Falls female retiree would view him as a project. Oddly, rather than mind it, Billy found it touching.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is with women and meetings,\u201d Bear said. \u201cYou meet the Kidd sisters yet? All I know is, you driving my wife saved me from having to deal with those old birds. They\u2019re going to use our letters, though. It\u2019ll turn this town around, you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to Sorrow,\u201d Billy said. At Bear\u2019s questioning look, he added, \u201cI mean, thanks to your daughter for finding them in the first place and seeing their worth. Not everyone would appreciate such a slice of history. Most folks would\u2019ve dumped the lot of them straight into the trash.\u201d</p><p>Bear shrugged. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get you a beer?\u201d a voice asked from behind him.</p><p>Billy turned to find Sorrow standing in the doorway. Her blond hair hung loose and wavy at her shoulders, and the light coming from the fireplace made her eyes sparkle.</p><p>The world stilled around him. Sorrow had the sort of looks that demanded his attention. She had some meat on her bones, and her snug sweater clung to that spot between the dip of her waist and the curve of her hip. His mind went to an image of his hand tucked just there.</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I think I could use a beer.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been with a woman in a long time. He\u2019d indulged in one or two mindless hookups\u2014outside town limits, of course. He was a man after all, and thirty-five was far from dead.</p><p>But this was Sorrow. There was no mindless hookup with Sorrow. And anything more would feel like...cheating.</p><p>He needed to stop looking at her curves so he dragged his eyes back to her hair. It was different. He realized she mostly wore it tied back. Not that he didn\u2019t like it that way. She was a natural beauty, with a peaches and cream, fresh-faced complexion that looked as good with makeup as without. Though tonight, in the warm firelight, her hair loose and her sweater tight, Sorrow was quite stunning indeed.</p><p>She gave him a perplexed smile. \u201cIs there a problem, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>Billy realized he\u2019d been staring. \u201cYou look...\u201d Edible. His eyes went to the oven mitt in her hand. \u201cLike you could use some help.\u201d</p><p>Was that disappointment that flashed on her face?</p><p>He stood abruptly. Get a grip. \u201cTell you what. Let\u2019s get that beer, and I\u2019ll give you a hand in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Bear shot him a look that Billy caught from the corner of his eyes. It\u2019d probably never occur to her father to lend a hand with the dinner prep.</p><p>They went into the kitchen, and she handed him a bottle of Bud from the fridge. \u201cSounds like a good trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a job,\u201d he told her, cracking it open. Because if he stood there staring at her, he might be tempted to find out just how soft the sweater\u2014and what lay under it\u2014really felt.</p><p>She looked around, deciding. \u201cWe\u2019ll ease you in slow, how about? Want to set the table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTable setting? Child\u2019s play.\u201d He pulled out the cutlery and plates. \u201cWhat does a man have to do to get respect around here? You\u2019d have thought I proved my worth helping strain that sauce of yours. And I didn\u2019t even get to taste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to settle for my salmon. It\u2019s better for you anyway.\u201d</p><p>He breathed in deeply. \u201cWow, that\u2019s like no salmon I ever smelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s with bamboo shoots and green curry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love green curry,\u201d he said, genuinely impressed. He went into the attached dining room to set the table, and she joined him, taking the napkins from his hand to spread them around the table. He caught her eye from across the table. \u201cOne question, though. Is Bear going to go for that?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHe\u2019ll go for it, or go hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rebel, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making up for my teen years.\u201d</p><p>They ended up side by side at the head of the table. He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just happy I\u2019m the one who gets to benefit.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, looking like she wanted to say something, but didn\u2019t quite know how to phrase it. He waited patiently, curious to see what this woman might say.</p><p>\u201cDid your wife like to cook?\u201d Her question surprised him, and she quickly added, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d Oddly, it was always a relief when people asked him about Keri. So many folks tiptoed around the issue, but what they didn\u2019t know was that Billy longed to talk about her. He missed her terribly, and it was the sort of grief that made him feel set apart from everyone else. But talking about her always brought him one step closer, back among the living.</p><p>He leaned against the dining table. \u201cMy wife\u2014Keri was her name\u2014she wasn\u2019t much for cooking. She was a lawyer. That\u2019s how we met, in court. Anyway, between her long hours in the DA\u2019s office and me being on the force, we spent more time at our local sushi bar than we did at the corner market. Then, when she did cook, it was always some fancy salad. They were good...she\u2019d use crazy ingredients, like goat cheese, or blood oranges, but truth be told, they always left me hungry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed at the memory, and it was good to be able to remember it, and talk about it, and actually have a smile about it.</p><p>Sorrow held his gaze with a warm, open look. She didn\u2019t say anything, didn\u2019t scramble to come up with any of the standard-issue condolences, and he was glad of it.</p><p>Talking about his wife like that, it was impossible not to note the differences between the two women. They were physical opposites\u2014Keri\u2019s chin-length black hair and bangs were such a contrast to Sorrow\u2019s feminine dishevelment. This woman seemed like she\u2019d be most at home in a long, flowing skirt and flip-flops, while his wife had been all about power suits and heels.</p> <p>He\u2019d adored his wife, and man, she\u2019d been something to see. Especially in the courtroom. A snapshot memory came to him\u2014polished nails, quick retorts, strong stride, and confident delivery. It stabbed him. What a loss, what a waste.</p><p>He realized he\u2019d been staring at Sorrow. She had such kindness in her eyes. Soft where Keri had been hard. The sort of woman who might twine her fingers through his hair, pull him to her, and make him forget his troubles.</p><p>A barking dog broke the moment. It was a relief. He\u2019d put women out of his mind. Best to keep them out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a dog,\u201d he said.</p><p>She tensed, looking in the direction of the den. \u201cNo. We don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>It was an odd reaction. \u201cNot a fan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sorrow caught his eye again. \u201cOf course not. I love dogs. I just...I think I know who that is.\u201d</p><p>The animal burst into the kitchen. He was friendly and high-energy, with a lean, medium-sized body and short, white fur covered with cartoon-cute brown spots. He looked like he might\u2019ve come from central casting for a Hollywood dog movie.</p><p>Billy squatted to call him over. \u201cHey, little guy. Who do you belong to?\u201d He glanced up, and Sorrow was stiff as a board.</p><p>The owner strolled in, and the dog forgot about Billy, galloping back to his master\u2019s side.</p><p>It was Damien Simmons. The boyfriend.</p> <p>Thirteen</p><p>\u201cHey, Bailey. You look great.\u201d Damien stepped in close.</p><p>Sorrow fought the urge to flinch away, self-conscious of Billy standing right there next to her. She and Damien had a thing. He was her boyfriend. So why was this situation stressing her out? She tipped her head so Damien could brush a kiss on her cheek\u2014she wasn\u2019t about to give him a full-on mouth kiss with the sheriff standing right there.</p><p>Billy stepped forward, reaching out to shake hands. \u201cIt\u2019s Damien Simmons, right?\u201d</p><p>The two men gripped hands, and if the white knuckles were any indication, it looked like a squeezing contest was going on.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sheriff. Good to see you.\u201d Damien\u2019s smile was wide and easy, Sierra Falls poster boy. \u201cThanks for taking care of our Edith today. The woman does love her meetings.\u201d</p><p>Our Edith. Sorrow felt her back go rigid. What was up with that? Helping out around the lodge was one thing, but laying claim to her mother was entirely another. She bit her tongue. Boundaries, Damien.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Billy said. \u201cThat\u2019s a cute dog. What kind is he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust a bird dog. Aren\u2019t ya, Coop?\u201d Damien scratched between the dog\u2019s ears, then smoothed his hand back to give a firm, affectionate pat to Cooper\u2019s side. \u201cHe was a rescue mutt...a pointer, most likely. He loves to hunt, don\u2019t you, boy?\u201d</p><p>The dog wagged furiously. That creature sure did love Damien...he could get in line with the rest of the town.</p><p>Damien\u2019s clothes finally registered. He was wearing his top-of-the-line gray and white camouflage jacket. \u201cYou went hunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were out hunting in this weather?\u201d Billy asked at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI did and I was.\u201d Damien directed his smile at her. \u201cQuail season doesn\u2019t end till February.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d So that was the important meeting that couldn\u2019t be interrupted? \u201cYou held all your calls so you could hunt?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff laughed. Good that someone found it amusing. \u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of wet for that?\u201d</p><p>She must\u2019ve been scowling because Damien chucked her chin, telling her, \u201cDon\u2019t look so bummed. I brought you a few quail in the cooler\u2014you can cook us up one of your gourmet feasts.\u201d</p><p>Damien wandered back into the den, and they followed. His sudden presence had her feeling a little smothered. She told herself she was glad he\u2019d had a good day. But it would\u2019ve been nice if he\u2019d at least fielded her call, instead of ignoring her and then showing up unannounced for dinner.</p><p>Billy went to the window and pulled back the curtain. It was full dark, and the snow glowed like a white blanket in the moonlight. \u201cI still can\u2019t get over that you were hunting in this weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a hunter, Sheriff?\u201d Damien settled on the couch. She sat stiffly on the end, and he scooted closer.</p><p>Billy seemed to be taking in every detail of their interaction, and it made her intensely uncomfortable. \u201cSure, I\u2019ve hunted,\u201d he said. \u201cI still have some venison in my freezer from the fall. And I love the snow...skiing, snowshoeing, it\u2019s all good. But choosing to sit in it? All day? Not my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d her mother chimed in.</p><p>Sorrow had to agree. If anyone was asking. Which they weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock it till you\u2019ve tried it,\u201d said Damien. \u201cWe hike around, it\u2019s good exercise. I\u2019ll take you sometime.\u201d</p><p>This whole exchange had her feeling peevish. \u201cYou never offered to take me.\u201d</p><p>Damien faced her full-on, asking earnestly, \u201cWould you like to go hunting with me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cA-ha! There you go.\u201d He addressed the whole room, saying, \u201cI tell you, it\u2019s more fun in the snow. More of a challenge.\u201d</p><p>Billy asked, \u201cWhat do you hunt with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-eight-gauge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s big for quail,\u201d her dad grunted from his recliner.</p><p>Damien turned to face him, not missing a beat. \u201cMister Bailey, when it comes to shooting, Rhett Akins gets it right.\u201d He warbled out the lyrics, \u201c\u2018A gun\u2019s like a woman...it\u2019s all how you hold her.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s laugh was explosive. He nodded sagely, his eyes brimming with warmth.</p><p>Maybe Bear should be the one dating Damien. She stood. \u201cBoy talk. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d</p><p>But Damien snagged his hand in her jeans pocket, catching her before she could escape. The gesture embarrassed her.</p><p>He tugged her back to the couch. \u201cWhat\u2019s eating at you, babe?\u201d</p><p>She shifted out from his grip. That was the thing\u2014she wasn\u2019t exactly sure what was eating at her. \u201cI thought you were supposed to have a big meeting with your dad today.\u201d</p><p>With a gusty exhale, Damien flopped back on the couch. \u201cOh, that. Yeah, we tabled it for another day. It was the old man who convinced me to go hunting instead. What was I supposed to do? He\u2019s the boss.\u201d</p><p>Of course Dabney could convince his son to get out of the office\u2014the world could be ending, and Damien would still jump at the chance to spend a day outdoors. The Simmons men had been butting heads over environmental issues, and Damien had been gaining support in the company. But the Simmons employees adored his dad, and Dabney probably wanted to buy time to remind them of that fact.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just trying to distract you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Looking at Billy, Damien explained, \u201cMy dad and I have a long-running argument when it comes to how much we should cut down and where.\u201d He paused, mimicking his dad\u2019s booming voice, \u201c\u2018People need paper, son.\u2019 But there\u2019s a way to do it mindful of the native habitat, you know? That\u2019s just good PR. And hell, it\u2019s good for the wildlife, too.\u201d</p><p>The men got to talking about the logging business, and she took that as her excuse to finally make her escape.</p><p>Her mom followed her into the kitchen, her voice a frantic whisper. \u201cSorrow Ann Bailey.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow stopped. \u201cUh-oh. The middle name\u2014I must be in trouble now. What is it, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be a good hostess and ask that boyfriend of yours to eat with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows he can eat with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you invite him. A man needs to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat is this, 1950?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Bailey.\u201d Damien appeared in the doorway. \u201cGot enough food for one more?\u201d</p><p>Her mother gave her a pointed look before scurrying from the room. Something about this whole situation put Sorrow out of joint. She turned on Damien. \u201cDo you have to call me Bailey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling you Bailey since junior high.\u201d He reached for her hair, twirling a wave around his finger. \u201cSorrow\u2019s just such a...I don\u2019t know...a mopey name.\u201d</p><p>Mopey. \u201cYeah, and it\u2019s all mine.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close, nestling her body against his. \u201cC\u2019mon, mopey. Give me a proper hello.\u201d</p><p>It was nice having a man who cared. Nice not to be alone. Wonderful how he\u2019d gotten her out of so many jams. Was she taking him for granted? She should want him around when she didn\u2019t need his help.</p><p>She tried to put herself into the moment. That hard body of his felt good. She glanced up. Damien sure looked good, too. So why did she feel so put-upon? Shouldn\u2019t she feel all melty at his touch? It was nice, but shouldn\u2019t it be electrifying, too?</p><p>She gauged the talk in the other room. Billy\u2019s deep voice, her mother chatting away, and Dad\u2019s occasional humph. They were deep in conversation. It didn\u2019t seem like anyone would come in and catch them kissing.</p><p>As she stood on her toes, she wondered why she was feeling so self-conscious. She told herself it was just polite. It was a considerate thing, not kissing one\u2019s boyfriend in front of one\u2019s dinner guest.</p><p>Damien\u2019s hands were warm and sure, sweeping down her back to cup her bottom. \u201cShorty,\u201d he teased. \u201cI need to pull you up to reach me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled her higher onto her toes, and she wrapped her arms around his neck for a slow kiss. She tried to forget herself, but remained overly aware of the hum of conversation in the other room. She wanted to push the voices out of her mind, but they weren\u2019t to be ignored.</p><p>Damien must\u2019ve sensed it, because he broke the kiss to nip along her jaw, nuzzling in behind her ear. \u201cC\u2019mon, gorgeous\u201d was a hot whisper in her ear.</p><p>A shiver rippled across her skin. The man definitely had some good moves.</p> <p>\u201cSorrow,\u201d her mother called, \u201cdo I smell something burning?\u201d</p><p>That was the problem\u2014nothing was burning at the moment. Putting her hands on Damien\u2019s arms, she pulled away, and they both sighed.</p><p>\u201cMom won\u2019t want to keep hungry men waiting,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He touched his forehead to hers. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019re blowing me off again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe cooking dinner is hardly blowing you off.\u201d Though she did find she was anxious to get back to her cooking, for more than one reason.</p> <p>He gave her shoulders a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m a patient man.\u201d</p><p>Her mom bustled into the kitchen to toss a couple of empty bottles into the recycling bin. \u201cI set another place, Damien. You\u2019ll be sitting right across from the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>A knot twisted in Sorrow\u2019s belly.</p><p>Not what she\u2019d pictured for the evening. Though why that was so troublesome to her, she had no idea.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Billy studied the man across from him. If he had to be honest with himself, he might say he was a little jealous of Damien Simmons. Not the guy\u2019s looks, which were good, and not even his bank account, which seemed sizeable. It was the guy\u2019s ease, that nonchalant way he carried himself through the world.</p> <p>Billy had lost his ease when he\u2019d lost his wife.</p><p>But Damien was young, eager to take life by the horns. He was the sort of guy who flirted with every waitress and cracked jokes with strangers. As though he were a friend to all.</p><p>Which made Billy wonder how much anybody really knew the guy.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is actual bamboo?\u201d Damien studied the food speared on the end of his fork. \u201cDoes that make me a panda?\u201d He gave the table a cheeky smile before shoving a hearty bite in his mouth.</p><p>Bear chewed and swallowed, frowning all the while. \u201cWhy you didn\u2019t just toss the fish on the grill is beyond me. Some butter, a little salt, there\u2019s a good meal right there. Takes a lot less time, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be enjoying it well enough,\u201d Sorrow said, not looking up from her plate.</p><p>Billy had to agree. The man complained a lot, but he sure did seem to be clearing his plate. He watched her father bristle, and jumped in to defray the tension. \u201cWell, I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Damien chimed in, not to be outdone. \u201cTotally.\u201d</p> <p>The compliment seemed rote, so Billy added, \u201cI used to eat a lot of Thai, and this is as good as any I got in the Bay Area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sheriff.\u201d Sorrow put her fork down, seeming genuinely touched.</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, overcome by a feeling of contentment. It must\u2019ve been a combination of good food, a cold beer, and general conviviality. And, he realized, it was because of Sorrow, too.</p><p>That she\u2019d asked about Keri had somehow drawn an invisible thread, connecting the two of them. His grief set him apart from other people, but Sorrow\u2019s openness had offered him a bridge back. He waited for the guilt to hit, but oddly, it didn\u2019t come.</p><p>The thought was interrupted when the dog exploded into frantic barking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go check it out.\u201d Damien scooted away from the table, nodding an apology. \u201cHey, quiet, Coop,\u201d he said, his voice carrying to them as he walked into the foyer. When he returned, he had a pretty blonde by his side. \u201cLook who I found.\u201d</p><p>Edith jumped up from the table with a squeal, and a smile finally cracked Bear\u2019s surly expression. Sorrow, though, her shoulders tensed. It was almost imperceptible, but Billy had been trained to spot such subtle cues.</p><p>Edith hugged the woman over and over, exclaiming, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Why didn\u2019t you call to say you were coming? You didn\u2019t drive all the way from San Francisco in this weather? Billy! You have to meet our Laura.\u201d</p><p>He pushed away from the table to stand.</p><p>\u201cMy older sister,\u201d Sorrow said, and he noticed she didn\u2019t jump out of her seat as quickly as her mother had.</p><p>\u201cLaura, meet our new sheriff.\u201d</p><p>She slipped a tiny hand into his, smiling wide. \u201cOoh, you\u2019re much cuter than the last sheriff.\u201d</p><p>The comment took him aback. The sisters weren\u2019t just different, they were very different, and women like this put him on his guard. He wanted to come off as friendly, but not too much like he was taking her bait, and he fumbled for an appropriate reply. \u201cI\u2019m glad to oblige. Though I hear your last sheriff was a good man.\u201d</p><p>Laura shrugged and wandered to the table. She poked at the curried salmon, swishing it around with the serving spoon. \u201cIs that hard-ass deputy still there?\u201d</p><p>Billy chuckled at that. \u201cWho, McGinn? He\u2019s a lamb, once you get to know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Laura said. She dropped the spoon into the serving dish, and it landed in the sauce with a plop.</p><p>Billy\u2019s smile turned speculative. If first impressions meant anything, this girl was a handful. It made him appreciate Sorrow all the more. He stole a look at her as she watched Laura with guarded eyes.</p><p>\u201cSit down, sit down.\u201d Edith shooed her eldest daughter to an empty seat, helping her out of her coat. It was a short, puffy thing that looked like it belonged in a magazine spread.</p><p>\u201cYou can eat bamboo with us,\u201d Damien said as he emerged from the kitchen carrying a fresh plate, napkin, and cutlery.</p><p>Billy had to give the guy props for being Boyfriend of the Year material.</p><p>They all returned to their seats, and Damien reached over to spoon some food onto Laura\u2019s plate, but she put a hand up to stop him. \u201cI ate already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing out,\u201d Billy said, using the opportunity to study her. Light from the wrought-iron chandelier caught her profile, and he saw the family resemblance. But although she had the same blond hair and delicate features as Sorrow, the similarities ended there.</p><p>Unlike her sister, Laura didn\u2019t have a hair out of place. Everything from her designer snow boots, to her skinny jeans, to the fake fur of her jacket collar spoke to urban-professional-goes-snow-bunny. She had a gym body, too, all taut lines to match her taut demeanor.</p><p>Not like Sorrow, who had the body of a real woman. He much preferred a girl with something to hold on to.</p><p>Damn, what was his problem? He took a big swig of his beer. He barely knew these people, and he was a guest in their home, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess this means the road is open again,\u201d said Bear.</p><p>\u201cThanks to the sheriff and his efforts,\u201d Sorrow said.</p><p>Laura\u2019s face lit, and she looked from her sister to him, and Billy sensed the female cogs turning. Had she read his thoughts? The possibility there might be a connection between him and Sorrow that was that obvious made him a little queasy.</p><p>They might\u2019ve had a friendly spark, but no way could it ever be more than that. She had a boyfriend\u2014who was sitting right there\u2014and even if she didn\u2019t, he\u2019d sworn off relationships. He\u2019d learned the hard way how all the clich\u00e9s were right. Love hurt, and he\u2019d never put himself through it again.</p><p>Laura met his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re making friends already, Sheriff. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man tries.\u201d He made his voice as bland as he could.</p><p>\u201cTries and succeeds, apparently.\u201d She reached over and tweaked her father\u2019s ear. \u201cIt takes a lot to get a compliment out of grumpy old Bear Bailey.\u201d</p><p>Her dad did his darnedest to bite back a smile. Billy made a mental note: apparently a statement of fact followed by a noncommittal grunt could be counted as a compliment where Bear was concerned.</p><p>Laura continued her assessment, and Billy polished his beer off too quickly, nervous under the scrutiny. \u201cI see you\u2019re not just strapping,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re also a can-do man.\u201d She looked to Sorrow with teasing eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll bet Helen at the bar is all over him.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow looked as uncomfortable as Billy felt. She steered the conversation to another topic, her voice absent of emotion. \u201cWhat brings you back to Sierra Falls?\u201d</p><p>Laura\u2019s reaction was subtle, but it was immediate. A cloud crossed her features, dimming the light in her eyes. \u201cI thought I\u2019d take a vacation.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow sipped her beer slowly, and Billy felt tension crackle between them. \u201cWhat about your job?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Laura shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s like a...sabbatical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a nun thing,\u201d said Bear. He was following the conversation, even though he mostly remained focused on his plate of food.</p><p>Sorrow ignored her father. \u201cIsn\u2019t that just for...I don\u2019t know...professors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was...it is a very high-stress job. You have no idea how cutthroat it is in Silicon Valley these days. Especially in Marketing.\u201d</p><p>Edith turned to Billy and beamed. \u201cLaura is vice president of her department.\u201d</p><p>Laura looked down as she twirled her napkin. She\u2019d gone from bubbly to cagey, and Billy half wondered if maybe she hadn\u2019t lost her job and was just too scared to tell her folks.</p><p>\u201cHow good you can take a vacation then.\u201d Sorrow kept talking, but seemed either unwilling or unable to meet her sister\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll be able to help around the lodge this time. I know you were too busy on your last visit. Reno, Tahoe...I understand there\u2019s a lot to do when you\u2019re on vacation.\u201d</p><p>Edith chimed in, \u201cNow, that won\u2019t be necessary. We\u2019ve got everything under control, don\u2019t we, Sorrow?\u201d</p><p>Billy hadn\u2019t been coming to the lodge for long, but if this was under control, he\u2019d hate to see when things got out of hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOn the contrary, Mom.\u201d Laura smiled wide. \u201cI\u2019d love to pitch in.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow stood abruptly to clear the dishes. \u201cI made a pie.\u201d</p><p>Now Billy had to stare flat out. Laura had offered help, and wasn\u2019t that what Sorrow needed? And yet she seemed upset. He stood to help, too curious to do otherwise.</p> <p>Damien made a move to get up, but Billy stopped him. \u201cI got this one.\u201d</p><p>The other man raised his beer in a toast to thank him. \u201cWorks for me.

She turned her back to him, stacking dishes in the sink.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like nothing in there.\u201d</p> <p>She stiffened. Paused. \u201cEvery once in a while, my sister breezes in.\u201d</p><p>He wondered what she wasn\u2019t saying. He wasn\u2019t one for female drama, but something about this situation piqued his interest. \u201cSeems like you could use the help,\u201d he ventured.</p><p>She dropped the dish she\u2019d been washing and turned to face him. \u201cTrust me, the next time there\u2019s a problem around here, Laura will claim some personal drama and make a break for it, heading back to San Francisco faster than you can say Miss Fancy-pants Vice President.\u201d</p><p>Billy chuckled. \u201cThat so? Well, maybe that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>Bear\u2019s belly laugh reached them from the other room, and Sorrow looked stricken by the sound of it. \u201cStick around long enough, Sheriff, and you\u2019ll see. There\u2019s a favorite daughter, and it ain\u2019t me.\u201d She\u2019d tossed the comment off, but he heard the pain beneath her breezy delivery.</p><p>This Laura might sail in all charm and sass, but it was Sorrow who struck him as the backbone of the family. He met her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t have siblings, but I\u2019ve done enough living to know that favorite and most valued are often two very different things.</p> <p>\u201cAnd besides,\u201d he added, \u201cmaybe she\u2019ll distract Bear long enough for you to start serving that frittata of yours in the tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe so.\u201d She softened her features, giving him a grateful smile. Up close like this, the girl was so pretty she seemed to glow from within.</p><p>Such an errant thought, it struck him dumb for a moment. He wasn\u2019t looking for a woman. He had one, and he\u2019d buried her. This one already had a man anyhow. He told himself it was purely neutral observation that had him thinking how much prettier Sorrow was than her sister, even though it was Laura who probably caught more men\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d she said as she pulled a pie from the fridge. \u201cYou ever have Butter Pie?\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew wide as a kid\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. There\u2019s such a thing as Butter Pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy specialty. Made just this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it really what it sounds like it is?\u201d He stepped closer to take an appreciative sniff. \u201cMy life has been incomplete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. Butter, sugar, vanilla, eggs. Some whipped cream on top. Some people add cranberries but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCranberries?\u201d he interrupted. \u201cWhy mess with beige perfection?\u201d</p><p>She giggled, and it was a good sound. \u201cShould we go for broke?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a hearty nod. \u201cHell, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab some ice cream. A little more beige never hurt anyone.\u201d She pointed to one of the drawers. \u201cScooper\u2019s in there.\u201d</p><p>He snagged the ice cream, scoop, and a stack of plates, and followed her back into the dining room, practically salivating from the wonderful smell.</p><p>Laura peered at the pie dish, frowning. \u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Sorrow said, and the change in her attitude was visible.</p><p>Laura folded her napkin and put it onto her plate. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t eat that.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow\u2019s arms and shoulders were stiff as she put the dish onto a trivet. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me you were coming, I\u2019d have baked my famous Splenda and Air Pie instead.\u201d</p><p>Billy choked back a laugh, cheering inside. If the other woman was going to be so uptight, he was glad they\u2019d added a big tub of ice cream to the spread. All the better to torture her with. As he sat back down, he told her, \u201cI say you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy, huh?\u201d Laura got a glint in her eye that made him wish he\u2019d kept his mouth shut. \u201cWhy am I crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo pass up this food. Your sister\u2019s cooking is some of the best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>Laura gave him a coy smile. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying, I don\u2019t need to watch my figure?\u201d</p><p>What the hell was he saying? This woman was a wily one\u2014was she baiting him? Flirting with him? All he knew was, he\u2019d better watch out for these land mines. \u201cI\u2019m saying...I\u2019m gonna shut up and eat some Butter Pie.\u201d And he took a giant bite to prove his point.</p><p>They all laughed. Except for Sorrow.</p><p>He looked over at her. If anyone was becoming a friend in this town, it was her, and he automatically sought her gaze to share the moment. But her eyes were flat, pinned on her sister.</p><p>He knew women. He\u2019d been married. He\u2019d had many women friends through the years, a number of female coworkers. He appreciated the fairer sex, listened to them, enjoyed their perspective, their company. And so he recognized her expression.</p><p>It was jealousy.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Laura pointed angrily at the TV. \u201cWhat the hell is she making?\u201d She was sprawled in one corner of their giant sectional couch and turned to glare at Sorrow seated stiffly in the other.</p><p>Sorrow grabbed the remote and made a show of upping the volume. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Laura. I can\u2019t hear over your talking.\u201d</p><p>Laura leaned over and snatched it from her. \u201cIt\u2019s 4:00, there must be a talk show on. She\u2019s just cooking\u2014how is that interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I just want one little break.\u201d Sorrow snatched back the remote. \u201cI was working all morning. I\u2019ll be working in the tavern all night. What have you been doing all day? I have this one tiny window when I can relax, and this is what I want to watch. If you\u2019re so bored, why don\u2019t you go do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Laura moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you\u2019re twelve. You should finish unpacking. You brought enough stuff to clothe an army.\u201d</p><p>Laura slumped into the couch, ignoring the suggestion. \u201cDo we have to watch the Food Network?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe host is discussing techniques for velveting tofu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExciting,\u201d her sister said sarcastically. Then she made a grumpy hmph sound. \u201cDo you really need to know this? You should just be a chef.\u201d</p><p>It was an offhand comment, but it made Sorrow feel like her head might explode. Old resentments burbled to the surface. \u201cGee, Laura, I\u2019d love to be a chef. But I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a suggestion. No need to bite my head off.\u201d Laura shrugged. \u201cMaybe if you spruced this place up a little, it\u2019d be more interesting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you hadn\u2019t fled Sierra Falls, this place wouldn\u2019t need sprucing.\u201d Sorrow angrily upped the volume. \u201cSprucing. Of course the place needs sprucing. Duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, cowgirl. I\u2019m just saying, if you livened it up around here, maybe you\u2019d get more visitors. Keep you busy. I don\u2019t know how you survive out here in the woods.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow muted the TV to glare at her sister. \u201cBusy. You don\u2019t know the meaning of busy. You cut and ran after graduation, leaving me holding the bag.\u201d</p><p>When Laura left, their brother BJ was already off at college on a ROTC scholarship, committed to serve upon finishing. By the time it was Sorrow\u2019s turn to make her life choices, her father had had his stroke, and somebody needed to stay behind and help run the place. Their mother definitely couldn\u2019t handle it; too many of their simple day-to-day chores\u2014shoveling snow, unloading groceries, hauling guests\u2019 suitcases up and down stairs\u2014were just too physical for her. And so Sorrow had given up on her dreams to stay behind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having this conversation again,\u201d Laura said.</p><p>\u201cSo now you can tell me what I can and can\u2019t talk about?\u201d Sorrow had been holding her feelings in for some time. All she\u2019d wanted to do was sit and watch her stupid program in peace. Her feet were killing her, and something about Laura\u2019s pouting pushed her to the breaking point. \u201cYou can tell your fancy coworkers what to do, but you\u2019re not vice president of me, so don\u2019t come here and think you can boss me around. You have so not earned the right to breeze in and tell me how I should be doing things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d Laura said under her breath. She looked away, back at the screen. \u201cRelax. I\u2019m not bossing. I was just making some friendly suggestions.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow ignored her and barreled on. \u201cYou left for bigger horizons, leaving me here, doing work I don\u2019t really want to do.\u201d</p><p>Laura rolled her eyes. \u201cLook, don\u2019t do me any favors. Nobody said you had to stay home and live with Mom and Dad. If you don\u2019t like it, make a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Sorrow turned off the TV\u2014she was unable to follow it anyway\u2014and scooted sideways to face her sister. \u201cSo, what, I was supposed to leave after Dad\u2019s stroke?\u201d It\u2019d happened when she was a junior in high school. He\u2019d been laid-up for months. Gradually, she\u2019d taken on responsibilities, until one day she was the one who was basically running the place.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Laura said. \u201cYou seem pretty happy to me. You\u2019re like queen of the castle here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Sorrow snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly unicorns and rainbows around here. But I do the best I can with what I\u2019ve got. Unlike some people who visit their family so they have a whole new audience to complain to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you should feel free to complain to me, any old time,\u201d Laura said blandly. \u201cYou hold things in forever, and then explode when it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. How are people supposed to know how you feel if you don\u2019t let anybody in? Even Damien\u2014it seems like you\u2019re keeping him at arm\u2019s length. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with that sheriff. I saw you giving him googly eyes. The man\u2019s too old for you. You should just stick with Damien. You want help around the lodge, you need to go for the hot, rich one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sorrow thought her vision might go red. \u201cWait right there. Let me clarify something. So, your version of letting you in actually means letting you tell me what to do? Like I need your advice.\u201d</p><p>Laura gave her an evil look. \u201cIf the shoe fits...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, thanks for being there for me,\u201d Sorrow said, sarcasm thick in her voice. \u201cThis has been awesome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine, forget the Damien-Billy thing. If you\u2019re so in over your head, I see some things you could be doing better. My life hasn\u2019t exactly been a fairy tale either, but I\u2019ve got experience. You could actually try listening to me for once.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow glared. \u201cOh, so I should let you take over? Just the easy things, though, like having Big Ideas. Stuff like shoveling snow, I can still hang around to do that. You know, actually, Dad would love that. He and Mom seem to love you unconditionally. Laura, Laura, Laura, she can do no wrong. Vice President Laura is soooo experienced.\u201d</p><p>Laura sat bolt upright. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re the one Dad has running the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hardly running the show. He has his nose in everything. Second-guesses everything. Unlike you, who can do no wrong.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, and Sorrow answered with a clipped \u201cHello?\u201d It was Helen from the tavern calling. Their water heater had sprung a leak. \u201cOf course it did,\u201d Sorrow said, hearing the news.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d Laura asked when Sorrow hung up.</p><p>\u201cThe water heater is leaking. It\u2019s a commercial model. That means a very big leak.\u201d Sorrow cradled her head in her hands, trying to think.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Laura asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should let me help. You\u2019re just being stubborn.\u201d Laura got up from the couch. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done butting heads, let me know. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow gave her a tired look. \u201cLook, I appreciate the offer, all right? But when it comes down to it, you can\u2019t really help unless you live here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. Whatever. Damien knows the place. You should call him.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow stared at the phone in her lap, wishing everyone would stop pushing her toward Damien. \u201cIt seems like all I do lately is lean on him for help.\u201d</p><p>Laura shrugged it off. \u201cEh, guys love swooping in on their white horses to give a lady a hand.\u201d</p><p>She might not trust her sister with the lodge, but Laura sure knew men better than Sorrow did. Damien did seem to like helping. Besides, whatever their relationship was, he had a genuine affection for her family. Still, she hedged. \u201cIt\u2019s taking advantage of him, calling so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamien Simmons is not the kind of man who lets himself be taken advantage of.\u201d Laura waggled her eyebrows. \u201cHey, I imagine if any advantage is taken, it\u2019ll be when he cashes in on your gratitude later tonight.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow blushed. \u201cLaura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Laura said. \u201cCall him.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she was just being stubborn. Finally, she picked up the phone, hating the feel of Laura\u2019s eyes on her as she dialed.</p> <p>They had a quick conversation, and he rose to the occasion like he always did. Her boyfriend loved saving the day. He was great at saving the day. He did it all day long in his high-powered job at Simmons Timber. A broken water heater was just one more thing for Damien to triumph over.</p><p>She hung up and told her sister, \u201cHe said we should get a tankless heater to replace it. His plumber is coming out today. The guy owes Damien some favor, so he\u2019s going to comp the labor.\u201d</p><p>Laura gave her a wicked smile. \u201cLike I said. Hot and rich.\u201d</p><p>But Sorrow could only scowl at that, unable to shake the feeling that she and her problems were just more items on Damien\u2019s list to conquer.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Sully wiped his forehead on his sleeve, and the stink of fry grease filled his head. He could probably boil that shirt in bleach, and still the stench would cling to it. He was sick of spending every day smelling like burgers.</p><p>He peeked through the window into the dining area. Folks had begun drifting in for lunch, and it\u2019d be mostly burgers and fries for the next two hours.</p><p>But he had a job, and he did it. A man didn\u2019t serve in the Army without learning a sense of duty and responsibility.</p><p>A wave of laughter swept in, and he scanned the room. He spotted Edith and her two daughters seated at a table. They hadn\u2019t been the source of the merriment, that was for sure. They were showing Laura those old letters, but instead of it being a happy occasion, the tension was as heavy as the stink of fry grease.</p><p>Edith was acting clueless as ever, pretending it was all good. But he knew better\u2014she really knew every single thing that went on in the lodge, and acting oblivious was her way of making everyone work out their own problems. Genius, if you asked him.</p><p>They\u2019d pulled over a few extra chairs. Would Marlene be joining them? He tuned his ear to their conversation.</p><p>\u201cListen to this part.\u201d Laura waved one of the letters, and she was practically vibrating with excitement. \u201c\u2018Sierra Falls is like a bit of gold sparkling in a dry creek bed.\u2019\u201d She slammed her hand down on the table. \u201cSee? We\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve struck gold. We make a Web site and pull some of these Buck Larsen quotes to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a Buck Larsen quote,\u201d Sorrow said, and Sully heard the steel in her voice. \u201cThat\u2019s a Sorrow Crabtree quote. If you just read further\u201d\u2014Sorrow snatched the letter from her sister\u2014\u201cshe writes, \u2018I don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t see the beauty. How you could ever leave such a place. How you could leave me.\u2019 If anything, it sounds like he couldn\u2019t get out of here fast enough.\u201d She gave Laura a pointed look. \u201cSounds like some people I know.\u201d</p><p>Laura waved it off. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. People will get the gist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter? How can you say that? We can\u2019t rewrite history. It\u2019s enough that Buck Larsen lived in Sierra Falls for a time and that he left an illegitimate child behind. We don\u2019t need to make it some misty-eyed interpretation. In fact, I think the real truth is just as interesting as your version.\u201d</p><p>Laura snatched the letter back again. \u201cIt\u2019s not as interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful with those,\u201d the younger sister snapped.</p><p>\u201cThis is called marketing, Sorrow. People love a love story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what marketing is, Laura. I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Popping grease brought Sully\u2019s attention back to where it should be, and he ducked back into the kitchen. It was just as he suspected\u2014tensions were running high.</p><p>Growing up, the two Bailey girls had been near enough in age to be a nuisance to each other, yet far enough apart that their worlds didn\u2019t intersect. By the time Laura got to high school, she naturally hadn\u2019t wanted anything to do with her kid sister, and then she\u2019d gone straight to college, and on to a high-powered job in San Francisco. She didn\u2019t get home much, and the girls had never really gotten to know each other.</p><p>And now that they were adults, their surface differences kept them apart. But he knew, they weren\u2019t so different in their hearts. If only they\u2019d give themselves a chance to see it.</p><p>He quickly flipped his burgers and wandered back to the window just in time to see Laura snatching the letters back. He couldn\u2019t help but smirk. Both girls had grown into strong, independent women, but this was turning into a childish squabble.</p><p>\u201cMom, tell her.\u201d Laura turned in her chair to challenge Edith. \u201cI majored in marketing. I have a degree in it.\u201d</p><p>Edith gave her youngest a rueful look. \u201cHoney, Laura is vice president of her company\u2019s marketing department.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow seemed ready to explode. \u201cWell, I have a degree in running this lodge, which is just as real as her experience.\u201d</p><p>It was silly, pure and simple. The lodge was falling down around their ears, and they had a real find in these historical letters. Why they wouldn\u2019t just talk it out was beyond him. They were all nuts...just one big fruitcake sitting there, sipping their Diet Cokes.</p><p>The door opened, and Sully held his breath. It was Marlene\u2019s entourage, Emerald, Pearl, and Ruby Kidd. The three grandes dames of Sierra Falls were a slow-moving barge of white hair, colorful clip-on earrings, and the scent of powder. And where Marlene\u2019s aunts and mother went, she was never far behind.</p><p>He gave a quick check to the grill, and darted out from the kitchen to help usher them in. Flurries blew in on a gust of cold air, and he angled his body in the doorway to block it. It put him face-to-face with Marlene.</p><p>Hell, but she was a fine figure of a woman. Winter had finally settled in for good, but she didn\u2019t frump up like some of the others did. Her down coat was white and sleek, and her sunglasses reminded him of something Jackie O would\u2019ve worn. The lady was all class.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tom,\u201d she told him, and the sound of his Christian name on her tongue was good on his ears.</p><p>She pulled off her sunglasses, and the smile she gave him knocked his socks off. She hadn\u2019t done any nonsense to her face like he\u2019d seen with other women their age. The years were plain on her face, and she was the more beautiful for it.</p><p>\u201cLooking lovely, Marlene. As ever.\u201d Sully frowned. She deserved more than whoever that milksop was she\u2019d met for drinks. Now he would know how to treat her right. Why shouldn\u2019t he meet a woman like Marlene for drinks? Why not Marlene herself? Yet he couldn\u2019t seem to get away from flipping Bear\u2019s damned burgers.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sweet talking me, why is it you look like you just sucked a lemon?\u201d</p><p>He had nothing to say to that\u2014although he was sure that, come midnight, a half dozen good responses would come to him. Cursing his lack of words, he could only grin at her, feeling like a fool.</p><p>She carefully folded her sunglasses and put them in her bag. Giving him a polite smile in return, she glided across the room to join the Bailey women.</p><p>Sully headed back to the kitchen, but when Edith popped out of her chair to get the women their teas and sodas, he saw his second chance. \u201cYou sit,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll get your drinks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laura twisted around to look at the bar. \u201cWhere\u2019s Helen?\u201d</p><p>Bear grumbled, \u201cYeah, where is that woman? Bar won\u2019t tend itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Sully said, \u201cand I don\u2019t care to know.\u201d There was a saying for women like Helen: a mess in a dress. He\u2019d spent years trying to find some inner peace, and getting embroiled in the dramas of his coworkers wasn\u2019t high on his list.</p> <p>The man seated next to Bear at the bar grumbled, \u201cGive the woman a break. I hear her husband\u2019s a real son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Deputy Marshall McGinn had been seated at the end of the bar, and he stood to put on his jacket. \u201cIt\u2019s morning yet, Bear. Pour your own damned coffee. Or Sully can pour it for you.\u201d</p><p>Sully shot him a snarling look. \u201cAren\u2019t you on duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch out,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cOr Marshall might give you a ticket next time he sees you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look at him funny and he\u2019ll give you a ticket,\u201d another said. \u201cAin\u2019t that right, Deputy?\u201d</p> <p>Marshall only shook his head at that, and a round of laughter followed him out of the tavern. McGinn was a by-the-book sort of deputy. Former military, with an honorable discharge after getting wounded in Iraq, he took his job in law enforcement more seriously than some folks in Sierra Falls deemed necessary.</p><p>Sully went behind the bar to pour the women their drinks. There was no need to ask what they were having\u2014the older ones always had iced tea, and the younger ones their diet colas. The women\u2019s chatter resumed, and he gave it half an ear.</p><p>His mind was on one thing: Marlene Jessup\u2019s perfume. It beat the smell of fry grease any day of the week.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Marlene watched Tom as he walked to the bar. The way he\u2019d looked at her...it\u2019d been a look. And she hadn\u2019t had one of those looks in years.</p><p>She\u2019d sworn off men. She was going to live as an independent woman who followed her own passions. So if all that was true, then why was she sneaking a peek at him in return?</p> <p>Ruby leaned in. \u201cIf you ask me, it\u2019s not right, not showing up for work. That Helen\u2019s a fast woman. Lord knows where she\u2019s off to.\u201d The woman\u2019s conspiratorial whisper hadn\u2019t been a whisper at all.</p><p>\u201cYou hush.\u201d Marlene nudged her aunt\u2019s arm. \u201cThat\u2019s not our business.\u201d</p><p>Pearl ignored her, adding, \u201cDoesn\u2019t pay to be a fast woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Emerald was a fast woman,\u201d Ruby said.</p><p>At mention of her mother\u2019s name, Marlene felt her cheeks go hot. She looked at her mother as she said, \u201cGood on Mama for getting out of Sierra Falls and living a little.\u201d</p><p>Marlene\u2019s grandfather, Frederick Bose Kidd, had been a pinched old tough-as-nails preacher, and he\u2019d raised the Kidd sisters with a heavy hand and a hefty dose of brimstone. It was no wonder they were all spinsters.</p><p>Her aunt pressed on and said with a definitive nod, \u201cFast living is what gave our Emerald the Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Laura muttered under her breath.</p> <p>Sorrow gave a beleaguered sigh. \u201cNot this again.\u201d</p><p>But Laura only laughed. \u201cSo...having sex before marriage gives you Alzheimer\u2019s in your later years?\u201d</p><p>Marlene wanted to say something to hush such inappropriate talk, but froze when she saw that Laura\u2019s comment had brought an unlikely, matching smile to Sorrow\u2019s face. Such sisterly goodwill was just too valuable to censor.</p><p>\u201cI love their scientific theories,\u201d Laura said.</p><p>\u201cSome things never change,\u201d Sorrow agreed.</p><p>\u201cEmerald\u2019s the one who frittered away her youth,\u201d Pearl said. She and Ruby looked like a matched pair of bookends, shaking their heads in judgment.</p><p>Laura looked from Emerald to the other women, amazement on her face. Ma was wearing her usual pleasantly blank expression. \u201cShe\u2019s sitting right here.\u201d</p><p>Little did Laura know that she and Sorrow sounded just as callous when they fought. Apparently every generation of sisters had its fair share of trouble.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t listen anymore,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cFast living took its toll.\u201d</p><p>Marlene couldn\u2019t keep it in any longer. \u201cGood heavens,\u201d she erupted, \u201cdon\u2019t say such things. That\u2019s your sister you\u2019re talking about. And my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, dear?\u201d Mama asked, a smile in her voice. The old woman had spent a lifetime bearing her sisters\u2019 judgment with a mischievous good humor that never seemed to flag. Even now, even with the senility that encroached more each day, she still wore that smile.</p><p>Marlene fought the urge to hop up and hug her. Instead, she reached over and put a napkin under Mama\u2019s glass of iced tea where it\u2019d sweat a puddle onto the table. One day soon she\u2019d need to put her in a home. It was the hardest decision she\u2019d ever faced. Some days Ma was the same woman as always, kind and playful. But other days, it was like a part of her was missing. The mind was a funny thing, solid but with blank spots, like Swiss cheese.</p><p>Edith finally joined in, speaking with an uncharacteristic edge. \u201cPearl, Ruby, you\u2019re sounding like your father.\u201d</p><p>Ruby sat erect in her chair, looking prim as ever. \u201cEmerald was the one who ran off. Not us.\u201d Her aunt was as stubborn as the day was long, and Marlene wished for once she were disrespectful enough to tell her so.</p><p>\u201cMet some man. In Los An-ge-les.\u201d Pearl said, elongating the words. \u201cGot herself in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Laura touched her shoulder to Sorrow\u2019s, whispering, \u201cSeriously? Emerald went to LA?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow nodded. \u201cWord is, she used to party with Olivia de Havilland.\u201d</p><p>Marlene had to unlock her jaw to speak. \u201cYou ladies are just jealous.\u201d</p><p>She put up with a lot, but this was getting to be too much. She\u2019d used what meager nest egg she had to wall off the porch so the women could have a TV room. She\u2019d put off vacations, and trips, and lunches with friends, always taking a backseat to what her aunts and mother might need. And it had gotten to be too much.</p><p>Tom hustled from behind the bar with the tray. \u201cHow \u2019bout some iced tea for you ladies?\u201d He caught and held her eye. There was an earnest look on his face. He seemed anxious to change the topic. For her sake.</p><p>She pulled her shoulders back, suddenly self-aware. Earlier, he\u2019d told her she looked lovely. She felt his continued scrutiny and wished she\u2019d gone to the restroom to touch up her makeup before sitting down.</p><p>The thought had her gaze breaking from his. What was she doing, flirting? The man\u2019s nickname was Sully, for goodness sake.</p><p>\u201cSully!\u201d Bear\u2019s bellowing voice rose stopped the chatter. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? I don\u2019t pay you to pour drinks. Is that something burning? Get on those burgers, man. Beef ain\u2019t cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d Sully was back in the kitchen in a flash, but not before Marlene heard him whisper, \u201cI never burned a damned burger in my life.\u201d</p><p>He returned a few minutes later with a handful of red plastic baskets, carrying orders of burgers and fries, a couple of chicken clubs, and one grilled cheese.</p><p>Marlene couldn\u2019t resist one more exchange. When she caught his eye, she said, \u201cLook at you, Tom. Serving the women. What will Bear say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a good God damn what the man says.\u201d His delivery was deadpan, but the wicked look he gave her made her giggle.</p><p>She covered her mouth. When had she last giggled? Trying for a little poise, she said, \u201cCooking, tending bar, and now this? Seems to me you need a day off.\u201d</p><p>Her mother looked up at Sully as he served her a club sandwich. The powder on her face had separated, settling into her deep wrinkles, but Mama\u2019s smile was just as bright. \u201cAren\u2019t you a gentleman?\u201d</p><p>He tipped his chin. \u201cA table of gentle ladies requires no less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom Sullivan,\u201d Marlene exclaimed. \u201cYou surprise me.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, she was flirting with the man. She was out of practice, but it felt good.</p><p>He put her grilled cheese before her. \u201cMore tea for you, Marlene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more and I\u2019ll float away.\u201d She made her smile broad and confident, eager to show Sully and the world that her ex-husband was a fool.</p><p>Sully put Laura\u2019s lunch in front of her. \u201cEat up,\u201d he told her, giving the girl\u2019s shoulder a squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m watching you, kid. You need to live on more than just Diet Coke and carrot sticks. You\u2019re wasting away to nothing.\u201d</p><p>The man was considerate. He noticed things.</p><p>He gave Marlene one last look, and she gave him her most pleasant smile. Maybe she could have a man in her life and her interests, too.</p><p>When he went back into the kitchen, Marlene got down to business. \u201cSorrow, did you bring the letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she said proudly, and began to hand a small stack to each woman.</p><p>\u201cThose letters belong to the family,\u201d Bear said from his perch at the bar.</p><p>Sorrow deflated like a balloon.</p><p>Sully poked his head from out of the pass-through. \u201cBear Bailey. Give the girl a break.\u201d</p><p>Marlene couldn\u2019t agree more. Even when Sorrow was just a kid, she\u2019d had those wise eyes that betrayed her as the type who felt responsibilities down to her core. Marlene had known then that someday the girl would suffer for it, taking on chores she didn\u2019t have time for, running errands for folks who, given an inch, would take a mile. Sorrow\u2019s was a dependable nature, and such a thing sometimes led a woman to betray her own heart.</p><p>Laura rolled her eyes. \u201cWhy does Sorrow need a break? Just because she has the same name doesn\u2019t mean those letters belong only to her.\u201d She turned her attention back to the table. \u201cIt\u2019s time to plan, and you ladies need to forget about your past festivals. The Buck Larsen Fair is going to be big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sorrow said with exaggerated patience, \u201ca Buck Larsen festival is exactly what we\u2019ve been talking about. Before you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should get the lodge involved,\u201d Laura said. \u201cRun a special weekend rate. Include discount festival tickets or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sorrow glared at her. \u201cYou let me worry about the lodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated the lodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are totally twisting my words.\u201d</p> <p>The girls were starting to snipe again, and it just made Marlene tired. She\u2019d endured enough sniping for the day. She caught a glimpse of Sully through the pass-through. What would he do if she just up and joined him? She could lean against the counter and sip her tea.</p><p>She tore her eyes away. The last thing she needed was a fry cook for a love interest. Best to stick to her previous plan: pouring heart and soul into the historical society. Which meant planning the best festival the area had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should advertise this year,\u201d Marlene interjected. \u201cWhat do you girls think?\u201d She purposely included both Bailey sisters.</p><p>\u201cI have all kinds of ideas about how we could handle it,\u201d Laura said. \u201cI\u2019ll do a press release, of course. Maybe align ourselves with some celebrity figure.\u201d</p><p>The ladies cooed at that. Laura was a handful\u2014not like Edith at all\u2014and when she was in charge, she was something else again. She\u2019d always been ambitious that way, must\u2019ve gotten it from Bear. Even back in her high school days, Laura was the kid who\u2019d sneak out after curfew and still make honor roll. It was clear why she was so successful as a career woman.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d Pearl asked, her voice awed.</p><p>Laura brightened. \u201cI have tons of marketing experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve heard,\u201d Sorrow muttered. \u201cFive thousand times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Ruby.</p><p>\u201cEdith, you must be so proud,\u201d Pearl added.</p><p>Edith smiled and reached across the table to pat her daughter\u2019s hand.</p> <p>The gesture gave Marlene the tiniest of pangs. She loved her boys, but had always wondered what it would\u2019ve been like to have a daughter. Her sourpuss daughter-in-law definitely didn\u2019t count.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be thrilled to take over publicity,\u201d Laura said, positively beaming. \u201cWe could do some online promotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fabulous,\u201d Marlene told her.</p><p>\u201cWith what money?\u201d Sorrow\u2019s voice was flat, and it gave Marlene pause. The girl looked like steam was about to pour from her ears.</p><p>Laura waved off the question. \u201cWe won\u2019t need much. We\u2019ll use Twitter. Make a Facebook fan page. Guerilla marketing stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorillas?\u201d Mama took that moment to tune in, sounding alarmed.</p><p>Pearl snuck a skeptical look at Ruby. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a permit for those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the fairgrounds will allow wild animals,\u201d Ruby agreed.</p> <p>Marlene choked back a laugh and almost spat out her tea. \u201cShe meant guerilla, like in warfare.\u201d</p><p>Pearl gave her head a prim shake. \u201cI think Buck Larsen is enough of a theme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear.\u201d Ruby gave Laura a soothing look. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to include things about wars, too.\u201d</p><p>Marlene rolled her eyes. This wasn\u2019t exactly going as planned.</p><p>Sorrow scooted her stool back with a loud scrape. \u201cYou know, you ladies have at it. My fearless sister seems to have this under control.\u201d She sidled up to the bar, calling into the kitchen, \u201cSully, I\u2019d love you forever if you made me one of your cookie sundaes.\u201d</p><p>He peeked out from the pass-through, a smile warming his face. \u201cYou got it, kid.\u201d</p><p>Marlene thought back. The last time she had a sundae she\u2019d been a kid herself. It made her think, Sully was so great with the Bailey kids, it was too bad he didn\u2019t have children of his own.</p><p>Her heart stuttered. Maybe he did. The man might have two dozen kids out there somewhere\u2014how was she to know?</p><p>She suddenly lost all interest in the conversation happening at the table and strained to catch every word of Sully and Sorrow\u2019s exchange. She studied his profile as he scooped the ice cream\u2014the man had a strong, clean-shaven jaw.</p><p>He peeked out again. \u201cYou still like whipped cream?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow made a face. \u201cDuh. It\u2019s not really a sundae if there\u2019s no whipped cream. And please, will you do that thing with the chocolate sauce?\u201d</p><p>Marlene held her breath, waiting to hear his response. But none came. All the man did was smile a knowing smile. Take off that apron, put him in a collared shirt, and he\u2019d be downright dashing.</p><p>The women\u2019s conversation became a meaningless drone around her. That was it. She had to find an excuse to join them.</p><p>He was sliding Sorrow\u2019s treat toward her when Marlene came up to the bar.</p><p>\u201cYou make desserts, too?\u201d She\u2019d made her voice breezy and self-possessed, but it cracked to see that Sully\u2019s special chocolate thing was to squirt a big, cursive S with chocolate sauce along the top. She sucked in a breath, murmuring, \u201cAdorable.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow grinned. \u201cS for Sorrow.\u201d She plucked the cherry from the top of his creation and popped it into her mouth. \u201cSully\u2019s cookie sundaes are to die for.\u201d</p><p>Marlene studied it. \u201cCookie sundae?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, there are cookies all along the bottom. He bakes them himself.\u201d Sorrow shoveled in a huge bite and sighed with pleasure. She covered a hand in front of her mouth to say, \u201cI make a mean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and it still couldn\u2019t compete with Sully\u2019s chocolate chip peanut butter cookie sundae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, woman. I\u2019ll make you one.\u201d Sully leaned against the bar. He had biceps like no sixty-something man should have.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, considering both the ice cream and the strong arms.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes on her. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can. I just shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He refused that answer. \u201cIf it\u2019s your figure you\u2019re worried about, you can throw those concerns right out the door.\u201d There was something assessing in his eyes. The way he\u2019d spoken with such intensity about her figure heated her blood. \u201cI say you need some ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Sully grabbed a spoon, and Marlene\u2019s mouth went dry. This man was a far cry from her husband, who\u2019d never given two hoots what she needed or wanted.</p><p>\u201cTry this,\u201d he said, as he assembled a spoonful of ice cream, cookie, and whipped cream in careful proportions. \u201cThe secret is mixing the dough in with the ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure to break off enough cookie from along the bottom,\u201d Sorrow told him.</p><p>She reached for the spoon, dumbfounded. Her husband had never tried to feed her ice cream. Her husband had thought she needed to watch her waistline.</p><p>But Sully didn\u2019t hand her the spoon. Instead, he reached it toward her mouth. \u201cHave a taste.\u201d His voice was like gravel.</p><p>Her heart kicked to life in her chest. The last time a man fed her something, she must\u2019ve been in her twenties. She hesitated, then opened her mouth. Risking eye contact, she saw Sully\u2019s eyes were riveted on her.</p><p>And then she tasted the ice cream. Shutting her eyes in bliss, she sighed a purring, contented sound. When she opened her eyes, she couldn\u2019t stop the grin from spreading across her face. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a way with food, Tom.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s lull in the tavern as the women read the letters and Bear stopped talking to sip his beer. Sully\u2019s voice filled the silence. \u201cI want a day off.\u201d There was something intense in his voice, something driven.</p><p>Bear put down his glass and gave him a blank look. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Marlene watched avidly.</p><p>\u201cI said I need a day off, Bear.\u201d</p><p>What did Sully do on his time off? Did he date women he met on the Internet? Take them out for drinks? Would he ever ask her out for drinks?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a night off.\u201d And then Tom Sullivan met her eyes, and it was as though he\u2019d read her mind. \u201cA man needs to live his life.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>\u201cOh, God...what now?\u201d Sorrow was trying on one of the old dresses she\u2019d found in the attic when a loud thud reverberated through the house. As she raced for the stairs, the heavy fabric swirled between her legs\u2014how had pioneer women managed?\u2014but she galloped down, doing her best not to trip, half expecting to find the walls caved in.</p><p>She darted from room to room, stopping short at the door to the den. Her sister. Of course.</p><p>\u201cWhat the...?\u201d Her eyes goggled, catching sight of a giant black workout contraption. A couple of men in blue-shirted uniforms were rearranging the furniture to make room. \u201cWhat on earth is that?\u201d</p><p>Laura smirked and pointed at her dress. \u201cThe question is, what on earth is that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, embarrassed, tugging the low neckline up and the tight bodice out. \u201cI asked you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an elliptical trainer.\u201d Laura gave her an aggravatingly innocent smile. \u201cYou\u2019re looking pretty saucy, baby sister. Is that one of Sorrow Crabtree\u2019s dresses?\u201d Then her eyes lit. \u201cHey, I know. We should have people dress up. You know, for the festival.\u201d</p><p>As if Laura cared about the festival, really. Getting dolled up in costume would probably be just another way for her trim sister to get attention. \u201cYou just want to dress up for the festival.\u201d She turned her glare at Laura\u2019s contraption. \u201cWhat\u2019s that doing here?\u201d Just the sight of it made her chest tighten. Moving the furniture had revealed more than she cared to see\u2014the brown carpet was five shades darker where the couch had been, and the baseboards were caked with dust. Just more things for her to deal with.</p><p>\u201cCardio,\u201d Laura answered brightly.</p><p>\u201cPut it in your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t fit in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it won\u2019t, because it\u2019s ginormous. Careful!\u201d Sorrow dashed between her dad\u2019s recliner and the wall. The moving men were hauling the huge leather chair out of the way and getting too close to the television in the process. If they damaged either, she\u2019d be the one to pay the price. She swung on her sister. \u201cLaura, this cannot go in here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought Dad could work out in front of CNN. It\u2019ll be good for him.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow crossed her arms at her chest. Anything to keep it from exploding. \u201cYou mean, you thought you could work out.\u201d She walked a circle around it. \u201cYou know Dad\u2019s never going to use a treadmill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a treadmill. It\u2019s an elliptical trainer. They\u2019re better for your knees.\u201d Her sister continued to use that overly chirpy tone, and it was infuriating.</p> <p>\u201cTry walking. It works for the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Laura shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as cardio. You could use it, too\u2014you need to get your heart rate up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Chasing down problems is all the cardio I need.\u201d</p><p>Laura\u2019s expression said she disagreed. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>Did her sister just give her figure a once-over? Sorrow sucked in her belly, feeling outraged. The snug saloon-girl dress wasn\u2019t helping matters. \u201cWhat are you doing here really?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you. I\u2019m rearranging the den. Since when did that become a federal offense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Laura. I mean, why are you here? Home. Don\u2019t your minions need you back in San Francisco? If this is just a visit, then why are you installing an elliptical machine?\u201d</p><p>Doubt flashed in her sister\u2019s eyes, and Sorrow wanted to exclaim a-ha. Her sister avoided the subject, as expected. \u201cSpeaking of rearranging furniture, I can\u2019t believe you all still have that stuffed bear.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow rolled her eyes. The black bear had adorned the foyer since they were kids. And yeah, it was disgusting. But she chose her battles, and her dad\u2019s prized bear wasn\u2019t one of them. \u201cIt\u2019s a hunting lodge,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s disgusting. But you\u2019re nuts if you think Dad will let us deep-six his bear. His name is Bear, after all.\u201d Sorrow crossed her arms. Her sister was a master at changing the subject, but she wouldn\u2019t be deterred. \u201cWould you please stay on topic?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Laura said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the topic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you\u2019d eat once in a while you wouldn\u2019t have such trouble paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe topic,\u201d Sorrow interrupted, not wanting to know what her thinner, fitter sister was going to say, \u201cwas, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo visit,\u201d Laura said, but she\u2019d replied too quickly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a simple visit?\u201d</p><p>Her big sister had fled Sierra Falls the moment she graduated from high school. There was never a \u201csimple visit\u201d where she was concerned. \u201cYou never just visit. So tell me: why\u2019s the big-deal VP taking a so-called sabbatical? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>Laura\u2019s eyes narrowed to slits. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you. Jeez, Sorrow. Why do you always feel so put-upon? No wonder Damien hasn\u2019t sealed the deal with you yet.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow practically shrieked. \u201cWhat? What the hell does that mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know exactly what that means. It\u2019s time for Damien to put a ring on it, but why would he when you\u2019re such a nag?\u201d Laura\u2019s face became the picture of calm.</p><p>Sorrow recognized her sister\u2019s expression. She\u2019d known it from their youth\u2014it was the look of battle. Well, she could play this game as calmly as Laura. Mastering her emotions, she kept her arms crossed tight, curling her fingers into her biceps. \u201cWho says I want Damien to put a ring on it anyway?\u201d</p><p>Saying the words, Sorrow realized the thought of a ring and Damien made her feel more alarm than anticipation.</p><p>Laura tipped the movers and shooed them out the door. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re into that sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not into anybody.\u201d Sorrow began to put the den back to rights, shaking out a throw blanket with a sharp snap, folding and smoothing it probably more than was necessary. But her stomach gave a little flip-flop at the thought\u2014was she into the sheriff?</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Laura gaped. \u201cYou are into him. He\u2019s kind of old for you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>How was it her pesky sister was always able to read her mind? Sorrow straightened, facing Laura head-on. \u201cBilly is not old. He\u2019s in his thirties. Since when is that old?\u201d</p><p>A slow smile spread across Laura\u2019s face. \u201cYou want some sisterly advice?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow\u2019s response was instant. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She continued anyway. \u201cGo for someone your own age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m not going for anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you before, Damien is cute and rich,\u201d Laura insisted. \u201cKeep your head in the game, kid. Eyes on the target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a kid.\u201d Sorrow was feeling trapped in this conversation\u2014she didn\u2019t feel like discussing either man. How did Laura always manage to get the upper hand? \u201cAnd what\u2019s with all the bad sports metaphors? Some people aren\u2019t in it to win something. We\u2019re not all as ruthless as you are.\u201d</p><p>Laura studied her for a second with an annoying smirk on her face. \u201cIf nothing\u2019s going on, why so defensive?\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the back door, and the sisters exchanged a withering look.</p><p>\u201cSaved by the bell.\u201d Sorrow dashed from the room to get the door, wondering who it could be. Folks usually used the front door and walked right in.</p><p>Unfortunately, she heard her sister\u2019s footsteps close behind. She looked over her shoulder, telling Laura in a quick, hushed voice, \u201cNothing is going on with Billy. Damien and I are just dating. I\u2019m not marrying anyone that I know of, not now, not in the near future. Thanks for your interest.\u201d That should shut big sister down. She opened the door, and it was him.</p><p>Billy.</p><p>Stopping behind her, Laura chuckled. \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d</p><p>Evil. Laura was evil. Devil spawn. Sent to torment her.</p><p>Billy\u2019s eyes zoomed to Sorrow\u2019s breasts, which were currently popping up out of the low neckline like two plump orbs desperate for air. She did her best to gather her wits, despite feeling very conscious of the cold air on her d\u00e9collet\u00e9. \u201cHi, Bill\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Laura\u2019s chirpy voice cut hers off. \u201cSheriff! What can we do you for? You here to see Sorrow?\u201d</p><p>Billy looked suddenly wary. He wasn\u2019t dumb; he was an intuitive guy. He probably sensed how he\u2019d walked smack-dab into the onset of World War III. \u201cI\u2019m always happy to see Sorrow,\u201d he said slowly, clearly thinking through his words carefully, \u201cbut I\u2019m here because your father sent me.\u201d</p><p>Laura leaned against the wall, giving him a playfully saucy look. \u201cAren\u2019t you happy to see me, too?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow would\u2019ve kicked her sister had she thought she could do it unnoticed. Instead she glared.</p><p>Laura was so easy with Billy, and it irked her. But why? Was she jealous of how good her sister was with men? Or was she jealous that Laura might be good with Billy?</p><p>She realized how she\u2019d begun to crave the man\u2019s attention herself. Shouldering in front of Laura, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got off duty and was grabbing a coffee when all hell broke loose.\u201d He kept his eyes on her as he added, \u201cI\u2019m afraid they need you at the tavern.\u201d</p><p>Of course they do. \u201cGive me a sec to change.\u201d</p><p>She forgot her girl trouble and had her jeans back on in no time. What could be going wrong now? Explosion, maybe? Plague of locusts? \u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d she asked as she grabbed her fleece and shouldered past Laura out the door.</p><p>\u201cThe freezer died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d She wasn\u2019t expecting that one. Not so bad. Her mind flipped through the contact list in her head, deciding who to call to get it fixed. Meantime, they\u2019d need to move the food. \u201cCan\u2019t Sully just transfer the food to the chest freezer? We\u2019ve got one in the garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Billy said, \u201cthat freezer\u2019s down, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of our freezers?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Her sister piped up, \u201cWeird.\u201d Clearly not in touch with the gravity of the situation.</p><p>Sorrow shot her a look, feeling surprised and a little annoyed to find that she\u2019d followed them. \u201cThanks, Sherlock.\u201d</p><p>She felt her sister\u2019s eagle eyes boring into her and the sheriff, scrutinizing every move. Why was she tagging along? The girl was a varsity flirt, and that she was even around for this interaction made Sorrow intensely uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Billy said. \u201cThe food\u2019s all spoiled. The units must\u2019ve been down for a while before anybody noticed.\u201d</p><p>That stopped her in her tracks. \u201cCrap.\u201d Hundreds of dollars in frozen patties, chicken tenders, corn dogs...all the junk her dad insisted Sully cook up; not much of it was fresh.</p><p>She felt a rock settle in the pit of her stomach. \u201cAll that food...that\u2019ll cost us a fortune.\u201d And then something else hit her. There weren\u2019t many lodgers these days, which meant the family relied on the tavern for income. They couldn\u2019t afford to turn people away. \u201cWhat are we going to feed people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you call your distributor?\u201d Billy asked. \u201cHave an emergency delivery made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really have one.\u201d</p><p>Billy pinned his eyes on her. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t have a distributor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stuff like bread gets delivered. But Dad says he doesn\u2019t trust the distributors. He likes me and Sully to pick out the meat ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d said Laura. \u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d Sorrow rubbed her temples and took a deep breath. Just go away, she wanted to tell her sister. Or help out.</p><p>Having Laura there to witness this latest crisis, feeling her scrutinize every aspect of this interaction with Billy...it all made her so uncomfortable. And in a way that went beyond the usual sisterly annoyance.</p><p>Could that mean she did have a thing for the sheriff? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He spoke in a low voice, aimed for her ears only. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll handle this one problem at a time. I have some business in Silver City tomorrow\u2014why don\u2019t you come with? We\u2019ll hit one of those big box stores in the morning, you can stock up, maybe even buy a small freezer unit to tide you over till you figure this out. I\u2019ll be driving the SUV\u2014it\u2019s more than big enough to fit whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed through her. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She took another deep breath. A plan\u2014she liked plans. They made her feel in control. She attempted a smile, having found humor the best way to deal with this ridiculous string of bad luck. \u201cThe Sheriffmobile, huh? Does that mean we can speed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell if you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him to express her thanks, but what awaited her stole her breath. Billy was staring down at her, such a solid male presence, his rich brown eyes trained only on her.</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>She did have a thing for him.</p><p>Nineteen</p> <p>Had he seriously just told the woman he\u2019d speed to the store for her? And in an official vehicle, no less. What the hell had gotten into him?</p><p>Billy jogged to catch up to Sorrow, striding purposefully to the tavern. His eyes grazed down her back\u2014God help him, that was what\u2019d gotten into him. Her fleece jacket and jeans hugged every curve, and he fantasized about giving that rump a good squeeze.</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his eyes. What was his problem?</p><p>He\u2019d had a few flings since Keri died. Emotionless hookups. And they\u2019d been enough to satisfy the part of him that, though grieving, was still a man. But never had he been so curious about a woman. Through the day, he found himself wondering how Sorrow was, if she was hanging in there, what she might be cooking up next.</p><p>The only trouble was, the pangs of guilt and regret were always quick to follow. Why should he get to enjoy and feel and live his life while Keri hadn\u2019t been given half a chance at hers?</p><p>The sound of yelling drifted out to them. Sully and Bear, shouting at each other. Sorrow\u2019s face fell, and their eyes met. \u201cSully never fights,\u201d she said, sounding a little lost.</p> <p>He got the sense the man was like an uncle to her. So now she had drama to add to the current crisis.</p><p>Laura caught up to them\u2014he hadn\u2019t realized she was following. \u201cWow, check it out,\u201d she said. \u201cSully actually has a voice.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a look. Big sister didn\u2019t seem to get it, obviously too concerned with her own issues, whatever those might be.</p><p>Laura caught his expression. \u201cSeriously. If you Googled \u2018strong, silent type,\u2019 you\u2019d find a picture of Sully.\u201d</p><p>They made their way back into the kitchen just as Sully was saying to Bear, \u201cThe girl didn\u2019t touch your freezer.\u201d</p><p>Bear scowled. \u201cFreez-ers.\u201d He spotted his daughters. \u201cSorrow. What the hell have you done? Why are the freezers busted?\u201d</p><p>Billy clenched and unclenched his hand. He didn\u2019t consider himself a violent guy, but just then he wished he weren\u2019t an officer of the law. Just then, he longed to get in one good punch. Instead, he stepped forward. \u201cCalm down, Mister Bailey. I\u2019m sure your daughter knows nothing about it.\u201d It was beyond him why that boyfriend of hers hadn\u2019t nipped Bear\u2019s attitude in the bud. Maybe Damien lent a hand around the place, but it sure didn\u2019t seem like he stood up for her enough.</p><p>Sully growled, \u201cNeither of us knows about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it can\u2019t be coincidence.\u201d Bear kicked the huge industrial freezer. \u201cBoth of them are dead, and the food\u2019s all spoiled. Somebody must\u2019ve done something to overheat \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Laura opened the door and shut it again quickly, scrunching her nose against the smell. \u201cDid you take a look, like, under the hood or whatever?\u201d</p><p>It was the first semireasonable thing the woman had said all day.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Billy nodded at Sully. \u201cYou get that side,\u201d he told him, and they pulled it from the wall. Dust was a thick, gray blanket along the baseboard, carpeting the floor in thick rolls like tumbleweeds. A dark puddle glistened along the floor.</p><p>\u201cIs that melted ice?\u201d asked Laura.</p><p>Billy touched a finger to it. \u201cFreon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t look.\u201d Sorrow hoisted herself up to sit on the counter with a sigh. \u201cI wish BJ were here.\u201d</p><p>Now there was an unfortunate name. He peeked from behind a panel of stainless steel to give her a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cMy brother,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBear Junior,\u201d Laura clarified. \u201cHe\u2019s got the magic touch when it comes to machines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Afghanistan,\u201d Sorrow added, \u201cflying copters.\u201d</p><p>Sully grunted. \u201cAnd if he ever gets tired of that, the kid could just as easily fix them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boy knows his way around a motor,\u201d Bear said proudly.</p><p>Billy had another question for Sorrow and looked at her just as she unzipped her fleece. His mind blanked.</p><p>Damn. When had thermal underwear shirts become so sexy?</p><p>He darted his eyes from her lush body to focus on the freezer instead. He struggled to remember his question. \u201cYou got a screwdriver? I\u2019m not as gifted as your brother, but I can take a look.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stared silently, except for Sorrow, who hopped down and grabbed one from a junk drawer. Was she the only one who knew what was what in this place?</p><p>Their eyes held for a second as she handed him the tool, and he felt a clench in his gut he hadn\u2019t known in years. He turned his entire attention to unscrewing the back panel.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to be an electrician to see the problem at once. Condenser tubes ran in an S-pattern along the back, and Freon dripped from them, a slow, glistening ooze.</p><p>Bear saw it too and exclaimed, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow stepped in. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d She smelled like shampoo, or lotion maybe\u2014some female smell.</p><p>\u201cThe condenser,\u201d said Sully.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Billy had to force himself to focus. He studied it closely, wishing the light were better. \u201cIt must be cracked or...\u201d His voice trailed off as he concentrated, running his finger along the tubes. Then he felt it\u2014a sharp edge. Too sharp to be just a crack.</p><p>\u201cRegular wear and tear?\u201d asked Laura.</p><p>Sorrow challenged, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t explain both freezers dying at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot wear and tear.\u201d Billy stood and wiped the grime from his hands. \u201cI think it was sliced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone cut it?\u201d the girls asked in unison.</p><p>With a nod, he faced Bear and said, \u201cLooks like you have a vandal on your hands.\u201d</p><p>Bear laughed outright. \u201cVandal? There are no vandals in Sierra Falls. Everyone knows everyone. This is just how it goes around this place.\u201d He looked at his daughter. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Sorrow? All hell breaking loose on a regular basis.\u201d</p><p>Billy didn\u2019t buy it for a minute. Those wires had been cut, and it called into question every other thing that\u2019d been going wrong lately. He\u2019d stake his badge that the Baileys were up against something more menacing than just the usual chaos of a family business.</p><p>Bear may not have wanted to hear it, but Sorrow did. She seemed to get it, and was looking at him with widened eyes. \u201cWho would destroy our freezers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody destroyed our damned freezers,\u201d her dad said. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the big city anymore, Sheriff. There\u2019s no crime out here. It may bore you, but all the suspicions in the world aren\u2019t going to make any criminals appear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to interrupt,\u201d Sully said, \u201cbut what are we going to feed people?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow pulled her shoulders back. \u201cBilly said he\u2019d drive me to Silver City for supplies.\u201d There was something in her voice\u2014Resolve? Camaraderie?\u2014that made him happy he\u2019d offered.</p><p>\u201cWe can stock up,\u201d he added. \u201cGet a small replacement freezer till you can get a bigger one delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t feed people right now.\u201d Bear checked his watch. \u201cHell\u2019s bells, girl. It\u2019s 4:30. People are going to start showing up for Sully\u2019s early bird any minute.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of tense silence, then Sorrow said, \u201cI could cook.\u201d</p><p>Bear shook his head. \u201cAin\u2019t you been paying attention? All our food is spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the frozen stuff. I can make pasta.\u201d</p><p>He loved how she stood up to her dad. The way she snapped right back at him had a way of defusing the man\u2019s temper, till he seemed like nothing more than a harmless grump. \u201cShe makes a good pasta,\u201d Billy said with a grin.</p><p>Sorrow\u2019s sister pinned him with a wicked look. \u201cWhen have you had her pasta?\u201d Something in her voice made him self-conscious.</p><p>He was grateful when Sorrow broke in, \u201cI\u2019ve got all I need in the pantry. Some garlic, olive oil, a couple of cans of olives, some capers...I can make a puttanesca.\u201d</p><p>Bear hooted. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive the girl a shot,\u201d Sully said, his voice almost comically somber.</p><p>\u201cYou, too?\u201d Bear looked from his cook to his daughter and stiffened. It was like witnessing a lightbulb flicker to life above the older man\u2019s head. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow crossed her arms at her chest, and Billy fought the urge to gently pull them apart and give her shoulders a quick rub. And then stroke down her back to the curve of her waist...</p><p>Hell. He really needed to stop thinking like that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to tell you,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to start cooking one night a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing,\u201d Bear said instantly.</p><p>Sully shrugged. \u201cI told you the other day. I could use a night off.\u201d</p><p>Bear looked aghast. \u201cWhat the hell? It\u2019s a conspiracy, that\u2019s what this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl can cook, and you should give her a shot,\u201d Sully said, which for him seemed tantamount to a speech.</p><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Sorrow\u2019s cooking,\u201d Laura added, \u201cI\u2019d have been five hundred pounds overweight when I graduated high school.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sorrow caught her sister\u2019s eye and gave a self-effacing shrug. Billy could see she was pleased and touched. Just how long had the woman been toiling in the kitchen without thanks?</p><p>Sully bristled. \u201cWait a minute. My food\u2019s not that bad.\u201d</p><p>Laura gave a gusty sigh. \u201cWe love your cooking, Sully. You know what I mean. Sometimes a teenage girl wants soup and a salad instead of cheesy chili fries.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can cook.\u201d Sorrow stood tall, and Billy felt a spurt of pride. \u201cPeople like my cooking, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Bear scowled. \u201cSo everyone tells me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else has told you?\u201d she asked, sounding genuinely curious. The girl was too modest for her own good.</p><p>\u201cHim, for one.\u201d Bear pointed his way.</p><p>Billy gaped. \u201cWhat?\u201d The attention flustered him, and he was at an utter loss for words. \u201cI...\u201d</p> <p>Sorrow got the cutest perplexed smile on her face. \u201cYou told my dad I could cook?\u201d</p><p>The way she\u2019d asked tugged at something in his chest. He tried to formulate something cool and collected to say, but Sorrow\u2019s father didn\u2019t give him a chance.</p><p>Bear turned on her. \u201cGirl, I don\u2019t know what you fed our sheriff, but he\u2019s been crowing about...I don\u2019t know...bread or something. All that time in the city, maybe he forgot how to eat meat.\u201d</p><p>Billy laughed. \u201cI love meat. For the record.\u201d</p><p>Sully added, \u201cSorrow does do a fine brisket, sir. Her secret is to add Coca-Cola, if you can believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Her father waved impatiently. \u201cSorrow can cook. One night a week. Tuesdays, how about. We\u2019ll call it Ladies\u2019 Night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLadies\u2019 Night?\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cShould I feel insulted?\u201d</p><p>Billy couldn\u2019t help it\u2014he couldn\u2019t keep his hands to himself anymore. \u201cHey.\u201d He squeezed her shoulders, telling her in a quiet voice, \u201cThis is a good thing. He\u2019s saying you can cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou start tonight.\u201d Bear walked to the window and shoved aside the lace curtain. \u201cAnd you better get a move on. Jack Jessup\u2019s truck just pulled into the lot.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Marlene stole a peek into the kitchen and knew a surprising wash of relief to see Sully. She didn\u2019t know why she was being so silly. After all, the man was always there. It was only that she wanted him to talk to her grandson, Craig, of course.</p><p>For a brief second, she wondered what it was Sully did when he left the tavern, driving away on that noisy motorcycle of his. Where did he go? Was there a woman waiting for him at home?</p><p>How was it she could know positively nothing about a man she\u2019d seen and said hello to for over two decades now?</p><p>There was some to-do in the kitchen, and she dallied, remaining standing to spy as she touched up her hair. She pulled off her scarf and cupped a hand along the bottom of her do, making sure her bob was still curling under.</p> <p>It looked like the Baileys were having some sort of appliance trouble. Bear had his usual crotchety face on, though for once his girls weren\u2019t at each other\u2019s throats.</p><p>The door that led between kitchen and dining room swung open, and she hopped aside, letting out a little \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>Laura stopped short before running into her. The girl put a startled hand at her chest and did a quick side step. \u201cSorry, Marlene. Gotta run get some ingredients from the house kitchen.\u201d</p><p>The door flapped shut, and as the girl ran off, Marlene stole a glimpse through it. Sorrow and their new sheriff were exchanging words. Quiet words.</p><p>She bit back a smile, pleased that she\u2019d insisted her family dine at the tavern tonight. If there was something afoot, she\u2019d not miss a second of it.</p><p>She went to the table to join her son Jack and his family. Her daughter-in-law, Tina, was wearing that sourpuss face she always had on\u2014she\u2019d wanted to go somewhere else for dinner, naturally. If Marlene said tomato, Tina would say tomahto. They never seemed to see eye to eye on anything. Especially money. Tina had a taste for the fancy restaurants in Silver City, and though Marlene\u2019s boys Jack and Eddie made a good living running Jessup Brothers Construction, Tina clearly had yet to understand that money didn\u2019t grow on trees.</p><p>Jack stood to scoot her chair in, and she gave her son a warm smile. \u201cThank you, dear.\u201d Her ex-husband might be a son of a bitch, but they sure had raised themselves some lovely gentlemen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go grab us some menus,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo need for that,\u201d Bear said as he burst into the dining room.</p><p>Sully was on his heels. \u201cFreezer\u2019s down.\u201d</p><p>Marlene made herself not look at the cook, focusing instead on unfurling and smoothing her napkin in her lap. She\u2019d raised four gentlemen, and she, too, would be genteel.</p><p>Jack stopped, midstride, a handful of menus in his hand. \u201cWant me to take a look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Bear said. \u201cThey\u2019re both down.\u201d</p><p>Marlene finally looked at Sully, and his eyes were already on her, riveted, like he might be able to see straight through her. She cleared her throat. \u201cSo, you\u2019re not cooking then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorrow\u2019s trying her hand at it tonight,\u201d Sully said, and his expression softened.</p><p>It gave Marlene pause. What else made his expression warm like that? Was there a woman in his life who got to see that face? She felt a twinge, like loss, and brushed it off as foolish.</p><p>\u201cSorrow\u2019s cooking?\u201d asked Jack.</p><p>Tina added under her breath, \u201cAnd pigs must be flying.\u201d</p><p>Marlene shot her daughter-in-law a look. The girl could be short on manners.</p><p>Bear shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s cooking up some putanleska pasta. You don\u2019t have to eat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Marlene exclaimed, delighted. \u201cA puttanesca. That sounds wonderful. Of course we\u2019ll eat it, Bear. Good heavens.\u201d</p><p>She felt Sully walk over and wished she had a drink to sip on. There wasn\u2019t much more she could do to arrange the napkin in her lap.</p><p>Why was she feeling this way? Lord, but the divorce had thrown her. What had happened to her confidence?</p><p>\u201cEvening,\u201d Sully told the table. \u201cHow are you folks doing? It\u2019s Craig, right? I didn\u2019t recognize you at first. Kid\u2019s growing like a weed.\u201d</p><p>Forgetting herself for the moment, Marlene looked up at him. When it came to her grandson, she was 100 percent focused. \u201cYes, this is my grandson, Craig. And I think you already know my son Jack, his wife, Tina.\u201d</p><p>Jack scrunched his face at her. \u201cCome on, Mom. Of course I know Sully. Join us,\u201d he said, gesturing to the chair next to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be an honor.\u201d</p><p>Marlene watched, mesmerized, at this different side of him. She\u2019d seen the man for much of her life, but somehow she\u2019d never really noticed him. Something was different tonight. First off, he wasn\u2019t wearing that apron. Instead, he wore a pair of khakis and a snug navy blue polo. Goodness, his eyes were dark blue...deep, almost purple, like lapis.</p><p>He turned his attention to Craig. \u201cI hear you want to join the service, son.\u201d</p><p>Her grandson beamed. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>There was a notable silence. Tina\u2019s eyes turned to frost, glaring from Marlene, to Sully, to Craig. She told her son, \u201cI thought this discussion was over. My son is doing no such thing.\u201d</p><p>It seemed suddenly that Sully was a million miles away, separated from them by a gulf of cold wariness.</p><p>Was it a mistake to have asked him to talk to Craig? Had she crossed a line? But she knew...the boy would be eighteen soon, and then he could make his own decisions. He was almost a man now, and pretending otherwise was the worst they could do.</p><p>Someone needed to say something, and it fell to her. \u201cI thought Tom...you know, Sully...could tell Craig about the service.\u201d</p><p>She was probably making an enemy of Tina, but this wasn\u2019t about her daughter-in-law. Craig was stubborn, and she wanted to make sure he was informed and thoughtful about the very life-changing choices he was facing.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want him to go,\u201d Tina said, shutting her down.</p><p>Jack\u2019s hand snaked across the table, finding his wife\u2019s. He nodded his agreement. \u201cThe boy\u2019s too young, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She could tell her son was trying, and she appreciated it. But she had the wisdom of her years to tell her, the boy would do what the boy would do. And all they could do was love him and guide him as best they could.</p><p>She doubled her resolve and turned to Sully. \u201cHow old were you? When you enlisted, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t enlist. I was a West Point man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d Marlene felt her eyes widen. It sounded so...masculine. Like something from a movie.</p><p>Sully looked amused. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Marlene put a hand on his arm to interrupt. The gesture surprised both of them. \u201cGood God, do not call me ma\u2019am. You make me feel positively elderly.\u201d She felt his arm tense. Hard ropes beneath wiry muscle. Tom Sullivan stayed in shape.</p><p>She pulled her hand back and touched it to her temple. Why did Bear insist on keeping the tavern so warm?</p><p>\u201cFine. Marlene.\u201d He gave her one of his rare smiles, and it was like the sun broke out and warmed something in her chest.</p><p>What was wrong with her? She hadn\u2019t had a hot flash in years.</p><p>Sully turned his attention back to Craig. \u201cHave you thought about college? It\u2019s a good way to go.\u201d</p><p>The boy slumped back in his chair and scowled at his folks. \u201cNot if there\u2019s no money, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing you\u2019ll learn in the service is not to talk to your parents that way.\u201d Sully\u2019s tone was one Marlene didn\u2019t often hear. It was more than simply strict, it was commanding, and yet he hadn\u2019t needed to raise his voice to get there. It was an officer\u2019s voice.</p><p>Craig\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll sit up like a gentleman, too,\u201d Sully added quietly. \u201cElbows off the table.\u201d</p><p>Damned if the boy didn\u2019t sit bolt upright and put his hands in his lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack and Tina gaped, and Marlene bit her cheek not to smile.</p><p>\u201cIf money\u2019s tight, you could do ROTC like Bear Junior did.\u201d Sully pronounced it rot-see.</p><p>Tina looked like she\u2019d swallowed a lemon. \u201cOnly kids with decent grades get scholarships.\u201d</p> <p>Jack shot his wife a quelling look before calmly adding, \u201cYou can join the construction business with me and your uncle. Nothing to be ashamed of in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want to go to college,\u201d Craig grumbled. His eyes were flat, staring at the table. \u201cI just want to enlist first.\u201d</p><p>Tina sat so rigidly, she looked ready to snap in half. \u201cI don\u2019t want my boy to get killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to see combat,\u201d Sully said, with understanding in his voice. \u201cThere are lots of jobs where\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see combat.\u201d Craig glared defiantly at the table.</p> <p>Tina\u2019s face turned beet red, and Marlene knew a pang of sympathy for the woman. This was clearly a conversation that happened on a regular basis. Her daughter-in-law turned on her, speaking with raw pain in her eyes. \u201cYou raised boys. Can\u2019t you understand what I\u2019m going through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCraig might be your son,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cbut he\u2019s my grandson. Don\u2019t you think for a minute I don\u2019t understand.\u201d She reached across the table to take Tina\u2019s hand. \u201cI might seem like a dried-up old prune to you, but with age comes wisdom. I know what it is to be protective. But a mother has to let go sometime. The boy\u2019s got to do what he needs to do to become a man. And all we can do is make certain he understands the choices he makes. I don\u2019t know Craig\u2019s heart. Only he does. What I do know is that replaying this same argument won\u2019t do the boy one bit of good. And it won\u2019t change his mind either. In fact, it could very well backfire and push him in a direction he\u2019s not ready for.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her daughter-in-law\u2019s hand, and Tina squeezed back like she was gripping a life raft. Marlene\u2019s throat clenched, and she swallowed back the ache. Tina would discover that, too\u2014how a mother\u2019s job was learning to swallow back the ache.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let us talk for a while?\u201d Sully said gently. \u201cYou and Jack go grab a glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>Marlene nodded to the bar, trying to muster some chirp in her voice. \u201cI see Edith running around back there. You two need to ask her about those letters. You still haven\u2019t heard the full story. It\u2019s a juicy one. Don\u2019t worry, you can trust Tom...Sully, I mean, to talk to the boy.\u201d</p><p>Tina bit her lip, her chin quivering. Marlene braced for a challenge, and was surprised when the woman nodded and let Jack escort her to the bar, his arm wrapped protectively around her shoulders.</p> <p>Marlene had faith in her son. There was something in Tina that spoke to him. Someday maybe the woman would let her in on it, too.</p><p>As his parents settled on stools at the bar, Craig turned a wary eye to Sully.</p><p>\u201cYou can still go to college,\u201d the older man told him. \u201cYou enlist now, you get free schooling once you\u2019re out. Which branch are you considering?\u201d</p><p>Her grandson was struggling not to fiddle with his napkin. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Sully stayed patient. \u201cWhat branch of the military are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I can be a Marine like BJ.\u201d</p><p>Sully nodded slowly, and Marlene could see the cogs turning. The boy hadn\u2019t given this enough thought. She guessed Sully\u2019s mind and decided some humor might ease the growing tension. \u201cWell, Tom, it seems you\u2019ve had trouble convincing any of these boys to go Army.\u201d</p><p>The sternness of his expression cracked a bit, and he spared her a half smile. \u201cI suppose I have.\u201d But then he turned back to Craig, and his intensity returned full-force. \u201cThis is a big commitment, son. You\u2019re not enlisting just because...you don\u2019t want to do construction, or you think big guns are cool, or it\u2019ll be like a video game, or any nonsense like that, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo sir.\u201d Craig laughed. \u201cThough I do hear they give a sweet enlistment bonus.\u201d He\u2019d lingered on the word suh-weet.</p><p>Sully stiffened. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I wanted to hear.\u201d</p><p>The boy tensed, on his guard, and his sullen expression made him seem younger than his seventeen years. \u201cThey think it\u2019s a joke. Like I\u2019m a joke. The whole family does. They\u2019ll take it serious enough if I bring home a fat check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe family thinks no such thing,\u201d Marlene said automatically, then checked herself. Craig was still a boy, and boys said thoughtless things.</p><p>But Sully kept on topic, pressing him, \u201cPeople take you seriously when you make decisions like an informed adult. Money doesn\u2019t make you a man. Serving your country is not a path you choose for the paycheck.\u201d</p><p>At words like adult and man, Craig snapped to attention, captivated. Marlene decided to listen in silence, letting Sully handle it. He had a way with the boy. Though that made sense, if it was true that he used to command them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t join just because you think you\u2019re some tough guy who\u2019s good at shoot-em-up video games. Now, I don\u2019t care if you go Army, Navy, whatever. Wherever you enlist, they\u2019ll chew you up and spit you out. They\u2019ll break you and build you back up again. So you best be serious, son. Now tell me. I\u2019m listening. Why do you want to join?\u201d</p><p>Craig paused and when he spoke again, the boy\u2019s voice was gone, replaced by the voice of a man. Her grandson was transforming before her eyes, this child crossing the gulf into adulthood. \u201cBecause,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cI want to be a part of something bigger than myself. Because I believe in this country. Men before me fought and died so I could play those shoot-em-up games, and now it\u2019s my turn to serve.\u201d</p><p>Sully got that answer and more, and every one of them sounded more articulate than anything she\u2019d ever heard come out of the child\u2019s mouth. She sat and listened, imagining how Sully might have looked in a uniform. In fatigues. In his dress blues. Picturing him at West Point, in Vietnam. He\u2019d probably walked through ranks of uniformed boys no older than Craig, shouting orders. Getting answers.</p><p>Marlene sat and watched Tom Sullivan, watched him in a new light.</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>\u201cNo, I said I\u2019m cooking.\u201d Sorrow nestled the phone at her ear as she tried to talk to Damien, chop olives, and saut\u00e9 garlic all at the same time. \u201cThe freezers went down and the food spoiled, so I\u2019m making pasta for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got reservations,\u201d he said, and she strained to understand across his warbled cell phone connection. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to Silver City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to cancel. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you.\u201d In a way, she was relieved. Not because she was looking forward to cooking, but because she needed to have a conversation with Damien that she was dreading. A breakup conversation.</p><p>The kitchen door swung open, and it was Laura and Billy with an armful of canned olives, a big jar of capers, and a few bottles of red wine.</p><p>Sorrow whispered an enthusiastic \u201cThank you!\u201d She nodded to the counter. \u201cPut it there. Could you open the olives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, babe?\u201d Damien asked.</p><p>The phone slipped, and she inched it back up, crooking her neck to hold it in place. A stitch zinged up her shoulder. \u201cSorry, but I really need to make this quick. I was saying, dinner and a movie isn\u2019t going to happen with me cooking for a restaurant full of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just get it started, and Laura can dish it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d She frowned. This was the chance she\u2019d been waiting years for, and he wanted her to let Laura take over? \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, Damien.\u201d There was a lot these days that wasn\u2019t that simple.</p><p>She worried she\u2019d been thinking about that sheriff one too many times a day. It was just that, when she was with Billy, she felt like she could let it all hang loose. That she could be herself, and best of all, he understood.</p><p>She held her breath, making an exaggerated grimace she knew nobody could see. She should really break it off with Damien, and tonight. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come here instead? You can have some of my puttanesca.\u201d Her cheek pressed redial, and there was a rapid beeping as the phone redialed Damien\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry. This is driving me nuts.\u201d</p><p>Billy came up behind her and silently showed her the olives. He was trying to help. He knew how this was her big moment. He got it. He got her.</p><p>He\u2019d opened several cans and silently gestured, asking if she wanted him to drain them. He\u2019d turned up the cuffs of his red flannel shirt, exposing solid forearms. His muscle flexed beneath skin as he moved. He was a man.</p><p>She had to stop thinking about him. Had to stop her mind from wondering what else about her he\u2019d understand. How those muscles would feel beneath her hands. How he might touch her. Hold her.</p><p>She came to, and glanced up to find Billy watching her. He lifted one of the cans, repeating his silent question. She gave him a grateful nod, feeling the heat flood her cheeks. Putting a hand over the mouthpiece, she mouthed, \u201cSave some of the juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m losing you, Sorrow. What was that?\u201d</p><p>That was it. This whole situation was just too unfair to Damien. She\u2019d break it off with him tonight. \u201cCome over, you can try my puttanesca. It\u2019s a tangy pasta.\u201d She\u2019d talk to him over dinner.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t eat pasta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d She couldn\u2019t deal with this right now. She had a job to do. She began to chop in earnest\u2014her knife slamming against the cutting board like it might save her life. \u201cI really should go. Ow\u201d\u2014she\u2019d sliced her thumb and sucked it into her mouth\u2014\u201cDamn.\u201d Sloppy chopping wouldn\u2019t do her a bit of good\u2014she needed to calm down. She was the one who\u2019d wanted to do this.</p><p>Damien sounded genuinely concerned. \u201cYou all right, babe?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I just cut myself.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff put down the can opener and took her shoulders in his hands. Her breath caught. His touch managed to be both gentle and sure. He led her to the sink, holding the phone so she could wash her cut.</p><p>\u201cIs it bad?\u201d asked Damien. \u201cCan\u2019t your sister help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s no biggie.\u201d She rummaged in the junk drawer for the little zippered kit she kept there. Billy took it from her, and she gave him a weak smile as he applied a glop of antiseptic cream and a couple of Band-Aids. His hands were gentle, and deft, too.</p><p>She cleared her throat, back at the cutting board. \u201cSo, you coming over for dinner then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, it sounds like it\u2019s crazy for you over there. And honestly, it\u2019s crazy for me here. I\u2019m buried. Can we take a rain check? I think I\u2019ll just work late. Let you have your moment in the sun. Save me some leftovers, though, okay?\u201d</p><p>She hung up with Damien, feeling a weird mix of disappointed, unsurprised, and relieved. Now that she had it in her head that they needed to talk, she needed to just do it and get it over with. Otherwise, it felt like an ax poised to fall.</p><p>That was the last real conversation she had all night, as she was quickly swept up in kitchen insanity. Somehow word had spread through Sierra Falls that Sorrow was cooking, and more folks than usual came by for dinner.</p> <p>She\u2019d salvaged beets, goat cheese, and some candied walnuts from her own pantry to pull together a beet salad. Some random veggies, a couple of cans of white beans, and chicken stock had made up a nice soup. And for a finishing touch, Billy had cored over a dozen apples, and she\u2019d made baked apple for dessert. That she\u2019d had to serve all of it in tiny portions had impressed the customers all the more; they thought it was some sort of fancy citified preparation.</p><p>Her mom carried in the last of the plates. \u201cHave you had a chance to eat anything?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow ignored the question, her eyes only on the teetering stack of white dishes. \u201cI don\u2019t have to do the dishes, too, do I?\u201d</p><p>Billy walked through the swinging door, taking the stack from her mother\u2019s hands and putting them in the giant stainless steel sink. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can sneak away from me, Edith. I got these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Sheriff.\u201d Sorrow said his title playfully, and rather than something formal it\u2019d felt intimate. She didn\u2019t care\u2014she was in a giddy mood, going on adrenaline, and was genuinely pleased that someone who wasn\u2019t family was there to witness her triumph. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were still around. It must be midnight.\u201d</p><p>Her mom checked her watch. There were digital clocks all over the place, but her mom had been relying on the same Timex for twenty years\u2014tan face, frayed brown band. \u201cIt\u2019s 10:30, and Sheriff Preston has been helping us shoulder the load. You\u2019d think the town had run out of food.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrow watched as he poured a big glass of wine. \u201cWere you here all night?\u201d Though thinking about it, she could picture Billy at various points in the evening, getting glimpses of him opening bottles of wine, clearing dishes. Yup, he\u2019d been there all night.</p><p>He handed her the glass. \u201cAnd miss your grand debut?\u201d</p><p>The man really was thoughtful, and she gave him a grateful smile. She sipped and exhaled a blissful sigh. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m ready to drop on my feet.\u201d</p><p>Her mom scraped the last of the pasta from the big pot. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit left, honey. You better eat up before the Jessup boys come in for fourths.\u201d She handed her the plate. \u201cNow I best get back out there. I think your dad is trying to muster up a poker game, and I\u2019m sure it breaks all kinds of gambling laws.\u201d She gave Billy a panicked look, realizing she was speaking in front of the sheriff.</p><p>Billy winked. \u201cDid you say something, Mrs. Bailey? I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>As her mom bustled from the room, Sorrow hopped onto the counter and dove into her pasta. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how starved I was.\u201d</p><p>Billy peeked under lids, scrounging for leftovers. He salvaged a cup of soup and half a baked apple. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s not much left.\u201d</p><p>He dished it out for her, then started on the dirty plates, making quick work loading them into the industrial dishwasher.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d All that\u2019d been left in the pot was a small serving of pasta and the dregs of the sauce. It\u2019d cooked down to thick, tangy glops of capers and olives. She held up her fork. \u201cThis bit is my favorite.\u201d</p><p>A memory sideswiped her, and she swallowed back the sudden ache in her throat.</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape Billy. \u201cYou all right?\u201d he asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just thinking about my brother. BJ loves my puttanesca.\u201d She laughed. \u201cThough he always drives me batty. Even though I buy these awesome Italian reds, he insists on washing down whatever I cook with a Budweiser.\u201d</p><p>Billy shook his head. \u201cAn abomination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows Miller goes best with Italian.\u201d</p><p>She hopped down and nudged him with her shoulder as</p><p>she slid her plate into the dishwasher rack. \u201cHeathens. All of you.\u201d</p><p>Her voice had come out sounding distracted, and Billy caught it at once.</p><p>He wiped his hands on a rag, and pinched her chin in his fingers, tipping it up to face him. \u201cUh-oh. I see cogs turning.\u201d</p><p>That touch sent an electric charge from his fingertips straight to her belly. The intense night left her feeling drained and emotional, and a powerful urge swept her\u2014the desire to lean into Billy and let him take care of her like she\u2019d been taking care of everyone else.</p><p>But there was Damien to consider. Until she broke up with her boyfriend, she couldn\u2019t allow herself to sink into this other man, as much as she wanted to. She stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>He put soap in the tray and turned on the dishwasher. He faced her, looking deadly serious. \u201cThis is more than just you being tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Sheriff. Remind me not to get pulled over by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t make me break out the tough-guy act.\u201d His voice had taken on a pretend stern tone, and yet something dark glinted in his eyes. Something that made her think of things like getting pulled over, frisked, and patted down by the likes of Billy Preston.</p><p>She felt her cheeks blush. What was wrong with her? She couldn\u2019t help but compare him to Damien. She\u2019d been very attracted to her boyfriend\u2014physically, they clicked. They\u2019d had some great times. But he didn\u2019t make her feel this way. This sensation of her skin tightening around her body, her breath catching with the need to step closer. To ask more. To tell him everything. To feel his skin against hers. To know Billy, and be known by him.</p><p>She had to break up with Damien, like, yesterday.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to distract me,\u201d he said, \u201cso you might as well spill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her eyes widened. Had he somehow read her thoughts?</p><p>\u201cYour eyes give everything away,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>Something about his tone, about being alone in the kitchen with him after a long day on her feet, intensified the growing intimacy between them. She wanted to know Billy, and he wanted to listen.</p><p>She\u2019d been feeling so isolated\u2014surrounded by loved ones and yet still alone. Nobody seemed to notice how she was frantically paddling to stay afloat. How close she felt to breaking sometimes. How often she dreamed of different places and different things.</p><p>But in walked Billy, and somehow he\u2019d seen. He\u2019d listened and heard. It was a simple connection, but it did so much to make her feel better. Getting to know him, she\u2019d begun to sense how happiness was there for her to find, she just craved a partner to share it with. Not a man to hold her up like Damien tried so desperately to do, but someone to stand with her, by her side.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She heard the care in his voice and knew she couldn\u2019t stop herself from sharing with this man if she tried. She missed her brother\u2014was racked with worry for him. Sometimes she hated her sister, and got so angry with Dad, so frustrated with Mom. But here was Billy, waiting, wanting to know what she was thinking. Wanting to know her.</p><p>She let out a long sigh, letting it all go. \u201cI told you about my brother. The thing is, he always knows how to handle Dad.\u201d She had to stifle a stab of guilt. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. Dad, I mean. His stroke...it was hard for him. But still, he drives me nuts. He\u2019s so old school. Take the whole \u2018Ladies\u2019 Night\u2019 thing. I mean, should I be offended? That I can only cook if it\u2019s Ladies\u2019 Night?\u201d</p><p>She risked a glance into his eyes, half expecting him to brush it off. Damien would have brushed it off. But instead, Billy\u2019s brow was furrowed in thought.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let the man offend you,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s from a different generation. It\u2019s a chance for you to cook, and you should take it. Let me guess, it\u2019s been Bear\u2019s way or the highway all these years. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you don\u2019t need to be a rocket scientist to figure that one out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his dad ran the lodge and tavern before him?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow sighed. \u201cI see where you\u2019re going with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he asked gently. \u201cThink about it from your father\u2019s perspective. I\u2019ll bet the things he\u2019s able to do\u2014hell, the things your mom lets him do\u2014have changed since his stroke. Changed a lot. He was once the master of his universe, and now I bet your mom doesn\u2019t even let him out of her sight without a cell phone in his pocket.\u201d</p><p>It was true, and it gutted her. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s pretty much the whole of it.\u201d She\u2019d only been thinking about her own perspective. She stared at the floor, ashamed of her selfishness. Dad\u2019s stroke. It\u2019d changed him, but the changes had come about so slowly, it was something she hadn\u2019t considered, not like that. \u201cHe worked timber when he was younger\u2014he was once a pretty physical guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know his type. Change is hard for a guy like him. But aging is something that happens to every man\u2014if they\u2019re lucky.\u201d Billy tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, and the sweep of his finger sent her blood pounding. \u201cBesides, he\u2019s in for a big awakening. Wait till Bear realizes that Ladies\u2019 Night draws every male in Sierra Falls just for a taste of your cooking. He\u2019ll see. As it is, I think he\u2019s floored by how much business you did tonight. More people jammed into that tavern for dinner than I ever saw on Sully\u2019s watch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Billy\u2019s hand still hovered by her cheek, and she fought the urge to turn into his palm, leaning into his warmth. How had he done it? With just a few words, he\u2019d made her feel more sensitive to her dad and better about herself, all at the same time.</p><p>What else could a man like that do, what else could he make her feel?</p><p>His hand was right there\u2014just one slight shift of her head, one step closer to his body, and she\u2019d take this conversation to a whole different place. What would he do if she did?</p> <p>The door swung open. It was her sister. Laura froze at the sight of her and Billy, standing so close to each other in front of the sink. The blood pounded in Sorrow\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>Laura waggled her brows in a way that she found intensely annoying. \u201cKudos, kiddo. Your pasta was a hit. Even I loved it.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow turned her back and pretended to finish up some chore by the sink, rinsing out a sponge that didn\u2019t need rinsing. Waiting for breathing to be not so difficult. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t do carbs.\u201d</p><p>Laura reverted to her high school big-sister voice. \u201cShut. Up.\u201d She put a stack of dishes in the sink, nudging Sorrow as she passed. \u201cI don\u2019t eat a lot of pasta. But I did have some of yours. Duh.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow gave her a grudging smile. \u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, seriously,\u201d Laura said in a more adult tone. \u201cIt was fantastic. Better than anything I ever got in North Beach,\u201d she added, referring to San Francisco\u2019s Italian district, but then she put the tease back in her voice. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>Billy smiled, not taking the bait. \u201cI\u2019ve been to North Beach a time or two myself. Your sister\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, okay.\u201d Sorrow put the sponge down and turned to face Laura. Now she really was blown away. \u201cThank you. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Laura winked. \u201cAnd someone else is here to taste it.\u201d</p><p>She recognized that wicked look. She should\u2019ve known that Laura\u2019s sweetness came with a price. \u201cWho?\u201d Sorrow asked blandly.</p><p>\u201cDamien\u2019s here,\u201d Laura said in a voice dangerously close to a singsong. \u201cHe\u2019s getting a game of pool going with that Neanderthal, Eddie. I told him you\u2019d be right out.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrow felt her shoulders tighten. She wasn\u2019t sure what bothered her most about the exchange with her sister, though she could work up a list.</p><p>Billy reached out toward her, and her heart soared, but then he squeezed her arm in a way that meant good-bye, and her stomach fell. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it, then.\u201d</p><p>A part of her wished he\u2019d show some typical male reaction\u2014jealousy, competitiveness, something. But instead Billy just looked vaguely amused. It made her feel like a kid. But she was twenty-three\u2014young, sure, but definitely well past teenager. Hell, she\u2019d been running the lodge nearly single-handedly.</p><p>And yet, hearing Damien\u2019s voice booming from the other room, she felt embarrassed. It was a strange feeling. There was definitely no need to be self-conscious\u2014Damien was hot. He\u2019d been an all-around sports star. He was from the wealthiest family in the area. So why this strange, jangly feeling in her chest?</p><p>She tried not to look as crestfallen as she felt. Damien was here, but she wanted to play a round of pool with Billy. Wanted Billy to be the one to walk her back to the house after they closed up.</p><p>Billy\u2019s hand on her arm had felt so broad and firm. That was the hand she wanted to take.</p><p>She gave a shake to her head. This was not good. It was time to talk to Damien.</p><p>But what if the connection she felt with Billy was a figment of her imagination? He was a widower, after all. What if he mourned his wife too much ever to move on?</p> <p>Or what if he were interested in a relationship\u2014what would that imply? Would it mean he hadn\u2019t mourned enough? She was treading water she had no idea how to navigate.</p><p>Billy\u2019s voice brought her back to herself. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d She let herself study him, and his gaze didn\u2019t waver from hers. Faint lines at his eyes, mouth, and brow spoke to spending much time outdoors. She imagined him squinting against the sun as he got out of his cruiser for a routine traffic stop. Those eyes would be hard on someone who\u2019d broken the law. But they were warm on her now.</p><p>He was so different from Damien, his features not technically as handsome, those eyes not as young. But Billy was so in control of his world\u2014he was steadiness, strength, and wisdom, and to her those things were more vital, more necessary, more attractive than anything she shared with Damien.</p><p>\u201cYou remember.\u201d Amusement tinged his voice. He tilted his head, studying her. \u201cSilver City?\u201d</p><p>Their shopping trip to Silver City\u2014she\u2019d forgotten. Excitement snapped through her veins. \u201cRight. Of course. Totally. Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>From across the kitchen, her sister snorted an unladylike laugh.</p><p>Sorrow blushed. She\u2019d answered a bit too giddily, and Laura had noticed. She made a mental note to ask next time they were alone just when it was her big sister planned on returning to the city.</p><p>Billy didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cGood news,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve got a buddy in the restaurant business there. He talked to his supplier. Usually they\u2019re closed weekends, but we can get you into the warehouse tomorrow morning. He said he\u2019d give you a new industrial freezer at cost.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that news, Sorrow forgot all about her sister. Appliances cost a fortune, and she was still in denial about just how much a new freezer was going to run them. \u201cAt cost? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne that won\u2019t break down.\u201d He winked and, for an instant, that rugged tough guy was just plain cute.</p><p>Cute, steady, strong, wise, and now thoughtful. She resisted the urge to fling herself into him.</p><p>\u201cRack \u2019em up,\u201d she heard Damien shout. His voice reverberated clear into the kitchen, followed by the laughter of other men. Damien had always been able to make the other men laugh.</p><p>But in that moment, Sorrow knew. She didn\u2019t want Damien.</p><p>She wanted Billy.</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>When Billy showed up early the next morning, Sorrow was waiting for him in the tavern. He spotted her at once. That tousled, wavy blond hair hanging down her back. A flannel shirt tied around her waist. From behind she seemed relaxed, perched on a barstool, chatting with her father. By the smell of things, Sully was there, too, frying up some hash browns.</p><p>Bear spotted Billy and nodded a greeting. \u201cSheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Sorrow turned and gave him a bright smile. \u201cHey, Billy.\u201d</p><p>His pulse jumped.</p><p>She might\u2019ve looked casual, but Sorrow was no tomboy. In fact, she was all woman. Her smile was open and easy, that of a confident, capable woman. Of somebody who knew what she was about. It was the smile of a woman who\u2019d be as confident in the bedroom as she was lounging on that stool.</p><p>He needed to stop going there in his head.</p><p>Last night he hadn\u2019t been able to stop himself. He\u2019d gone there in his head all night, until his stomach was in knots, through the night, until finally he hadn\u2019t been able to stop himself. He\u2019d touched her. He couldn\u2019t help not touching her\u2014he\u2019d had to know what that hair felt like, how those waves might give beneath his fingers.</p><p>And once he\u2019d touched her he\u2019d had to touch her again. Her chin. Her arm. He\u2019d had to turn and face the sink, running cold water over his skin to stop the ache.</p><p>It\u2019d taken all he had to look casual. To pretend to be easy when all he\u2019d felt was a fist closing around his heart. Pained, wanting her, then guilty because of it. Guilty because of Keri. Because of Damien, Sorrow\u2019s boyfriend, who\u2019d been just in the next room.</p><p>He inhaled deeply to gather himself, trying to look more nonchalant than he felt. \u201cMorning, folks. Sorrow, you ready?\u201d</p><p>The way she lounged on that barstool\u2014leg swinging, leaning against the counter in a way that pulled her shirt tight. Self-consciousness overwhelmed him. Like a damned teenager with a crush, he became overly aware of his approach, of his step. Of where he should look and how broadly he should return her smile. It was a feeling he hadn\u2019t felt...well, since he was a teenager.</p><p>It\u2019d been different with his wife. He\u2019d known Keri for years before they hooked up. She worked in the DA\u2019s office, and with his role in the department, they\u2019d moved in the same circles. They\u2019d had a long time in which to get to know each other over coffee, over posttrial beers. By the time he and Keri realized there was a spark between them, he was as comfortable with her as he\u2019d been with his closest friends.</p><p>Sorrow, though, she was different. This was different.</p><p>He pushed aside the thought. Women like her weren\u2019t for him. Crushes and hope had died with Keri.</p><p>Billy leaned on the bar next to her, ignoring the smell of her shampoo. The scent of Sorrow in the morning.</p><p>\u201cGood news,\u201d she told him. She was happily working through a stack of pancakes.</p><p>Her eyes were bright and her mood contagious. It was like sunshine burning through the cloud over his heart, burning away the shadows. He couldn\u2019t help but forget his dark thoughts and give himself to the moment.</p><p>\u201cSock it to me,\u201d he said, stealing a triangle of her toast. He had to admit\u2014he loved a woman who loved to eat.</p><p>\u201cOur cupboards are full. Or rather they will be. No need for us to go shopping after all.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment needled him, and he tamped it down. He told himself he was just concerned for her safety. He was suspicious of all the unusual accidents lately. If he wanted to hang around Sorrow, it was simply that he wanted to keep an eye on things. \u201cThat is good news,\u201d he said.</p><p>And he tried to believe it. Not having to shop for food meant he\u2019d reclaim several hours from his morning\u2014he should be happy. It was his day off, and there were any number of things he needed to tend to in his personal life.</p><p>He just needed to think of them.</p><p>She nodded and swallowed. \u201cIt means I don\u2019t need to bother you too much this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be a bother.\u201d If the way this disappointment kept surging to the surface was any indication, a shopping trip with Sorrow would\u2019ve been a pleasure. But he was being a fool. He grabbed another slice of toast, and it was too dry in his mouth. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamien heard about our troubles when he was here last night.\u201d Her eyes flicked to his, as she quickly added, \u201cHe left pretty much right after he found out.\u201d</p><p>Was she trying to tell him something with that look? Had there been a message in her eyes?</p><p>He looked away. Pretty, young women didn\u2019t telegraph hidden messages to men like him. More fool he.</p> <p>\u201cDamien has some friends,\u201d Sorrow continued, and he could\u2019ve sworn he heard something like guilt in her tone.</p><p>Bear interrupted with a smirk, \u201cSome friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d she said flatly, \u201cDamien has a lot of friends. He knows a few restaurant owners\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome as far away as Reno,\u201d Bear boasted.</p><p>Billy forced his pleasant expression not to fade. He\u2019d offered his help, but restaurant owners? How could he compete with that? All he had to offer was a buddy who worked as a line cook in Silver City.</p> <p>Her smile was gone now, her mouth a tight line. \u201cYes, Dad. Some as far away as Reno. So anyway, apparently any minute now, men will start showing up with food. Enough to tide us over, but not so much that it won\u2019t keep in the regular fridges.\u201d</p><p>Billy said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d So how come he didn\u2019t feel wonderful? He was disappointed, and the reaction surprised him.</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sorrow crumpled her napkin and dropped it onto her plate. Did she look disappointed, too? \u201cThough I can\u2019t imagine what Damien offered to convince them to sell us food from their own kitchens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he offer?\u201d Bear put down his coffee hard enough that some sloshed over the edge of the cup. \u201cThe guy offered not to kick their asses if they helped you.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow stood and patted her dad\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEasy there, cowboy.\u201d She met Billy\u2019s eye. \u201cI may not need to buy food, but if that other offer still stands...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe freezer?\u201d Something in Billy\u2019s chest unclenched. \u201cYou bet.\u201d</p> <p>She grabbed her purse from atop the bar. \u201cIt\u2019s as good a day as any to spend a ridiculous amount of money on appliances.\u201d</p><p>Bear handed his daughter her coat. \u201cYou help her, Preston. Have her pick out a good one.\u201d</p><p>Billy helped her shrug into her layers. \u201cI\u2019m sure your daughter is perfectly capable of picking out her own appliances, but I\u2019ll be happy to offer my help if she asks for it.\u201d</p><p>Was it his imagination, or was that a mischievous glance she just shot him? He resisted the urge to put his arm around her shoulders as they walked out to his SUV.</p><p>It was a long drive to Silver City. Forty-five minutes in which Billy would not notice the curve of Sorrow\u2019s thigh on the seat next to him. To not savor the smell of her, something like vanilla and shampoo. To not allow his gaze to be pulled over and over again to the slash of sunlight that cut across her face, sparking her blond hair to a thousand shades of gold.</p><p>His mind went to Keri again, and he knew his usual grief, but this time it was cut with something else. He felt the sadness, but oddly, it didn\u2019t sear through him like it usually did.</p><p>Was this him moving on? Because for the first time, he was glimpsing what it might be like to turn the page on that chapter of his life and step into another.</p><p>Was that what Keri would want him to do?</p> <p>He stole a look at Sorrow. His heart was heavy, but something in his mind felt lighter than before. More open. He imagined it was hope. It was a heady feeling.</p><p>Sorrow was like those rays of early morning light that cut through the windshield, and he was a creature emerging from darkness, blinking at this new reality, feeling a tentative fascination.</p><p>She was so different from his late wife. Keri would never ride in the car with her shoes propped on the dash. She\u2019d never sit with her face turned toward the sun. His wife had shied from the sun, slathered herself in sunscreen, worn designer hats.</p><p>But there was Sorrow, with a faint dusting of freckles across the bridge of her nose, wearing jeans, a T, and a flannel shirt layered overtop. Fitted and purple, it was definitely a women\u2019s shirt, but it made him think how good she\u2019d look wearing his flannel shirt. Romping around his apartment in his ancient red plaid. Wearing nothing else but her panties.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He needed to stop thinking. He wasn\u2019t ready for this.</p><p>Talking. Talking would stop this thinking. \u201cWe should be in Silver City by ten. Stroke of luck Damien knows so many people. Good thing I\u2019m not competing with him,\u201d he said, attempting a joke. \u201cMoney, charm, and powerful friends...a guy could get easily outmatched.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow gave him a blank look.</p><p>The line had been funny enough in his head. Hell, he needed to stop talking and thinking. He turned on the radio, and an old rock song filled the truck.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she muttered, \u201cDamien\u2019s something else.\u201d She leaned forward, peering at the complicated police console. Her hair slipped from behind her ear, sending a waft of flowery shampoo scent his way.</p><p>He stared hard at the road. Maybe talking had been better.</p><p>He\u2019d told himself he wasn\u2019t interested. That he couldn\u2019t allow himself to be interested. He\u2019d sworn off relationships\u2014he\u2019d barely survived getting gutted by the last one. He wouldn\u2019t survive another loss like that. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>But could he survive his current life? Going on like he\u2019d been, closed to all but the most superficial of interactions.</p><p>He\u2019d come to Sierra Falls, hoping to find peace in a small town. To find solace dealing with small things. But in the past weeks, he\u2019d discovered the most peace while spending time with her.</p><p>He stole another glance. She was so different, so refreshing.</p><p>And so beautiful. Long hair tucked haphazardly behind her ear. Fresh, rosy cheeks. A love of life, a passion for food, and a smile ever on her face, even as she dealt with the most challenging of issues\u2014finances, the lodge and tavern, her father.</p><p>She was just right.</p><p>But would a woman like that want a man like him? He felt like an old shell sometimes, but there Sorrow sat, a woman of appetites, fresh and ripe and...</p><p>It sheared like a bolt straight through him. He wanted her.</p><p>Was this him deciding to live again? Because where his mind went, his body eagerly followed. If he were honest with himself, he\u2019d wanted to get to know her all along, had enjoyed learning about her. But what consumed him now was something else entirely.</p><p>It was desire.</p><p>He adjusted himself in his seat, racking his brain for idle chat.</p><p>This was no good. The woman had a boyfriend, for God\u2019s sake. He might want Sorrow, but that wasn\u2019t his decision to make.</p><p>The current station went to a commercial, and she reached over the console for the radio. \u201cMay I?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded, desperately trying to come up with some topic of conversation. \u201cYou like music?\u201d Lame conversation, apparently.</p><p>\u201cI like a little of everything.\u201d She zipped through, searching for a good song. The scent of her hair wasn\u2019t so much flowers as it was flowery vanilla.</p><p>He cracked the window.</p><p>Cooking. That seemed safe enough territory. \u201cWhy do you cook?\u201d It was the best he could come up with, though he could guess the answer. He\u2019d tasted what Sully called pot roast.</p><p>But he was surprised when her answer was slow in coming.</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen is my solace,\u201d she said finally. \u201cIt\u2019s a place for me to go. You know, in my head. I mean, there\u2019s not much else to do around the lodge.\u201d She gave a rueful laugh. \u201cThough you\u2019d never be able to tell with how crazy things have been lately. But usually it\u2019s just me sitting long hours behind the desk, or cleaning the rooms\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shot her a look. \u201cYou clean the rooms? When do you sleep?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, sounding older than her years. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we have tons of people in and out of there. It\u2019s not that much. Anyway, planning menus, all the kitchen prep...it helps me imagine traveling to a place. When I cook, tasting Indian curries, or stir-frying Chinese, it\u2019s a way to visit there. In a way.\u201d She got quiet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never left Sierra Falls?\u201d He cursed the disbelief in his voice\u2014he would hate to think he sounded patronizing.</p><p>\u201cWell, sure I\u2019ve left,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cClass trips to Sacramento, San Francisco. That sort of thing. But real traveling...I guess that\u2019s not in the cards for me.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell her she could determine her own cards. That she needed someone to help prod her father. Why Damien didn\u2019t apply some friendly pressure on her behalf was a mystery. Hell, he\u2019d been pressuring Bear on her behalf since the day their roof caved in. Billy wanted to say that and lots of other things, but instead he just kept driving.</p><p>She shifted in her seat, and he felt her eyes glued to his profile. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>The bald way she\u2019d asked it took him aback. \u201cHow about me?\u201d</p><p>He gave a little laugh, but when he turned to catch her eye, he wished he hadn\u2019t. She was watching him avidly, her expression serious, like she might be able to uncover something he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been hiding.</p><p>He wanted her to turn and look out the window instead.</p><p>He wanted to reach across the seat and sweep the hair from her face. Then he\u2019d take her hand and tuck it in his, to hold it nestled in his lap.</p><p>\u201cYou were a high-ranking police officer,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Oakland. It must\u2019ve been so exciting.\u201d</p><p>He put his entire focus on the road. That\u2019d been another time. Another life. His voice was tight when he replied, \u201cExciting is one word for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must pale in comparison to what we\u2019ve got going on in Sierra Falls.\u201d</p><p>He shot her another look. He was so in control in all aspects of his work. His whole job was getting people to confess to things they wanted kept secret. And yet Sorrow always caught him off guard, always got him talking\u2014how did she manage it? \u201cHey, we were talking about you. How\u2019d the tables get turned?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a wicked smile that would\u2019ve worked on any perp, in any interrogation room. \u201cI\u2019m not done with my questions yet, Sheriff. So you decided to leave gangs for grandmas?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t miss it?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t even sure what that meant, miss it. It was so much more complicated than that. Of course he missed it. Just as he never wanted to go back. He avoided the question. \u201cI\u2019m happy putting myself out to pasture.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re hardly ancient.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Some days he felt it. Billy sat there, waiting for the familiar weariness to swamp him again. Only this time it didn\u2019t. Catching a glimpse of her sneakers on his dash, smelling her sunshine scent, he had to admit, this was not one of those days.</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>Sully kept one eye on the kitchen as the men carted away the old freezer and rolled in the new. The appliance guys worked fast, hooking up the water line and electricity, and rolling that big beast into place.</p><p>He occupied himself with busy work, because he didn\u2019t really need to be there. Not with Billy Preston there supervising things. Sully leaned on the pass-through for a glimpse.</p> <p>Billy and Sorrow were in the kitchen, but it was Billy who\u2019d asked the men to sweep away their trash before pushing the freezer into place. Billy who\u2019d told them not to ding the door. Finally, it seemed there was someone else around the place looking out for Sorrow.</p><p>Sully eyed the sheriff\u2014he sure was hanging around a whole helluva lot lately. He had to admit he liked the guy. As former military himself, Sully understood a man who\u2019d chosen a uniform as his vocation. Respected him.</p><p>It put him in mind of Damien, who had yet to command Sully\u2019s respect. His uniform was a pair of khakis and a button-up shirt, and Sully had always thought Sorrow could do better.</p><p>The door swung, catching Sully\u2019s eye. The installation guys were headed out. \u201cYou\u2019re all set,\u201d one of them told him. \u201cGive a call if there\u2019s any trouble.\u201d</p><p>Sully nodded his thanks. Curious about the new freezer\u2014and, he hated to admit, excited, too\u2014he went into the kitchen to check it out.</p><p>But Sorrow and Billy were already checking it out, and they were standing close. Real close. Though they didn\u2019t look like they might kiss, they were speaking quietly, like two people who\u2019d definitely thought about it.</p> <p>Sully cleared his throat. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t even been touching, but Sorrow and Billy sprang apart like they were two magnets with opposite poles.</p><p>Unsure what to do, he snatched a rag from the counter, turned on his heel, and headed right back out. It\u2019d been an adolescent maneuver, but he\u2019d needed to do something. Those two were close and looked like they were thinking about getting closer. Better for Sully to feel like a moron than catch Sorrow and Billy in a lip-lock.</p><p>Especially when one of them had a boyfriend. He was surprised they hadn\u2019t broken up yet, though lately Damien had been making himself scarce, almost like the guy knew something was up. The sheriff, meanwhile, seemed to be there every time Sully turned around, and from what he just saw in the kitchen, it looked like where there was smoke there was fire.</p><p>Well, hot damn. He let the notion sit for a bit. The sheriff was older than Sorrow\u2014he better not be taking any advantage. Sully considered the possibility, then dismissed it just as fast. Billy Preston struck him as a good man. A widower\u2014not the type to be dallying with girls\u2019 affections. Quite the contrary\u2014Billy would be serious, with serious intentions.</p><p>And what exactly were those intentions? Sorrow deserved to have someone in her life who wanted to ask just that. He didn\u2019t trust Bear with the task\u2014the man wouldn\u2019t know subtle if his life depended on it. No, it\u2019d be up to him to ask what Billy had in mind where Sorrow was concerned.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before he got the chance. Sully heard the phone ring, and Sorrow strode out of the tavern not a minute later. Billy stood at the door, shouldering into his coat.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sheriff,\u201d Sully called. \u201cYou got a second?\u201d</p> <p>With a curt nod, Billy hung his coat back on the hook. \u201cSure thing.\u201d His look was quizzical as he joined him in a booth.</p><p>\u201cSorrow head out?\u201d he asked, unsure where he was going with all this or how to begin.</p><p>\u201cSome emergency at the lodge.\u201d Billy noticed his concern and added, \u201cNothing major. I get the impression that a light\u2019s out and Bear can\u2019t find the bulbs.\u201d</p><p>Sully let out a belly laugh, relieved it wasn\u2019t something more. \u201cGood thing he\u2019s got Sorrow around. If it weren\u2019t for her, the man would probably just sit in the dark and bitch about it.\u201d</p><p>Billy chuckled, adding, \u201cProbably gripe about how it was her fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d The irreverent talk had broken the ice, and there was a moment\u2019s comfortable silence.</p><p>Sully took a deep breath. It was now or never. \u201cI\u2019ve known Sorrow since she was knee-high to a grasshopper. She was a good kid, and she\u2019s grown into a good woman.\u201d He looked Billy in the eye\u2014it\u2019d be cowardly to do anything but. \u201cYou\u2019re a lawman, and I respect you, but I\u2019ve got to ask...\u201d He faltered. He didn\u2019t have kids, and definitely no experience with daughters. He could command a battalion of soldiers hailing from every background, every race, every walk of life. But this? He was no good at this overprotective thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat my intentions are?\u201d</p><p>Sully let out that breath. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s the one. I\u2019d like to know what your intentions are.\u201d</p><p>It was Billy\u2019s turn to falter. \u201cShe has a boyfriend,\u201d he answered finally, and though his words said one thing, his eyes told quite another story.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><p>Billy nodded, hesitated. \u201cSorrow is special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have feelings for her.\u201d</p><p>Billy nodded. Looked down at his hands on the table. There was something else.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s something else, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Sully prompted.</p><p>When Billy looked back up, his gaze was distant. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just the boyfriend.\u201d He gave a humorless laugh. \u201cI\u2019m a broken man, Sully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t seem broken to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, not broken, but...my wife, Keri. I can\u2019t seem to forget her.\u201d</p><p>Sully had some experience on that front. Not with women, no. But he was haunted by faces\u2014dozens of them\u2014young men who\u2019d died while he lived. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we ever forget the past. Just so long as we keep moving forward.\u201d</p><p>They sat with that thought a moment. Billy looked like he needed to say more, so Sully just waited for his words to come.</p><p>Eventually they did. \u201cKeri cast a long shadow,\u201d Billy began. \u201cShe was powerful. A lawyer in the DA\u2019s office. And man, could that woman make the most hardened felons quake.\u201d He smiled at the memory. \u201cShe was something else. Never would I have cheated on her.\u201d He laughed then. \u201cHell, I was afraid to disagree with her.\u201d</p><p>The smile bled from his face, and he leaned his elbows on the table, struggling to put words to his feelings. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just moving on that\u2019s hard. The feeling that I\u2019m somehow breaking my vows if I look at another woman. It\u2019s that I was a different person when I married her. That man is long gone. And that feels like a betrayal, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen change.\u201d As Sully said it, he wondered if it was time to make some changes himself. But he pushed the notion away to focus on the man across from him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep going. Experiencing new things. That\u2019s how you honor her memory\u2014by living your life. Otherwise you might as well have died with her. Something like that\u2014losing your wife so young\u2014it\u2019ll make you different. You\u2019ll live different, and you\u2019ll love different, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am different,\u201d Billy said. \u201cThere\u2019s a quiet inside me that I didn\u2019t have when I was with Keri. Like peace. My whole life, I didn\u2019t realize it\u2019d been lacking. Until I came here and met Sorrow.\u201d</p><p>Sully knew a little something about that. \u201cI think some folks call that wisdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so.\u201d Billy shrugged. \u201cAll I know is that, for the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be things out there I could look forward to. And it\u2019s because of her. Sorrow. When I\u2019m with her, I just feel...happy.\u201d He\u2019d spoken the word as though he\u2019d never said it before. But then a dark glint flashed in his eyes. \u201cAnd I feel a whole hell of a lot more than that, too, obviously.\u201d</p><p>Sully recognized that glint. He growled, \u201cI\u2019ll have to caution you there, son.\u201d</p><p>Billy laughed. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d He leaned back in his seat, looking lighter. More at ease. \u201cYou ever lost anyone, Tom?\u201d</p><p>Sully blew out a sigh. Why hadn\u2019t he poured them something to drink first?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known loss,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cNot a wife, though. Not that. But they were losses just the same. I felt a lot of guilt when I stepped off that plane back in \u201972. Coming home when so many didn\u2019t. But those boys, my friends, they\u2019d have wanted me to live. They\u2019d have kicked my ass if they thought I\u2019d given up on my own life. Strong woman like your Keri? I imagine she\u2019d do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKick my ass from the great beyond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Sully said, but then it was his turn to go quiet. He sure was free with the advice\u2014advice he should consider taking himself. Because what he was doing\u2014flipping Bear\u2019s burgers day in and day out\u2014that wasn\u2019t exactly taking life by the horns. It was time he made a change. Time he did a little living himself, maybe ask Marlene out on a proper date.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to let go and give in to your feelings,\u201d Sully said, but then he paused as it hit him. Those words applied to himself as much as to Billy. He nodded, clear now on his own feelings. Billy was lucky\u2014the guy was a kid in comparison, with another lifetime ahead of him. \u201cYou\u2019ll never lose the grief,\u201d Sully added, \u201cbut you\u2019re young yet. You can move through it. It\u2019s no dishonor to your Keri if you move on with your life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Billy\u2019s eyes met and held his. Something moved between the two men, connected them. It was respect.</p><p>The sheriff was good people. Solid. Sully could see him and Sorrow making something work. Which meant she needed to do something, and fast, before she had a situation on her hands. \u201cNow she just needs to deal with that boyfriend of hers.\u201d He wished there were a way to broach it with her, have a talk like he was having with Billy, but if he brought up her love life, she\u2019d probably look at him like he\u2019d grown horns.</p><p>An evil smile curled onto the sheriff\u2019s face. \u201cI could always arrest him for something. That\u2019d take him out of the picture.\u201d</p> <p>He barked out a laugh. \u201cNo need to resort to that. I\u2019ve had my eye on that girl. I\u2019ve seen how she is with you. If I know Sorrow, that boy will be getting his walking papers any day now.\u201d</p><p>When Sorrow returned, she plopped next to the sheriff in the booth. \u201cLet there be light,\u201d she pronounced.</p><p>Talk about lightbulbs\u2014Billy\u2019s eyes were a thousand watts when he looked at her. \u201cAll good?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAll good.\u201d She leaned against him with a sigh. \u201cBut boy, am I beat.\u201d</p><p>Sully watched the exchange in silence. He was sure they were blissfully unaware how obvious the fireworks were that crackled between them. He\u2019d said Sorrow could handle Damien, and he hoped he was right. She was, in her way, a bit of an innocent with men, unaware of her effect on them.</p> <p>Damien, though, he was a pro. Not manipulative, but a smooth talker, that was for sure. Sully had tried to like him, wanted to trust and respect him, but as far as he could tell, the guy earned his money mostly by wearing those fancy clothes and talking on his cell. Born into the richest family in Sierra Falls, he\u2019d had a lucky birth, though with the way women treated him, you\u2019d have thought he was in line to be king of England.</p><p>The front door opened, bringing in a gust of crisp winter air. Speak of the devil.</p><p>Sorrow sat bolt upright. \u201cDamien, hi,\u201d she said, her voice overly bright.</p><p>Damien stiffened. \u201cHey, Bailey. Sheriff.\u201d He gave a curt nod toward the back of the room. \u201cSully, congrats. I hear you got a new freezer.\u201d</p><p>A crazy grin was pasted on Sorrow\u2019s face. \u201cWhat a surprise to see you. I thought you had to work.\u201d</p><p>He took in the whole scene. \u201cI like to keep you on your toes,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cI wanted to check out the new setup.\u201d He shot a pointed look at Billy. \u201cSee if you need anything.\u201d</p> <p>Looked like things might come to a head sooner rather than later. Sully suppressed a smile\u2014this was more fun than he\u2019d had in some time. These kids, figuring out their lives. Youth really was wasted on the young.</p><p>She stood, looking brittle enough to snap in two. Damien wrapped an arm around her and leaned down, taking a kiss that struck Sully as longer and firmer than necessary.</p><p>Sorrow pulled away. \u201cWell, come see.\u201d</p><p>Damien strode straight back into the kitchen, leading the way. And of course he did\u2014Damien was the sort of guy who never second-guessed himself.</p><p>Sully couldn\u2019t help but follow, and he felt Billy at his back. The word guarded came to mind.</p><p>Damien gave the freezer a once-over. It was a professional model, with great stainless steel panels. \u201cShe\u2019s a beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine is in the restaurant business,\u201d Billy said evenly.</p><p>Sully frowned. \u201cNobody better tamper with this one.\u201d He met the sheriff\u2019s eye, and they exchanged a meaningful look.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Bear about installing a security system,\u201d Billy said.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d Damien opened the door to take a look. \u201cThis whole thing must\u2019ve cost him a fortune already.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow was nodding away like a bobblehead doll. \u201cBilly\u2019s friend got it for me at cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he did,\u201d Damien muttered.</p><p>Sorrow and Billy were so focused on staring inside that freezer that Sully was the only one to notice the smirk on Damien\u2019s face. He wasn\u2019t sure if the kid was getting ready to laugh or punch the sheriff.</p><p>\u201cWell, Sheriff, nice work.\u201d Damien shut the door. \u201cIt sure is a big one. Sort of reminds me of those Transformer movies. Like it might spring to life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right?\u201d Sorrow tried to sound playful, but there was tension in her voice.</p><p>Damien put his hands in his pockets. \u201cSo I guess you don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d Sorrow stopped herself with a dispirited laugh. \u201cI mean, of course we need you, but this is all taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Sully noted it was \u201cwe need you\u201d instead of \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>He backed away slowly. Seemed like a good time to run out and do an errand. Maybe make a quick stop by the house. Marlene\u2019s grandkid wanted to see his Vietnam medals.</p><p>Folks said all was fair in love and war, but at the moment, war sure seemed the easier of the two.</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>Billy\u2019s friend had moved heaven and earth to deliver the freezer so soon, and Sorrow contemplated the big, whirring beast as she cleaned the kitchen, scouring away grease and the dust that\u2019d exploded from beneath the old one when the appliance guys had done their thing.</p><p>Cleaning was usually such a good, mindless activity, and yet she couldn\u2019t stop fretting about what the heck she was supposed to do with her love life. The timing kept being off, and there hadn\u2019t been a good moment to have her talk with Damien. He\u2019d probably be fine with a breakup\u2014he was the sort of guy who had two dozen women waiting in the wings. Maybe he was even thinking of breaking up with her.</p><p>She had to admit, though, he\u2019d looked ready to throttle Billy this morning. She was sure his jealousy had nothing to do with her\u2014Damien just didn\u2019t like to lose. However she looked at it, there was no question\u2014she needed to end their fling the next time she saw him, no matter what.</p><p>Because she couldn\u2019t get Billy out of her mind. She was surrounded by people she loved, people she knew who loved her, and yet it was only when she was with Billy that she felt like she wasn\u2019t in it alone.</p><p>She\u2019d thought she was into Damien, until Billy had come into her life. The two men posed such a stark contrast. Damien seemed like such a...guy sometimes, a dude who told jokes over the pool table, made public moves on his girl, and drove his car too fast. But the sheriff was all man\u2014thoughtful, kind, strong, experienced\u2014and all man was exactly what Sorrow needed. What she wanted.</p><p>Laura had ribbed her about Damien putting a ring on it, but as she got to know Billy, Sorrow realized how Damien wasn\u2019t the sort of man she\u2019d want for a husband at all. She was young even to be thinking the word marriage\u2014some might say too young\u2014but she\u2019d borne such responsibility for so long, sometimes she felt far more ancient than her twenty-three years.</p><p>It was old enough to know Damien wasn\u2019t the one. The man she\u2019d spend her life with would be someone who stood tall, stood for what was right. Stood up for her. A man like Billy Preston.</p><p>Her fling with Damien had been fun, but now she saw how that was all it\u2019d been\u2014good, physical fun. Granted, Damien was a great person\u2014he\u2019d done so much for her and her family, and she didn\u2019t doubt he cared for her. But her stolen conversations in the kitchen with Billy, the quiet way she felt him ready to catch her if she fell, how he always wanted to know about her day before anything else...she saw how love could grow there. And love was what she wanted.</p><p>The problem was him. He\u2019d said he wasn\u2019t competing with Damien. \u201cGood thing I\u2019m not competing with him\u201d to be exact. If Billy wasn\u2019t even trying, that meant he wasn\u2019t interested, right?</p><p>It\u2019s not that she expected Billy to make a move. He was a gentleman after all. A good guy. And a good guy never moved in on another man\u2019s woman.</p><p>Which meant it was up to her to make a move. Only she didn\u2019t have any inkling what his feelings toward her might be. She knew he liked her, and she definitely knew she was feeling something. But was she in it alone?</p><p>Maybe he still felt too much grief over the loss of his wife. A part of him would surely grieve her for the rest of his life. Would he ever see his way through it? And, if he did, would there be a place left in his heart with room enough for someone to find a home there? Could that someone be her?</p><p>Billy was older, though. Might he want someone more experienced?</p><p>Dealing with her dad\u2019s stroke at such a young age had certainly made her feel older than her years. She\u2019d had plenty of emotional experience. And she had the real-life experience of running the lodge almost single-handedly. Yet she didn\u2019t feel worldly. While Billy, with his life in the city, and his fancy restaurants, and his lawyer wife...he\u2019d lived a lifetime before he\u2019d even arrived in Sierra Falls. And it\u2019d been a lifetime that seemed pretty worldly to her.</p><p>Either way, it was definitely past time to break it off with Damien, and only then could she figure out this thing with Billy. If he wasn\u2019t interested, that was something she needed to find out pretty quick, because she was spending way too much time daydreaming about the man.</p><p>She managed to get Damien alone when he swung by for lunch. By the look in his eyes, she could see he knew what was coming. It made her nervous. Damien was smooth, he was quick on his feet. He\u2019d try to trip her up. She needed to focus. End it quickly, kindly, with no debate. Like pulling off a Band-Aid.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that sheriff,\u201d Damien told her. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking up with me because you\u2019ve got a thing for Billy Preston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorrow Bailey, I\u2019ve known you my whole life. You can\u2019t bullshit a bullshitter. I see what\u2019s going on. I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...you do?\u201d Relief plumed through her. Damien understood. Maybe he\u2019d make it easy on her.</p><p>\u201cOf course. And I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><p>Her relief was short-lived. He wasn\u2019t going to make this easy at all. She\u2019d just have to toughen up. \u201cWell, you have to buy it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surprise flashed in his eyes. Good. He was hearing her. Only he decided to take a different tack. He stepped closer, tugged at the front of her shirt. \u201cLook, babe. You\u2019ve been so swamped around here. And I\u2019ve been swamped at work. What we need is to get out of town, reconnect. We\u2019ll take a mini-vacation. Drive someplace warm, like Sonoma or Napa. We could go wine tasting. French Laundry is out that way, too\u2014I could get us a reservation. It\u2019s one of the best restaurants in the world.\u201d</p><p>She knew an instant of temptation, but then pictured Billy in her mind\u2019s eye. She might not know how the sheriff felt, but she had to be free to find out. She took a step back. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you? I\u2019ll whisk you away.\u201d He stepped forward, leaning down to whisper in her ear. \u201cThere\u2019s a spa in Sonoma. You can get a facial. Maybe a hot stone massage.\u201d</p> <p>Wow, he was good. It\u2019d be so easy to say yes. Hot stone massages and floating in hot mineral pools. She could go. He\u2019d love to take her.</p><p>But she knew she couldn\u2019t. She shook her head. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not right?\u201d He shook his head, baffled, like she was speaking gibberish.</p><p>That nonchalant attitude of his girded her. Damien had always gotten what he wanted. But not this time. She stood tall. \u201cI\u2019d feel like I was taking advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not taking advantage when it\u2019s something I want to do. For you. For us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Damien. I\u2019m just not feeling it.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak, and for once nothing came out. She felt a pang of guilt. Damien was a good guy\u2014she cared for him. She really did. And she hated hurting him. Because, she was surprised to discover, he looked genuinely hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d he asked, his tone subdued for once. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m feeling it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and the word brought with it a stab of sadness. It was more than the discomfort of delivering bad news\u2014this breaking up thing was hard. She genuinely cared for him, would genuinely miss him. \u201cThis is it, Damien. You\u2019re great\u2014so great. You\u2019ve done so much for us. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cThe old \u2018it\u2019s not you it\u2019s me\u2019 line?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders fell, and he laughed, a rueful, regretful sound. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Bail. I\u2019ve given that talk a time or two myself.\u201d He chucked her chin. \u201cIt\u2019s not done yet, you know. It ain\u2019t over till the fat lady sings.\u201d</p> <p>As breakups went, it felt oddly incomplete. He\u2019d see, though. In time, he\u2019d come to understand that she\u2019d meant every word.</p><p>She moped around the house after that, and Laura found her later, sitting on their brother\u2019s bed. It was a good place to think. Representing hope and melancholy both, there was no better spot for wallowing than BJ\u2019s room.</p><p>He\u2019d gone to Quantico for Officer Candidate School right after college, and though he\u2019d been away for years, everything was just as he\u2019d left it. A Metallica poster. San Francisco Giants baseball memorabilia. A snapshot of him with his high school girlfriend.</p><p>She peered at that photo for a while. Strange that he\u2019d kept it, they\u2019d been broken up for so long.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Laura said, and Sorrow startled.</p><p>She put the picture frame back on BJ\u2019s bedside table. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d Laura wandered in, glancing idly at the books on his desk. But then she froze, paled. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any news, was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sorrow said quickly, having instantly understood the question. A loved one fighting a war on the other side of the planet tended to make normal things like doorbells, ringing phones, and somber visits to the bedroom cause for alarm. \u201cNo word from BJ.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJeez. You scared me.\u201d Laura plopped next to her on the brown corduroy bedspread. \u201cSo then what\u2019s got you so droopy? You look like you just lost your puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamien and I broke up.\u201d</p><p>Laura smirked. \u201cYou mean, you broke up with Damien.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow cast her eyes down and picked at the comforter. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hasn\u2019t guessed? You and that sheriff are practically joined at the hip.\u201d</p><p>She snapped her head up at that. \u201cWe are not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that, anyway? Some sort of older man complex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s, like, ten or eleven years older than me,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Laura flopped onto her side, leaning on her elbow. \u201cSo, you and Damien. Spill it. How\u2019d it all go down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>Her sister laughed. \u201cOf course he didn\u2019t. I think the last person to break up with Damien was Paula Richardson in the third grade.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow gave her a rueful smile. \u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019d he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he wanted to take me away somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike on a vacation?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow nodded. How she\u2019d dreamed of a vacation. But she\u2019d never take advantage of his money that way. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I just wasn\u2019t feeling it.\u201d</p><p>Laura waved her hands, beckoning for more. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then he said he was into it, and what could he do, and it went on pretty much like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do? Are you and Billy a thing now?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow gave her a sharp look. \u201cBilly doesn\u2019t have \u2018things.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t seem like the type. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s even interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh. Of course he\u2019s interested.\u201d Laura sat up, looking riled. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t lived with you for so many years, I\u2019d have thought you were born yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think he comes around here? For what, Sully\u2019s cooking? To chat with Dad?\u201d</p><p>A tiny match lit in Sorrow\u2019s chest, a small flicker of hope. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe guesses not.\u201d Laura shoved her shoulder. \u201cWell? Do you want him to be interested?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow felt the blood heat her cheeks.</p><p>Laura barked out a laugh. \u201cSorrrr-ow likes the sherrr-ifff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Sorrow said, shoving her sister back. \u201cWhat about you, Miss Know-It-All?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quick with the love life advice,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cAnyone you\u2019ve got your eye on?\u201d</p><p>Laura looked taken aback. \u201cIn this town? No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that? There are lots of great men in this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is like walking into the land of low-hanging fruit...\u201d Laura laughed. \u201cBut none of them are for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Laura shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The guys around here are all so...townie.\u201d</p><p>The attitude was classic Laura, and as usual, it drove Sorrow nuts. She crossed her arms at her chest. \u201cJust because a guy lives in the mountains, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s backwoods.\u201d</p><p>Laura bristled. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou implied it. You were born here, Laura. What, you spend a few years in San Francisco, and all of a sudden you\u2019re better than the rest of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Laura said, and seemed actually to mean it.</p><p>Maybe her sister was being sincere. Maybe she was the one with the chip on her shoulder, reading too much into Laura\u2019s off-the-cuff comments.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Sorrow waved it off. \u201cIt\u2019s just men. I didn\u2019t mean to jump down your throat.\u201d</p><p>Laura puffed up playfully. \u201cAn apology. Well, then.\u201d Her eyes narrowed to an evil glint. \u201cIt\u2019s just men, my ass. Little sis, I think you need my help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp,\u201d Sorrow said flatly, but then she felt suddenly shy. She hated to admit it, but what Laura knew about men could probably fill an encyclopedia. \u201cOkay, say I am interested in him. What do I do next?\u201d</p><p>Laura laughed. \u201cSome things you need to figure out on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious. What should I do?\u201d Her sister never had guy trouble\u2014she was confident in a way that attracted men. Sorrow had always been confident, too, but until Damien, that\u2019d meant she\u2019d always ended up as the buddy. Everyone\u2019s favorite girl. \u201cI need your help.\u201d She was stumped enough that it didn\u2019t even sting to say it. \u201cYou\u2019re good with guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with guys, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe at playing the part of the girl next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d Laura said with a scowl, \u201chow\u2019d you ever land Damien?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow shrugged. \u201cYou know Damien. Damien landed me. I think he must\u2019ve been bored.\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s eyes hardened. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. You have got to stop thinking crap like that.\u201d</p><p>Laura\u2019s vehemence took her aback, touched her. Her sister was right; Sorrow was prone to being too self-effacing.</p><p>She considered confiding more, but decided not to go there. The trust just wasn\u2019t there yet. She waved it off. \u201cOkay, okay. I didn\u2019t ask for a therapy session.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, here\u2019s a question,\u201d Laura said. \u201cIs Damien going to need a therapy session when you\u2019re done with him?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t, she knew that. Their relationship had been complicated in its way, offering something they each needed. For Damien, it was that she got him. Being with Sorrow let him imagine himself something he longed to be. He wore a suit, sat behind a desk, was a power player, but that success came with a price\u2014it kept him under his father\u2019s powerful thumb. Whereas she\u2019d understood that a part of Damien longed to roll up his sleeves and be a man\u2019s man, doing things like jumping dead batteries and thawing frozen pipes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she wasn\u2019t about to explain all that, so Sorrow just shrugged. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly true love with us, you know?\u201d Feeling vulnerable, she flopped onto her back, staring at the ceiling instead of meeting her sister\u2019s probing stare. \u201cPlease. I just need some advice. I\u2019m not good at this flirting thing.\u201d She put a hand out to stop Laura\u2019s denials, meeting her eye. \u201cListen. You don\u2019t understand. It comes naturally to you. Me, I\u2019m the girl guys confide in. I\u2019ve always been Sorrow Bailey, The Buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Laura\u2019s expression softened as she seemed to see Sorrow for the first time. \u201cWell...first off, you\u2019ve got to let him know you\u2019re interested. Give him a sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of sign?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuys don\u2019t need much. Billy looks at you all the time. Next time you\u2019re alone, just...don\u2019t look away. Trust me. The man will take it from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I can do that. Wait.\u201d Sorrow\u2019s heart skittered in her chest at the thought. \u201cWhere should I be when this happens? Tell me how I should begin, exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow, exactly?\u201d Laura scanned her critically. \u201cChange that shirt, for starters. And wear something other than hiking boots.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow stuck her legs in front of her, rolling her ankles. \u201cThese aren\u2019t hiking boots. They\u2019re all-weather sneakers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever. Lose them. And wear a shirt that fits.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrow tugged at her hem. \u201cThis fits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, check that. I meant, wear something fitted.\u201d Laura popped from the bed and grabbed her sister\u2019s arm. \u201cCome with me. We\u2019re raiding my closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Sorrow stumbled down the hallway behind her. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me?\u201d</p><p>Laura flung open her closet door. \u201cIf you mean, will I dress you up then shove you out the door, then yes, gladly. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow briefly registered the surprising amount of clothing Laura had brought for what was supposedly a \u201cshort visit.\u201d But then her sister\u2019s words sank in. \u201cWait, you\u2019re going to shove me out the door? Where am I supposed to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo his house, dummy.\u201d Laura flipped through her closet, grabbing random items and tossing them on the bed.</p> <p>She felt a fluttering in her belly, excited to be getting actual help, but a little nervous, too. \u201cWhat should I talk about when I get there?\u201d</p><p>Laura stopped what she was doing to give her a long, hard look. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d</p><p>She gave her sister a rueful shrug. \u201cI can talk, I\u2019ve just never gotten how to, you know, flirt.\u201d</p><p>Laura turned and, putting hands on hips, studied her. \u201cYou know how to flirt. You just don\u2019t know that you know. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust talk about something you feel strongly about. Like food. Only spice it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpice up the food?\u201d Sorrow asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, dummy. Spice up your banter. Make it sex-ay.\u201d Laura raised a naughty brow, making Sorrow laugh. \u201cAnd make some sexy food while you\u2019re at it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSexy food? You mean, like how they say stuff like oysters and foie gras are aphrodisiacs?\u201d</p><p>Laura grimaced. \u201cIt needs to be easy and edible. Like, something drizzly and chocolaty and whipped creamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Sorrow said. Food was her domain, and talk of it gave her confidence. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>Laura rolled her eyes. \u201cSeriously? If you haven\u2019t figured that part out yet, you\u2019re in more trouble than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d She joined Laura at the closet and picked out a purple dress, holding it in front of her before a mirror.</p><p>Her sister snatched it away and flung it on the floor. \u201cMakes you look like an eggplant.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow plopped on the edge of the bed. \u201cSo, what will my excuse be, for showing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Make it up. You bought too many groceries or something.\u201d Laura picked out one black high-heeled boot and tossed through her closet to find its mate. \u201cIsn\u2019t the fastest way to a man\u2019s heart through his stomach? You\u2019re the chef, so...go chef.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She could do that. \u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that.\u201d Laura\u2019s eyes lit, and she plucked a gauzy black top from her closet. \u201cA-ha.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow frowned. \u201cYou want me to wear that? It\u2019s see-through.\u201d</p><p>Laura foisted it at her. \u201cWear it. And don\u2019t leave until he kisses you.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-five</p><p>Billy knew he should do something, but there was nothing he felt like doing. It was too early in the evening to pop in a movie. He\u2019d already gotten in a workout, just the free weights he kept in his garage, but his heart hadn\u2019t been in it. Considering he wore only an ancient pair of jeans, it seemed he couldn\u2019t even finish getting dressed.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been able to get events at the lodge out of his mind. The Bailey family had scoffed at his suspicions. Fallen trees, the errant road closure, car and appliance troubles galore\u2014they blamed it all on coincidence. Just a slew of innocent incidents that came with mountain living. But the cut freezer lines had cast all those emergencies in a new light. He had a hunch something was going on. Somebody was playing a dangerous game.</p><p>And, one of these days, one of those innocent incidents could turn lethal.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bear the thought that Sorrow might get caught in the cross fire. He\u2019d done some poking around, but it\u2019d been no good. Bear had been right on one count: Sierra Falls was a friendly town, where everybody knew their neighbors. So who on earth would want to mess with the lodge?</p><p>He balled up his T-shirt and tossed it onto one of the kitchen chairs. As much as it killed him, he had to let it go for the night. All he wanted to do was storm the lodge and protect her, but it wasn\u2019t his place.</p><p>He had to get his mind on other things before he drove himself nuts. He opened the fridge to stare inside. Food. He needed food.</p><p>There was nothing to eat. And he didn\u2019t feel like cooking anyway. He slammed the door shut.</p><p>He\u2019d already had pizza once that week, which just about covered the delivery options in Sierra Falls. He thought about the tavern, but there was no way he could go there.</p><p>Even though that was all he wanted to do.</p><p>The early birds would be showing up for dinner right about now. Sully had probably made some sort of meaty special\u2014meat loaf, Prospector\u2019s Pie, or maybe his Southwest burgers. He hadn\u2019t made those in a while.</p><p>Billy could get a hot meal, keep his eye on things. Sorrow would be in and out, probably working on her own creation in the family kitchen.</p><p>Sorrow. If he went for dinner, he probably wouldn\u2019t even see her. He could just swing by, grab a quick bite, make sure nothing was amiss. It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d be paying her a visit. If he saw her, he saw her, and if he didn\u2019t, well, it\u2019d be no big deal. He grabbed his T-shirt, decided.</p><p>And then he stopped. He wadded the shirt back up and tossed it back onto the chair. He couldn\u2019t go back to the tavern again. People would start to talk, if they hadn\u2019t already. He\u2019d lost count of the number of times he\u2019d \u201cdropped by\u201d the Bailey place that week.</p><p>Something had happened on that car ride. A shift. It went deeper than him wanting to keep her safe. It was that he wanted her.</p><p>More, that it was okay to want her. That maybe he even needed her.</p><p>Except there was that damned boyfriend. He\u2019d never compete with someone like Damien Simmons. Rich, young, powerful, good-looking...the list went on and on.</p><p>But then again, Sully had said Sorrow would be giving the guy his walking papers any day now. Could that possibly be true? And, if it were, would she possibly be interested in him?</p><p>He could always look elsewhere. If he\u2019d made his decision to start dating again, he could try going to that bar across town\u2014what was that ridiculous name, Chances?\u2014and stop spending so much time at the tavern.</p><p>But who was he fooling? Sorrow was the only woman he had his eye on. Sorrow, who\u2019d managed to burrow her way beneath his shell.</p><p>The doorbell pulled him from his thoughts. He glanced at the clock. Five was late for someone to be showing up at his doorstep. He raked his hand through his hair a couple of times. People come by a man\u2019s house after hours, they had to take what they got.</p><p>He opened the door, and his jaw dropped. It was her. \u201cSorrow. Hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>He drank in the sight of her. Her cheeks were flushed from the cold and her sandy blond hair danced in the breeze. She was wearing a fuzzy bluish green hat that was an exact match to the color of her eyes.</p><p>She got prettier every time he saw her. Was there something different about her today, or was it just him, seeing her differently?</p><p>\u201cLaura kicked me out of the kitchen, but I bought too many groceries,\u201d she said, sounding nervous, \u201cand they\u2019ll spoil if I don\u2019t do something with them, so I was hoping maybe, I mean, I thought that maybe you might be hungry. If you\u2019re free. And hungry. I could cook for us.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been feeling listless, but now he felt rooted to the spot, his entire focus consumed by her. Seeing her there before him, it struck him just how powerful a presence she\u2019d been in his thoughts. And now she was here. On his doorstep. It was strange\u2014like he\u2019d summoned her somehow.</p><p>Her gaze flicked down, taking in his clothes\u2014or lack thereof.</p><p>Damn. He wasn\u2019t even dressed.</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not bothering you,\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes. I mean...no, of course you\u2019re not bothering me. And yes, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Hungrier than you realize. He laughed and stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, let\u2019s try that again. Hi, Sorrow, please come on in.\u201d He noticed her canvas bag overflowing with groceries and took it for her. \u201cLet me get this.\u201d</p><p>What was she doing there? She was like an angel who\u2019d appeared at his door, and now she was walking through his house as though it were something she did all the time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they headed to the kitchen, he caught her surreptitiously scanning the place. He darted a look around. A blanket was wadded on the corner of the couch. Some mail was tossed randomly on the coffee table. There was a stack of kindling and newspaper where he\u2019d been readying a fire. A bit messy, but not dirty.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of rumpled,\u201d he told her, \u201cbut it\u2019s home. And the kitchen\u2019s clean.\u201d He put the groceries down and quickly snatched up and pulled on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cNot rumpled at all.\u201d She followed him into the kitchen and put her purse on the counter. \u201cI was just thinking how homey it is. Comfy. Plus there are no heads anywhere,\u201d she added with a laugh, referring to her dad\u2019s penchant for wall-mounted antlers.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not big on dead and dusty animals.\u201d He looked at her. She was so damned beautiful, and she was standing there in his kitchen. \u201cSo, are you really making me dinner?\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cIf you want. Is that weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Not at all. Just before you got here, I was wondering what I was going to feed myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She looked pleased at that. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He began to empty the groceries from her bag. He needed to do something with his hands, something other than trace those errant wisps of hair from her face, or smooth his hands down her back.</p><p>As he unpacked, he grew more and more impressed. Melons, prosciutto, lamb, tomatoes, strawberries, champagne. \u201cWhat did you bring us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got melon and prosciutto skewers to start. Then I thought a rack of lamb with herbes de Provence, and some berries for dessert.\u201d Doubt flickered in her eyes. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAre you kidding? More than okay.\u201d He tempered himself\u2014he needed to stop sounding so enthusiastic. This was another man\u2019s woman. And it was Sorrow, no less. She was guileless, not at all a flirt. If she was there because she said she\u2019d bought too many groceries, then that was why she was there.</p><p>She still wore her jacket, and he went up behind her. \u201cHey, take off your coat and stay a while.\u201d</p> <p>He slid it from her shoulders and had to choke back a curse. Her shirt was sheer and black, and it gave him a glimpse of her black bra underneath. It was the sexiest goddamned thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He coughed, feeling mighty glad he was standing behind her so she couldn\u2019t see his face, or any other parts of him for that matter. \u201cYou\u2019re looking fine this evening.\u201d</p><p>As she turned to face him, her hand fluttered at her hem, like she was fighting the urge to adjust her shirt. \u201cAm I too dressed up?\u201d</p><p>His eyes went to that part of her shirt that wasn\u2019t smooth, right where the lacy cups of her bra covered her breasts. His jeans grew tight, like he was a damned teenager again. Thank God he\u2019d at least changed out of his sweats, or his condition would be ridiculously obvious. \u201cHell no.\u201d He laughed at how vehemently that\u2019d come out. \u201cI mean, not too dressed up at all. You\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>But then an icy rock formed in the pit of his stomach, giving him pause. Was she staying, or did that fancy shirt mean this was a cook and run sort of thing? \u201cAre you...have you got a date with Damien later?\u201d</p><p>For an instant, she looked panicked. \u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly, then added in a more somber tone, \u201cI mean, no. We broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His pulse thrummed hard in his neck, his throat suddenly dry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am, actually.\u201d She stood at the counter, arranging groceries that didn\u2019t need arranging. \u201cI\u2019m the one who broke it off.\u201d</p> <p>The full impact of the situation hit him. Sorrow was single.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d He hesitated on the question he knew he needed to ask. \u201cDoes that mean you didn\u2019t love him?\u201d</p><p>She got a funny, faraway look. \u201cI don\u2019t think I did.\u201d Those blue-green eyes cleared, coming into focus to meet his. \u201cI mean, I know I didn\u2019t. I guess I wanted it to be love. I\u2019ve never been in love.\u201d She opened her mouth like she wanted to say more, and he held his breath.</p><p>He\u2019d love to see this woman in love. Heat flared in his chest, long-stoked embers raging into flame. Billy would love to see this woman in love with him.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said.</p><p>She\u2019d put on that killer shirt. Filled a bag with food. And come to him. It wasn\u2019t love maybe, not yet. But maybe it could be.</p><p>There was something between them. He realized there had been, from the first cup of coffee she\u2019d ever poured for him at the tavern. He\u2019d felt the instant connection of two like minds, followed by a spark of attraction. But he\u2019d been too muddled, or too guilty, or simply too long numbed to know what it was he\u2019d been feeling.</p><p>He knew it now, though. He\u2019d been nearly dead inside for years, but now he felt awake and alive. And like a bear emerging from hibernation, he was hungry and ready. His wanting was fierce, a thing that clenched his chest and tightened his groin.</p><p>His gaze went back to that shirt\u2014the neck was a low V, with a row of delicate buttons down the front. A man would need to undo each one slowly, carefully.</p><p>Or simply tear the thing off her.</p><p>She looked around. \u201cSo...we should get started.\u201d</p><p>Oh yes, they should. He stepped closer, forcing himself to breathe slowly. They\u2019d be lucky if they made it to the first course.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an apron I could wear?\u201d She glanced down at her shirt. She wore a small locket nestled between her breasts.</p><p>Someday he\u2019d be the man to sweep the hair from her neck to clasp her necklace as she got ready. He\u2019d stand behind her and rest his hands on her bare shoulders. He\u2019d turn her to face him. He wouldn\u2019t give her a chance to finish getting dressed.</p><p>Billy licked his lips. He could taste her already. He could imagine what it would be like between them, and he was a goner.</p><p>\u201cThis is Laura\u2019s shirt, and I don\u2019t want to mess it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, though his mind was still in his fantasy. And in his fantasy, he\u2019d be careful with that shirt. No ripping this one. He\u2019d take each tiny, shiny button one at a time.</p><p>She looked at him expectantly. \u201cSo...apron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApron,\u201d he repeated. He had an old one wadded in the pantry, but he\u2019d be damned if he let her cover up that shirt. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no apron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not too, too starving,\u201d she said as she readied the lamb. \u201cI\u2019d like to marinate this for an hour or so before I cook it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d rather she marinate it for a good ten hours\u2014there were other things he was much hungrier for than dinner\u2014but instead he said, \u201cThat suits me just fine.\u201d</p><p>Once she finished her prep work, he let her take the lead and followed her into the living room. She stopped and spun, and he nearly walked into her. It put them standing close enough that he could feel the heat of her body pressing along the length of his.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even call before I came,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m totally interrupting your evening.\u201d</p><p>The normally self-possessed Sorrow sounded nervous, and it ignited an urge deep inside, to protect her, to put her at her ease, to let her know she\u2019d be his.</p><p>He told her, \u201cYou\u2019re making my evening, not interrupting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you already have plans?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fight it any longer\u2014he put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cI did. Grand plans. I was going to spend the next several hours poking at that fire. Care to join me?\u201d</p><p>A broad smile spread across her face. Her eyes were so bright when she smiled. It was all he could do to not cup her face and kiss her. But he\u2019d take this slow. She\u2019d showed up with food, not propositions. Not yet.</p><p>He turned his attention to the fire, stoking it to life. He sensed her wandering toward the couch to study his stuff. Her presence was heavy in the room, and he felt her every pause, her every move at his back.</p><p>He mentally cataloged his d\u00e9cor. What would she make of it all? And his photos of Keri\u2014what would she think about those? It wasn\u2019t as though the walls were blanketed with them, but they were here and there. Tacked over his desk, a black and white photobooth strip, shots of them making silly faces. There was a framed photo in the hallway, too, Keri\u2019s formal headshot from the DA\u2019s office. He felt Sorrow stop to study it.</p><p>\u201cYour wife was beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cVery elegant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d He stood, wiping newsprint and ash from his hands. For the first time, thoughts of Keri weren\u2019t cold and sharp with grief, but had mellowed into something warmer and wiser, a melancholy. He\u2019d loved his wife, more than anything. Her memory would forever be a gift in his heart, him all the richer for having had her for even a short time. He thought of Keri, of her foibles\u2014the ones he\u2019d loved, and the ones that\u2019d annoyed him, too\u2014and he smiled to recall the lot of them. \u201cShe was a city girl, born and raised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCity girls must be pretty appealing.\u201d</p><p>He heard the subtext there\u2014he\u2019d need to tread carefully. \u201cMy wife was something else. But women from the city are just like women anywhere else...some are appealing, some not.\u201d</p><p>He walked across the room to stand at Sorrow\u2019s back. He studied Keri\u2019s photo, seeing it anew. Her severe black bob. Those dark eyes that once crackled with energy. She\u2019d narrow those eyes during cross-examinations to go in for the kill, and witnesses never knew what hit them.</p><p>She\u2019d been hard where Sorrow was soft, a razor-edged wit to Sorrow\u2019s bemused insightfulness.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss the city?\u201d Sorrow asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even have to think about that one. \u201cHonestly, no, I don\u2019t miss it one little bit.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow was silent, so silent he wondered if she held her breath. He sensed she wanted to hear more, needed more.</p><p>It was time to dredge his memories, to let this woman in. He took a deep breath. \u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s the city that took her from me. She was in a...an accident.\u201d He cleared his throat, gathering his emotions. He owed it to Keri to tell her story. \u201cI had no idea it\u2019d happened. It took them a while to ID her. To track me down. And the thing of it was, I\u2019d heard them talking about it over the scanner. Bus versus bike. One fatality.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d was all Sorrow said. There was nothing else to say, and she knew it.</p><p>His focus shifted, from the image of his wife to Sorrow\u2019s reflection in the glass. Her expression was drawn, pained. Sorrow was feeling his grief, opening her heart to him. She might\u2019ve been different from Keri, but she was no less extraordinary.</p><p>Billy wanted to open his heart in return, but he also wanted to put her at ease, so he shifted back to the original question. \u201cI always liked the country more than she did. We used to argue about it, over where to spend our vacations.\u201d He shook his head, remembering. \u201cKeri\u2019s idea of camping was staying at anything more downscale than the Marriott.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019d have loved the lodge,\u201d Sorrow said in a flat, deadpan tone.</p><p>\u201cSorrow,\u201d Billy whispered, chiding her. He put his hands on her shoulders and gently turned her to face him. \u201cI love the lodge.\u201d</p><p>Standing this close he saw the flecks of gold in her eyes. Her lashes were thick and brown. He imagined them fluttering closed during a kiss. His gaze shifted to her mouth. Her lips were parted, surprised at his touch.</p><p>The sight brought with it a revelation. He was alive again, and it was time to seize back his life. And that meant he would kiss Sorrow. Tonight.</p><p>Which meant he needed to steer her from these somber topics. \u201cCome sit by the fire,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse.</p> <p>She nodded, but the look she gave him was sad. Instead of sitting down, she wandered in front of the fireplace. Amber firelight cast dancing shadows on her face.</p><p>He read the question in her eyes. She\u2019d want to know if he was ready to move on.</p><p>She put words to her thoughts, and he had to credit her courage as she asked, \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever marry again?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to know if he was still in mourning. Was a person ever done mourning? The answer was complicated, but it was one his heart finally understood.</p><p>\u201cI will marry again,\u201d he said firmly. He\u2019d thought those words before, but now, for the first time, he truly felt them. \u201cIt\u2019s been over three years since her accident. She\u2019d want me to move on.\u201d For the first time, he felt the truth of those words.</p><p>Sully had been right. Keri\u2014tough, smart-as-a-whip Keri\u2014would have kicked his ass from beyond if she\u2019d caught him wasting one more night wallowing. \u201cShe\u2019d want me to find love again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut do you...can you...\u201d Sorrow was struggling for words.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find out.\u201d Billy cupped the back of her head and leaned down. And then he kissed her.</p><p>Twenty-six</p><p>Billy\u2019s strong arms were around her, and she felt herself pulled onto her toes, her heart soaring even higher than her body.</p><p>After spending so much time looking at him, it felt so good finally to feel him. She wrapped her arms around him, greedily touching the stubble of his jaw, stroking his hair, squeezing the thick muscles of arms and shoulders, savoring each texture, memorizing the size of him.</p><p>She felt his hardness straining against her already, pressing hot and insistent along her body, and a whimper escaped her throat. Her desire was immediate and consuming, an ache in her belly. She was mad with it.</p><p>For months, she\u2019d been kissing Damien, and it was a shock to be kissing someone else. Even though they\u2019d broken up, the newness, the revelation of this other man made her feel dirty and hot.</p><p>Because whatever she\u2019d fantasized about Billy, it hadn\u2019t been this. He was so gentle and kind in life, she\u2019d expected a gentle, kind kiss. But this...this kiss was anything but hesitant. He was demanding. Confident.</p> <p>And so big.</p><p>She felt his size as a visceral thing, his heat and strength imprinting along her body. She\u2019d known Billy was a large man\u2014he was broad and solid in his sheriff\u2019s uniform\u2014but when he\u2019d opened the door shirtless, she\u2019d had to force herself not to stare. The man was ripped, and her hands roved him, eagerly feeling what she\u2019d seen with her eyes. He was so firm and sure, and she felt so small in his arms. She felt safe.</p><p>She felt taken.</p><p>They kissed with desperation, and still it wasn\u2019t enough. She wanted Billy to take her, to take it all.</p><p>She\u2019d had questions for him, but she no longer remembered them. All she knew was the throbbing between her thighs, the tightness in her breasts. All she wanted was to leap into his arms, wrap her legs around him, and quell this urgency.</p><p>A timer sounded in the kitchen.</p><p>No no no.</p><p>Sorrow wanted to ignore it, wanted it to go away. She couldn\u2019t stop kissing him, not now. She did ignore it, and instead scraped her fingers along his scalp, twining his hair into her fists. Her heart pounded till she felt she might not catch her breath. She wanted him completely, wanted completion. She wanted Billy to kiss her forever.</p><p>But the timer continued to ring.</p><p>Finally, slowly, he parted from her and touched his forehead to hers. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>She shut her eyes, pained. Inhaling deeply, she pulled away. When their eyes met, they shared a slow smile\u2014it began as something wicked and naughty, like a shared secret, but as the timer continued to blare in the background, the moment grew more conspiratorial, until they were laughing. Stepping back, she slapped a hand to her forehead. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The potatoes might be done, but we\u2019re not.\u201d He wrapped an arm tight around her shoulders, walking her slowly into the kitchen. \u201cYou and I are far from done.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ease away from her, wouldn\u2019t let her go, and the feel of him, the sensation of being so coveted transformed something deep inside her. Sorrow wanted another kiss, and more than another kiss. She\u2019d show him what she was really made of.</p><p>When she\u2019d arrived and seen photos of his wife, it\u2019d scared her. Losing a spouse so young\u2014a person might never recover from a thing like that. Her first thought was, how could she ever compare to such a pretty, sophisticated, powerful woman?</p><p>But that kiss. He\u2019d kissed her, and instead of doubt, all she\u2019d tasted was hunger.</p><p>All through her dinner preparations, Sorrow\u2019s skin buzzed, sensing his eyes on her, feeling his occasional touches grazing along her shoulders, down her back, leaving trails of fire along her body. Her whole being was attuned to him. Every look between them, every move, charged.</p><p>If she were being honest, it was something that\u2019d started weeks ago, that night she\u2019d cooked for him for the first time. Their bond had been instant, and the sparks, too. Meeting in the kitchen like this had felt like a secret courtship. Getting to know Billy over homemade food and loaded glances, till one morning she\u2019d woken up to realize she was falling in love with him.</p><p>They had the intimacy, the connection. And now it was time to bring it to a different level. A level where she\u2019d get to see that bare chest again.</p><p>Slowly, she sliced the shallots. Using her shoulder, she pushed the hair from her eyes. \u201cToo bad we have to eat,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>He stepped close to sweep his hand along her neck, smoothing the hair from her face. \u201cA man needs his strength.\u201d</p><p>He repositioned himself behind her, until his body touched hers. The contact was light along her back, but she experienced it like a sizzling in her blood. His closeness weakened her knees, and she leaned on the counter for support.</p><p>His arm grazed hers as he reached over her to grab a couple of tomatoes. \u201cCan I chop these for you?\u201d</p><p>At that moment, she could think of a hundred things she wanted him to do. Chopping was at the bottom of that list. But instead she said, \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Billy made quick work of the tomatoes, and seeing there was no obvious job for him to do, he leaned against the counter, bringing all his attention to bear on her. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here. What did I do to deserve this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like cooking for you.\u201d She was rubbing her herb mixture into the lamb, but spared a glance up and caught his eyes raking over her shirt. His gaze was heavy, and a bolt of desire speared her through.</p><p>\u201cI was about to say I couldn\u2019t think of anything better than your cooking. But,\u201d he said, in a voice thick with innuendo, \u201cI think I could.\u201d</p><p>His banter was sexy, and it made her feel sexy. \u201cFood first,\u201d she chided.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m so famished,\u201d he told her in a rasp, \u201cor I wouldn\u2019t let you finish.\u201d</p><p>She put the lamb in the broiler and washed her hands. \u201cJust a few more minutes now.\u201d</p><p>He walked up behind her and ran his hands down her arms, threading her damp fingers with his. \u201cI\u2019m going to take more than a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>The aroma of roasting lamb filled the room, and he breathed it in, exhaling with a satisfied moan that reverberated through her body. \u201cHow did they spare you at the tavern? Your father\u2019s a fool not to let you cook every night.\u201d</p><p>She loved his focus on her, loved the feeling of being seen and understood. And she loved that\u2014with the possible exception of her sister\u2014nobody had any idea where she was. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know where I am,\u201d she said. In some ways, she had no idea where she was\u2014she felt like she was spinning out of control, falling fast.</p><p>\u201cTheir loss, my gain,\u201d he said. \u201cYour dad is lucky you don\u2019t leave the tavern and get a professional chef\u2019s job.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he mimicked affectionately and turned her to face him. \u201cWhat do you mean, nah?\u201d</p><p>She thought of the lodge, the tavern, her parents...all the responsibilities that tethered her in place. \u201cMy time has passed.\u201d</p><p>He traced her brow to sweep her hair behind one ear, his gesture softening the expression of wry humor on his face. \u201cWhat on earth do you mean, your time has passed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d She crumpled her face into a half smile. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for me to do anything new like that.\u201d</p><p>His face became dead serious. \u201cYou\u2019re young, and you can do whatever you set your mind to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck.\u201d She paused, expecting him to speak, but he waited as though he were hanging on her every word, and so she continued, \u201cThink about it. How am I supposed to follow any dreams from here? Laura and BJ were the ones who got free of this place. They left me to run it all by myself.\u201d Though abandoned would\u2019ve been a better word for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The timer sounded, and putting on the oven mitt, he pulled the pan out himself. \u201cYou\u2019re cooking one night a week at the tavern\u2014that\u2019s a start. We\u2019ll convince your dad to up it to two, then three.\u201d</p><p>She molded aluminum foil into a tent over the lamb. \u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, but then who\u2019ll do my job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround the lodge? Get Laura to help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d She smirked. Even if she could get over her resentments, she still hadn\u2019t gotten past the fact that her sister\u2019s attempts at \u201chelp\u201d felt like an intrusion. Around the lodge, planning the festival\u2014it was like Laura had something to prove. That she had more experience, that she knew better. That she was smarter, older, superior.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to ask people for help. You need to make people help.\u201d He popped a prosciutto-wrapped melon ball into his mouth, sighing with pleasure. \u201cHell, I\u2019ll help, if it gives you time to come up with more food like this.\u201d</p><p>She had to laugh at that. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet how you encourage me. My cooking is a dream, but it\u2019s a pipe dream, Billy. I\u2019ll never get help from Laura. Not any help I want, at any rate. I don\u2019t even get why she\u2019s here or for how long.\u201d</p><p>His gaze bored into her. \u201cSomething\u2019s been nagging me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d She looked away. How had her intended seduction turned into this?</p> <p>He took her chin and tilted her face up to his. \u201cI need you around me more, Sorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...you do?\u201d She\u2019d been ready to go on the defensive, and his bold statement had thrown her. Stolen her breath.</p><p>\u201cI do. Why do you think I\u2019ve been hanging around that lodge? It was for glimpses of you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart soared till she thought her smile might split her face in two. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. But you\u2019re so busy, and there was Damon.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cDamien.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever his name is.\u201d He shrugged playfully, barely concealing his smile. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, I want to take you on a real date. You deserve the best. But you\u2019re always running circles around that damned lodge. I hate the thought of you dealing with everything. Repairs, budget, food, staff, and the cleaning? It\u2019s too much. We\u2019re hiring you a cleaning service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cleaning service?\u201d It was the last thing she\u2019d expected to hear. She shook her head doubtfully. \u201cIn Sierra Falls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find one for you. You won\u2019t even have to think about it.\u201d</p><p>The prospect tickled her. But she was a realist. \u201cNot possible,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dad would have a conniption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad can deal with it.\u201d The steel in Billy\u2019s tone gave her pause. \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he added. \u201cIf Bear gives you any trouble, tell him I\u2019ll cite him for child endangerment. Forget that, I\u2019ll tell him myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, I get it.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI get your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to demand more help from your family. What do you have to lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d She\u2019d been accepting Damien\u2019s sporadic favors for months, so why was she afraid to ask for help from the people she cared for most? She was thoughtful as she assembled their dinner on plates. \u201cAll right then. What the hell?\u201d</p> <p>Her next thought, one that remained unspoken, was why hadn\u2019t Damien ever helped her get to that conclusion? How was it this new sheriff had come into her life, managing to turn it\u2014and her\u2014upside down in such a short time?</p><p>She raised a brow, feeling saucy. \u201cIf you help me, I\u2019ll of course need to figure out a way to express my gratitude.\u201d For the first time, she felt in control, felt how powerful she was in her femininity. She decided she\u2019d make Billy wait, until he was crazy with wanting. She wouldn\u2019t spend the night. Not tonight. But she knew it\u2019d be soon. Her skin pulled tight at the thought, the blood pounding hot, just beneath the surface. \u201cI\u2019ll try to make your efforts worth your while.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, expecting to see humor on his face, but Billy\u2019s eyes were dark, pinned on her. She sucked in a breath, his intensity staggering. He was kind and thoughtful. But he was also a man\u2019s man, desiring and demanding, and that was what she read in his gaze now.</p><p>Her pulse kicked as some essential part of her wakened to life. Billy Preston was a lawman, but he kissed like an outlaw. She was desperate to discover just how he went about other things, too.</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>Marlene assembled her guests in the sitting room. Facing west, it was the brightest and warmest spot in the house and had a comfortable seating area with antique occasional tables that made serving tea and finger sandwiches convenient.</p><p>It was also her mother\u2019s favorite spot. And though the women had gathered to discuss historical society business, it was what to do about Ma that weighed most heavily on Marlene\u2019s mind.</p><p>Emerald was having an off day, staring silently, and it worried Marlene. Usually, her mother looked more present, like she was in there somewhere, wearing an expression that was bland but pleasant. But not today. Today Ma just sat, blankly.</p><p>Marlene had made her mother\u2019s favorite French toast, played her old music, and shepherded her into the TV room to watch one of her programs, but none of it had worked. Nothing engaged her.</p><p>Sorrow came to stand beside her, and Marlene remembered herself. She had guests who needed her attention. \u201cMake yourselves at home,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks for having us.\u201d Sorrow took off her hat and fluffed her hair, and it crackled with static.</p><p>\u201cI thought a change of scenery would do us all good,\u201d Marlene said. Truth was, they had business to tend to, and she\u2019d wanted to meet on neutral ground. Though with the tension that flared between the two Bailey girls, sometimes it seemed that not even Switzerland would be neutral enough.</p><p>Her eyes returned to her mother, sitting like a statue in the corner. Bailey family tension aside, she was happy not having to shoehorn three elderly ladies into that blasted pickup.</p><p>Sorrow caught her line of sight\u2014the change in Ma\u2019s condition would soon be obvious to everyone, if it wasn\u2019t already. She gave Marlene\u2019s shoulder a comforting squeeze. \u201cI swear, this is the prettiest room. So cozy, especially with all that snow outside.\u201d</p><p>She was a sweet girl, that Sorrow. Marlene gave her a heartfelt smile. Having a house full of women might be just the thing to take her mind off her troubles.</p><p>\u201cSnow?\u201d Laura flopped down on one of the wing chairs, stretching her feet in front of her. \u201cGray slush, you mean. I am so over this weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spring festival will be here before we know it,\u201d Edith said.</p><p>Sorrow cringed and went to the buffet. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me. There\u2019s too much to do. I need food first.\u201d</p><p>Marlene had assembled their favorites\u2014sandwiches made with olives and cream cheese, pimento spread on triangles of thin white bread, mint Milano cookies, and those crispy chocolate tubes Aunt Pearl loved.</p><p>\u201cOh, yum,\u201d Sorrow said, grabbing a plate. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we need to meet here more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat town hall is too chilly.\u201d Pearl buttoned up her cardigan, as if the mere recollection made her cold, even though the gas fireplace had the sitting room downright balmy. \u201cAnd Bear\u2019s restaurant can be so gusty.\u201d</p><p>Bear was a tightwad when it came to his heating bill. But then she smiled to herself, thinking how she never felt cold when that Sully was around.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a treat to get away from the tavern for the afternoon,\u201d Edith agreed, ignoring the jab against her family business.</p><p>\u201cTotally good to get away.\u201d Laura caught her sister\u2019s eye. \u201cDid you see Dad this morning?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow laughed. \u201cThe man was on a rampage.\u201d</p><p>That tidbit engaged Ruby\u2019s attention at once. \u201cWhy was your father on a rampage?\u201d</p><p>A broad smile lit Edith\u2019s face. \u201cWe got a letter from my boy today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news, but...\u201d Marlene frowned at the nonsensical connection. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why is Bear in a sour mood if you heard from BJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHearing from him always does it,\u201d Sorrow said.</p><p>\u201cThank God he hasn\u2019t figured out how to Skype BJ over in Afghanistan,\u201d Laura joked. \u201cThat\u2019d really put Dad over the edge.\u201d</p><p>The sisters shared an amused, understanding look. It was good to see them getting along. Hearing from Bear Junior sure had put the Bailey women in a good mood. But Bear\u2019s inexplicable mood swings remained a mystery. \u201cI still don\u2019t see why it should make him so crotchety,\u201d she said.</p><p>Laura raised a brow. \u201cYou mean more crotchety than usual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBJ is spending more time near the front lines,\u201d Sorrow explained. \u201cHis unit\u2019s in Kabul now. I think it worries Dad.\u201d</p><p>Laura grew serious. \u201cHe\u2019s doing stuff like air reconnaissance and troop transport in that giant helicopter of his.\u201d</p><p>The barrage of military words put Marlene in mind of Tom Sullivan. He\u2019d shown Craig some of his Vietnam memorabilia. Not that Sully had told her about it\u2014the man wasn\u2019t exactly a big talker, and she\u2019d had to hear the report from her grandson. According to Craig, Sully had a stack of medals.</p><p>She had no idea he\u2019d been such a hero.</p><p>Apparently, there were other things in his collection, too. A few photos, something called a boonie hat\u2014whatever that was\u2014and his dress uniform. Her mind drifted. The man kept himself in great shape\u2014she bet he could still fit himself into that uniform.</p><p>Marlene gave a shake to her head, clearing those thoughts. They were talking about BJ\u2019s letter, not aging retired officers.</p><p>She began to pour the women tea from her great-granny\u2019s old silver service. \u201cWell, I\u2019d just think Bear would be thrilled to hear from the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was,\u201d Edith assured her brightly. \u201cAbsolutely thrilled.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gave her friend a probing look, though what she wanted to do was demand what gave Bear the right to be such a sourpuss. And Edith enabled it, too\u2014she acted like Bear\u2019s chief apologist. They had a curious relationship, those two. Marlene had known the Bailey family for decades, and she suspected more happened behind closed doors than people knew. Bear acted, well, like a bear, but she guessed it was really Edith who called the shots in her quiet way.</p><p>Edith must\u2019ve sensed Marlene\u2019s opinion, because she added, \u201cHe lives to get those letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Sorrow sat in the window seat, balancing her plate on her knees. \u201cHe\u2019s practically memorized this one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I just think it\u2019s the strangest thing,\u201d Ruby said, trundling over to the buffet.</p><p>Pearl was right behind her. \u201cIf he misses the boy so much, he certainly has a strange way of showing it.\u201d</p><p>Judgment was thick in the women\u2019s voices, but nobody took issue. Disapproval was a downright hobby for the Kidd sisters, and everyone was used to it.</p><p>Marlene eyed her aunts as they assembled their food, wondering how different their lives might\u2019ve been if they\u2019d married, had children, and gotten a taste of how difficult the whole business was. She wagered they wouldn\u2019t have so much spare time in which to pass judgment.</p><p>Edith sighed. \u201cBear Senior is just...frustrated. He wishes he could do more\u2014we all do. He hates that we\u2019re not in more contact with our boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d Sorrow said with a shake of her head. \u201cDad just wishes he could put on a uniform and go fight with him.\u201d</p><p>Edith gave a doting smile. \u201cMy husband is a man of action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAction?\u201d Laura blew on her tea, stirring in three packets of Sweet\u2019N Low. \u201cA man of temper is more like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he should just say a little prayer when he feels his temper coming on,\u201d Ruby said definitively, though she was mostly focused on assembling her selection of goodies.</p><p>Laura eyed the older woman\u2019s plate. \u201cHow on earth do you stay so thin?\u201d She caught Sorrow\u2019s eye and muttered, \u201cMaybe I should start praying more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s genes, dear.\u201d Pearl settled herself in the armchair and upped her voice a notch to address her ailing sister. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Emerald? We Kidd girls have good genes.\u201d</p> <p>Marlene went to the table to make a plate of food for her mother. She saw that Laura still had only a cup of tea. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201d</p><p>Laura pulled an apple from her bag. \u201cI\u2019m eating. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn apple\u2019s not eating,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cThough it does look good.\u201d She picked at her cucumber sandwich. \u201cI cannot wait till winter\u2019s over\u2014produce has really been sucking lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBerries will be in season soon,\u201d Ruby said cheerfully.</p><p>Marlene pulled a table over to her mother\u2019s chair and put a plate of sandwiches and cookies before her. Patting her shoulder, she prompted in a clear voice, \u201cTime to eat, Ma. I\u2019ve got your favorites.\u201d</p><p>Emerald looked at the plate, and Marlene peered hard, anxious to see something flicker in the woman\u2019s eyes. But still, there was just that horrible, devastating blankness.</p><p>Laura glanced at the clock on her cell phone, looking impatient. \u201cWe should get this show on the road.\u201d She pulled a manila folder from her bag. \u201cSo, for the festival, I went ahead and created a marketing plan. Nothing major, just some milestones that we\u2019ll need to meet in the next few weeks, a tentative schedule of events, and a list of tasks and who they should be delegated to.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at her, shell-shocked expressions all around.</p> <p>Laura shrugged. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep last night.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow held up a finger as she finished chewing, and the room seemed to hold its breath. \u201cWe need to learn more about her relationship with Buck Larsen before we finish planning. Like, did he ever return to Sierra Falls? That sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Laura crunched her apple. \u201cI still think we need a list of tasks and owners. There\u2019s so much more to do than just arranging the annual bake sale. Like, we should compile a program. We could pull together some good Sorrow Crabtree quotes, add some old-timey photos. It\u2019s easy to get a book like that printed up these days, and then we could sell it at the festival.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow gaped at her sister, and Marlene braced. Laura was taking charge, and it was only a matter of time before the tension ignited between the two. But Sorrow surprised the room when she said, \u201cLaura, that is an awesome idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Marlene agreed quickly. Anxious to keep the meeting so pleasantly civil, she steered them in a safe direction\u2014one that didn\u2019t involve words like publicity or strategies. \u201cBut Edith tells me you haven\u2019t finished reading the letters yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing.\u201d Sorrow flipped through them thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ve tried. But there are a bunch of passages I can\u2019t make sense of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat old-timey handwriting is a...\u201d\u2014Laura cut herself off, seeing Sorrow\u2019s glance that silently warned language\u2014\u201cit\u2019s a real pain in the tuckus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you ladies come in,\u201d Edith said, addressing the older women.</p><p>Ruby pulled a lap blanket from the arm of her chair and draped it over her legs. \u201cWe\u2019re not that old-timey, dear.\u201d</p><p>Pearl poo-pooed her. \u201cYou know what they mean.\u201d She turned to Sorrow. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you read them, dear, then we can help make out the handwriting when you get stuck.\u201d</p><p>They spent the next hour enthralled, as Sorrow read her thrice-great-grandmother\u2019s letters. It was impossible for Marlene to hear the woman\u2019s words and not feel their universal truth. Sorrow Crabtree had been a woman who dreamed of greater things, stuck in a situation with no escape.</p><p>Sorrow stopped cold, calling Marlene back into the moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, dear?\u201d Edith asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d Sorrow flipped the pages back and forth. \u201cThese are out of order.\u201d</p><p>Laura frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow shuffled through some more, then just dropped on her knees to the floor, spreading out all the pages. \u201cOkay, remember this gem? \u2018My Mama told me to live life for me. To follow my heart and love my kin and my God. And I\u2019m going to do that, Buck. Just me and our boy. With or without you.\u2019 That was dated 1851.\u201d She set it aside.</p><p>\u201cNow check this out. We read this one first\u2014remember? Where she went on and on about the dance hall and making a life for herself? At the end, she wrote, \u2018I\u2019ve got a babe in my belly.\u2019 We\u2019d thought it was from that same time period. But it\u2019s not.\u201d Sorrow flipped through, matching page numbers and connecting sentences. \u201cThis one is dated 1853.\u201d</p><p>The women gasped.</p><p>\u201cShe had another baby,\u201d Edith said, marveling.</p><p>Pearl clucked. \u201cThat woman\u2019s luck was poor from the day she was born.\u201d</p><p>Marlene frowned at her. \u201cSome see a baby as a blessing, Aunt Pearl.\u201d</p><p>Laura plopped onto the floor next to Sorrow, holding out her hand. \u201cLet me see that.\u201d For once, Sorrow didn\u2019t hesitate and just handed over the pages without question, and Laura read for a moment. \u201cWow. You\u2019re right. Check this out, \u2018He moves in my belly. A boy, like your beautiful son. I\u2019ll raise them both to be good men.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Edith tilted her head, peering at the pages scattered across the floor. \u201cWas Buck the father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sorrow said, \u201cBuck Larsen never returned. There must\u2019ve been another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a fast woman,\u201d Ruby said, shaking her head.</p><p>Pearl grunted her disapproval. \u201cTwo fathers, no husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA life of toil and fatherless babies,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cThat\u2019s what being a fast woman brings you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Marlene said. She was tired of this conversation. Tired of what they implied about her very own mother.</p><p>But Pearl wasn\u2019t done. She pursed her lips. \u201cI wonder if it runs in the blood?\u201d</p><p>Laura rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s us. We Baileys of the spoiled blood.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow shot Pearl an impatient look. \u201cWho says she was fast? If she had another baby, maybe it means it got better for her. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a fatherless baby, but a secret love affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d Laura said, trying to concentrate. She grumbled, \u201cHow did you read this, Sorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she say?\u201d asked Edith impatiently.</p><p>\u201cGive me a second,\u201d Laura said. \u201cHandsome...first sight...blah blah. Okay, here it is. This must be the baby\u2019s father: \u2018My Silas is an angel. As dependable as God\u2019s love, he comes to town once a month, with letters in his bag and love in his heart.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Sorrow shrieked. \u201cShe was in love with the mailman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose guys were actually pretty macho,\u201d Laura said. \u201cSnowshoeing all over the wilderness. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>Edith\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cFirst sight...angel...When we read it before, I didn\u2019t really get it. I\u2019d thought it had something to do with the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all did,\u201d Sorrow said.</p><p>Marlene leaned forward in her seat. \u201cAnd you\u2019re sure the date is correct? 1853?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead more, read more.\u201d Sorrow waved her sister on.</p><p>Laura found her place on the page. \u201cOkay, here we go. \u2018All\u2019s I need is a simple man. I thought I needed a man like you. But your promises are just as empty as that fancy suit you wear.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Laura read on, but Marlene stopped paying attention. Those words had stuck in her craw.</p><p>She thought about her own situation\u2014had she been wasting time on the wrong things? Had she been chasing men in suits with their meaningless boats and convertibles, when what she really needed was a man whose humble exterior held a heart filled with love? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If she were being honest, she\u2019d always suspected there was more. She\u2019d had a husband who was successful. She\u2019d had a nice house. Shopping jaunts to Reno and a new designer coat every September. She\u2019d devoted her life to standing by her man. But what had it gotten her?</p><p>She had her children, of course. And she\u2019d do it all over again to have those four wonderful boys she\u2019d raised into good and caring men. The love she held for them was fierce.</p><p>But what of her feelings for her ex-husband? After he took off, she\u2019d begun to doubt herself. She often felt angry at being left holding the bag. But had she ever genuinely missed him?</p> <p>Marlene looked at the three Kidd women and noted with a pang how her mother hadn\u2019t eaten, hadn\u2019t even moved. She just sat, not even looking out the window, with that same blankness in her eyes. Life marched on. One day these women would have passed and then Marlene would...what?</p><p>Everyone spoke at once, startling Marlene, and she tuned back in.</p><p>\u201cYou have to finish,\u201d Sorrow was demanding.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The only things...the things...\u2019\u201d Laura shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s no good. I can\u2019t do it. This crazy handwriting is killing me.\u201d</p><p>Pearl held out a quaking hand. \u201cLet me see it, dear.\u201d She slowly donned her glasses, kept on a beaded chain around her neck, and concentrated on the letter. After a silent moment, her face lit with understanding. \u201cAh! It says, \u2018The only things you regret in this life are the risks you don\u2019t take.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Marlene felt herself pale. It was as though Sorrow Crabtree had reached across the generations to deliver this message just to her.</p><p>Her life was all about roads not taken. She\u2019d spent her life caring for other people, first her husband, then her sons, and now her aunts and mother. Hers had always been the responsible choices\u2014the sorts of choices where she\u2019d had no choice. Her life had held no room for risk.</p><p>Sorrow\u2019s hand was warm on her suddenly chilled shoulder. \u201cYou okay, Marlene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Pasting a smile on her face, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s keep reading. We\u2019ve been looking forward to it.\u201d She cut her eyes back to her mother. Maybe Ma was in there somewhere to enjoy it, too.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s life had been all risk. Leaving home, meeting a man, and returning heavy with child. Why had Marlene never asked her more about it? Asked her mother the hard questions. Ma sat there, across the room, empty as the prettiest of seashells, the one woman Marlene wished more than anything could give her wisdom.</p><p>Folks thought just because a family member was still alive meant there was no cause for grief. But Marlene knew different\u2014Marlene grieved her living mother every day.</p> <p>Twenty-eight</p><p>Sorrow\u2019s cell buzzed, and she had to juggle a lid, a ladle, layers of apron, and the rag she had tucked at her waist to reach it. It was worth it, seeing who the caller was.</p><p>\u201cBilly, hey.\u201d She didn\u2019t even try to mask the relief in her voice. \u201cYou coming by soon? It\u2019s Ladies\u2019 Night,\u201d she added in a teasing voice. Tuesday was her night to cook at the tavern, and her dad had dubbed the evening with the silliest name imaginable. But she was heeding Billy\u2019s advice and taking her opportunities where she could get them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m calling.\u201d</p><p>His somber voice alerted her at once. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to work a double shift,\u201d he said. \u201cMarshall was hit with the flu\u2014the guy looks like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much crime can there be in Sierra Falls? Can\u2019t you just let people speed for one night?\u201d</p><p>His laugh was gentle. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t. But I\u2019ll be thinking of you. Wish I were there to help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish you were, too\u2014I\u2019m using a Dutch oven that, I swear, weighs about a thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you end up making? The chicken or the pork loin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken. Coq au Vin to be exact.\u201d Her sauce needed thickening, and she was stirring madly. \u201cIf I can get my roux to cooperate. It\u2019s broken twice already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned roux,\u201d he said in a perfect deadpan.</p><p>She laughed. She missed him. They\u2019d had a few kisses, and already she couldn\u2019t wait for more. \u201cI miss you.\u201d The words had slipped out, and she instantly knew a twinge of regret. They\u2019d kissed, but she didn\u2019t know how he really felt. She suspected he was dealing with a lot of emotional baggage, and she needed to play it cool.</p><p>But he surprised her by saying, \u201cI miss you, too.\u201d There was real affection in his voice, and it made everything okay. \u201cSave me some,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll stop by later. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d just finished searing the meat and had put it into the oven to braise when she sensed a hubbub in the tavern. Sorrow pulled off the red bandanna she wore in lieu of a hairnet, wiped her brow, and pushed through the swinging door.</p><p>\u201cI swear, Helen,\u201d she said as she pushed through the swinging door. \u201cI don\u2019t know how Sully does it. I am roasting in there. Could you please get me\u201d\u2014she spotted Damien and his parents settling into a window booth\u2014\u201csome ice water,\u201d she finished lamely.</p><p>Dabney and Phoebe Simmons\u2014what were they doing there? If Damien was the prince of Sierra Falls, it was because his parents were its nobility. They were moneyed and sophisticated, and she wished she could hate them for it, but they also happened to be two of the kindest, most gracious people she\u2019d ever met.</p><p>Dabney had been especially sweet every time he\u2019d seen her, always joking how Sorrow needed to make his boy an honest man. It was like he was actually lobbying Damien to propose to her. She never could figure it, except to guess that Damien had been a hell-raiser as a kid and that maybe he\u2019d mellowed a bit under her influence.</p><p>They\u2019d have found out about the breakup by now. Had Damien sent them to convince her to get back together with him? She dreaded the conversation. Dreaded feeling like she\u2019d hurt not just Damien but his parents, too.</p><p>As Helen handed her a big tumbler of water, she sang under her breath, \u201cOh yes, it\u2019s ladies\u2019 night, and you\u2019re feeling right.\u201d She made a little snorting laughing sound that Sorrow didn\u2019t feel was entirely kind.</p><p>She glared at the bartender over the lip of the glass as she chugged and then put it down hard. \u201cIf you\u2019re quoting the song, I think it\u2019s \u2018and the feeling\u2019s right.\u2019 And thanks for that. The only thing I needed more than seeing Damien\u2019s family was a Kool &amp; The Gang song stuck in my head.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe and Dabney were kibitzing over the menu. Her mind scrambled for excuses, but it was no good. The chicken was in the oven\u2014there would be no better time for her to go say hi.</p><p>\u201cNeed something stronger?\u201d Helen whispered.</p><p>She had a joke on her lips when she met the bartender\u2019s eyes but kept her mouth shut when she saw that Helen was serious. Drinking might\u2019ve been how the other woman dealt with her problems, but that wasn\u2019t how Sorrow rolled.</p><p>Still, the woman was just trying to be kind, and there was genuine gratitude in Sorrow\u2019s voice when she said, \u201cNo thanks, Helen. No drinks. I\u2019ve got too long a night ahead of me.\u201d</p><p>She was girding herself to approach and say her hellos when Damien beat her to it.</p><p>\u201cHeya, Bailey.\u201d He sauntered over to the bar, giving her a confident smile. Apparently, not even a breakup could get Damien down. Assuming he\u2019d finally accepted that they\u2019d broken up, which she didn\u2019t entirely believe. He wasn\u2019t the sort of guy to give up easily\u2014showing up with a smiling face and his parents in tow had to be part of a master plan.</p><p>He was looking mighty fine, as always, and Sorrow gave herself a moment to study her own reaction to him. She was pleased to realize she didn\u2019t feel a darned thing\u2014not a moment\u2019s regret, nor one iota of desire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking good,\u201d he told her, echoing her own thoughts. \u201cCooking agrees with you.\u201d</p><p>She took the compliment for what it was and gave him a grateful smile. \u201cNothing like a hot, stuffy kitchen to put color in the cheeks.\u201d She and Damien weren\u2019t exactly going to be best chums, but he was a good guy, and maybe someday they\u2019d get back to where they\u2019d begun, as casual friends.</p><p>He gestured to the door. \u201cHey, your bear box is open.\u201d Everyone in the Sierras kept their trash in a bear box, lest they summon a several-hundred-pound scavenging visitor. \u201cI tried to shut it, but it looks like the latch is broken. If you have some tools, I could take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I got it,\u201d she said, knowing she absolutely could not ask him to help her. She didn\u2019t want him to think they were slipping back into their old ways. And besides, she was perfectly capable of tending to her own bear box.</p><p>She went outside, and sure enough the door was swinging on its hinges. Not many bears this time of year, but the last thing she wanted was to awaken some hungry brute out of hibernation. Leaning her shoulder into it, she tried to close the latch, but Damien was right\u2014it swung back open, broken.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any tools, wasn\u2019t wearing gloves, and had two Dutch ovens\u2019 worth of Coq au Vin going. Now was not the time to deal with this, and she made a mental note to take care of the problem tomorrow.</p><p>She went back inside, and annoyance needled her. Everyone was in the kitchen, dragged back by her father who insisted on showing off their new freezer to the Simmons family.</p><p>Frustration joined annoyance\u2014she had a ton yet to do. There was no time to give people the grand tour. She caught her mom\u2019s eye and gave her a pleading look, but Edith just shrugged as if to say what can you do?</p><p>It was true\u2014there was no stopping Dad once he got going. He was droning on, clearly trying to make himself sound important by spouting an array of ridiculous product descriptions\u2014gaskets and cam-lifts, solid door reach-in, electro-polished shelves\u2014but there wasn\u2019t one iota of judgment on Dabney\u2019s or Phoebe\u2019s face.</p><p>She walked up behind Damien\u2019s mom and gave her shoulder a grateful squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s a freezer all right,\u201d Sorrow whispered, rolling her eyes. \u201cNot like it\u2019s going to feed any starving orphans or anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her dad stopped midsentence, the light in his eyes dimmed. Mom shot her a disappointed look, and she instantly felt ashamed. Bad daughter.</p><p>\u201cVery impressive,\u201d Dabney said, saving the day. Rich, landowning, and in possession of a timber business that employed a goodly number of Sierra Falls townspeople, he was the town\u2019s resident benefactor. Dabney was something of a silver fox, too, in his convertible Jaguar and Italian driving loafers. \u201cDamien tells me you got yourself quite a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you have the sheriff to thank for it.\u201d Phoebe caught her eye and gave her a sad smile. Her next words were whispered for her ears alone. \u201cHe\u2019d best be as good as he sounds, Sorrow. You were supposed to marry my Damien, you know.\u201d</p> <p>But her husband had overheard. Dabney came over and wrapped an arm around Sorrow. \u201cIf that man doesn\u2019t treat you right, I\u2019ll have to go over there with a shotgun and see that he does.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, relieved that it was out in the open. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I mean...we had one date, that wasn\u2019t even really a date, and...\u201d</p><p>A trickle of black smoke was the only warning they got. The oven door jumped as a fireball exploded to life, a boom followed by a raging, roaring blaze.</p><p>The kitchen exploded with screams. She felt a body pummel into hers. It was Damien, shielding her body with his.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the kitchen,\u201d he yelled. Turning to his father, he shouted, \u201cGet them out of the kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>Edith pulled the faucet hose from the sink, and Damien pushed away from Sorrow to grab the woman\u2019s hand. \u201cNo! No water!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, boy?\u201d Bear muscled across the room, grabbing for the faucet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s grease.\u201d Flames licked up the back wall, the fire no longer contained in the oven. Damien squinted at the blaze, covering his nose and mouth with his hand, and barked out orders. \u201cCall 911. Sorrow, fire extinguisher.\u201d</p><p>Everyone fled the kitchen, and Sorrow was across the room and back in an instant with the extinguisher. Damien snatched it from her and sprayed. Black smoke filled the kitchen as the fire alarm keened shrilly.</p><p>Coughs racked her, and Damien shot her an angry look. \u201cGet out of here.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Struggling for breath, she grabbed their restaurant-sized bag of baking soda, but by that time the fire was out. She dumped it on the stovetop anyway, her body shaking with adrenaline.</p> <p>Damien scooped her in his arms and half walked, half carried her to the dining area. They saw everyone standing in a cluster outside, shivering and talking a blue streak. He stopped her. \u201cI need a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d Through the window, her dad\u2019s expression was as black as the smoke had been. \u201cGuess who\u2019s going to get the blame for this.\u201d</p><p>Damien tipped her chin to face him. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d He smudged soot from her cheek. \u201cSee, I\u2019m good to have around, right?\u201d</p><p>She went on alert\u2014she\u2019d need to tread carefully here. \u201cI never said you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Damien\u2019s voice was husky as he slowly leaned down, bringing his face to hers. \u201cSo can I get you to come to your senses?\u201d</p><p>Apparently he hadn\u2019t gotten the original message after all. Sorrow put a gentle hand on his chest and stepped back. \u201cDamien, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s still over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Bailey. You know we\u2019re good together.\u201d He chucked her chin, as though she were being willingly unruly. \u201cYou need me, huh? Just a little?\u201d His voice was teasing and light, and he wore his trademark grin, but now she saw how it masked something\u2014Damien Simmons wasn\u2019t as confident as he made himself appear.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d she said. \u201cAs my friend.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes shuttered. \u201cYou\u2019ve already hooked up with Billy, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHooked up?\u201d She prayed her voice hadn\u2019t squeaked.</p><p>As though in answer, Billy stormed through the door. The lights on his SUV were a red and blue strobe flashing on the tavern walls. His gaze went from Sorrow, to Damien, to Damien\u2019s hands on her shoulders.</p><p>At that moment, the sheriff looked eager to address Damien\u2019s question with his fists.</p><p>Twenty-nine</p><p>When the call went out over the radio\u2014fire at the Thirsty Bear Tavern\u2014fear exploded in Billy\u2019s chest. A horrific picture came to him\u2014a bloodied body lying in the dirt, lovely limbs broken and twisted. His heart pounded, so hard he felt it slamming in his throat, choking him. Because, instead of seeing Keri\u2019s face like all those other times, this time he saw Sorrow\u2019s.</p><p>He\u2019d suspected the depth of his feelings for her, but such a blast of panic and longing galvanized those feelings, illuminating the truth as bright as a lighting flash. He loved her.</p><p>He sped dangerously fast, beating the volunteer fire department to the punch. He had to get to her. They\u2019d called only for the fire truck, not the ambulance, but he had to see for himself that she was safe.</p><p>It was clear now. Someone was terrorizing the Bailey family. She was in danger\u2014they all were. If a fire didn\u2019t make Bear see the truth, he didn\u2019t know what would.</p><p>But when he charged in and found Sorrow\u2019s ex holding her, fear turned to fury.</p><p>He wanted to tear the guy\u2019s hands off her. Wanted to scoop her up and carry her from harm, away from this other man. He had to take her and have her to himself, someplace safe where he\u2019d peel off every layer of her clothing to make sure every inch of her was unharmed.</p><p>Urgency boiled his blood, so powerful the desire to show Sorrow how much he wanted her, needed her. She\u2019d snuck up on him, breathed life back into him, until the urge to tell her he loved her blinded him to all else.</p><p>It took everything he had to measure his step. He was in uniform, after all.</p><p>He flexed his hands\u2014he would not physically remove this other man\u2014but to his tremendous relief, Sorrow pushed from Damien and flew into his arms.</p><p>He wrapped himself around her, running his hands over her hair, along her back, up her sides. Let people think what they would. He had to check for himself that she was whole. His heart was thundering so hard, he felt certain she must\u2019ve felt it reverberate through her own chest. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>At her weak nod, he pulled her closer. He met Damien\u2019s eye. It was an adolescent thing to do, this urge to claim his woman, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. He met Damien\u2019s scowl with satisfaction, pulled her closer, nestled her head beneath his hand. Mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Billy demanded.</p><p>The door blew open, and Bear repeated the question, though more colorfully. \u201cWhat in the goddamn hell happened in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrease fire,\u201d Damien said. His expression was remote now. He was the sort of guy who\u2019d need to save face at all costs.</p><p>Bear glared at his daughter. \u201cI knew your cooking was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>She tried to push from Billy, and though he loosened his arms, he refused to lose contact altogether. He would not let her face this alone.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d she said. He heard the faintest tremble in her voice, and it nearly broke his heart. \u201cGrease fires happen all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in my restaurant.\u201d</p><p>Billy cut the man off. It had been just one coincidence too many around the Bailey place. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this was an accident.\u201d</p><p>The SFFD fire chief, Mike Haskell, burst in.</p><p>Damien spoke up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mike. Sorrow and I put it out.\u201d</p><p>Billy was anxious to hear that story. He gave Damien a grudging nod of thanks.</p><p>Mike sniffed the air. \u201cTrying to burn down the place, Bear?\u201d</p><p>The fire chief\u2019s good humor did nothing to dispel Bear\u2019s glowering. \u201cNo, but my daughter is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d Sorrow turned to Billy, a pleading look in her eyes. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>He ran the facts through his head. He knew Sorrow, and he knew Sully, too. They weren\u2019t careless. He\u2019d seen one dangerous incident too many around the Big Bear Lodge and Thirsty Bear Tavern.</p><p>\u201cSorrow\u2019s right,\u201d Billy said emphatically. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d From the corner of his eye, he saw Scott Jessup pull into the lot in the old Parks Department Bronco. His friend was a volunteer firefighter in addition to his job as a ranger, and he\u2019d be glad to have him there. Sorrow needed all the friendly faces she could get. \u201cSomething else has got to be going on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with your theories again, Sheriff.\u201d Bear turned to scowl at his daughter. \u201cI told you I didn\u2019t want you to cook. First you break the freezers and now this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not break the freezers.\u201d</p><p>Scott walked in the door and, sensing the tension, got a look on his face that was one part wary and one part bemused. \u201cI hear you\u2019ve got barbequed kitchen on the menu.\u201d</p><p>Bear looked like his head might explode, and Mike took the hint. He met Scott\u2019s eye. \u201cGreetings, Ranger. About time you showed up. How about we have a look-see in the kitchen? Seems like these nice folks have some things to work out.\u201d He patted Bear\u2019s shoulder as he headed to the kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you be.\u201d</p><p>Laura burst in. \u201cI hear Sorrow burned down the kitchen!\u201d</p><p>Billy shot her a warning look.</p><p>To his surprise, it seemed to have some effect, because she went to Sorrow and, looking cowed, squeezed her sister\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSeriously, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but her dad cut her off before she could speak. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cbut my kitchen\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to your kitchen,\u201d Sorrow said, and Billy was hugely impressed at how well she was doing under the pressure.</p><p>\u201cSully\u2019s been cooking in there for over twenty years and he\u2019s never had a fire.\u201d</p><p>Mike leaned on the pass-through and called out, \u201cIt was a grease fire, sure enough. Must\u2019ve had some drippings on the bottom of the oven.\u201d</p><p>Bear\u2019s eyes narrowed, but Sorrow cut him off before he could speak. \u201cNo way. There is no way this is my fault. I keep a spotless kitchen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damien\u2019s parents came back in. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d Phoebe told her, \u201cI am so sorry. Your big night was ruined.\u201d</p><p>Dabney turned to Sorrow, too, giving her a bolstering look. \u201cShe\u2019ll get another chance, won\u2019t you, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe spilled grease in the oven,\u201d Bear said.</p> <p>Sorrow\u2019s voice was dangerously calm. \u201cSpilled grease? There\u2019s no grease in my Coq au Vin.\u201d</p><p>Billy put a protective arm around her. \u201cNobody keeps a healthier or cleaner kitchen than your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell something was in that cocoa van of hers.\u201d Bear shook his head as he told her, \u201cI told you not to cook. That kitchen\u2019s too big for you.\u201d</p><p>The patronizing comment sent her over the edge. She crossed her arms tightly at her chest, edging one step closer to her father. \u201cToo big? Too big?\u201d</p><p>Dabney helped his wife shoulder into her jacket. \u201cListen here, Bear. If the girl said there was no grease, there was no grease.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201d Phoebe gave her a hug good-bye. She held her chin and looked into her eyes as she gently said, \u201cOne of these days, this town will serve something more palatable than Tom\u2019s chicken poppers, and my money\u2019s on you.\u201d</p><p>Dabney went to the door. Looking back at Damien, he said, \u201cCome on, son. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re our ride.\u201d</p><p>Billy had to give the guy some credit\u2014at least he looked hesitant to go. Damien turned to Sorrow. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. The Simmons family left, with the rest of the crowd close behind.</p><p>\u201cGrease fire,\u201d Chief Haskell said as he made his own exit. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to do but clean it up. Believe it or not, the oven survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mike,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cThat\u2019s good news.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything for a pretty lady.\u201d Mike gave her a wink.</p><p>Billy clapped him on the shoulder, giving him the hint. \u201cAll right, work\u2019s done here. Don\u2019t you have a wife to get home to?\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cUnderstood. Hey, Sorrow, we\u2019ll see you at the festival. I hear it\u2019s shaping up to be a doozy, what with all the Buck Larsen stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope,\u201d she said, giving him a tired smile.</p><p>The sight stabbed him. Billy wouldn\u2019t stand idly by\u2014he needed her father to listen to reason. \u201cI wish I could convince you,\u201d he told the man. \u201cFirst the freezers, now this. I don\u2019t think these accidents are accidents at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough for one night. I told you before, city boy. All we have in Sierra Falls is neighbors. No vandals, or gangs, or anything like that.\u201d Bear nodded toward the door. \u201cTime for you two to get out of here. I\u2019m closing shop. Gonna open some windows to air it out. Between the stink and the cold, we\u2019re pulling a goose egg on business tonight.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow stiffened. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was somebody\u2019s fault,\u201d Bear said.</p> <p>Billy was quick to intervene. He was just as done with Bear as Bear was with his night. \u201cWe\u2019ll lock up here, Mister Bailey. You go join the missus.\u201d</p><p>Laura took her father\u2019s arm. \u201cCome on, Dad. Let\u2019s go watch some CNN.\u201d She winked at her sister.</p><p>Her father sucked at his teeth a second, then with a stoic nod, let Laura lead him back to the lodge.</p><p>Sorrow gave Billy a sad half smile. \u201cI think Dad could use some alone time to sit in his recliner and lick his wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to go back to the lodge, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019m not going back there until I know my father is sound asleep in bed.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped her in his arms. \u201cI know it\u2019s not your fault. Not even a little bit.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed into him, sighing deeply. \u201cThank you. Though I can\u2019t imagine how something like that happened.\u201d She pushed back enough to meet his eye. \u201cThere\u2019s no grease dripping from a Dutch oven, and Sully keeps a spotless kitchen. So, what happened? Usually, the most exciting thing that happens in this town is when old man Ziegler has one nip too many and drives his snowplow off the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that sounds dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she admitted, \u201cit kind of was. But that was back in Christmas \u201995, and he hasn\u2019t done it again. I think the whole episode was why Marshall finally became a deputy when he got back from Iraq.\u201d</p><p>Billy chuckled. \u201cThat explains a lot.\u201d They grew silent, thinking. There\u2019d been severed freezer lines, a roof cave-in, one downed tree, and now this. Fire was nothing to mess around with, and it shot his concerns to a whole different level. But how to address it with Sorrow without scaring the wits out of her? \u201cYour dad thinks it\u2019s all just a run of bad luck...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of bad luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll at once,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo a crazy degree.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes locked, each reading the uneasiness in the other\u2019s eyes. She slowly shook her head. \u201cThese aren\u2019t accidents, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way they are,\u201d he said. \u201cI just can\u2019t figure out who\u2019d want to harm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarm me?\u201d She gave a weak laugh. \u201cHave you noticed how all this stuff started to happen when Laura showed up? Maybe I can blame her.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her suggestion. \u201cYou\u2019re remarkably droll about this whole thing.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIf that means I\u2019ve got a sense of humor about it, then yeah, it\u2019s either laugh or cry.\u201d She dropped her forehead against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a remarkable woman, Sorrow Bailey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a suspect or clues, there\u2019s nothing we can do. The best plan of action is to keep you close.\u201d He slid his hands down her back. \u201cYou know, there is something we can do to deal with the stress.\u201d</p><p>Her head sprang up, and she mimicked a grave nod. \u201cAnd the uncertainty. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping an arm around her, Billy steered Sorrow to the door, plucking her coat from the rack on the way out to his car. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, cowboy.\u201d She halted to lock up. \u201cI thought you were on duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my duty.\u201d But then he paused\u2014it\u2019d been an intense night for her. He needed to be certain she wanted this as much as he did. \u201cUnless you want to stay home, hang in for the night...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Billy. You\u2019re all I want.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her resolve, he urged her back into a walk. \u201cThen we\u2019re a pair, Sorrow. Because I happen to want you back. A lot.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cBut what about all those speeders and lawbreakers?\u201d</p><p>He ushered her into his SUV and walked around to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cCalls get routed to Silver City dispatch starting at ten P.M. Until then, Marshall has one ear tuned to the radio and will call if anything comes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the deputy was sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered him a raise.\u201d</p><p>She turned to give him a perplexed look. \u201cSo this is how a sheriff figures out who\u2019s up to no good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sorrow.\u201d He reached over and squeezed her thigh. \u201cThis is how a sheriff gets up to no good.\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d made it clear it was what she wanted, Billy had put her in that car like he wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. Which was fine by Sorrow. She had zero intention of telling Billy no to anything.</p><p>Not much time had passed since their first kiss, but Sorrow realized now just how long it\u2019d been since she\u2019d known deep down that she wanted to be with Billy. This was it. Tonight would be the night. Their night.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted him for a while now, and after tonight\u2019s scare, she needed him. Needed to feel his strong body surround hers, to be safe in his arms. She needed to experience that feeling she knew when she was with Billy\u2014the sense that she was no longer in it alone.</p><p>He drove them to his house. Her bag, their coats, his keys...everything dropped to the floor the moment the door slammed behind them.</p><p>Billy was such a man\u2019s man, so in charge, and she\u2019d barely gasped in a breath when he brought his mouth to hers. Her body exploded to life, every nerve, every inch of her wanting more from this kiss, deeper and harder.</p><p>Her hands roved eagerly along his body, fingers catching over foreign bits of his uniform. His belt, his cuffs. The newness of him turned her on in a way that startled her, excited her.</p><p>He unbuckled his belt, keeping his mouth on hers. Finally he pulled from her, and she heard the clatter of his gear where he put it on the entryway table. He was back at once and twined his fingers in her hair, tilting her face to lay kisses along her cheek and down her throat.</p><p>Oh God, he was good. But his hands, she wanted more of those hands. She\u2019d never been good at the sexy banter, but she spoke now in a voice she didn\u2019t recognize, words coming from some unknown wicked part of herself. \u201cYou gonna frisk me, officer?\u201d</p><p>His husky, sexy laugh sent a shiver rippling across her skin. \u201cI\u2019m going to do more than that.\u201d He took her shoulders in his hands and stepped forward until his body was hard along the length of hers. His leg pressed against her leg, guiding her backward.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Her voice was weak\u2014she couldn\u2019t catch her breath for the fire burning inside her.</p><p>He unbuttoned her top button, guiding her back another step. His head rose from where he\u2019d been kissing her neck, her ear. His eyes were dark with intent. \u201cI\u2019m getting you naked.\u201d He nuzzled her neck again, popping another button. \u201cYou can stop me.\u201d</p><p>They went back another step. He popped another button.</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d she said breathily. She tangled her fingers in his hair, guiding his mouth lower. \u201cBut I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d He undid a third button, and cool air kissed through the lace of her bra. She sucked in a breath at the sensation, every inch of her skin pulled tight with desire. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this moment for some time.\u201d He swept a thumb over the peak of her breast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hissed in a breath. \u201cMe, too.\u201d She took another step back as he undid her last button, and her shoulders touched something hard\u2014the doorjamb stopping her. She savored the feel of cool wood against her burning flesh.</p><p>His broad hand cupped her breast, kneading her and teasing her with his palm and thumb. He reached around her. Opened the knob. \u201cCare to see my bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow did. Though there was something she needed to see much more than that\u2014his chest, bared again. She tugged his uniform shirt, untucking it from his pants. \u201cTake this off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Billy swept her onto the bed, and she gave a little bounce as she landed.</p><p>She never knew she had a cop fantasy until experiencing the sight of a broad-shouldered sheriff stripping just for her. Legs parted slightly in a commanding stance, he stood over the bed, his eyes hooded and dark with hunger, swiftly unbuttoning. His gaze was unwavering. His desire, unwavering.</p><p>She\u2019d enjoyed sex before, but never had she felt wanting like this. It seared her, set her body on fire. \u201cI want you, Billy.\u201d She slid her jeans down to midhip, very aware of the sliver of black lace she revealed. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He practically ripped the rest of his clothes off and was on top of her, kissing her, touching her. She writhed with need, and he snatched her one hand, and then the other, twining his fingers with hers, sweeping her arms up over her head to give him unfettered access. \u201cIs this what you\u2019ve been hiding under those sweaters?\u201d His mouth teased through the damp lace of her bra, sucking and nibbling her. \u201cYou\u2019re so hot. And now you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She arched her back, reaching her breast to his mouth, needing it closer, harder, more. \u201cGet these clothes off me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He slid his hand behind her back, flicked open the clasp of her bra, and tossed the black scrap of lace onto the floor. Her jeans and panties followed, his movements exhilaratingly confident and sure.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling herself up, and him down, longing to feel his naked body press against hers.</p><p>When their skin touched, he hissed in a breath. He shifted, holding the brunt of his weight off of her. \u201cYou\u2019re so perfect,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She raked her fingers through his hair, kissing along his collarbone, up the strong column of his neck, to his jaw. Stubble scraped her tongue, and the erotic sensation amped her lust to a fever pitch. \u201cMe? God, Billy, you.\u201d Desire made her weak, and she slid her hands from his hair to steady herself, grasping his upper arms, and moaned when her fingers met smooth, hard muscle. \u201cYou\u2019re rock hard.\u201d She gave a breathy laugh, realizing her double entendre, because another very hard part of him was an undeniable pressure against her leg. She wriggled beneath him, inching her hips closer to his, beckoning. She teased, a purr in her voice, \u201cRock hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCondom,\u201d he growled, rolling from her. He was back on the bed in an instant, intense, focused, breathless. \u201cI\u2019ll take more time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she interrupted, guiding him to the perfect spot. \u201cNow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow.\u201d He plunged into her. \u201cAnd again,\u201d he snarled with a thrust of his hips. \u201cAnd later. And more. And forever.\u201d</p><p>And for the first time in her life, Sorrow felt completed. Complete.</p><p>Thirty</p><p>Marlene stole another glimpse of Tom Sullivan out of the corner of her eye. The theater was dark, but the movie\u2019s glow flickered over his features. In the starkly dappled shadows and light, he looked carved from granite.</p><p>He caught her looking, and she cut her eyes back to the screen, feeling herself blush a hundred shades of red. When was the last time she\u2019d acted like such a schoolgirl? Probably the last time she\u2019d been taken on an actual date, and she sure didn\u2019t remember when that\u2019d been.</p><p>She\u2019d felt like a girl again, when Sully picked her up to drive them to Silver City. He\u2019d taken her to a nice Italian restaurant\u2014not a chain\u2014and had bought tickets to a movie she\u2019d picked out.</p><p>The last time her ex-husband had taken her to dinner and a movie, they\u2019d probably been in high school. It seemed like they\u2019d gone straight from the Homecoming Dance to having babies to diaper and bills to pay. She\u2019d lost both herself and him somewhere along the way.</p><p>She tried to pay attention to the film, but something began to buzz, and it took her a moment to figure out that it was coming from her purse. The mobile phone. She hardly used it, and on those rare occasions it rang, it always took her a moment to place the sound.</p> <p>She slowly unzipped her bag, cringing at the loud sound, and slipped it out. It buzzed like an angry beetle in her hand. If someone were actually calling her, it was either a wrong number or an emergency. She prayed it was the former.</p><p>She glanced at Sully, uncertain. They\u2019d announced that cell phones weren\u2019t allowed during the film.</p><p>Guessing her conundrum, he leaned close to whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She barely registered his words, so focused was she on the feel of his breath on her cheek and the faint scent of his aftershave.</p><p>She forced herself to nod and peeked at the screen. The number was familiar, and it took her a moment to place it. Ruby. Her heart kicked up a notch. Oh dear Lord, what happened? There\u2019d been much ado in her household over Marlene and Sully\u2019s date, and her aunt wouldn\u2019t be getting in touch if she didn\u2019t have a reason.</p><p>Sully guessed her distress, and with a steady hand, he guided her up from her seat and out of the theater. It was supposed to have been a simple, friendly date. Nothing big, just a Tuesday night\u2014he\u2019d had to talk her into it, for pity\u2019s sake.</p><p>And yet here he was, his warm arm around her shoulders the only thing keeping her propped up.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he prompted gently, when they got into the lobby.</p><p>She blinked against the bright overhead lights, fumbling to press the button to answer. She was too late, and her hands trembled as she redialed. A person didn\u2019t act as caretaker to three elderly women without holding a part of her mind in constant reserve, always somehow expecting the worst.</p><p>\u201cRuby,\u201d she gasped, hearing her aunt\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Marlene felt the blood drain from her head. She ended the call, met Sully\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s Ma. She fell. They think it\u2019s her hip. An ambulance\u2014\u201d She choked on the last words.</p><p>Sully somehow had her in her coat and headed out the door before she knew which end was up. \u201cThey\u2019ll be taking her to Silver City Memorial,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded, grateful not to have to speak. Tom Sullivan just knew. Just as he somehow knew how to navigate the streets of Silver City, pulling into the hospital lot. She was on autopilot, grateful he was there to find the right attendant and ask the right questions, navigating them to the correct curtained room in the ER. Her mother had just arrived.</p><p>And then the waiting began. Time compressed until she felt as though she\u2019d either just gotten to the ER or had been sitting there her whole life.</p><p>Ruby and Pearl showed up not long after the ambulance, having driven themselves there in Marlene\u2019s pickup. She would\u2019ve found it shocking, had she not already been so swamped with emotion. She observed her aunts as though from a distance\u2014them interrogating the nurses, bustling around, finding coffee\u2014and she was struck by their calm. Their independence.</p><p>Suddenly it was nearly sixty years ago, and she was the kid and they were the adults. Snippets of memory returned in a flash, those times when her mother hadn\u2019t been home, and it\u2019d been Pearl and Ruby feeding her dinner, making her wash her hands and finish her schoolwork.</p><p>Like sun shifting through a prism, a new light shone on her aunts, revealing a different truth, showing their quibbles and tics anew. She\u2019d forgotten such large chunks of her childhood\u2014the tiny details, the meaningless daily trivia. As the years passed, much of it had drifted from her mind like bits of ash on the wind. Those long-forgotten snippets came to her now, and she wondered, how had life passed so quickly? How had those memories slipped away? Weren\u2019t those day-to-day details what life was about?</p><p>Sully had been gone, and he reappeared now, sitting beside her to take her hand. He gave it a squeeze.</p><p>She looked at their twined fingers. His hands were so new to her, such an unexpected source of comfort. She\u2019d seen in his eyes that he had word from the doctor, and she wanted to put off hearing it for another few moments. \u201cMy husband never held my hand like this,\u201d she said, stopping him before he could deliver any more bad news.</p><p>\u201cYour husband was a fool,\u201d he said without hesitation.</p><p>She squeezed this strange man\u2019s hand as she remembered Frank. How would he be acting right now? Her ex had never held her hand, never courted her, never taken her to fancy restaurants, and he definitely would never have tolerated a chick flick just because it was what Marlene had wanted to see.</p><p>She met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Tom.\u201d And she meant it. She was so grateful. She was an independent woman, a grown woman. She\u2019d raised a houseful of boys. She was always the responsible one, including being responsible for her mother in a way Mama had never been truly responsible for her. She was a strong, self-reliant woman, and yet she found comfort in having a man beside her now. She drew a stabilizing breath. \u201cWhat did the doctor say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother broke her hip. She\u2019s not responding, but that\u2019s the Alzheimer\u2019s. Technically, besides the hip, she\u2019s in good physical shape.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed again and again, trying to dissolve the ache in her throat. \u201cMa was always fit as a fiddle. Mountain living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d His left hand joined his right, until her cold fingers were cocooned in Tom\u2019s steady warmth. \u201cThey\u2019ve hooked up an IV tube, Marlene, for feeding. But you\u2019re going to have some decisions to make.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, blinking back the tears. \u201cCan I see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He pulled her to standing. \u201cThey\u2019re moving her now.\u201d</p><p>Walking into the hospital room, all Marlene could think was that she needed to get her mother out of there. Mama might be staring blankly, no longer in her body, but the woman she\u2019d grown up with wouldn\u2019t want to be in a glaringly white and antiseptic hospital room\u2014she\u2019d want to be at home, where she could eat her favorite Pepperidge Farm cookies and watch her favorite afternoon programs. The younger Mama would\u2019ve wanted to be in a car with the top down, laughing and angling for a picnic, even in the worst of weather. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Ma,\u201d she said, and had to clear her throat not to cry.</p><p>Sully pulled a chair from the corner and brought it to the bedside. \u201cYou sit with your mother, Marlene. I\u2019ll go get you some coffee, find your aunts.\u201d</p><p>He was almost out the door when Mama\u2019s eyes cleared suddenly, pinned on Sully. \u201cWait,\u201d she said sharply.</p> <p>\u201cMa?\u201d The sound of her mother\u2019s voice should\u2019ve been reassuring, but instead it alarmed her. She patted her mother\u2019s arm, and it felt like thin crepe draped over bone. When had Ma gotten so thin? Should she have put her in a home? Thinking on it now, she realized her mother hadn\u2019t been eating much, not really. Marlene knew a spurt of guilt and pushed it away. She beckoned Tom closer, saying in as bright and even a tone as she could muster, \u201cYou remember Tom Sullivan? Sully? Tom helped me. He drove me to see you.\u201d</p><p>But Marlene hadn\u2019t needed to bring him to her mother\u2019s attention\u2014Emerald\u2019s eyes were glued to the man. Mama\u2019s voice was strong and steady when she said, \u201cI don\u2019t regret you for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Sully shot Marlene a wary glance, but came to sit at Ma\u2019s bedside. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d He took her mother\u2019s hand without thinking, and Marlene thought him a good man for it.</p><p>When Emerald spoke again, an eerie clarity infused her eyes and voice, focusing on Tom like he was the only person in the room. Her hand trembled and knuckles turned pale with the grip she had on his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t regret our running off. What I regret is that we didn\u2019t keep running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks you\u2019re someone else,\u201d Marlene whispered.</p> <p>\u201cGus?\u201d The old woman became agitated, her tone turned frantic.</p><p>Marlene held her breath. Gus. She\u2019d never before heard her mother say the name. The man who must\u2019ve been her father.</p><p>Tom remained calm, though, his demeanor so warm and open. \u201cYes, Emerald? What is it?\u201d</p><p>His equanimity calmed her mother, calmed her, and a question slammed to the forefront of Marlene\u2019s mind: how on earth is this man single?</p><p>Mama\u2019s chin quivered with emotion, but her voice rang clearly through the hospital room. \u201cIf I had it to do again, I\u2019d stay. I loved you, Gus. And I love you still. And that\u2019s all there is. Daddy said I was reckless and I believed him, but my mistake wasn\u2019t that I ran off with you. It was heeding anything but my own heart.\u201d</p><p>She watched as Ma fell asleep wearing the most peaceful expression Marlene had ever seen. Sully silently disengaged his fingers and tucked her mother\u2019s hand beneath the covers. As he took Marlene\u2019s hand, she let her gaze meet his. The man behind those dark blue eyes was steadfast and strong.</p> <p>It was time to learn from her mother. Time to let her heart run free. And as she held Sully\u2019s gaze, she knew. Her heart would be safe with him.</p><p>Thirty-one</p><p>Sorrow\u2019s eyes shot open, her heart pounding, unsure why she was awake and where. She knew a moment of sweet relief, feeling Billy at her back. Billy. Wondrous, amazing, hot as hell Billy. Then a ringing. The phone. The phone had woken her. Her heart kicked into double time.</p><p>Middle of the night phone calls were never good.</p><p>Billy sat up, as alert as if a switch had flicked in his mind. He answered the phone, and his voice might\u2019ve been all business, but he put a warm, strong hand on her suddenly chilled shoulder.</p><p>Her first thought was of BJ\u2014phone calls at odd hours were terrifying when you had a loved one at war. She told herself they never called\u2014they came, first thing in the morning. Gray light filtered through the blinds\u2014what time was it? Would her parents have gotten word and called her here? She glanced at the clock. 7:17 A.M. Early, but was it too early for some Marine Corps chaplain to drive out to Sierra Falls and knock on her folks\u2019 door?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he said, then mouthed to her, Marshall.</p><p>She bolted upright, cradling the sheet across her chest, unable to relax. Why was the deputy calling? Had there been another accident at the lodge? Billy worried the culprit was after her, but if they thought she was at home in her bed...</p> <p>Billy and Marshall went back and forth, but then Billy looked at her. Hesitating, he said, \u201cYeah, she\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the headboard, feeling numb. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Billy didn\u2019t drop her gaze, but he didn\u2019t tell her what was going on either. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. We\u2019ll be there in no time.\u201d</p><p>She pounced on him the moment he was off the phone. \u201cWhat is it? What happened? It\u2019s not BJ, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBJ?\u201d He had a perplexed look on his face. \u201cOh! God, no, Sorrow. BJ and your folks are all fine. It\u2019s Emerald. I\u2019m sorry, she passed last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d She slouched, letting the news sink in. \u201cPoor Marlene.\u201d Emerald Kidd had been ailing for some time, but that didn\u2019t make it any easier on the family left behind. She frowned, thinking. \u201cBut why was he asking about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour folks were looking for you. The lodge was up at dawn. Your mom apparently has a bee in her bonnet to hold a reception this afternoon. Emerald was well-loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all loved Emerald.\u201d Sorrow sighed, nodded. It was what you did in a small town\u2014when crisis hit, you banded together and you ate. \u201cGrief,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s feed or be fed.\u201d She shifted to face him full-on. \u201cBut how did they know to call here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they realized you weren\u2019t in your bed, Bear called dispatch.\u201d</p><p>She slapped a hand to her forehead.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOur secret\u2019s out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. His job as sheriff kept him in the public eye\u2014would he shy away from the extra attention? The speculation? She was ready to jump in with both feet, but what about him? Was he even fully done with his grieving?</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d He gently drew her hands from her face and pulled her close. \u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you talking? I\u2019m not sorry. You were here last night with me. I\u2019m walking on air, Sorrow. I\u2019m thrilled for people to know.\u201d</p><p>Walking on air. No man had ever said such a thing about her. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only that, do you honestly think anyone will be surprised?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shy smile. \u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d The question of Damien and his response was one she\u2019d consider another time. With a sigh, she pulled off the sheet. \u201cI guess we\u2019ve been summoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t.\u201d He tugged the sheet back up and burrowed deeper, snaking his hands around to grab her and roll her atop him. \u201cThey definitely won\u2019t miss you for another hour or so.\u201d As he glided his hands up and down her thighs, he told her slowly, \u201cYou need to shower, and do your hair, and eat breakfast, and lots of other things that will take you lots of time.\u201d His hands came to rest cupped on her bottom, nestling her into place.</p><p>Her hair fell in a curtain around his face. His body was already straining to meet hers, and she wriggled suggestively. \u201cYou sure we have time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s short, Sorrow.\u201d Billy\u2019s face grew serious, the dark glint of desire in his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll make time.\u201d</p><p>Laura looked from her to Billy. \u201cWell, lookee what the cat dragged in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning to you, too,\u201d Billy said, unruffled.</p><p>Sorrow felt herself blush, but refused to take her sister\u2019s bait. Today wasn\u2019t about them. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, redirecting the conversation.</p><p>Laura\u2019s teasing smile faded at once. \u201cEmerald fell yesterday. She was on the porch, trying to go down the front stairs, wearing just her slippers and robe. Ruby and Pearl were in the kitchen when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poor women. I bet they feel horrible.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time something like that had happened, but there\u2019d been no way to keep an eye on Emerald twenty-four hours a day. Not even a nursing home could claim that. \u201cWhere was Marlene when it happened?\u201d</p><p>Laura raised her brows. \u201cOn a date. With Sully.\u201d</p><p>Despite the sad news, Sorrow couldn\u2019t help the smile that popped onto her face. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d Laura sighed. \u201cBut talk about feeling bad. Marlene hates that she wasn\u2019t there. Thank God she was able to catch up with Emerald at the hospital. She passed in the night, very peacefully, I gather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need us to do?\u201d Billy asked.</p><p>Laura gave him an assessing look. \u201cSo you\u2019re sticking around, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall\u2019s on duty today, so you best get used to my ugly mug.\u201d He slid Sorrow\u2019s coat from her shoulders. \u201cYou go help your mom. I\u2019ll see if I can occupy Bear, keep him out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>When he left the room, Laura grinned shamelessly. \u201cYou go, girl.\u201d</p><p>What she had with Billy felt too special to gossip over, so she cut off her sister, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get to work.\u201d</p><p>Laura\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cFine,\u201d she muttered. \u201cBut you have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust follow me.\u201d</p><p>They headed into the dining room, and her eyes widened at the devastation. It looked like someone had come and emptied their breakfront. Every piece of blue Wedgwood they owned was stacked on the buffet, the good silverware looked like it\u2019d exploded over the dining table, a few cut-glass vases were waiting to be dusted, and blackened silver polish rags littered the place. \u201cWhat\u2019s the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe story?\u201d Her sister sighed. \u201cThe story is, Mom\u2019s losing it.\u201d</p><p>As if to illustrate the point, their mom bustled in, holding a tablecloth in each hand. \u201cWhich one?\u201d she demanded, looking a little wild-eyed. \u201cThe gingham or Meemaw\u2019s table runner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeemaw\u2019s,\u201d the girls said in unison.</p><p>Edith looked doubtful.</p><p>\u201cMeemaw was friendly with the Kidd sisters. It\u2019s a nice touch.\u201d Sorrow took it from her, and with Laura\u2019s help, moved the silver aside to spread it on the table. Before her mom could bustle back out of the room, Sorrow snatched her hands, forcing Mom to meet her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a luncheon,\u201d Edith said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Sorrow said gently. She glanced over her mother\u2019s shoulder, spying what was already a huge spread of food scattered across the counter. \u201cBut if people are coming over soon, we need to get this place cleaned up and put the food on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved Emerald,\u201d her mom said. \u201cI want it to be perfect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI loved her, too. We all did. And it will be perfect\u2014just perfect enough.\u201d She let go of Mom\u2019s hands and began to put the silverware back in its felted tray. \u201cPeople won\u2019t notice if you\u2019re using the good silver or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Laura murmured.</p><p>Sorrow shot her sister a look before turning her attention back to her mother. The woman looked like she\u2019d aged twenty years in the night. \u201cHave you eaten? You sit down.\u201d Sorrow steered her into the kitchen, hating the feeble, fragile feel of Mom\u2019s slack shoulders in her hands. \u201cTake a minute to have a cup of coffee and make a list of what you need us to do. Lists are good.\u201d She sat her at the table and put a pad of paper and a pen before her. \u201cJust tell us what you need, and we\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow went back into the dining room. With a heavy sigh, she met and held her sister\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Billy reappeared. \u201cYour dad is set up in his recliner. Lucky thing it\u2019s March Madness. Not only is he occupied, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll need to unplug the TV to get him up from that chair.\u201d</p> <p>He stood at Sorrow\u2019s side, resting his hand on her lower back. She looked up at him to give him a quiet smile\u2014he managed to be loving and steadfast without being overtly affectionate. At the moment, it was just right. She read total understanding in his eyes\u2014Billy was more well-versed in grief than any of them.</p><p>They heard the scrape of the kitchen chair, followed by the clicking of the gas burner.</p><p>\u201cMom is wigging out,\u201d Laura said, and the uncharacteristic anxiety in her voice made Sorrow feel like the older sister instead of the youngest one.</p><p>\u201cIt helps her feel in control,\u201d Billy said. \u201cPouring herself into busy work is probably what\u2019s helping her keep it together.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow\u2019s eyes shot to his. The man was even wiser than she\u2019d realized. Emerald\u2019s death might not have been a shock, but it was a blow. Even though she\u2019d just passed the night before, everyone in the town\u2014especially Mom\u2014would want to pull together, keep busy, and most of all, help. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cMom loved Emerald. She grew up around the Kidd sisters. Putting together a big spread is the most therapeutic thing she could do, for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been different since Dad\u2019s stroke,\u201d Laura said, her voice subdued. \u201cI think she\u2019s clinging to life more than ever.\u201d</p> <p>The insight was remarkable, and coming from Laura, it was a shock, too. Dad\u2019s stroke had been a reminder of how it could all change on a dime, and neither of her parents had been the same since.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sorrow conceded. \u201cI think that\u2019s exactly right.\u201d But then she sighed, checking the clock on the wall. \u201cBut all this talk isn\u2019t putting lunch on the table.\u201d</p><p>Laura led them into the kitchen. \u201cI made a few plates of food this morning. Now that we don\u2019t need to polish the silver, we can start putting it all out.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow had braced herself to be the one to handle everything\u2014especially the food\u2014but when she saw the spread Laura had pulled together, she was shocked. \u201cWow,\u201d she said grudgingly. \u201cThanks. This looks great. How did you manage?\u201d</p><p>Edith came over to stand between her daughters. \u201cShe did a nice job, didn\u2019t she, Sorrow?\u201d</p><p>She looked at her sister, seeing her in a new light. She\u2019d spent so many years feeling like she lived in Laura\u2019s shadow, resenting every minute she\u2019d had to pick up the messes Laura left behind, that she\u2019d lost sight of who her sister was, really\u2014a bright, beautiful, capable woman. \u201cYeah, big sis. Nice work.\u201d</p><p>Laura shrugged, looking shyly pleased. \u201cLuckily, I went shopping yesterday, and there was enough stuff like veggies, dips, and deli meats to assemble some buffet plates. Plus, I found some random frozen stuff in the freezer this morning\u2014mini-quiches and pot stickers\u2014I thought we could make those, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea.\u201d Sorrow gave her a sad smile. \u201cNothing like putting on a Costco wake.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty-two</p><p>It\u2019d been a week since her mother\u2019s funeral, and Marlene kept thinking about the picture that\u2019d graced the easel at the front of the chapel\u2014a black and white studio portrait of Ma, taken when she was much younger. Her dress was white with polka dots, and her lipstick was a dark and perfectly applied bow. It captured the younger mother she\u2019d known, the vital one, who drank sparkling ros\u00e9 and knew how to tell a cheeky joke. The woman who\u2019d run away for love and returned home for the same reason.</p><p>\u201cMarlene,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said. It was the sheriff, standing over her table, warm concern written on his face. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She considered the question, knowing he was the sort of man who\u2019d see through a rote reply. \u201cI\u2019m...I think I\u2019m doing okay.\u201d And actually, she was. She\u2019d come to meet with the festival planning committee over an early dinner, and it was good to be out, to be in the tavern among her friends, even if it did mean the possibility of Bailey family sparring. It\u2019d been a tear-soaked week, but she was grateful to feel all cried out for the moment. \u201cWould you like to join us?\u201d She\u2019d been the first one to sit down, and gestured to the empty spot next to her.</p><p>\u201cOn duty, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>She noticed how his eyes found and tracked Sorrow through the room. So that was why he\u2019d stopped by the tavern, despite being in uniform. She smiled\u2014it was just the sort of intrigue Mama would\u2019ve enjoyed. Life went on, and it was good.</p><p>\u201cYou let us know if there\u2019s anything we can do,\u201d Billy added. \u201cSometimes it hits the hardest when all the vases are packed away and the well-wishers have gone.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d know better than anyone. She gave him a grateful smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got my family around me.\u201d And Tom now, too. She glimpsed Tom through the pass-through window. He was wearing his white T-shirt, and in the heat of the kitchen, it clung to his broad back.</p><p>\u201cMy mistake wasn\u2019t that I ran off with you. It was heeding anything but my own heart.\u201d Mama had wished to be her own woman. Marlene was sixty-three, and it was high time she learned what it meant to be her own woman. Heed your own heart.</p><p>There was a crash outside and the terrible shriek of metal scraping metal. Her hand flew to her chest. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d There was another crash followed by shouts, and she flinched.</p><p>Tom flew from the kitchen, right to her side. \u201cSounds like a couple of fender benders.\u201d He put a hand on her shoulder, acting nonchalant, but his eyes were bright as a hawk\u2019s when they locked with the sheriff\u2019s. \u201cYou sit tight, Marlene. We\u2019re on this. Don\u2019t you give it a second thought.\u201d</p><p>He was back in a flash, flanked by the sheriff, Sorrow, Eddie Jessup, and Helen, the tavern bartender. Dabney Simmons trailed behind them, an arm around his visibly shaken wife.</p><p>Laura had sat down to wait with Marlene. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack ice,\u201d Sully said. \u201cA sheet of it on the driveway, smooth as glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d Laura\u2019s gaze flicked to Eddie, giving him a quick once-over. \u201cNobody was hurt, were they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nobody\u2019s hurt,\u201d Sorrow said, joining them at the table. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some denting of fenders and pride,\u201d the sheriff added. \u201cEddie\u2019s new pickup is a little worse for wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI salted out there yesterday, and it\u2019s been dry.\u201d Sorrow worried the edge of her apron. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this could\u2019ve happened.\u201d</p><p>Marlene caught the look that flashed between Sorrow and Billy and was taken aback by the poor girl\u2019s intensity. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, dear,\u201d she assured her. \u201cThese things happen.\u201d</p><p>Sully looked doubtful. \u201cIt is strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than strange,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare. Mister Simmons\u2019s Mercedes has a huge dent in it. Poor Helen, it was her old Dodge that glided right into it, like a big sled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Helen is right.\u201d Marlene eyed the woman behind the bar. She was tying on her apron with shaking hands. It\u2019d take months of tips to cover the bodywork on that fancy Mercedes. \u201cI hope she has insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t think of making Helen pay for this,\u201d Phoebe Simmons said from over Marlene\u2019s shoulder. The woman had a white-knuckle grip on her Chanel quilted leather handbag.</p><p>There\u2019d been a day when Phoebe\u2019s affluence would\u2019ve made Marlene writhe with envy. But not now. Not ever again. She\u2019d thought she wanted a BMW sedan and a retirement house on the lake, but Ma\u2019s passing made her realize those weren\u2019t the things she\u2019d be mourning on her deathbed.</p><p>\u201cCome join us,\u201d she told Phoebe. \u201cHave something for your nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a tad rattled.\u201d Despite those nerves, Phoebe was all grace as she glided into a chair. There was no way to disguise her caliber of wealth\u2014she could be the most down-to-earth woman in Sierra Falls and still she\u2019d ooze class. \u201cA sip of sparkling water should set me to rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d Tom nodded and went to the bar. When he returned, it was with two glasses\u2014he\u2019d brought a sparkling water for Marlene, too. She gave him a shy smile.</p><p>Phoebe sipped, looking calmed. \u201cLaura, it\u2019s such a treat seeing you back in Sierra Falls. Edith tells me you might stay for a while this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I just might.\u201d</p><p>Poor Sorrow was stiff as a board, and Marlene willed the girl to look her way so she could share a smile of encouragement. She\u2019d heard about the girl\u2019s breakup with Damien and didn\u2019t know if her agitation was due to the accident, to Laura, or to the appearance of her ex-boyfriend\u2019s mother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Phoebe was doing her best to ease the tensions, though, and she met Sorrow\u2019s eye with a smile. \u201cYou deserve the help.\u201d The sentiment notched the woman higher in Marlene\u2019s estimation.</p><p>Laura straightened, brightened. \u201cI\u2019d love to transform this place from a dusty old hunting lodge into a cute destination resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that would be charming. I\u2019ve always thought the lodge had such potential.\u201d Phoebe\u2019s gaze swept the room, coming to rest on a pair of antlers over the dining table.</p> <p>Laura laughed, catching her line of sight. \u201cThe first order of business would be to lose the animal heads.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow sat silently, practically quivering, and Marlene tried to ease the tension. \u201cSome of us like a little local flavor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d keep some flavor, for sure. I\u2019m talking to an old friend about designing a Web site, and it\u2019d totally telegraph that gold rush town feeling.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cHave you talked to Dad about this? Because you sure haven\u2019t talked to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, not yet.\u201d Laura shooed her hand. \u201cI\u2019m pulling together the marketing plan now. It\u2019ll be comprehensive\u2014addressing new interior design, an Internet presence\u2014and it\u2019ll all tie into what I\u2019ve got in mind for the festival. I thought we could even have a gold rush menu, with Sully\u2019s Prospector\u2019s Pie of course, and maybe even feature a special gold rush dinner that Sorrow could make. How about it, sis? You up for it? You could debut it at the festival.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrow didn\u2019t get a chance to answer before Dabney came to gather his wife. Once the Simmonses left, she rounded on Laura. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, this dusty old tavern is open for business, so now is not the time to be gabbing about your grand takeover plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t\u2014\u201d fret, Marlene was about to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never the right time for you,\u201d Laura snapped. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not trying to take over.\u201d</p><p>Marlene took a big sip of her water.</p><p>Sorrow crossed her arms at her chest. \u201cWell it sure looks that way. You go around second-guessing everything I do. Don\u2019t you have enough to do in your fancy job? Do you need mine, too? Don\u2019t forget, you were the one who couldn\u2019t run for the door fast enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget when you remind me every time I\u2019m home? What is your problem, anyway? I\u2019m just trying to help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou scheming about how to redecorate is so not helpful.\u201d</p><p>Laura pouted. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like my gold rush dinner idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, of course. It\u2019s cute. And it\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is the point? You\u2019ve barely got a handle on things around here.\u201d She swept her arm, gesturing to the room. \u201cWhy are you so resistant to accepting my help? Like with the festival.\u201d Laura pinned her eyes on Marlene. \u201cTell her, Marlene. I feel like I\u2019ve contributed a lot to the planning.\u201d</p><p>Marlene swallowed. \u201cOh dear, I...\u201d</p><p>Edith appeared in a trice, aware of her girls\u2019 tension like a sixth sense. She gave them a scolding look. \u201cOur dinners are up, and I\u2019m sure Marlene is hungry. I know I am.\u201d She took her elder daughter\u2019s arm, tugging her up from her seat. \u201cLaura, honey, would you help me bring out our plates? Helen is still too shaken up.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow and Marlene were left alone. The younger woman dropped her head in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was unacceptable to do that in front of you. I just...I haven\u2019t gotten much sleep, I think, and it\u2019s been a pretty emotional week. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hush.\u201d She took Sorrow\u2019s hand. \u201cWhatever are you apologizing for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor me and my stupid sister.\u201d She sat up, but her shoulders remained slumped. \u201cNothing is going right today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think this is the first sisterly fight I\u2019ve seen? Don\u2019t forget who I live with.\u201d She had to smile. \u201cDon\u2019t give it a second thought. You\u2019re young. You both are. You\u2019ll figure it all out.\u201d She watched Laura standing at the pass-through, balancing plates on her arms. \u201cConsider forgiving your sister. The old clich\u00e9 is true: life it just too darned short not to. Open your mind to your sister\u2019s ideas. I happen to think a little change around here would be a grand idea. And if Laura decides to stay in Sierra Falls for a while, then good on her for following her heart.\u201d</p><p>And, Marlene thought, it was high time she did the same.</p><p>Thirty-three</p><p>Several days had passed since Billy and Sorrow had received their wake-up call that\u2019d outed their relationship to the town. Now he was back in the Bailey house, sitting stiffly, wondering if it would be expected or frowned upon to grab a beer from the fridge. He\u2019d already erred once, choosing what was apparently Edith\u2019s preferred spot on the couch. Not that Sorrow\u2019s mom was going to be watching any basketball with him and Bear.</p><p>When her dad brought up the Colorado/Brigham Young game, Billy had jumped at the chance to join him. He had a thing or two to say to the man, but so far, the bulk of the conversation had gone something like Bear grunting, \u201cColorado, huh?\u201d and Billy replying, \u201cYes, sir. Econ major.\u201d</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t complain. In fact, he was shocked Sorrow\u2019s dad had even remembered his alma mater, and it made him think that there was more going on in Bear\u2019s head than the old grump let on. It was progress.</p><p>Sorrow popped her head in, looking mischievous. \u201cYou boys need anything in here?\u201d</p><p>Billy let his eyes devour her for a moment. \u201cOh, I think I\u2019ve got all I need,\u201d he said, but the look that passed between them said something more like, when can we be alone again?</p><p>She shot a glance at Bear to make sure his attention was on the TV, then gave Billy a saucy look meant for his eyes only.</p><p>He waited a full minute before he sprang up off the couch. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I think I should see if your daughter needs any help.\u201d</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t totally a lie\u2014he\u2019d hoped his presence around the house might help Sorrow a bit, both with the general workload and with the sisterly and fatherly tensions that permeated the air, thick enough to cut with a knife.</p><p>He came up behind her where she was wiping down the counter, \u201cI\u2019m here to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Watching a game with my dad is above and beyond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust getting to know the man better.\u201d He swept aside her hair, revealing a stretch of pale neck. Seeing tension in her shoulders, he snatched the sponge from her hand and tossed it aside, easing her arms to her sides to massage away her stress. \u201cYou know I\u2019m in this for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d She leaned back against him, releasing a huge sigh like the weight of the world slipping from her shoulders. She was so soft and inviting pressed against him, his body tightened, reaching for her. \u201cWell hello, Sheriff,\u201d she said with a giggle. She nestled back against him. \u201cI like the feel of it, too.\u201d</p><p>All rational thought fled his brain. He swooped her up, spun her around, and seated her on the counter. Slowly, he glided his hands up her thighs, separating them, pushing between her legs to stand closer. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky your dad is in the next room.\u201d He nuzzled his way up that luscious neck, whispering against her mouth. \u201cBecause I\u2019m of a mind to have you right here, right now, on this counter.\u201d</p><p>She laughed wickedly, and he loved the sound of it, the sound of her, free and easy. \u201cI thought you were here to help,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not helping?\u201d His hand found her breast, and she sucked in a breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He leaned close to nibble on her ear. \u201cI\u2019m a force for good. What do you say we head upstairs, and I can show you just how good?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed two fistfuls of his hair and pulled his mouth to hers, kissing him deeply.</p><p>If he\u2019d thought he was turned on before, the feel of her taking what she wanted from him sent him over the edge. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d he said, when she parted.</p><p>\u201cNow you know how it feels.\u201d She slid from the counter, a slow glide down the front of his body. \u201cAnd now, I need to get this place in order. We have two parties of two coming in this afternoon. A Big Bear Lodge record.\u201d</p><p>The lights flickered, and it took Billy a moment to realize it was the faltering electricity and not some side effect of his desire, like his vision wavering from total frustration. But then there was sudden silence as the power shut down for good.</p><p>Sorrow\u2019s hands convulsed, gripping his shirt tight. He could see her eyes pop wide open in the darkness. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>He smoothed his hands along her shoulders, easing her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a simple power outage.\u201d Actually, he wasn\u2019t so sure, and he wasn\u2019t about to take any chances.</p><p>She gave a nervous laugh, holding a hand at her chest, looking rattled. \u201cSorry. Just a little jumpy these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all are.\u201d He was attuned to her, but he sent a part of his senses outward, listening. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fuse box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarage.\u201d</p><p>That meant she\u2019d be safe inside. \u201cYou wait here,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Bear shouted from the other room, \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man,\u201d Sorrow whispered, exasperated. She laughed again, sounding a little more like herself. \u201cWell isn\u2019t this great? We\u2019ve got guests on their way, and now no electricity.\u201d</p><p>He planted a kiss on her forehead and stepped from her. He had a hard time believing this really was a simple outage\u2014where the Bailey lodge was concerned, nothing struck him as simple as it appeared. \u201cI\u2019ll go see if you blew a fuse.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the front of his shirt, stopping him. \u201cHey, rain check on the whole force for good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, darlin\u2019.\u201d He swooped in, stealing one last hard, quick kiss. \u201cI will cash that rain check.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBest get going then.\u201d She gave him a playful shove, then snagged him a flashlight from a kitchen drawer. \u201cJust in case.\u201d</p><p>The living room was dim, and Bear was hauling himself to the edge of his lounger, trying to get up. \u201cWait,\u201d he grunted. \u201cI got this.\u201d</p><p>Billy went to him, leaning down to give him a hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201d</p> <p>The older man flinched back, angry. \u201cI\u2019m not an invalid. It\u2019s my house, and I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. So how about I come with, in case you need me to hold the flashlight?\u201d Someone could be waiting out there, and he wasn\u2019t about to risk Bear getting jumped in the dark.</p><p>The man shot him a suspicious glare, and as Billy watched him struggle from the chair, a puzzle piece clicked into place. Sorrow\u2019s father had been raised to be a man\u2019s man, spending his youth hunting for fun and logging for pay. That his body no longer cooperated had to be a blow to his ego and his manhood.</p><p>He might\u2019ve been moving more slowly, but the man wasn\u2019t dead yet. It seemed somebody needed to apprise him of that fact.</p><p>Billy stood in front of the chair, blocking Bear\u2019s path. \u201cPermission to speak frankly, sir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop sirring me.\u201d Sorrow\u2019s dad teetered for a moment, getting his balance.</p><p>Billy bit back a smile. \u201cPermission to speak frankly, you old hard-ass?\u201d</p><p>Bear laughed at that. \u201cI been waiting for you to speak frankly. Because I can\u2019t figure you out.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the response he\u2019d expected. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to figure,\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cWhat you see is what you get. I like your daughter, and I\u2019m not going away anytime soon. At least, not if I have anything to say about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about her breaking it off with that Simmons boy,\u201d Bear said, and he suspected the old man was testing him. \u201cThe kid practically prints money at that job of his.\u201d</p><p>The man wanted to be contrary. Fine. It was his right. But it didn\u2019t mean Billy would take the bait. \u201cDamien has money, that\u2019s easy to see. Doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s the right guy for Sorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I wonder if the girl would know the right thing if it came up and bit her on the rump.\u201d Her father shrugged, wearing an expression of mild distaste. \u201cSo, this is you speaking frankly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is me speaking frankly: you need to stop being such a nasty old coot. Hollering at the women in your life doesn\u2019t make you a better man, it just gives us all a headache. I know your body isn\u2019t what it was, and I\u2019m sorry for that. But, Bear, last I checked, getting old sure as hell beats the alternative.\u201d</p><p>Bear scowled hard at the word old, but Billy pressed on. \u201cYou want to be powerful again? You put that daughter of yours up on your shoulders. You support her, make sure she\u2019s set up to fly higher than you ever did. Now there\u2019s a weight that only a real man can handle.\u201d</p><p>Bear\u2019s features went utterly still, but whether it was anger or attentiveness had yet to be seen. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, you need to let your girl spread her wings.\u201d</p><p>The man frowned. \u201cLast time she spread her wings, she almost set the tavern on fire.\u201d</p><p>Billy\u2019s response was instant. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that was her fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would say that. New sheriff and all. We pay you to be suspicious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, Bear. Think what you like. But if you were to share more of the decision making, things would get better around here. If Sorrow wants to have more say in the tavern, give her a shot\u2014what the hell, right? I\u2019d bet good money Sully would welcome the help. Maybe it\u2019d even prevent incidents like that fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl\u2019s got no time for all that,\u201d Bear said.</p><p>\u201cThat brings up my next point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many points you got, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>Billy ignored the gibe and pressed on, \u201cSorrow could use some help around the place. An assistant maybe.\u201d Bear\u2019s eyes goggled at that, but Billy refused to give him a chance to interrupt. \u201cShe runs around like a one-armed paperhanger. The girl is in her twenties, and as far as I can see, her closest friends are a bunch of retirees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura\u2019s back in town,\u201d Bear protested. \u201cShe\u2019s been helping.\u201d His tone was firm, but it sounded to Billy like the man was beginning to lose steam.</p><p>\u201cYou need to hire someone,\u201d Billy insisted. \u201cIn addition to dealing with things like repairs, and budget, and reservations, you\u2019ve got Sorrow on room-cleaning duty. For God\u2019s sake, Bear. If you hired someone, if you had more help around the place, you could handle more business. You\u2019d eventually bring in more tourists. Think on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d The man\u2019s expression no longer made him look like he\u2019d swallowed a box of nails.</p><p>Billy breathed a sigh of relief to see it. \u201cAll done,\u201d he told him with a decisive nod. He suspected he\u2019d gotten through, just a bit.</p><p>Bear was the one person around here who could use some standing up to, and yet not many people did. His kids knew how to rebel against him, maybe. But rebelling against the man and challenging him were two different things.</p><p>\u201cThen if you\u2019re finished flapping your jaw, let\u2019s go see what happened to my power.\u201d The man was proud; he wouldn\u2019t admit anything, but hopefully an attitude adjustment was in their future.</p><p>Billy clapped him on the back. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>They huddled in the dimness of the garage, with Bear flicking the fuses on and off. Billy tipped the flashlight, illuminating a tangle of frayed wires under the circuit breaker panel. \u201cIt\u2019s all chewed up.\u201d</p><p>Bear grunted. \u201cRaccoon maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Billy peered closer, certain that what he was looking at wasn\u2019t the work of any animal. Raccoons just weren\u2019t interested in fuse boxes. \u201cEither way, you\u2019ll need to call an electrician.\u201d</p><p>Bear creaked to standing. \u201cThat\u2019ll cost a pretty penny.\u201d His lip twitched as he considered this news. He didn\u2019t look pleased. \u201cNothing for it, though. I\u2019ll get Eddie on the phone.\u201d</p><p>Just a couple of hours later, and it was all patched up. Eddie Jessup had come straight over\u2014one half of Jessup Brothers Construction, his schedule had been miraculously open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all set,\u201d Eddie said, joining everyone in the living room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done?\u201d Doubt was written across Bear\u2019s face. \u201cAll fixed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear Bailey. When I say \u2018all set,\u2019 I mean all set.\u201d</p><p>Bear harrumphed, admitting under his breath, \u201cI guess we didn\u2019t need Damien after all.\u201d</p><p>Billy looked over the man\u2019s shoulder to catch Sorrow\u2019s eye. They shared a smile. \u201cI guess we didn\u2019t,\u201d he said expansively.</p><p>Suppressing a giggle, Sorrow stood and handed Eddie a foil-wrapped bunch of fresh-baked cookies. \u201cI made these before the power went out. Spice molasses.\u201d</p><p>Eddie took them eagerly. \u201cI\u2019d have done the work for free if I\u2019d known I was going to get some of your cookies. I swear they get better every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to thank you for getting here so fast. We have some guests arriving tonight, and the last thing we need is a power outage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trouble fitting you in,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI had a hole in my schedule.\u201d</p><p>Billy grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d It wasn\u2019t hard to guess why his schedule had a hole in it. \u201cI saw those skis tossed in the back of your pickup.\u201d</p><p>Eddie laughed, and it was an easy, rolling sound. The guy lived and breathed outdoor sports, and had the snow-tan and premature smile and squint lines to prove it. He was the type to veer off the side of the road whenever he spotted a hill that looked dangerous enough to be interesting, hikeable enough to climb, and snowy enough to ski back down.</p><p>\u201cYou caught me,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cWhat can I say? It snowed last night. Not much, but just enough for some fresh tracks out east of the falls.\u201d</p><p>Bear was staring at the cookies in Eddie\u2019s hands, apparently stuck on the concept that he might\u2019ve somehow wrangled the electrical work for free. \u201cThat mean you\u2019re not going to charge extra for coming early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear. I\u2019m offended. But\u201d\u2014Eddie put down his toolbox and pulled on his jacket\u2014\u201cI will accept partial payment at the tavern in the form of something tall and cold.\u201d His smile froze as Laura walked into the room. His eyes tracked her, and Billy heard him mumble, \u201cSpeaking of tall and cold...\u201d</p><p>The guy was looking slack-jawed, and no surprise there. Clad in only a pair of short shorts and a see-through mesh top over her jog bra, Laura was dressed\u2014barely\u2014for a workout.</p><p>\u201cYou can shut your mouth now,\u201d she said, not meeting Eddie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>That brought the guy out of it. A huge smile split his face. \u201cWell, well, well. The Big Bad Bailey Sister is still here. Whatcha running from on that treadmill, little girl?\u201d</p><p>Laura tossed a towel over the monitor and climbed onto the machine. Billy could\u2019ve sworn she was blushing. \u201cIt\u2019s an elliptical trainer,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>Sorrow made a snorting noise that sounded suspiciously like a swallowed laugh.</p><p>Billy read her mind and began backing out of the room. \u201cWell then. You all look like you\u2019ve got it under control here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sorrow was quick to add. \u201cI told Billy I\u2019d help him with...a thing.\u201d Catching his eye, she jerked her head toward the door. The moment they were safe in his SUV, she said, \u201cThat was...\u201d</p><p>\u201c...something else,\u201d Billy finished for her. When their laughing died down, he said, \u201cAt least I seem to have risen in your dad\u2019s estimation. I\u2019ve gone from accused to merely a person of interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Dad\u2019s a \u2018guilty until proven innocent\u2019 kinda guy.\u201d</p><p>Billy was thoughtful for a minute, then asked, \u201cWas he that curmudgeonly before his stroke?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe was always a tough guy. But no, he\u2019s gotten worse. Isn\u2019t that what they say happens with age? Can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks, and all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so.\u201d Though Billy wasn\u2019t entirely convinced. In fact, he thought he had the man pretty well figured. \u201cMight be that he\u2019s just frustrated he can\u2019t get around like he did before.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, letting the idea sink in. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been thinking about what you said before. It\u2019s got to sting, letting go of so many responsibilities.\u201d But then she laughed. \u201cEither way, I thought his head was going to explode when he lost power to the TV.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, \u201cspeaking of electricity, there sure were sparks flying between Laura and Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura? No way. You thought my dad was proud? My sister will gain twenty pounds, sprout wings, and fly before she hooks up with a Sierra Falls man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure am glad you didn\u2019t get that whole dieting gene. A man likes something to hold on to.\u201d He reached across the car to squeeze her thigh. \u201cAnd hey\u201d\u2014his fingers slid up to give that luscious rump a playful tweak\u2014\u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with Sierra Falls men?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed away with a squeak. \u201cYou know there is nothing wrong with Sierra Falls men. We attract only the finest.\u201d It was her turn to reach across, resting her hand on his thigh, growing thoughtful. \u201cLaura hightailed it out of here after high school and wants nothing to do with the place. I\u2019m sure she pictures herself in some urban loft somewhere, shacked up with a dot-com bazillionaire.\u201d</p><p>Billy cut his eyes from the road long enough to give her a perplexed look. \u201cThen why is she still hanging around?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow that\u2019s the question.\u201d Sorrow leaned back, kicking her feet up on the dash. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s hoping her dream bazillionaire will drop from the sky and check into the lodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s something else going on with her. Have you thought about just asking her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d she said, dismissing it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean in the middle of an argument. I mean, you could have a sisterly heart-to-heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh, no thanks,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cI\u2019ve grown fond of my head and would prefer to keep it attached to my body.\u201d</p><p>Billy let out a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious she\u2019s wound pretty tight, but...I don\u2019t know...She was a pretty big help at Emerald\u2019s memorial. Maybe you underestimate her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess she has done a lot for the festival,\u201d Sorrow admitted. \u201cShe asked if I\u2019d cook a special gold rush dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess it kind of is.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s constantly online, doing whatever she does. Some historical journal is even coming out next week to do a write-up on Buck Larsen and his days in Sierra Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d Billy said enthusiastically. \u201cThat\u2019s something. It\u2019ll bring in more tourists. It does seem like you have more guests than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d she said grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem, then? The festival is coming together. You\u2019re drawing more visitors. Your sister wants you to cook for everyone. She must be good for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this buzz is great, sure. But I\u2019m totally overwhelmed. The place is falling apart at the seams. Every time I fix one thing, something else breaks. Apparently, somebody may or may not be out to get me. Getting more visitors is all well and good, but it means more mouths to feed, more rooms to keep perfect, more things to stay on top of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overwhelmed, and it seems like Laura wants to help. It\u2019s not like you love every aspect of running the business. Why don\u2019t you let her have a crack at it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave a crack at it...\u201d Sorrow\u2019s feet slid from the dash, hitting the floor with a thump. \u201cGuess who\u2019s going to clean up the mess when her whole crack at it thing fails? Who\u2019s going to pick up the pieces when Laura decides she\u2019s done and takes off again?\u201d</p><p>Alarms sounded in Billy\u2019s head. There was some tricky history between the sisters\u2014Sorrow had been more hurt than he\u2019d realized, harboring it more deeply than he\u2019d guessed.</p><p>He made a snap decision to broach a topic that maybe wasn\u2019t ready for broaching. \u201cWell,\u201d he said gently, \u201cif she decides to take off again, I think we might have some other help for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Sorrow gave a rueful laugh. \u201cFirst the Laura hard sell. You\u2019re not going to foist Ruby and Pearl on me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than that. Bear\u2019s hiring you an assistant. At least I think he will.\u201d He waited, excited and anxious to see her response.</p><p>But she looked at him as though he\u2019d just spoken in Greek. \u201cAssistant? What kind of assistant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe helpful kind,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kind who\u2019ll make the beds, and answer the phones, and do the grocery runs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn assistant,\u201d she said in a dreamy voice. \u201cHow fancy. I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll need one. Because I\u2019m taking you to Silver City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember my chef buddy?\u201d</p><p>It took her a second to follow him. \u201cYou mean the freezer guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one. He\u2019s arranged for you to shadow him for a night at his restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out! I\u2019ll get to work under him like a sous-chef?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yeah.\u201d He stole a glance at her. The way her sweater clung to her curves gave him a good idea of what\u2014and whom\u2014he\u2019d like to get under.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she marveled. \u201cWorking with a real chef. How can I ever thank you?\u201d</p><p>He practically skidded into his driveway. \u201cI\u2019ve got some ideas.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-four</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d Billy asked, his voice low in the dark. He pulled her closer to cradle her body more snugly to his, and she felt him begin to rouse at her back. \u201cI could try to take your mind off things.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and rolled around to face him. \u201cIf you take my mind off of it any more tonight, I\u2019m afraid I might have trouble walking tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay in bed all day. My bed. I can protect and serve, and all that.\u201d He tugged her closer to prove his point, but reading the anxiety on her face, his tone turned somber. \u201cYou know you\u2019re safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it. But...\u201d Sorrow tried to relax\u2014Billy was being so charming and sexy\u2014but her mind was going a million miles an hour. Someone had been inside her house, probably even while she\u2019d been at home. The idea chilled her. It was too much like something out of a horror movie. \u201cIt\u2019s just...someone broke into our garage. While we were home. It feels so creepy. So personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has been personal all along. But I will protect you. We will find the bastard.\u201d</p><p>A sharp blade of moonlight shone through the slats in his blinds, illuminating him. She drew strength from those strong features\u2014even in the shadows, she could see his resolve. She had every faith in him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but think about her father and mother still at home. It seemed like one day her father had been the strong daddy swinging her up on his shoulders, and then the next she was fretting over his ability to walk up and down the stairs unassisted. And now he was acting so stubborn, refusing to accept these were more than simple accidents. What would happen if someone broke in again? What if next time whoever was after them did something worse than just snip some wires? \u201cI\u2019m worried about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour folks?\u201d Of course he\u2019d known exactly whom she meant, and at her nod, he told her firmly, \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. Eddie said he\u2019d crash in one of your spare rooms. Those Jessup boys are tough\u2014he can handle whatever comes up.\u201d But then he laughed low. \u201cThe question is, will Eddie survive your sister? There are sparks between those two.\u201d</p><p>She felt a smile flicker on her face. \u201cLaura totally denies it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the line...the lady protests too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yeah.\u201d</p><p>They both grew quiet, and when he spoke again, his tone was grave. \u201cI hate to say it, but without you there, I don\u2019t think anything else will happen tonight.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, chilled to her bones. \u201cWho\u2019s doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever it is, I\u2019ll find him and throw his ass in jail so fast his head will spin. If I don\u2019t wring his neck first.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow had to laugh at Billy\u2019s vehemence. \u201cThanks. You know, I believe you will.\u201d</p><p>They lay in the dark a while longer as he idly stroked his hand up and down her back. She sighed\u2014she felt safe with Billy. Safe in his house. In his arms.</p><p>But she still couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He slipped out of bed and pulled on his boxers. As he handed her his robe, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d He grabbed an old pair of wool socks for her, too. \u201cThis time of night, you\u2019ll want these.\u201d</p><p>She swam in the green and navy plaid flannel robe, but there was nothing more intimate than the feeling of wearing her man\u2019s clothes. They walked downstairs hand in hand, and when she spoke again, she couldn\u2019t help the excited curiosity in her voice. \u201cWhere\u2019re we going? It\u2019s got to be past two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making you a cup of tea. And\u201d\u2014he snagged her purse from where she\u2019d dropped it onto the dining room table\u2014\u201cwe\u2019ll need this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need my purse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need what\u2019s in your purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in my\u2014?\u201d Her eyes lit, watching him extract the thick packet. \u201cOhh. The letters.\u201d Ever since the fire, she\u2019d been anxious to keep Sorrow Crabtree\u2019s letters safe and carried them with her, tied in a neat bundle that she kept wrapped in a Ziploc bag. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t just their historical value to her family and the town that had her so careful. As troubles around the lodge escalated, so did her feeling of connection with her great-great-great-grandmother. Her ancestor had faced struggles Sorrow couldn\u2019t begin to contemplate. So many of those pioneer women must have. And she figured, if her ancestor could weather the old days as a single mother, then she could buck up and deal with a little stress at the lodge.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed how you read these every possible free moment.\u201d He helped her into the kitchen chair and gave her shoulders a squeeze. \u201cHave you finished reading them yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going slowly.\u201d She carefully pulled the collection from their layers of plastic and contemplated the paper, crisp and yellow with age. \u201cHer story takes my mind off my troubles. I want to prolong it.\u201d</p> <p>She wanted to savor every moment reading them, and the desire to understand what the older Sorrow endured had only intensified since Emerald\u2019s death. Why hadn\u2019t she ever asked Marlene\u2019s mother more questions? About how Sierra Falls used to be? About Marlene\u2019s childhood? So many simple things that\u2019d never been asked and would never be answered now.</p><p>She half listened as Billy puttered around the kitchen, getting out tea bags and filling the kettle with water. He asked, \u201cWould you read one to me?\u201d</p><p>She popped her head up to make sure he was being serious. Her breath caught to look at him, scruffy in the dim light, wearing just his T-shirt and boxers. She couldn\u2019t believe this guy was hers. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He stopped his bustling to pin her with his eyes. Standing still, he held the teakettle poised in midair over the stovetop. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m in this for keeps. What makes you happy makes me happy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said simply. She darted her eyes back down, overcome with emotion. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had expressed an interest in her happiness alone. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd hey, it\u2019s not exactly a stretch, either.\u201d Billy was still by the sink and hadn\u2019t caught her sudden shyness. \u201cThose letters you found are amazing. To think Buck Larsen was prospecting for gold before he was elected as one of the first California representatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he must\u2019ve bought his post with gold rush money.\u201d The man was infamous in California for having appeared out of the blue, replacing his political advisors with businessmen, then resigning midterm when elected life bored him. Rumors about bribes had followed him out the door. Larsen went on to build a railway empire, but not much was known about his life before he burst onto the scene.</p><p>\u201cI guess all his money didn\u2019t come from bribes after all. Maybe some of it came from gold.\u201d The kettle whistled, and Billy poured their tea and joined her at the table. He gestured to the letters. \u201cWhere\u2019d you leave off?\u201d</p><p>She shuffled through. \u201cLet\u2019s see...last thing I knew, Sorrow Crabtree had been bemoaning the town\u2019s judgmental biddies.\u201d</p><p>He gave a thoughtful shrug. \u201cCan\u2019t have been easy, pregnant and alone. Life was hard and cheap back then\u2014especially for women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you the strong, sensitive type?\u201d She gave him a playful smile and squeezed his hand. He\u2019d been right to bring out the letters\u2014the more they chatted, the further away her troubles at the lodge seemed. \u201cBut you know, back then it wasn\u2019t just the men who made names for themselves. I read that some of those gold rush dancers made a fortune.\u201d</p> <p>Billy leaned closer to scan the writing. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve seen too many Westerns, but I bet there were other types of women than just dancers. You know, those kind of women.\u201d</p><p>She exclaimed, \u201cA \u2018lady of the night\u2019? She couldn\u2019t have been, could she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead it and see.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow traced her finger down the page to find her place. \u201cHere\u2019s where I stopped. She wrote, \u2018Thank the Lord for Madame Lizzie. I know what you\u2019d say, you\u2019d be like to call her a harlot or worse. But, to me, she\u2019s my angel. She invited me to live with the Parlour Ladies, but she don\u2019t make me dance no more, nor worry about any of that other business on account of my swole belly. Swole with your child, Buck. Maybe I can see how you\u2019d walk away from me, but I don\u2019t understand how you could walk away from your son.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Amused, Billy raised a brow. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make her do that other business?\u201d</p><p>She put the letter down and met his eye. \u201cWow. She moved into a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA house of ill-repute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what you said.\u201d She put the page down to sip her tea thoughtfully. \u201cIt seems that the Madame was a Madam Madame.\u201d</p> <p>Billy playfully guided her mug back down to the table and handed her the letter. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop reading now.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a broad smile and found her spot again. \u201c\u2018Some folk carry a Bible in their hand and judgment in their eyes. But not the Madame. She has only kindness in her heart. Says we women need to stick together. I get the idea maybe she had a man who left her just like you did me. But I\u2019m done being angry. It burned through me, and I\u2019ve vowed to rid my heart of every last bit. Because each day goes by, and love fills my heart instead, feeling the strong kicks of my baby. My baby, Buck.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She put the letter down. \u201cJeez, he sounds like such a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the infamous Buck Larsen knocked up a dance hall girl and left her alone and pregnant in a pioneer town. He\u2019s even more of a bastard than everyone thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant, alone, and living in a whorehouse,\u201d she marveled. \u201cAt least it sounds like she didn\u2019t have to do the...extra duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must\u2019ve done something to earn her keep.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow nodded and read on. \u201cWait, listen to this. \u2018Trouble came round this morning. I was in the parlour when some men came. They looked at me funny, all demanding like, wanting to buy my time. They said some nasty, un-Christian things, and I had to say a quiet prayer not to curse you, Buck. But then just when it seemed I was a goner, the Sheriff stepped in. I suppose Madame Lizzie done told him about my babe, and he sent those men packing.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Billy grinned. \u201cSee, we sheriff types are good.\u201d</p><p>She beamed back at him. \u201cToo bad Sorrow Crabtree ended up with the mailman instead of the sheriff. That would\u2019ve been just too cool.\u201d She flipped through and saw they\u2019d just about reached the end of that one. \u201cShould I stop? It\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. You can\u2019t stop now.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow felt her grin grow even wider. She loved these old letters, loved getting to know her ancestor this way, and she was positively tickled that Billy honestly seemed to enjoy them just as much. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, flipping to a new page full of cramped script. The beginning spoke about mundane things\u2014the food, the coming weather\u2014but then they finally reached a juicier bit. \u201cYou said she had do something to earn her keep; well here we go. \u2018Madame L says from now on I\u2019m just to work at the cooking and laundry. It\u2019s hard work and my hands bleed from it, but it\u2019s better than lying under a man. Some of them come round with their suits and pocket watches, and they remind me of you. And I\u2019d rather my hands bleed, Buck. How do you like that?\u2019</p><p>\u201c\u2018One fellow came by yesterday, had with him a newspaper from Sacremennto. And whose name would you figure was on the front page? Mister Buck Larsen, all right. News is you were voted to Congress Man. My compliments. I guess the folk of California believed your promises just like I did. Fools, all of em.\u2019</p><p>\u201c\u2018But I tell you, Buck, maybe it stung extra bad because today is an angry day. None of my dresses fit no more. I let them out all I could, and now I had to sew an extra panel just to cover my belly but all I had to use was an old bit of calico from my apron. And I tell you, Buck, that bit of calico makes me spitting mad. At you. Angry how you had your pretty words for me. You told me I was so lovely. Like a winter bloom on the mountainside, you said. But you plucked that bloom and left me, no good for no man now.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She looked over the paper at Billy, making a funny face. \u201cYikes. Pregnancy hormones, you think?\u201d</p><p>Billy raised his hands in surrender. \u201cI\u2019m not touching that comment with a ten-foot pole.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and read on. \u201c\u2018I shoulda known watching you glad-hand folk the way you did. You wanted me on your arm, so pretty you said. Like a picture. You\u2019da shown a picture more care though. The moment the Rassmussens came to town, with their fancy Foreignn money, you jumped fast enough for their girl. \u2019Tis unkind of me to say, but I get comfort thinking of those teeth of hers like a Truckee River Beaver, and trying to picture you kissing on her. I swear, I hope you have a flock of beaver-faced children. Not this babe in my belly though. Hes a fine boy. I can feel it.\u2019</p><p>\u201c\u2018And he\u2019s getting big too. I move slow now, but it don\u2019t matter. Madame L lets me hide in the kitchen with my cooking, and it\u2019s fine by me. I work and I think about the places I\u2019ll take my boy some day.\u2019\u201d</p><p>A sensation overwhelmed Sorrow, of a connection across generations. \u201cShe liked to cook. It was an escape for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you,\u201d Billy said quietly.</p><p>She studied him. Stubble was faint along that strong jaw and his hair went every which way. Being with Billy like this, in the middle of the night serenity of the kitchen, she knew a fierce stab of emotion. She felt loved and complete. \u201cYou get it, don\u2019t you? Get me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d He scooted his chair closer, and gently swept the hair from her brow, tucking it behind her ear. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the luckiest man alive that you\u2019ve let me in to see.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-five</p><p>When Sully woke that morning, he knew at once\u2014it was in the smell of the air, in the way he\u2019d thrown the covers from the bed in the night. Spring had sprung, no doubt about it.</p><p>His bare feet hit the timber planks of his cabin\u2019s floor, and he drew up the shades. The snow had melted to a thin, crusty layer. Water dripped from the eaves, catching the dawn sunlight like crystal. The sky was clear, and the birds were chirping. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been waiting for just such a day.</p><p>He made a quick call to Sorrow, and was surprised when she answered groggily. Usually she was the first up and at \u2019em. He smiled to himself\u2014it was none of his business, but still, he hoped it was the sheriff who\u2019d made her so sleepy that morning. The girl deserved to find happiness.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d she said, when he asked for a personal day. In fact, she sounded downright excited about it, and he\u2019d suspected she would. Any excuse to get into that kitchen, cooking up an exotic breakfast confection sure to aggravate her father.</p> <p>Anxious to surprise Marlene before she headed out for the day, he worked fast, making a picnic out of whatever basics he had on hand. Assembling a fruit salad, deviled eggs, bread, cheeses, juice, a thermos of coffee. Tossing it all in his pack.</p><p>On his way out the door, he cast a longing look at his Harley. It might\u2019ve been spring, but a woman like Marlene wasn\u2019t ready for the bike. Yet.</p><p>She answered the door, and it took his breath away. She was such an elegant lady, always pulled together, her clothes and hair just-so. But this morning, she wore jeans and a no-frills sweater, in a red that made her cheeks glow.</p><p>\u201cTom.\u201d She was shocked to see him. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Is something the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, something\u2019s the matter.\u201d He knew what grief was like. Though Marlene still had her aunts, the routine she\u2019d had with her mom would be hardwired into her. She\u2019d be hopping up throughout the day, thinking it time to dress her mother, or feed her, or help with the bathroom, and maybe she\u2019d make it all the way across the room before remembering that Emerald was no longer there to need her help. Marlene\u2019s days would feel long and empty for some time to come, and he\u2019d help her avoid that emptiness if he could. He held out his hand. \u201cYou need to come with me.\u201d</p> <p>She touched a hand to her cheek. \u201cI need to finish putting on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour face sure looks on to me. Prettier than this spring morning.\u201d He was certain he gaped at the sight\u2014he couldn\u2019t peel his eyes from her, and if she didn\u2019t hear the truth in his words, then she was plum deaf. He repeated earnestly, \u201cCome with me, Marlene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my coat.\u201d She nodded gravely, grabbing her jacket and purse from a rack by the door and joining him on the porch.</p><p>She\u2019d jumped into action, and Tom forced himself to keep a straight face. She really was going with him.</p><p>Her hands fumbled with her keys, and he gently took them from her hands, locking the door for her. \u201cWhere are Ruby and Pearl?\u201d</p><p>She widened her eyes, and it made her appear shell-shocked. \u201cShopping,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cThey took the old pickup all the way to Silver City. There aren\u2019t even any sales right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood for them.\u201d He opened the car door for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the emergency?\u201d she asked once he\u2019d gotten in. \u201cIt\u2019s not the lodge, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He pulled out of her driveway, headed for Route 88.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe falls,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an emergency at the falls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d He pulled his eyes from the road for long enough to savor her wide-eyed confusion. \u201cThere\u2019s a picnic at the falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA picnic?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur picnic.\u201d He gestured to the pack thrown onto the backseat. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to hit midfifties today. I thought we\u2019d take a brisk walk out to the falls. We can sit on the rocks\u2014they get nice and warm in the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hiking out to the falls?\u201d She still sounded flummoxed, and it was endearing. \u201cI don\u2019t have the right shoes for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got snowshoes in the back,\u201d he said with a straight face, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll come to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnowshoes?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMarlene. I saw your shoes. They\u2019ll do just fine. I was out that way last week. The old fire road is clear, and the trail to the falls is pretty chewed up and dried out by now. Shouldn\u2019t give you any trouble. It\u2019s a short walk anyway.\u201d</p><p>The fire road was a longer walk\u2014about two miles\u2014but the day was glorious. Even though there hadn\u2019t been snow in days, thick blankets of it clung to the pine boughs, shrouding them in heavy silence. Once on the trail and in the trees, glimmering patches of ice and shards of sunlight made the land seem frozen in time.</p><p>They caught their first glimpse of the falls, and Marlene\u2019s breath caught. \u201cIt\u2019s magnificent.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d whispered, and the reverence and awe in her voice made his chest swell. He\u2019d brought her here.</p><p>Her pace slowed as she took it all in. The water was flowing again after the long winter, but patches of ice still clung in shadows along the edges, an iridescent white blue. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cThen come on, princess. Time for your feast.\u201d</p><p>The fresh air made their appetites boundless, and Marlene was devouring the countryside with her eyes as ravenously as she was eating her brunch. \u201cI\u2019ve never been here in the winter,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>He put down his fork, his interest only in her. The sunlight dappled through the trees onto her cheek, and her expression of awe made her seem twenty years younger. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite time to come,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She took a bite of fruit salad and shook her head, staring at him as she chewed.</p><p>He raised a wary brow. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet another surprise from you, Tom Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not generally the biggest talker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more a man of action,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>She made a startled oh sound that gratified the man in him. He asked, \u201cIs it the action part that surprises you?\u201d He heard the huskiness in his voice and saw an answering flush on her cheeks. She seemed so uncertain, all he wanted was to wrap her in his arms and take care of things for a while.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s that...just when I think I know you, you open your mouth and say the darndest thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s this, then?\u201d He took her hand. \u201cMarlene Kidd Jessup, once the weather warms up, I\u2019m bringing you here on my bike.\u201d</p><p>She coughed as she swallowed. \u201cOh goodness. I could never ride a motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not,\u201d she repeated, considering it. She opened her mouth, hesitated, then shut it again. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know why not, precisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be your own woman, Marlene. Heed your own heart.\u201d He was thinking of her mother\u2019s last words, and he knew Marlene must\u2019ve been thinking the same.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know how I\u2019d go about that,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI could help you. We could figure it out together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we?\u201d She sighed. \u201cSometimes I wonder if it\u2019s not over for me. I\u2019m not sure how it happened or when, but I woke up one day and I was old. And now all I have in me is to mind my aunts, nag my grown children, and wait for the years to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to me, your aunts do a damned fine job of minding themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems that way, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d A grudging half smile spread across her face. \u201cSo there it is: my kids are done with me, my mother is gone, and not even my aunts need me, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you best get living for your own self.\u201d He wanted to touch her, to comfort her with his body. But there\u2019d be time enough for that. He\u2019d let her do some more grieving. Let her come to her own conclusions, get back on her own two feet. And then one day soon, he\u2019d take Marlene, and they\u2019d take off together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Her eyes brightened, clearer and more vivid than he\u2019d ever seen them. \u201cAnd you\u2019re on, Tom Sullivan. When the weather clears, we\u2019re getting on that bike of yours.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-six</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry.\u201d Sorrow shepherded the couple out the door, doing her best to carry their suitcases with numbed fingers. Waking up to screaming tended to do that to a girl\u2014dump adrenaline in her veins, leaving behind chilled and deadened limbs. \u201cWe\u2019ll refund your stay, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet you will,\u201d the woman said, looking as pinched as her buttoned-up collar.</p><p>Her husband angrily snatched back their roller bags, shoving them in the trunk of their car. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t expect to encounter wildlife on one\u2019s research trip.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow began to say, \u201cWe generally don\u2019t get bears\u201d but the slamming car doors cut her off.</p><p>She stomped into the kitchen, muttering, \u201cNewsflash, Professor. One does generally encounter wildlife in the damned mountains.\u201d</p><p>Her mom was standing at the sink where she\u2019d been watching the proceedings from the window. \u201cGood Lord in heaven, that woman has a scream to wake the dead.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow leaned against the counter and blew out a sigh. \u201cI guess all their copious research didn\u2019t uncover how to handle a simple encounter with a black bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, honey.\u201d Her mom led her to the table. \u201cYour hands are shaking.\u201d</p><p>She shook them out. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I need to call Scott.\u201d Marlene\u2019s second oldest boy was their local park ranger. If there was a bear foraging through the trash cans of Sierra Falls, Scott Jessup needed to know about it.</p><p>She got up to pace, staring out the window as she called. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d fixed the stupid bear box, but it was swinging wide open again this morning, trash exploded everywhere\u2014a veritable bear buffet. Someone must\u2019ve tampered with it. There was no other explanation. Someone tampered with her bear box, knowing it\u2019d summon every bear within sniffing radius. They were lucky there hadn\u2019t been a whole gaggle of them to surprise their lodgers.</p><p>\u201cScott\u2019s on his way,\u201d she told her mom as she put down the phone. \u201cWhat do you call a group of bears? Like, there\u2019s a gaggle of geese, a murder of crows, and a what of bears?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, honey. Relax.\u201d Her mom foisted a cup of tea on her. \u201cDrink this.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow smelled it. Chamomile.</p><p>\u201cDrink it, Sorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad\u2019s gonna flip out.\u201d As she took the mug, Sorrow cast another look out the window. \u201cThat couple couldn\u2019t get out of here fast enough. We could\u2019ve used that money. And that mess...\u201d</p><p>Her mom pointed to the table. \u201cSit yourself down for a second. The trash will wait. And your father will survive.\u201d</p><p>She thought about what Billy had said about Dad. Her father was from a very different generation, one that didn\u2019t have therapy or talk through their problems. No Chicken Soup for the Soul for men like Bear Bailey. There were a bunch of ways he could be more vital around the lodge\u2014he just wasn\u2019t seeing them.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, sitting with her mom at the table, \u201cDad can\u2019t stand up for very long, but I bet if I dug out his old fishing stool and set him up with his tools, he could fix the bear box.\u201d</p><p>Her mom beamed. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely idea. What a wonderful thing for you to think of.\u201d</p> <p>Wow. Gauging from her mother\u2019s immediate and grateful reaction, Billy really had been on to something. \u201cYeah, no problem. I can think of other things, too.\u201d Her mind was already spinning with possibilities. \u201cFor sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Mom began slowly, \u201cI think your father has given up a little. Be patient with him. His bark is worse than his bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set him up just as soon as I clean up that mess. Ugh.\u201d She shuddered, just thinking about it. There were chicken carcasses, assorted bones, half-eaten bags of chips\u2014it was a disaster. \u201cDid you see it out there? Do we really have that many leftovers at the tavern? What a waste. I need to talk to Sully about that.\u201d</p><p>Mom stirred honey into her tea. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sister? Maybe she can help clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaura? It\u2019s an emergency, Mom. Duh. For emergencies, Laura is nowhere in sight.\u201d</p><p>Mom reached across and put a gentle hand on hers. \u201cBreathe, Sorrow. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d</p> <p>She blew on her tea, thinking how Billy had said some variation of the same thing. Maybe it was time for her to unclench, ask for help. \u201cOkay, Mom. You\u2019re right again. I\u2019ll wait till Laura gets back to start the cleanup.\u201d</p><p>But a couple of hours passed, and when Sorrow felt like she could no longer wait, she called her sister\u2019s cell. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning errands,\u201d Laura said, and then Sorrow heard her whisper \u201cThank you\u201d to somebody.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? I just needed you to pick up milk and some toilet paper. How long does that take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove out to Silver City.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow froze in place. \u201cFor groceries? That\u2019s my car you took. If I\u2019d known you were going to empty the tank I wouldn\u2019t have let you borrow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy trunk\u2019s not big enough. I needed some other stuff, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other stuff?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019m going to be staying in Sierra Falls for a while,\u201d Laura said, \u201cbut I totally don\u2019t have the clothes for it.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow thought her head might explode. \u201cYou went clothes shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Jeez, Sorrow. Chill out. You have things like hiking boots, why can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. You\u2019ve decided to stay...because you saw an opportunity to accessorize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Laura\u2019s tone frosted over.</p><p>\u201cIt means you talk big about wanting to help around here, but I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so unfair,\u201d Laura snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve come up with a million ideas, and you\u2019ve shot down each one without even listening.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow didn\u2019t give her time to elaborate. She\u2019d been harboring these feelings for years, and they burst to the surface, her voice coming louder, faster. \u201cYou took off for the city the moment you graduated, but it looks like you failed there, or at least I\u2019m guessing you did because you\u2019re sure not talking, and by the way, saying you\u2019re taking a sabbatical, whatever the heck that is, tells me nothing, though apparently it involves you meandering home for a while where you can buy a new pair of hiking boots. You came home so that, what? So we can take care of you? You can\u2019t just drop in like nothing\u2019s happened, like it was no big deal that you disappeared for years. Like you\u2019re still the big sister in charge. It takes more than dressing like you live here to make you an active, contributing member of this household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am totally an active member,\u201d Laura shouted, finally managing to cut in. \u201cI\u2019m practically pulling this festival together solo. But do I ever bug you about it? No. Did I have you help me do online publicity, or ask for money for the ads I placed in Bay Area newspapers? No. Did I\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow interrupted, her tone icy and measured, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to do any of that stuff. All kinds of weird stuff is happening, the lodge is falling apart around us, and frankly, it shocks me that you haven\u2019t even noticed. So yeah, stupid Buck Larsen is the last thing on my mind at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Laura barked a sarcastic laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t get all holier than thou on me. Our lodge is also the last thing on your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d Sorrow grit her teeth, bracing for it.</p><p>\u201cMeaning, you spend more time with that sheriff than you do in your own house.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow wanted to scream. \u201cAre you so bored with your own life you came home to meddle in mine? Why are you even here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo help the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, right.\u201d Sorrow rolled her eyes. \u201cBecause you\u2019re sooo committed to Mom and Dad. How do you expect me to believe you\u2019re here to stay when, way back, you fled town as fast as you could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be honest?\u201d Laura asked in a flat voice.</p><p>Sorrow muttered, \u201cThis should be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost my job, Sorrow. My boyfriend broke up with me. And I feel like a failure. I wake up every morning, and my life is empty. I\u2019ve dated all the wrong guys, chased all the wrong things. I\u2019ve got my stupid condo, and my stupid car, but there\u2019s nobody around who cares about me.\u201d</p><p>She had a moment of feeling stunned. But then she chalked it up to Laura just being dramatic. Again. Things were never that bad with her. Boyfriend\u2014she\u2019d probably only gone on two dates with the guy. Her sister was an expert with men, just like she was an expert with everything.</p><p>\u201cCry me a river, Laura. I am so sorry that driving your Beemer around San Francisco is giving you a crisis of the soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came home to get back to my roots, if you want to know. I need to figure my life out, and I need to be home to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard your dramas before, Laura. But I\u2019ve got my own dramas to worry about.\u201d She looked out the window and felt a pang of guilt. Had she been spending too much time with Billy? Was it so obvious she\u2019d been paying less attention to business since he\u2019d come into her life? \u201cLook. I\u2019ve got to go. Don\u2019t bring my car back with an empty tank.\u201d She hung up.</p><p>The new leaf Sorrow had meant to turn was turned back again. She angrily snapped on a pair of rubber gloves, grabbed a box of heavy-duty trash bags, and got to work.</p><p>Some time later, the door slammed, and Mom came out. \u201cI thought you were waiting for Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, dealing with it myself.\u201d Under her breath, she added, \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Her mother wrapped her cardigan tight around her chest to ward off the cold. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let her take my car to run a couple of errands.\u201d Sorrow used her forearm to wipe the hair from her brow. \u201cBut apparently she decided to disappear instead.\u201d</p><p>Would that she could disappear for a while. Would that she could go shopping\u2014she\u2019d get herself some sexy new lingerie. She\u2019d shower off the stink of tavern scraps, put on bits of lacy silk under her jeans and sweater, and go to Billy\u2019s.</p><p>It had become her haven. He had become her haven.</p><p>She\u2019d been going to his place a lot. She\u2019d worried it was too much too soon, but he insisted he wanted her there as much as she wanted to be there. She worried they might get sick of each other, but instead of the magic wearing off, it intensified every time they were together. He came to the tavern almost every day for lunch, and every time she saw him, her heart skipped a beat. She was a goner...head over heels for the guy. And better yet, she had the impression he felt the same.</p><p>\u201cCan Billy help?\u201d her mom asked hopefully. Sorrow had been gazing into the distance, and the woman had clearly guessed what her daughter was thinking about.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cOn duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d she said, even though she knew she could. Billy would make time for her. But as much as she wanted to hear his voice, she made a point of not bugging him during his working hours.</p><p>They heard the phone ring, and her mom ran inside. A minute later, she was peeking out the door, her hand on the receiver. \u201cIt\u2019s Eddie Jessup,\u201d she said, sounding perplexed. \u201cHe says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. Urgent?\u201d Cold panic prickled up her arms\u2014Eddie never called the house phone. Whenever she had construction issues, she contacted him or his brother Jack on her cell. She jogged inside, pulling off her gloves.</p><p>The call was quick. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>Her mother barely waited for her to hang up before she asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She met Mom\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s been an accident.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-seven</p><p>Billy held Sorrow in the antiseptic waiting room. She leaned against his chest, and he willed strength into her. She\u2019d need it.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming to get me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He\u2019d come over right away, speeding Sorrow to Silver City Memorial Hospital, with her parents following in Bear\u2019s truck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He squeezed her closer. \u201cWhat good is a police vehicle if I can\u2019t rush you to the hospital?\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky Eddie drove by when he did\u2014he\u2019s got a work site near the Simmons place. He found Laura in the middle of nowhere, off Old Mine Road.\u201d</p><p>She nodded against his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s our shortcut. Old Mine hits a couple of back roads that eventually land you on 88 to Silver City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the route,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a miracle Eddie saw the car. She\u2019d rolled into a pretty deep ravine.\u201d The prospect chilled him. The road was thin and winding, shrouded by rock face on one side, sloping down to tall pines on the other. It was the foothills, and the drop off the eastern side got pretty steep in parts. \u201cIt\u2019s possible a few people drove by and didn\u2019t even see her.\u201d</p> <p>Keri\u2019s accident flashed in his head. She\u2019d been in Oakland, in the middle of the city. How many hundreds had driven by her accident site, rubbernecking for a glimpse?</p><p>He pulled Sorrow more tightly to him, holding on, thinking he might never let go. He knew firsthand just how lucky Laura had been. How lucky they all were that she\u2019d survived.</p><p>The door to the waiting room swung open, and Sorrow looked expectantly at the nurse who\u2019d appeared, but she was just calling in a patient. Her shoulders sagged. \u201cI hate hospitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d He smoothed a hand over her hair. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be able to see her the moment she\u2019s out of radiology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she broke her collarbone?\u201d Sorrow asked, repeating the same question she\u2019d asked not five minutes earlier. It was pure speculation, but he was happy to indulge in as much idle conjecture as she wanted, as long as it helped her pass the time.</p> <p>And, for the moment, it was putting off the difficult news he needed to tell her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens,\u201d he repeated for the umpteenth time, \u201cshe\u2019ll come through just fine. She\u2019ll be okay, and you two will be at each other\u2019s throats again before you know it.\u201d</p><p>At that, she burst into tears. Panic overwhelmed him, and he ran through his mind what he\u2019d just told her, wondering what he\u2019d said wrong. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said such horrible things to her the last time we talked. What if those had been the last things I ever said to her?\u201d She scrubbed her face, and it was a relief to finally see her tears start to flow. The whole drive to Silver City, she\u2019d been frozen, unable to cry, and he was beginning to fear it was shock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He gently shushed her, rubbing her back and thumbing the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI promise you, Laura will come through this just fine. She was lucky. It could\u2019ve been a lot worse. I finally talked to the guys on the scene\u2014your little GMC Jimmy is a pancake.\u201d</p><p>Dread and fear swept through him anew, a ball of ice in his belly. He\u2019d lost one woman before; he\u2019d not lose this one. He grabbed her chin, held her gaze, and told her in a grave voice, \u201cI want you in a better truck. With air bags all over the place. And steel beams. One of those giant Ford Excursions. Or how about a tank? I need you safe, Sorrow.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed, looking grateful for the flash of humor. A wave of emotion slammed into him, overtook him\u2014this woman was so strong, so self-possessed. The words I love you burst into his heart, cut to the forefront of his mind. They were on his lips but still too frightening to say, so instead he hugged her more tightly, his voice cracking with intensity as he told her, \u201cI feel so blessed it wasn\u2019t you behind the wheel.\u201d An accident had claimed his love once before, and he\u2019d do everything in his power to prevent it from happening again.</p><p>Something shifted inside him, and the sheriff took over for the man. \u201cWe are lucky,\u201d he said vehemently, \u201cand I intend on staying that way. There\u2019s something we need to talk about. Silver City PD told me some things you need to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Was it her fault?\u201d She pulled away to look at him, looking afraid at what he was working up to. As well she should. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand how the accident happened.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand, led her to a seat in the corner, away from the other people in the waiting area. He walked slowly, piecing together just the right words. \u201cThat\u2019s just it, Sorrow. It wasn\u2019t an accident. Your sister said a Hummer was on her tail. She slowed to let him pass, but as he was passing her, he slowed, too, and matched her pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like something out of a movie,\u201d Sorrow said, looking confused. \u201cYou mean he was driving side by side with her?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe, or she. Laura didn\u2019t get a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d the driver do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA car approached from the other direction. When your sister saw it, she panicked. The Hummer managed to edge her over, off the road. That was how she lost control and flipped.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She dropped her head into her hand. \u201cPoor Laura. That should\u2019ve been me doing errands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d he said, and the fierceness in his voice took them both aback. \u201cAny other day it would have been you driving that car. Do you hear what I\u2019m saying? Somebody did this on purpose. Somebody who thought you were driving.\u201d</p><p>Just the thought of it made him want to prowl the roads in his Sheriff\u2019s SUV until he found the son of a bitch.</p><p>Her eyes were wide, her skin blanched of its color. \u201cThis has something to do with all the accidents at the lodge, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>In that moment, she looked so vulnerable, he wished he could scoop her up and hide her away, protecting her until this was all over.</p><p>He wrapped an arm around her shoulders, tugging her close and kissing her head. \u201cI believe it absolutely does. Listen to me, Sorrow. As sheriff, this is my only priority right now.\u201d Technically, it was in Silver City\u2019s jurisdiction, but SCPD was being remarkably cooperative. And even if they weren\u2019t, nobody could stop him from investigating on his own.</p><p>She ran a finger under her eyes, drying the moisture and wiping away a smudge of makeup. She was visibly gathering herself, and it made him feel good to see it. She was a strong one, his Sorrow.</p><p>She inhaled and exhaled sharply. \u201cOkay, tell me what I need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to be strong. Lay low. Stay off the roads as much as you can. And, Sorrow...\u201d He hesitated. She wasn\u2019t going to like what he had to say next. \u201cI want you to stay away from Damien.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped wide. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Everyone loved Sorrow. Everyone wished her well. Everyone, with the possible exception of Damien.</p><p>\u201cThe accident happened near Simmons Timber land,\u201d he said, and let the statement hang for a moment. \u201cWho might have a grudge against you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody! Especially not Damien or his family,\u201d she answered instantly. \u201cThey love me over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, somebody doesn\u2019t. And they\u2019ve upped the ante. First all those small incidents, then a fire, now a hit-and-run.\u201d He raised his brows. \u201cHave you considered how you might\u2019ve hurt your ex more than you realized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you think Damien tried to run me off the road?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a noncommittal shrug. \u201cThink about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said in a flat voice.</p><p>He wondered if her expression was confusion or anger. He\u2019d accept either. Sorrow could be mad at him all she wanted\u2014he just wanted her safe. \u201cIt\u2019s fine for you to think that, but right now, for me, everyone is a suspect.\u201d</p><p>The intake nurse popped her head through the door. \u201cMiss Bailey?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow hopped to her feet. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMad?\u201d She looked down at him, her expression bewildered and rattled. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not mad. It doesn\u2019t mean I believe Damien had anything to do with this. But I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will.\u201d She gave him a sad smile. She looked so tired, and it made his heart ache.</p><p>He stood up, cupped her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t think about this now. I\u2019m on it. And I promise you, I will find out who did it. I won\u2019t stop until I see them behind bars.\u201d</p><p>She looked hesitant to leave him.</p><p>\u201cYou go to your sister,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201d she asked in a small voice. \u201cI could ask if it\u2019s allowed.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cFamily only.\u201d Though he\u2019d be family soon, if he had anything to do with it.</p><p>For now, he had work to do. His mind was already two steps ahead, eager to track down the bastard who did this\u2014and it all started at Simmons Timber.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t stress Sorrow by speculating about things she didn\u2019t need to hear, so he fudged the truth. \u201cI need to get back anyway.\u201d He put his hands on her shoulders, fighting the urge to pull her in for another embrace. \u201cAre you going to be okay here?\u201d</p><p>She smiled weakly. \u201cI\u2019ll get a ride with Mom and Dad.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek. \u201cI hate to leave you.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled deeply, and he read raw affection in her eyes. \u201cYou just go find the bad guy.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-eight</p><p>Sorrow stood in the doorway, watching her beautiful, vital, energetic, pain-in-the-ass sister, lying broken and sleeping on a hospital bed. The sight dredged powerful feelings to the surface.</p><p>Laura\u2019s left arm was in a sling, her shoulder was bound, and an IV tube was plugged into the other arm. Her face was bruised, and the sight of it shot a spear of anguish through Sorrow\u2019s heart. For all her bluster, Laura was so fragile. What if she hadn\u2019t survived? What if Sorrow had never gotten the opportunity to take back all those ugly things she\u2019d said the last time they\u2019d spoken?</p><p>Laura\u2019s eyes fluttered open, and the two sisters stared silently at each other.</p><p>\u201cHey, sleepy,\u201d Sorrow said finally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry about your car.\u201d Laura\u2019s voice was small and cracking, and she coughed, clearing her dry throat.</p><p>Sorrow was beside her in an instant, easing onto the bed, pouring some water from a pitcher at her bedside. \u201cForget the car.\u201d She stroked the hair from her sister\u2019s head. \u201cHey, you did me a favor. It\u2019s a miracle the thing still ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when Dad got it?\u201d Laura asked, and the girls laughed at the memory.</p> <p>\u201cTotally. He used to wax it every weekend, right before Sunday night football.\u201d</p><p>Laura rested her head back, a wistful smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cThere were times,\u201d Sorrow said, \u201cwhen I wondered who he loved more, that car or us kids. I was shocked he handed it down to me. I thought for sure he was going to save it for BJ.\u201d</p><p>Laura\u2019s response was instant. \u201cNah. Of course it went to you.\u201d She looked away, her eyes suddenly glimmering. She gave a shuddering sigh, and Sorrow could tell her sister was trying to hold back the tears. \u201cI always screw things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Sorrow took her sister\u2019s good hand in hers and patted it. Laura was the favorite, the golden girl\u2014the one who never screwed up. \u201cThat\u2019s just the painkillers talking. You know you\u2019re the family princess.\u201d</p> <p>Laura pulled her hand away. \u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019re Dad\u2019s favorite, you always have been.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow felt her jaw drop open, but darned if she could think of anything to say to that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that look,\u201d Laura said. \u201cDad would never have let me take over the lodge.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow regained her voice. \u201cAs if you\u2019d ever want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d Laura scooted herself up on the bed, looking ready to rant. \u201cI\u2019d have loved to work more around the place. But Dad always second-guesses me. Why do you think I took off? It\u2019s not easy being the oldest.\u201d</p><p>The room was silent but for the general muted buzz and whirr of the machines. Sorrow had spent years feeling abandoned by her sister. But what if Laura hadn\u2019t run from the family? What if she\u2019d felt she had no choice but to leave, driven to prove herself?</p> <p>\u201cYou really want to stay?\u201d Sorrow asked finally. \u201cLike, to live in Sierra Falls again?\u201d She still didn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I just said, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Laura sighed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Laura. Permanently permanently? As in, you\u2019re not going to get bored and take off again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermanently,\u201d Laura said. \u201cI swear. I pinky swear it.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow saw her sister in a new light. \u201cYou\u2019re being serious.\u201d Laura staying. She sat with the notion a moment, remembering what Billy had told her. Why not let her sister help more? Sorrow had been too proud to see it, but finally the light clicked on.</p><p>Then Sorrow laughed outright, thinking of another side benefit. Sharing lodge duties also meant sharing the blame when things went wrong. \u201cYou know, actually, we totally need you. Please stay.\u201d She gripped Laura\u2019s hand. \u201cYou must stay. I don\u2019t know what my problem has been anyway. You\u2019d be awesome\u2014you have more business experience than the whole town put together.\u201d</p><p>Laura looked away, fiddling with her IV tubes. \u201cDad would never have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d She gave her sister a gentle nudge on her good arm. \u201cMom and Dad would be thrilled to have you around again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Laura admitted, laughing at Sorrow\u2019s vehemence. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not being fair. But sometimes I think Dad respects me more in concept. Like, he can think about his eldest daughter out there, driving her fancy car, being Urban Business Barbie, but he doesn\u2019t need to be around to witness all the screwups.\u201d She blinked a few times, tears shimmering in her eyes. \u201cAnd believe me, they are many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, forget that,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the Sierra Falls Rural Business Barbie. And we\u2019ll screw up together.\u201d She beamed at her sister. \u201cOh my God, Laura. You don\u2019t understand. I\u2019d give anything to spend less time with accounting ledgers, and plumbers, and snow shovels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to share it with you.\u201d Laura gave her a bland look. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you that since I got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, you want responsibilities, I\u2019ve got them coming out of my ears.\u201d</p><p>Laura\u2019s answering laugh turned into a cough, and Sorrow was quick to bring the cup of water to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe just need to get you better.\u201d Sorrow watched her sister\u2019s trembling hand reach for the cup and the way her throat moved slowly and convulsively. \u201cThank God Eddie came along when he did. I\u2019m going to give the guy a big kiss when I see him next.\u201d</p><p>Laura raised a brow. \u201cWon\u2019t the sheriff be jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you can give him a big kiss.\u201d Sorrow narrowed her eyes on her sister. That she was staying made it a whole other ball game. \u201cMaybe you should, Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for Eddie. I\u2019ve seen the looks between you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie?\u201d Laura scowled, then grimaced from the pain of it. \u201cIf you saw me give Eddie Jessup any look, it was clearly either scorn or distaste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s so cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned my lesson\u2014I\u2019m staying away from pretty boys. If I date anybody, it\u2019ll be some nice businessman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Sorrow tamped down a surge of anger. If Laura was going to be staying in Sierra Falls, she was going to need a massive attitude adjustment. \u201cNot only have Eddie and his brother built a great business, but he\u2019s outside all day, working with his hands and body. I don\u2019t know, Laura, that sure seems pretty sexy to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never be interested in a man who uses tools.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow snorted with laughter. \u201cYou just lobbed me a softball.\u201d</p><p>Laura rolled her eyes. \u201cOkay, Miss Dirty Mind, if we\u2019re being specific, I\u2019d never be interested in a man who works as a contractor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then why are you blushing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not blushing,\u201d Laura snapped. \u201cI haven\u2019t blushed since seventh grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s part of your problem.\u201d It came to Sorrow in a flash, exactly how best a girl\u2019s attitude got adjusted. \u201cMaybe a good mountain man who makes you blush is just what you need. Give up on those city dorks in khakis whose idea of foreplay is talking about mutual funds.\u201d</p><p>Laura guffawed. \u201cWho put a nickel in you? Jeez, the girl gets lucky with the town sheriff and all of a sudden she\u2019s Dr. Phil.\u201d Her sister\u2019s tone was joking, but Sorrow saw how she did consider it for a moment. But then Laura shuddered. \u201cHe drives a vehicle best suited for monster truck competitions. That giant red pickup. Can\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Eddie\u2019s pickup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of tacky, isn\u2019t it? Like he\u2019s overcompensating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say about the size of a man\u2019s truck,\u201d a deep voice said from the doorway.</p><p>Laura\u2019s cheeks flushed pink.</p><p>Sorrow grinned to see a couple of Jessup brothers. \u201cEddie, Mark, hi!\u201d Under her breath, she sang, \u201cBlushh-innng.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found the doctor,\u201d Eddie said, shoving his brother into the room. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if you can trust him. I hear he sucks.\u201d</p><p>Mark shouldered him back, and the sight of a white-coated doctor roughhousing was comical. \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous I got all the brains.\u201d</p><p>Eddie flinched his shoulder away. \u201cWhatever, dude. Mom likes me better.\u201d He got a wicked look in his eye and walked right up to Laura\u2019s bedside, putting a finger under her chin. \u201cPlus I have the biggest truck. Isn\u2019t that right, sugar?\u201d He winked.</p><p>Sorrow snickered to see the pink in Laura\u2019s cheeks flame positively crimson.</p><p>\u201cJessups,\u201d Laura said in a strangled voice. \u201cThey\u2019re all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get away from us.\u201d Eddie sat on the edge of her bed, and she inched away.</p><p>Mark snagged the chart that hung from the foot of her bed and flipped through. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while, Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since you graduated high school,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in eighth grade then. So, yeah. Long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish the circumstances were better than a fractured clavicle.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow read over his shoulder. \u201cYou and me both, Dr. Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to figure out who did this,\u201d Eddie said in a steely voice, his shift in tone marked.</p><p>Sorrow nodded somberly. \u201cBilly is investigating.\u201d</p><p>Mark raised a brow. \u201cBilly, is it?\u201d</p><p>It was Sorrow\u2019s turn to blush. \u201cThe sheriff and I have become friendly.\u201d She continued in her best business-as-usual voice, \u201cHe believes too much has happened around the lodge. And now, with the accident...it\u2019s just too suspicious.\u201d</p><p>Eddie pinned Laura with a look. \u201cGood thing Miss Fancy-pants here will be running off soon. Staying safe. Right on schedule.\u201d</p><p>Her sister resembled something like a deer in headlights, so Sorrow spoke for her. \u201cLaura\u2019s sticking around this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is she now?\u201d Eddie\u2019s eyes glinted. \u201cSounds like something I need to investigate.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-nine</p><p>Billy needed to question Damien, and if he couldn\u2019t get the guy into an interrogation room, he\u2019d do one better. A bar. The Thirsty Bear Tavern, to be exact. He\u2019d considered meeting at a neutral spot like Chances across town, but when taking a man\u2019s measure, it was best to poke, prod, and provoke, targeting his most sensitive spots, getting under his skin. Which meant meeting at the tavern\u2014ground zero for Damien\u2019s relationship with the Bailey family.</p><p>\u201cThanks for meeting me,\u201d he said when Damien came in. He forced an easy smile. The town of Sierra Falls seemed to love the guy, but from the start, he\u2019d struck Billy as arrogant, slick, and too young to know better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. You bet.\u201d Damien pulled off his fleece jacket, his movements stiff. \u201cThough why do I get the sense that this isn\u2019t a friendly visit?\u201d</p><p>Because we\u2019re not friends? But instead of speaking his mind, Billy just laughed a carefree, rolling laugh. \u201cShall we get some drinks?\u201d</p><p>Damien\u2019s posture loosened a bit, and with a nod, he headed toward an open stool at the bar.</p> <p>But Billy headed him off, anxious for a little privacy. \u201cHow about a booth instead? That way we can kick back.\u201d</p><p>Damien\u2019s gaze skittered to the booth and back. \u201cWhatever you say, Sheriff. How about I snag us a couple of beers first?\u201d He laughed nervously. \u201cI hope by drinks you didn\u2019t mean diet sodas.\u201d</p><p>The Simmons boy had always struck Billy as an entitled jackass, and nothing got a jackass\u2019s jaw flapping like a sit-down with his pal, Johnny Walker. He gave Damien a broad smile. \u201cWhy mess around? I\u2019m off duty. How about a couple of shots with a beer back? My treat.\u201d He caught the bartender\u2019s eye. \u201cMy tab, Helen.\u201d</p><p>By the time Damien returned with the drinks, his features had hardened, his nerves under wraps. Apparently the guy knew the best defense was a good offense. He settled into the booth, leaning forward and sliding Billy\u2019s shot and beer across the table. \u201cCut the shit, Sheriff. Why am I here? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s because you need a new drinking buddy.\u201d</p><p>Billy raised his glass. \u201cPoints for the brass balls, Simmons.\u201d He tossed back his shot. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not looking for a friend.\u201d</p> <p>Damien\u2019s lip twitched, waiting for it.</p><p>He continued, \u201cJust want to make sure it\u2019s all cool, this situation with me and Sorrow.\u201d</p><p>Damien\u2019s eyes narrowed to tiny slits. He threw back his own shot, then said, \u201cYeah, sure. It\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, remaining as emotionless as possible. \u201cSorrow has enough on her mind without worrying about any bad blood. You\u2019ll have heard about the accident, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The guy\u2019s face was like stone. His head moved in the slightest of nods. \u201cTough break.\u201d</p><p>Simmons was going to be harder to crack than he\u2019d anticipated. Time to bring out the big guns. \u201cHey, Helen,\u201d Billy called. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just bring over the bottle?\u201d</p> <p>Damien raised his brows, like he was expecting a trick.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it,\u201d Billy said easily. \u201cMy buddy Scott is coming by later. He\u2019ll drive us home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the sheriff,\u201d Damien said, his voice flat. He stared at his beer bottle, peeling and fraying the label. \u201cSo, she okay? Laura, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Helen brought over the bottle of Scotch and her eyes lingered overlong on Damien. \u201cI hear you\u2019re single now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss a beat before responding, \u201cAnd I hear you\u2019re still married.\u201d As she walked away, Simmons pulled the bottle closer, tipping a solid slug into his shot glass. \u201cWomen,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Watching the amber liquid glug into the glass, Billy said, \u201cThat\u2019s the way,\u201d all the while thinking, that\u2019s right, kid, time to get nice and loose. He slid his own glass over for a pour. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you and Sorrow left it,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cShe\u2019s no gossip, and what happened between you two is none of my business anyhow. But, as far as I can tell, there\u2019s no reason two men can\u2019t have a friendly drink.\u201d</p><p>Damien met his eyes and held them silently as he tipped the entire glass down his throat. \u201cOr five.\u201d</p><p>Billy laughed. \u201cWhoa, cowboy.\u201d Either the guy was more upset about the breakup than Sorrow knew, or he had something heavy on his mind. Guilt, maybe.</p> <p>As sheriff, he knew that, if he wanted cred with the guy, he\u2019d need to match him drink for drink, and so tipped his own shot back then slammed his glass down, exhaling hard. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can drink an old man under the table.\u201d</p><p>Simmons actually cocked a half smile at that. Progress. \u201cI bet I can, old man.\u201d He stared in challenge. \u201cSpeaking of old, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re maybe a little too old for our Bailey?\u201d</p><p>Billy barked out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not dead yet.\u201d</p><p>Damien was quick to wave the comment away with a brittle laugh. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re right. Foul ball.\u201d He sighed, and the twenty-something guy suddenly sounded much older. \u201cHell, I don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d He poured himself another and raised it in a toast. \u201cIt pains me, Sheriff\u201d\u2014he clutched playfully at his heart, but there was truth in the jest\u2014\u201cpains me to say it.\u201d He grew oddly serious. \u201cBut I say this for her sake. I\u2019ve known Bailey all my life. She\u2019s good people, and any friend of hers is a friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>That was unexpected. He ran it through his head, searching for some hidden edge or agenda, but it rang true. In his mind, he upgraded the kid from evil to just plain jerk. He clinked his glass with Damien\u2019s and tossed it back. They\u2019d never be best buds, but Billy knew he had to keep his mind open to possibilities. Law enforcement\u2019s first lesson was that sometimes things weren\u2019t at all what they seemed.</p><p>Still, he reminded himself that it wouldn\u2019t do any good to trust too easily. Which meant it was time to bring it back to the matter at hand. He was nonchalant, not even looking at Damien as he said, \u201cSo I hear the accident happened close to Simmons land. Hope that doesn\u2019t bring any bad publicity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad told me once, no publicity is bad publicity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father must know what he\u2019s talking about. He\u2019s successful enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruer words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d Billy added, \u201chaving such an experienced man as a mentor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you work closely with him? I imagine he treats you like his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. You\u2019ll be the one to inherit Simmons Timber, after all.\u201d</p><p>Damien guzzled his beer, downing the second half of the bottle in one drink. \u201cSometimes I think Dad just wants me to be a suit.\u201d</p><p>Billy poured them each another, smaller drink, and then kept the bottle. The kid was pounding them too hard for his tastes. \u201cA suit?\u201d he repeated, encouraging Damien to say more.</p><p>\u201cYeah. A good old boy in a suit. He says it\u2019s the lynchpin of a business like ours. Hunting trips with the boys, that sort of thing. I have ideas, though.\u201d He snatched the bottle back, helping himself. \u201cI try to be a good guy, a responsible guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResponsible how?\u201d Like by running Laura Bailey off the road?</p><p>Damien caught and held his gaze. \u201cNewsflash, Sheriff: logging isn\u2019t exactly the most PC thing these days. I drive into the city and mention I\u2019m in timber? Girls can\u2019t run away fast enough.\u201d He threw back his drink, and damn, the kid could hold his liquor\u2014Billy would need to watch himself. But although the guy might not be slurring, the words were flowing more freely. He rambled on, \u201cThese days, all women wanna talk about is composting. Vegetarian food. Stuff like that. You\u2019d think I was clubbing baby seals out there. Like cutting down trees is the devil\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>Billy saw the kid in a new light. He was vulnerable, maybe even lonely. Sorrow probably had hurt him more than she\u2019d realized. It was easy enough to imagine. If Sorrow were to leave him, he\u2019d be shattered.</p><p>He\u2019d need to tread carefully. \u201cSeems to me, Damien, the ladies would love things like, well, let\u2019s be honest, like that car you drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Simmons said flatly. He caught Helen\u2019s eye and silently raised his empty bottle, requesting another beer. \u201cGirls go for the money.\u201d</p><p>The kid sounded more jaded than the young, rich scion of a successful business should. He clearly didn\u2019t want the kind of girls who chased money. So then what was Damien\u2019s story? Seemed like there might be more to him than Billy had suspected. But why should that discovery surprise him? He had to give Sorrow a little credit\u2014she wouldn\u2019t go out with a total numbskull.</p><p>When Billy spoke again, it was more as a fellow guy than as sheriff. \u201cHave you tried to talk to your dad? I don\u2019t know much about running a big company, but it seems to me that change happens from within. Hell, I think sometimes environmental initiatives can be lucrative. Good press and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, man. I went to the Simmons board once, all I did was say the word sustainability, and they laughed me out of the boardroom. Like I was some kind of idiot. I know people need paper. Paper\u2019s not going anywhere...yet. I know that. I get it\u2014I\u2019m not stupid. But Dad, all he wants is to build, build, build.\u201d Damien laughed evilly, kicking back and peering out the window. \u201cI think it drives him fucking nuts that Bear\u2019s sitting on so much prime land. I love it.\u201d</p><p>Billy froze. The Baileys were struggling\u2014all this time, he\u2019d just assumed that the only things they had were the tavern and the roof over their heads. \u201cAre you saying that Bear owns land? And that it borders Simmons Timber?\u201d</p><p>Damien laughed again, but this time he just sounded weary. \u201cYessir, Sheriff. Old Dabney Simmons calls it green gold.\u201d</p><p>Forty</p><p>The lunch crowd was thinning, and Sorrow heard the tavern door whoosh open and shut as she stood at the bar, refilling the salt shakers. She glanced over her shoulder and held her breath. It was Damien, and he was making a beeline straight for her.</p><p>He came up beside her to lean against the bar. \u201cI have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello to you, too.\u201d Her heart went to her throat. Billy and her ex had met for a couple of drinks the other night, and although Billy didn\u2019t come out of it as the biggest Damien fan, he no longer thought the guy capable of doing harm to her sister. According to his report, things were \u201call cool\u201d among them. So then why this visit?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing a look,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure you are. You\u2019re doing your deer in the headlights thing.\u201d He laughed, surely seeing how flustered she was. \u201cRelax, Bailey. I know you\u2019re off the market. I had a little powwow with your new boyfriend. Didn\u2019t he tell you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded warily. \u201cHe told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then you know it\u2019s all good.\u201d He chucked her chin. \u201cYour sheriff\u2019s not that bad even. For a relic.\u201d He gave her a pointed look that drew a smile from her. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the Bailey I know. Here,\u201d he said, handing her a box. \u201cI even brought you a peace offering.\u201d</p><p>She took it\u2014it was one of those decorative tins\u2014and she hefted it suspiciously in her hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCookies. Fancy cookies. You should look for yourself. And before you thank me, don\u2019t. My parents got them for you.\u201d</p><p>She pried open the box. It was filled with chocolate-dipped madeleines.</p><p>He said, \u201cBecause of Laura\u2019s accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow...\u201d She was speechless, touched by the gesture. To her it meant so much more than just them wishing her family well during this tough time. It meant that all was forgiven. She\u2019d broken up with their only son, but they hadn\u2019t taken it personally themselves.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re from France,\u201d he said. \u201cYour fancy-pants sister should like that.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cThey don\u2019t know Laura very well if they sent her cookies.\u201d But then she gave an automatic tug to the leg of her jeans\u2014all the cooking she was doing for Billy was beginning to take its toll. \u201cOr is it so obvious how much I like cookies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, goof. It\u2019s so obvious you deserve a treat.\u201d Seeing her suspiciously narrowed eyes, he quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m saying that as a friend. You\u2019re pretty as ever, but I told you, Billy and I had a meeting of the minds. We\u2019re all good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you men? Everything is \u2018It\u2019s all good. It\u2019s cool.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He gave her a broad smile. \u201cThat\u2019s because it is, Bailey.\u201d</p><p>She closed the tin. \u201cSo this is your peace offering? Some cookies that your mom picked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Damien said defensively. \u201cWell, okay, partly. The cookies are gravy. I\u2019m really here because I need to show you something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded, instantly on her guard.</p><p>\u201cYou have to come with me to see it.\u201d</p><p>She and Billy had agreed\u2014Damien wasn\u2019t capable of such calculated evil as a hit-and-run designed to hurt her. But still, something niggled in the back of her mind. \u201cCan\u2019t you just tell me? Why the mystery?\u201d</p><p>Damien\u2019s eyes went cold. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, Sorrow. God, you make me feel like a criminal. I found something you\u2019ll think is cool. I wanted to surprise you with it. Sort of like one last hurrah for the two of us.\u201d At her skeptical glare, he added, \u201cA platonic hurrah. Come on. Be a sport. I\u2019ll have you back in an hour.\u201d</p><p>Her misgivings transformed into pity. She felt ridiculous being suspicious of Damien\u2014she\u2019d known him all her life. But she did have an honest excuse. \u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Bailey. The dinner crowd won\u2019t be here for hours. And Sully\u2019s back there, right? He can hold down the fort in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>She checked the clock on the wall\u2014made from a slab of wood, it\u2019d hung there for as long as she could remember. \u201cI haven\u2019t even eaten lunch yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pack a couple of sandwiches.\u201d He grabbed the tin. \u201cWe can bring these, too. Come on,\u201d he pleaded again, making her smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got no meetings till three. Just sixty minutes, for an old friend. Closure, isn\u2019t that what you women are always clamoring on about?\u201d</p> <p>She barked out a laugh at that. It was the mischievous Damien she\u2019d always known, and that was what decided it. It would be nice to have a little closure. She\u2019d love to remain his friend, and an impromptu picnic seemed like just the right first step in that direction.</p><p>She whipped together a few sandwiches, grabbed a couple of apples, refilled her water bottle, and they were on their way. Some fresh air would do her good anyhow. She hadn\u2019t been out since Laura\u2019s accident, and spring was in full force, teasing her from outside the window. She was dying for a little blue sky. And, with him driving, she\u2019d be safe. Whoever this mysterious bad guy was would assume she was at the lodge.</p><p>Her doubts burst back to the surface the farther they got from civilization. He was driving them down an old fire road, well off Irish Camp Road and deep into Simmons Timber land. \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I have something to show you.\u201d</p><p>She had to trust that Damien wouldn\u2019t hurt her. She knew him. But still, she couldn\u2019t help but joke uneasily. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of freaking me out here.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily, pulling onto a dirt road, and stopped almost immediately, his sports car unable to go any far-</p><p>ther. Hurt flickered in his eyes\u2014he\u2019d heard her unease. \u201cYou used to trust me, remember? What happened between us, Sorrow?\u201d</p><p>She sat stiffly, not unbuckling. \u201cIs that why you brought me here? To talk about our relationship? You need to bring me back home, right now.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back against the headrest, looking tired. \u201cGive me just fifteen minutes. Then I\u2019ll take you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you have to answer something for me.\u201d When Billy mentioned his initial reservations about Damien, she\u2019d scoffed. But now, sitting in the middle of nowhere, everything Damien had ever said, every crisis at the lodge, every moment he\u2019d happened to be right there to swoop in and save the day\u2014it all came to her in a rush. There was just one too many coincidences. \u201cHave you been sabotaging us?\u201d</p><p>His face hardened into stunned disbelief. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She almost chickened out, but the words had been said. They were out there, hanging, with no going back now. She might as well let it all out.</p><p>\u201cThere have been so many freak accidents at the lodge,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cAnd yet you always seem to be right there to help.\u201d</p><p>He stared in stunned silence. She\u2019d expected the truth to flash in his eyes, but all she read was confusion, comprehension, and a surprising despair.</p><p>Finally, he spoke, his voice low and achingly heartfelt. \u201cJesus, Sorrow. I know I can be a jerk, but I would never sabotage you. Never.\u201d</p><p>She watched him, plumbing those eyes for the truth. \u201cHow can I be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you even think that? I\u2019ve been trying to help. You\u2019ve been so in over your head.\u201d He slammed his hands on the steering wheel. \u201cWhy would I ever hurt you? I care about you.\u201d</p><p>She racked her mind for possible reasons. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf Billy? Yeah, sure, I admit, at first my gut twisted every time I saw his damned cruiser parked in your lot. I mean, what\u2019s the appeal? He\u2019s older, he doesn\u2019t try worth a damn\u2014and yet every woman in town swoons for the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to me, you\u2019re the one they\u2019re swooning for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He stared sightlessly out the front window, his voice gone soft. \u201cYou always talk about how you feel stuck, Sorrow. Abandoned in Sierra Falls by your siblings. But think how I feel.\u201d He met her eyes, and his were dark with anguish. \u201cI\u2019d give my left nut for a sibling. You think you\u2019re stuck, but I\u2019m the one trapped with a golden boy rep and an empire whether I want it or not. What good am I, when my own girlfriend doesn\u2019t want me, and I\u2019m the dude who supposedly has it all?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide. \u201cAre you kidding? Damien, you\u2019re like...the prince of Sierra Falls. You were the star quarterback. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to inherit half the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still broke up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of you, though. You\u2019re amazing. It\u2019s just that I connected with Billy.\u201d</p><p>He gave a bitter laugh. \u201cThe old \u2018it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u2019 talk. But the thing is, Sorrow, it was me.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. Billy Preston is the kind of man I could never be. Simple, loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re loved!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Sorrow.\u201d Damien\u2019s expression shuttered. \u201cForget all that. It\u2019s not what I came here for, whatever you might think. Look, I\u2019m glad you found Billy. If you get off on the guy, I\u2019m thrilled for you. If you\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cAll I want, all I ever wanted, was to look out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook out for me?\u201d Ice rushed into her veins. \u201cFrom what?\u201d She looked out the window\u2014they were surrounded by towering pines, and not another soul for miles. \u201cYou have me a little freaked out here.\u201d</p><p>He practically tore off his seat belt and pinned her with a look. \u201cI keep being misunderstood, and I need to make it right.\u201d</p><p>Forty-one</p><p>Damien got out and angrily flung open her door. He offered his hand, his arm extended rigidly. \u201cCome with me. I swear I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d Something broke in his expression when she didn\u2019t take his hand right away. \u201cI wanted this to be fun, and you\u2019re wigging out on me.\u201d His arm dropped, and he sighed, a tired, sad sound. \u201cHell, Sorrow, until that sheriff started showing his face around, I was the only one who gave a shit about whether or not you kept your head above water.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him and saw emotions she\u2019d never seen on Damien\u2019s face before\u2014earnestness, anxiety, and even pain. It was in such contrast to the easy confidence she was used to. This was the Damien she\u2019d suspected had been there all along.</p><p>She made her decision. Reaching up, Sorrow took his hand. \u201cFifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>They hiked in silence. The trail was overgrown, and though they probably only went about a half mile, it was slow going.</p><p>She stopped to catch her breath. \u201cSo this is Simmons land?\u201d</p><p>He leaned against a tree, pulling a water bottle from his pack, offering it to her first. \u201cYou don\u2019t know where we are, do you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She chugged, surprisingly thirsty, then looked around. Pine trees as far as the eye could see. \u201cHow could I?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the right. \u201cSee that over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s your land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear\u2019s land, at least. There\u2019s a strip of it, extending south of the lodge. It\u2019s not enough to do much of anything with but sit on. Which is what the Baileys have been doing since, well, probably since the days of your Sorrow Crabtree.\u201d He took back his water and drank before returning it to his pack.</p><p>She laughed\u2014there was no other response to such unexpected news. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t we rich? Because it sure seems like a lot of land to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the phrase land rich and cash poor?\u201d At her nod, he said, \u201cWelcome to my world.\u201d</p> <p>He walked on, and she followed. \u201cWhat do you mean, your world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimber isn\u2019t exactly the thing to make your fortune in the twenty-first century. My family is nothing but land rich and cash poor.\u201d</p><p>He ducked through a thick patch of greenery, holding aside branches so she could follow. It looked like he was headed straight up.</p><p>She stared, aghast. \u201cAre you sure this is safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you.\u201d He held a hand out. \u201cI promise, you\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>She practically had to crawl up, clutching his hand and clawing at roots to clamber up behind him. Finally, she made it to the top, and he held her shoulders to steady her.</p> <p>\u201cCareful.\u201d He led her along a narrow ledge. \u201cI need you in one piece, so you can see\u201d\u2014he put his hands on her shoulders, angling her\u2014\u201cthis.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. The path led to a black hole in the wall of the hill. Rotted timber posts at the entrance told her it was more than just a natural cave. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old gold mine,\u201d he said, sounding as giddy as a kid. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his shirt to stop him. \u201cIs it safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He tugged her forward. \u201cI\u2019ve been here a bunch of times now.\u201d</p><p>As they got closer, she caught a glimpse inside, taking in the deep hallway and timber scaffolding. \u201cWow, it really is a mine.\u201d The Sierra Nevada foothills were gold country\u2014there must\u2019ve been half a dozen gold rush tourist spots in El Dorado County alone\u2014but she\u2019d never been inside an actual mine. \u201cHoly cow. And this is on our land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he called from inside. \u201cAll yours. Too bad it\u2019s not worth a dime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d She followed him in, stopping to let her eyes adjust. It was dark, but not pitch-black. She sniffed, picking up a distant smell, pungent, like urine. \u201cWhat is that? Is there, like, an army of homeless prospectors still down there?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just bats. They won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She scowled, not buying it. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>He came back, guiding her shoulders. \u201cI promise. It\u2019s totally safe. I\u2019ve been hiking here since I found it.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity got the better of her, and she felt comfortable enough to look around. The place was in remarkably pristine condition, with regular wooden posts and tracks for a rail cart, just like in the movies. \u201cHow come not everyone knows about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did some research down at Town Hall. The mine was a failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Bail. I did research.\u201d He walked in farther, leaning against a railing. \u201cThe Comstock Lode hit, and folks forgot about this place.\u201d</p><p>She went to stand next to him, then yelped and hopped back a step. He was standing at the edge of a narrow shaft. She registered the rusted pulley overhead, rotting ropes dangling from it like cobwebs. A ladder led one level down, dark enough that the floor below could easily have been just an illusion. \u201cCreepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like it.\u201d He picked up a rock and tossed it down. It landed on a platform just one story down, but the sound echoed and echoed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a guy,\u201d she accused. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything crazy, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty safe, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty safe?\u201d She shivered, backing up another step. \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it. You\u2019re right, though. It is cool. How\u2019d you even find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Coop did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dog found it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were hunting. He scented a fox and wouldn\u2019t let it go. He followed her to a den just outside. There was a whole litter of kits\u2014I swear there were a dozen of the things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me Cooper didn\u2019t eat them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever fear. You know Coop wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly.\u201d Damien laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s why he\u2019s such a sucky hunting dog.\u201d</p><p>A quiet hissing sounded outside, and she went back to the entrance, glancing out to see a drizzle starting to fall. Nothing serious\u2014just a gentle Sierra misting\u2014but enough that she found herself a spot between rails and slid to the ground, leaning against the side of the tunnel.</p><p>He tossed down his backpack and joined her. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarved.\u201d A light breeze billowed in, bringing the scent of damp pine needles. It was serene\u2014and eerie, but in a pleasant way. She tucked into a turkey and Havarti sandwich and asked between bites, \u201cSo you really just wanted to show me this place?\u201d</p><p>Damien gave his sandwich a critical once-over and opted for an apple instead. He took a huge bite, smiling as he chewed. \u201cMaybe I wanted one more shot with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamien!\u201d She nudged his foot.</p><p>He gave an exaggeratedly innocent shrug. \u201cSo. You sure it\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d She narrowed her eyes at him \u201cHey, you said your intentions were innocent, bringing me here. You lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie,\u201d he said, smiling to match her glare. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She glared harder.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he admitted. \u201cMaybe a little white lie. Can\u2019t blame a guy for trying.\u201d</p><p>She tried to be mad, but couldn\u2019t. It was just too classically Damien. Oddly, she felt a stab of affection for him because of it. Affection and, at the same time, total resolve. Damien was the same smooth-talking lady-killer he\u2019d been in high school. But it wasn\u2019t high school anymore, and sitting there with him, she knew more than ever how she\u2019d found her perfect man in Billy. The revelation made her as comfortable with Damien as she\u2019d ever been. \u201cYou just want to keep dating now that you know I\u2019m a gold mine heiress,\u201d she said, ribbing him.</p><p>\u201cDream on,\u201d he said, ribbing right back. But then he grew thoughtful. \u201cYou really like that sheriff, huh?\u201d</p><p>She finished the first half of her sandwich and dusted off her hands to reach for the second. \u201cYup. I really like that sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a lucky man.\u201d He nibbled around the apple core, getting every last bit. The poor guy still looked famished.</p><p>The compliment made her feel shy, so she ignored it and focused on his choice of lunch instead. \u201cI tell you, between you and my sister...\u201d She nodded to his uneaten sandwich. \u201cA carb and some mayo once in a while isn\u2019t going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy\u2019s gotta stay ripped.\u201d Damien smiled the confident old smile she knew. He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cEspecially now that I\u2019m single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, this was supposed to be a hurrah. I\u2019d think, just this once, you could feed yourself something other than beef, berries, or protein shakes.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, pulling the cookie tin close. \u201cThen screw the sandwich. If I\u2019m eating processed, it\u2019s going to be sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlert the media,\u201d she said gleefully, watching him shove an entire cookie into his mouth. \u201cDamien Simmons, eating carbs. Eating sugar! Apocalypse really is nigh.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, too, and gobbled down a second cookie for good measure. \u201cYou should try one,\u201d he said, speaking over a mouthful.</p><p>\u201cVery appetizing,\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will. If you can save me some.\u201d</p><p>Damien actually grabbed a third cookie, breaking off the chocolate end and popping it down. \u201cThat sheriff better take care of you. I worry about you in that lodge.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, her sandwich held in midair, studying him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe place is a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dump? Is that what you were going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. It\u2019s halfway there, though. Why do you think I\u2019m always coming by?\u201d</p><p>The realization hit her with a sharp pang. She hadn\u2019t loved Damien, but for a little while she\u2019d enjoyed his company. Had felt wanted by him. \u201cI\u2019d hoped it was because you were my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, Sorrow.\u201d He caught her gaze and held it, speaking earnestly. \u201cI really do care about you. A lot. Say the word, and I\u2019m back on board, baby. Your sheriff is lucky. Any man would be thrilled to call himself yours. But, no offense, where the lodge is concerned, you seem to be flying solo. You can\u2019t run the place alone. It\u2019s like a demolition zone. You need someone to look out for you.\u201d</p><p>The unexpected sentiment touched her, and for an instant, her eyes burned with unshed tears. Little did he know how much she needed actual protection. She was sure Billy would disagree, but she found herself confiding. \u201cBilly thinks everything that\u2019s been happening...he doesn\u2019t think those are accidents.\u201d</p><p>He froze, his mouth gaping. \u201cWhat do you mean, not accidents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it.\u201d She dropped her head in her hands, rattling it all off. \u201cThe tree branch, bear box, black ice...stuff like that can happen, sure. But a fire in the kitchen? That wasn\u2019t my fault. Sully and I keep a spotless oven, and you know it. And then there was Laura\u2019s hit-and-run. When she was driving my car.\u201d When she looked back up at him, he was wearing a peculiar expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust...\u201d His brow was furrowed hard. \u201cWho would want to hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She stood abruptly and put a hand to her belly. It churned to think how someone was out there right now, waiting to do her harm.</p><p>\u201cAre you sick?\u201d he asked, sounding focused.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I just...\u201d She froze, watching his face. He had such a strange look on his face\u2014at first, she\u2019d thought it was just his shock, but saw now how he was breathing through his mouth. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel kinda strange all of a sudden. I thought maybe you felt funny, too.\u201d He raked his hand through his hair, giving his head a shake. \u201cWhat\u2019d you put in that water bottle?\u201d His laugh sounded only half joking. His skin was peaked, his face drawn. It was unlike him\u2014Damien was usually a powerhouse of fitness. \u201cOh shit.\u201d He lurched up and stumbled to the railing, leaning over the edge. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d</p><p>She bolted over to him, rubbing his back. \u201cCan you make it outside?\u201d Trying for some comic relief, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if the bats would like you puking in their territory.\u201d</p><p>He laughed weakly. \u201cGross, Bail. You know I can hold my water better than that.\u201d He tried to give her a smile, but his face grew slack. \u201cI think I need some fresh air,\u201d he said, and the words came out sounding garbled.</p><p>When he tried to stand upright, he stumbled into her, and she leaned into the railing for support. He smelled like chocolate.</p> <p>It set off an alarm in her mind. \u201cAre you allergic to anything? Maybe there was a weird ingredient in the cookies.\u201d She grabbed his arms, trying to shuffle him away from the edge of the shaft. He needed to get fresh air, and she needed to call an ambulance.</p><p>\u201cSshhi\u2014\u201d He blinked his eyes open and shut, really slurring now.</p><p>\u201cCan you breathe?\u201d Her mind raced. Damien\u2019s cell would be in his pocket, but she couldn\u2019t grab it while he leaned on her like this. \u201cLook, we need to call an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cRessep...resss...\u201d</p><p>No cell reception. \u201cGot it. Let\u2019s get you outside. Can you walk?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, swallowing convulsively. She wondered if he might not get sick after all. The prospect spurred her to action.</p> <p>\u201cReady? On three. One, two\u2014\u201d She pressed her back into the railing, trying to heave him off her chest so they might be able to shuffle out side by side.</p><p>Damien stumbled backward and fell on his bottom. There was a sharp crack, and Sorrow fell back, too. But all she met was open air.</p><p>Time suspended as she fell. But then she landed with a crash, and reality exploded to life. A horrific snap. Her arm. The sound was so hideous, she knew she\u2019d never get it out of her head. She cradled it close, breathing through her teeth.</p><p>And then the strangest thing happened. Rather than panic, the oddest, calmest clarity overtook her. She assessed her situation. Her whole body reverberated with pain, but nothing else seemed broken. It registered that Damien was shouting down to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she shouted back. She looked around, praying she didn\u2019t see any of those bats he\u2019d told her about. The floor was wider than she\u2019d have guessed, with metal tracks leading away into the blackness. It was the eeriest thing she\u2019d ever seen. She forced her voice to be steady. \u201cI\u2019m on some sort of a platform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he said, and despite the slurring, she could hear how his voice had snapped taut with panic.</p><p>\u201cThe ladder.\u201d Using her good hand, she inched herself forward, reaching for it, but the wood crumbled in her fingers. Tears burned her eyes. \u201cRotted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you...don\u2019t move.\u201d He was speaking slowly, but she was grateful to hear his words were less slurred. \u201cI\u2019ll...get help.\u201d</p> <p>She yelled up at him, \u201cNo! You can\u2019t drive in your condition. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d She heard him shuffling around up above, and shouted again, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave, Damien Simmons!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...no good, Sorrow. I\u2019m...been...coward...enough.\u201d</p><p>She heard his scuffling footsteps, and then nothing. Just the echo of her breath in a cavern twenty feet underground.</p><p>Forty-two</p><p>Billy stormed the tavern. He\u2019d gotten a thirdhand message, delivered via police band. Dispatch calling with news from the EMT. An accident.</p><p>Just like Keri. All over again.</p><p>Not Keri, he assured himself. Sorrow hadn\u2019t been on the scene. But she was in danger all the same. And he had to find her.</p><p>The tavern door hit the wall, he\u2019d opened it so hard. Everyone turned to stare.</p><p>Bear spun on his stool. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s gotten into you? Coming in here like a bat outta\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut the man off. There was no time for bullshit grumbling. \u201cThere\u2019s been an accident. Damien, driving under the influence. He\u2019s injured and getting medevacked to Silver City, but he kept asking for me.\u201d Apparently through his slurring, all he did, over and over, was rant how they needed to contact the sheriff. Needed to find Sorrow. Needed to go to the mine. What the hell that all meant, he had no idea.</p><p>\u201cAll I know is, Sorrow had been with him, but now she\u2019s not. She\u2019s out there somewhere, and I think she\u2019s hurt. He said something about an Irish mine, and I need you to tell me what that means.\u201d</p><p>He cursed himself. Could he have done something to stop it? For all he knew, she was lying broken at the bottom of a shaft somewhere.</p><p>Worse than Keri. Unthinkable.</p><p>He\u2019d taken too long to put the pieces together. At first, he\u2019d thought Damien was to blame for Sorrow\u2019s troubles. But then the kid had innocently spoken two words: green gold.</p><p>Then it hit him. Not Damien. Dabney. His father. If Dabney viewed Bear\u2019s property as valuable, for whatever reason, he\u2019d swoop in to buy that land if anything happened to the owner.</p><p>Billy had the makings of a motive but he still didn\u2019t have proof, so he\u2019d done some snooping. Damien had been down to the Town Hall, looking through old mining records. Later, thinking it Simmons Timber business, the clerk had innocently mentioned it to Dabney. Hearing there was an old gold mine on that land would\u2019ve been as much of a shock to him as it\u2019d been to Billy.</p><p>Mines meant gold. And yellow gold was a hell of a lot more valuable than the green kind. Valuable enough to kill for.</p><p>It was Dabney who\u2019d been causing the trouble. Dabney behind the wheel of that Hummer.</p><p>The only missing piece had been how. Dabney didn\u2019t have the muscle to do it alone. That was when Billy checked with the El Dorado County parole officer. The fact that the Simmons family gardener had done time for breaking and entering was a big red flag. Surely Dabney did a background check on his employees, especially the household staff. Which meant Dabney knew he had a record\u2014and now the guy had a new set of crimes to add to the list, and they were currently getting processed at the county lockup. The moment Billy tracked down Sorrow, he\u2019d see that Dabney Simmons joined him there.</p><p>Edith was frantic. \u201cWhat do you mean, Sorrow\u2019s hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d His voice was hollow in his ears. Would it be just like with Keri? Not being there when she needed him? Losing yet another woman he loved? Because he loved Sorrow, more than he ever thought possible.</p><p>He\u2019d come to Sierra Falls thinking to bide his years quietly. He hadn\u2019t expected to live any sort of a life at all. Instead, his feelings were deeper now than when he was married. He was older, his emotions more resonant, because he knew better than before, better than anyone, how it could all be taken in an instant. \u201cI need to find her. Which means I need to find this mine.\u201d</p><p>These people could help. They knew Sierra Falls better than he did, and he was panicking them. His eyes swept the room, engaging every person in there. He took a deep breath and started again from the top. \u201cThe EMT said Damien was agitated, repeating Sorrow\u2019s name, and other things, too. He was fading in and out, so it was hard to follow, but he kept saying something about a mine. An Irish mine, maybe? Does that make sense to any of you? He must\u2019ve meant Irish Camp Road, I can\u2019t think what else.\u201d</p><p>Everyone was quiet. Too quiet. He wanted to scream, to speed out of there without another word and drive till he found her. But instead, he forced his voice to be calm and slow\u2014the most crucial thing right now was for him to play the role of sheriff, not frantic boyfriend. He pinned his eyes on Sorrow\u2019s father. \u201cThe mine, Bear. I need to find this mine.\u201d</p><p>The man nodded gravely. \u201cI know the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Edith asked, dumbfounded.</p><p>Helen piped up, \u201cThere\u2019s a mine in Sierra Falls?\u201d By the looks on everyone\u2019s faces, she wasn\u2019t the only surprised one.</p><p>\u201cIf you follow Irish Camp out past 88, there\u2019s an old fire road. I played there when I was a kid. There was a lot of digging and panning back in the day. This particular mine closed back when my granddaddy was a kid.\u201d</p><p>Billy shoved his hat back on his head. \u201cThen that\u2019s where I\u2019m going. Edith, Bear, rally the troops. We\u2019ll need everyone\u2019s help tracking her down. Helen, call the hospital. No, call Dr. Mark. Maybe he can get some inside info, see if Damien\u2019s coherent yet. Hell, call everyone. And I mean everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we call 911?\u201d someone asked.</p><p>\u201cI am 911.\u201d He was getting aggravated now\u2014hadn\u2019t he just said to call everyone? \u201cBut yeah, get the deputy on his cell, for sure. Scott can help, too. Maybe the Ranger Department knows the mine. Or at least they\u2019ll have some old survey maps lying around.\u201d</p><p>Edith hopped from her chair, following him to the door. She was visibly holding herself together, and barely. \u201cPlease bring my girl home.\u201d</p><p>He spared a moment for Sorrow\u2019s mom, giving her a meaningful look. \u201cI\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>Bear was right behind. \u201cWe\u2019d be lost without her.\u201d Alarm gave an edge to his voice.</p><p>He contemplated the man with a hard look. Fear had stripped away Billy\u2019s filters, and he told him, \u201cThat\u2019s something you should try showing her once in a while.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emotion wrenched Bear\u2019s features into those of an old, pained man. \u201cThen bring me with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t move fast enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Bear grabbed his coat from a hook by the door. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll never find the mine without me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen make tracks, old man.\u201d Billy stormed out the door with Bear on his heels, moving faster than he\u2019d ever seen him.</p><p>Forty-three</p><p>They sped to the trailhead, with Bear glowering in the seat beside him. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t get,\u201d the old man said. \u201cDamien drunk? This time of day? Doesn\u2019t sound like the kid I know.\u201d</p><p>Billy had to agree, but for different reasons. He\u2019d bent his own elbow with the guy and knew from experience it\u2019d take a hell of a lot to get Damien drunk.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just hope he had his wits enough to send us to the right place.\u201d The dirt road degraded until he could go no farther and his wheels spun and spat rocks against the vehicle\u2019s undercarriage. He slammed it into Park. \u201cThis is as far as she goes.\u201d</p> <p>Bear peered out the window. \u201cWe\u2019re not close enough. You using your four-wheel drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how to drive in the mountains.\u201d There was no time for this. He unbuckled, jumped from the car, and leaning in, demanded, \u201cAre you going to show me the mine, or do I need to find it myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I let you get all the glory.\u201d Bear hopped out, looking spry for a man half his age. Sure, he struggled with a limp, but he was keeping up remarkably well for someone who\u2019d given up on good health.</p><p>The trail was slow-going, and Billy was going crazy with frustration. But Bear had been right, the mine would\u2019ve been impossible to find without help.</p><p>He stopped to let Sorrow\u2019s father catch up. The pace was maddening, his fear for Sorrow consuming, and he found himself speaking unchecked. \u201cYou want to know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Bear said between heavy breaths.</p> <p>\u201cI think that you\u2019re not as feeble as you worry you are.\u201d</p><p>The man didn\u2019t lift his eyes from the trail as he grunted, \u201cI\u2019m not feeble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I said you think you\u2019re feeble. I think that stroke scared the hell out of you,\u201d Billy pressed. \u201cI think you\u2019re afraid of testing your limits. But you were lucky. Many people don\u2019t survive it. You\u2019re lucky as hell you\u2019ve got a kid like Sorrow who knew the signs and got you to the hospital early. You need to think on that, on how much you have, instead of focusing on what you\u2019ve lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, here\u2019s what I think: I think I\u2019m done hearing your claptrap theories.\u201d The man looked like he\u2019d swallowed a lemon, but his brow was furrowed in thought, and Billy had to hope his words had sunk in. Bear grumbled to himself, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you or anything, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>A hill rose up beside them, and rather than continuing on the trail, Bear turned to face the steep incline, sighing heavily. \u201cThis is it.\u201d</p><p>Billy surveyed the rise, picking out a path of roots, rocks, and footholds in his mind\u2019s eye, \u201cUp it is, then. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d What he didn\u2019t say was that he\u2019d haul Bear up as he went.</p><p>Bear was trembling by the time he got to the top. \u201cThat way.\u201d He pointed along the ledge, trying to catch his breath. \u201cYou\u2019ll see it. On the right.\u201d</p><p>The man needed to gather his strength, but Billy couldn\u2019t wait. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight behind you,\u201d Bear said. \u201cI told you. Not feeble.\u201d</p><p>If Billy hadn\u2019t been looking for the mine, he would\u2019ve hiked right by it. Just a small black hole, etched into the rock face, it was no wonder folks had forgotten it through the years.</p><p>He shouted for her and strained his ears for a reply. Sorrow\u2019s answering yell came quickly, but her voice sounded strained and far away. Relief swamped him. She was alive. It was enough.</p><p>Billy burst into a run\u2014it was a stupid, precarious thing to do, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself. He was desperate to get to her.</p><p>He burst into the mine, stopping short to let his eyes adjust. The air was close, cool pine breezes of the woods at his back mingled with the still scents of dirt and the abandoned nests of wild animals.</p><p>\u201cSorrow!\u201d he shouted again, and bats exploded from inside the mine, a burst of shrieking and flapping.</p><p>Sorrow screamed.</p><p>He ran toward the sound, eyes scanning the ground. He\u2019d been careless, but it\u2019d be unforgivable if he fell to his death. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just bats. They won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say.\u201d Her voice wavered, but her attempt at humor gave him hope.</p><p>He spotted the broken railing in the shadows, a timber skeleton holding vigil over a narrow black hole in the ground. He edged closer, not trusting the ground beneath him. It was a mineshaft, narrow as a well.</p><p>He dropped to his belly, scooting forward. \u201cI\u2019m here, babe.\u201d A ladder led up to the surface; she\u2019d climbed halfway up, and he was startled to see her closer than he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she said, and his relief turned to alarm.</p><p>He\u2019d heard her pain and distress and assessed the situation, his eyes accustomed to the dark now. At least half the ladder rungs had crumbled to dust, and she held one arm tucked painfully at her side.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he ordered. \u201cGood God, Sorrow. What are you doing? You\u2019re going to kill yourself.\u201d</p><p>He eased over the ledge as far as he could go, stretching his arm out to her, but it was no good. She was just out of his reach.</p><p>He ran his hand down along the ladder rails. Between him and where Sorrow had managed to climb, there were only a couple of nubs where rungs should be. \u201cLooks like you can\u2019t go any higher. Can you ease yourself back down?\u201d</p><p>She gave a tight shake to her head. \u201cA bunch of rungs snapped when I stepped on them.\u201d</p><p>And she was too high up to jump back down. Her arm was broken, and God knew what else. He couldn\u2019t risk further injury, which meant the only way for her to go was up.</p><p>He looked around frantically. The fragments of an old pulley system hung overhead, but the ropes had rotted decades ago. Why didn\u2019t he keep rope in the car? When they got out of there, he was going to do some serious reassessing of the safety gear he kept in the SUV.</p><p>Bear\u2019s scuffling footsteps announced his arrival. \u201cYou sure ran off half cocked,\u201d the old man said.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Sorrow\u2019s voice broke on the word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, girl. We\u2019re getting you out.\u201d Bear came and stood at the edge of the shaft, sucking on his teeth, deep in thought. \u201cWe\u2019ll need something for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ease down the side maybe, if it weren\u2019t so tight.\u201d Billy considered the drop. He didn\u2019t care that he might break a leg\u2014his concern was hitting her on the way down. He peered up at Bear. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right back\u201d was all the man said in reply.</p><p>Sorrow made a tiny whimpering sound, and as much as he wanted to soothe her, he knew the only way to handle it was to get her mind on other things. \u201cHold on,\u201d he said in a firm voice. \u201cTalk to me, Sorrow.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound that was half laugh, half sniffle. \u201cTalk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe. You can start by telling me how you managed to get halfway up a mineshaft with a broken arm, using nothing but a decaying ladder.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment, her breath echoing in the narrow passage. \u201cA lot of shimmying,\u201d she said finally, her voice wavering with emotion.</p><p>She was trying, so he\u2019d try, too. He kept his voice light as he said, \u201cI\u2019d like to see that sometime.\u201d</p><p>But rather than playing along, when she spoke again her voice was fragile, cracking as a child\u2019s might. \u201cMy dad really came?\u201d But then she was quick to brush it off with a weak laugh. \u201cI bet he\u2019s just worried I won\u2019t get the roast in the oven in time to feed the early birds.\u201d</p><p>Her doubt in her own lovability broke his heart. \u201cAw, hell, babe. Of course he came. He loves you. We all do.\u201d</p><p>The words had rolled off his tongue without thought, but he felt Sorrow hold her breath. She looked up at him, and her face glowed in the shadows, pale, beautiful, and dirt-smudged. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it,\u201d he said, his voice strong. \u201cI do, Sorrow. I love you. And the moment we get you out of here, I\u2019m going to show you just how much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool your jets,\u201d Bear grumbled from behind him. \u201cSon of a gun, Sheriff, can\u2019t you control yourself for two minutes?\u201d</p><p>Billy felt like slugging the guy. Until he turned and saw the giant branch Bear had dragged in behind him. His eyes goggled. \u201cWhere the hell\u2019d you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom a tree.\u201d Bear grumbled under his breath, \u201cFool city boys.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cA tree, he says. I figured that, old man. But...how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust used my belt to pull it down.\u201d Bear tried to look nonchalant, but Billy read the pride in his eyes. \u201cBack in my timber days, we called it tree fishing. Best way to clear the deadwood. We used rope, but a belt works just fine.\u201d</p><p>He gave the man an admiring look. \u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>Bear went to the ledge and shouted down to his daughter, \u201cGot to get you back for the early birds. They think you\u2019re making pot roast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Sorrow exclaimed, but Billy saw the humor in her eyes. It\u2019d been just what she needed.</p><p>Billy lowered the tree limb down the hole\u2014the thing must\u2019ve been a good twenty feet long, and it scraped along the ceiling of the mine as he shoved it down. Dust and bits of rope showered onto Sorrow, and she looked away, shutting her eyes tight. Debris pelted his neck and back, but he didn\u2019t budge\u2014he refused to take his eyes from her.</p><p>He worried the branch might snap, but it was dead not rotted, and thankfully still had enough resilience to bend. Unfortunately, that also meant it\u2019d be too spindly at the top to support Sorrow\u2019s weight. But, leaned against one side of the ladder, it offered enough traction for her to shimmy up. He didn\u2019t need her to go far, just high enough for him to grab hold. She scrambled, and he held his breath. Finally she was within reach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrab my hand, Sorrow. I got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReach, girl,\u201d her dad echoed. \u201cYou\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>She hooked the elbow of her broken arm around the remains of one of the rungs, wincing with the effort. She strained her good hand up until her fingers brushed his arm. Billy grasped her forearm and scooted backward, hauling her up and over.</p> <p>Still lying on the ground, he swept her into an embrace, careful of her broken wrist. He gazed at her, drinking in the sight of her, safe in his arms. Her face was filthy, there were cobwebs in her hair, and there was a goose egg on her head the size of a baseball. But Billy didn\u2019t see any of that\u2014all he knew was that he was looking at his future bride. \u201cYou\u2019re one helluva woman, you know that, Sorrow Bailey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it,\u201d she said, smiling broadly. \u201cOh, and Sheriff? I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Bear turned to give them privacy. \u201cIf you kids are done, let\u2019s get the hell out of here. I\u2019ve got a neck to wring. I plan on killing Damien Simmons with my bare hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Damien\u2019s fault,\u201d she said as Billy helped her stand. She swayed as she got her legs under her, and he held her close.</p><p>\u201cLike hell it wasn\u2019t Damien,\u201d Bear snarled. \u201cHe brought you here, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Dad. My falling was an accident.\u201d Sorrow clung to Billy for balance as they made their way from the mine, and he thought he might never let her go again. \u201cI think he ate something that made him sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething from his parents, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u201d\u2014she stopped\u2014\u201cWhat? Dabney and Phoebe sent us cookies. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Billy pressed on, walking as he talked. \u201cAll the problems at the lodge, Laura\u2019s hit-and-run...it was Damien\u2019s dad. He\u2019s been sabotaging you all along.\u201d He felt her stagger, and hoisted her higher, taking more of her weight. \u201cWe need to get you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to tell me what happened,\u201d she insisted. She was striding along the path, looking nothing like a woman who\u2019d spent the afternoon trapped in a mineshaft.</p><p>He shook his head\u2014there was no stopping her. \u201cDabney wanted your land. At first he wanted the timber. But then he found out about the gold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that mine isn\u2019t on our land,\u201d Bear said.</p><p>Sorrow added, \u201cAnd Damien told me it was a failure anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Billy said. \u201cThe lode was played out, and that mine was a failure. Thing is, that wasn\u2019t the mother lode. The mother lode is on Bailey acreage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly cow,\u201d Sorrow exclaimed. \u201cAre you saying there\u2019s gold on our land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I learned that Dabney knew about the mine, from there, it was a no-brainer. There aren\u2019t many surveyors around. It took me fifteen minutes to track down the one he worked with, out of Sacramento. Modern technology makes things like prospecting a whole other ball game. They found gold\u2014a high-grade vein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get how Dabney could\u2019ve done all this,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cHe was with us in the kitchen when the oven exploded. It was his car that got hit when Helen spun out on the black ice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDabney didn\u2019t do it alone. He had help from his family gardener. The man has a record as long as your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy,\u201d Sorrow exclaimed. \u201cBut you know what\u2019s crazier...we\u2019re rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Bear said. \u201cThat ain\u2019t how it works. My granddad was panning for gold before Dabney Simmons was a light in his mama\u2019s eye. We\u2019re all sitting on gold out here. It\u2019s the mining of it that\u2019s hard. Dabney\u2019s too much the fool to know that.\u201d He turned to Billy, getting back on point. \u201cSo if it\u2019s my land, why pick on my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Billy took a moment to help both of them navigate down the ravine. \u201cIt makes sense. Despite my doubts, it seems our Damien is a decent guy.\u201d He put his arm around Sorrow\u2019s waist, adjusting her arm to take most of her weight. \u201cEvery one of those accidents at the lodge drove the two of you closer. When you had trouble, Damien came to your rescue. The more accidents you had, the closer you got. If you\u2019d eventually married the guy, the mine would\u2019ve become just another part of the Simmons empire. Or at least your share of it would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then why try to run me over? I can\u2019t marry Damien if I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe game became deadly when you had the great good sense to break up with Prince Charming. That meant it was time to sabotage the lodge and take it by force.\u201d He looked at Bear. \u201cI imagine Dabney\u2019s long-term game was to drive your business into the ground and then make you an offer you couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow staggered as they reached the bottom of the gully, and Billy simply swept her into his arms. \u201cPut me down,\u201d she protested at once. \u201cI\u2019m too big to carry.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little bounce, careful not to jostle her arm. She was soft and full and perfect in his hands. \u201cYou feel just right to me.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her good arm around his neck, and the feel of her was like a missing puzzle piece clicking into place. She whispered in his ear, \u201cThanks for finding me.\u201d</p><p>Billy pointed his chin toward Bear. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have done it without that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom and I would be lost without you, girl.\u201d Bear\u2019s lip twitched as he spoke, and Billy chuckled to himself, seeing how hard it was for the man to speak warmly. \u201cThought I\u2019d have to come drag you out of that mine myself. Your sheriff was moving slower than molasses in January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow...rich or not, we\u2019re sitting on a gold mine,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou know what that means? I\u2019m definitely getting an assistant.\u201d</p><p>The men laughed and Sorrow did, too, and it was a wonderful sound. She tucked her head in his neck and he hugged her closer, managing to carry her effortlessly back to the car.</p><p>She\u2019d been wrong\u2014she was a feather in his arms. He could carry her forever if she let him. He hoped she would.</p><p>He\u2019d never forget Keri\u2014she\u2019d been his first love, and there was no greater gift than that. But he\u2019d aged a lifetime in a few short years, and his heart and soul had found peace there with Sorrow.</p><p>He let Bear walk ahead on the trail. Sorrow nestled close. \u201cThanks for carrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking how there\u2019s nothing better than holding you.\u201d He hugged her even tighter, overwhelmed by the urge to have her, to make Sorrow his, wanting her with an intensity he\u2019d never experienced before.</p><p>She nipped him on the ear, whispering, \u201cI could think of maybe one thing that\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>They went to Silver City Memorial, where she got bandaged up. Then Billy sped her back to his place, hoping to put that theory to the test.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to lie in bed?\u201d Billy was torn. He wanted to be gentle with Sorrow. But he also wanted to take her, to have her and love her. To take care of her. To let her know he\u2019d be there to do all of those things for the rest of her life if she\u2019d let him.</p><p>Sorrow used her good hand to grab a pillow from his couch and toss it in front of the fireplace. \u201cI\u2019m sure I want to lie right here, with you, in front of the fire that you\u2019re about to make for me.\u201d</p><p>He added a couple of pillows to the mix, making a cozy nest for the two of them. \u201cI\u2019m about to make you a fire, am I?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, settling under the afghan. \u201cMm-hm. A nice big hot one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI best get to it then.\u201d He squatted in front of the hearth, stacking kindling and logs. He glanced back at her as he twisted sheets of newspaper into rolls for tinder. The sight of her arm in a cast made him weak, but it could\u2019ve been worse\u2014she could\u2019ve needed surgery. Or he might not have found her at all.</p><p>He forced such thoughts from his mind. He\u2019d be there with her, enjoying the moment, looking with hope to the future while putting away regrets of the past.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sheriff.\u201d Sorrow had a saucy light in her eye, and it was one he\u2019d already come to recognize. \u201cYou almost done over there?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. God, he loved this girl. \u201cOh, I\u2019m done...with the fire, that is.\u201d He stood, wiping his hands on a rag. The kindling began to crackle and pop, warm at his back as he faced her. \u201cI was thinking maybe you wanted me to do something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d She pulled aside the afghan for him to join her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin you?\u201d He knelt beside her.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. A girl gets cold on the floor. And lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold and lonely. We can\u2019t have that.\u201d He slid in next to her, and she turned to face him, wrapping her good arm around his neck. Their bodies fit like two puzzle pieces. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, helping her adjust her injured arm.</p><p>They settled her broken wrist on the floor over her head, nestled in pillows. \u201cI\u2019m good now,\u201d she said.</p><p>He sighed, a satisfied sound. \u201cYou are. You have no idea how good.\u201d He stroked his hand up her side. In the hospital, she\u2019d been unable to pull her sweater back over her cast and had become chilled in just her tank top, and so he\u2019d put her in his flannel shirt the moment they got back to his place. And, just as he\u2019d imagined, she was sexy as hell in the oversized red and black plaid. \u201cYou warming up?\u201d</p><p>Her hand found him beneath the blanket, and she caressed his leg. \u201cIt\u2019s getting downright hot in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d He snuck his hand under the flannel, finding her breast and teasing her through the thin cotton of her tank.</p><p>She moaned, leaning close to nip at his jaw, then leaned in for a deep kiss. \u201cNow I\u2019m burning up,\u201d she whispered as she parted from him. Her eyes were glazed with desire.</p><p>He swept the hair from her face. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d His eyes went to her mouth, so glistening and tempting. \u201cI could kiss you forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Those lips curled into a sexy smile, \u201cI was hoping you had other things in mind.\u201d</p><p>They kissed again, until they were both breathless. He tugged at her hem. \u201cMaybe we should take this off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should.\u201d She sat up a little, leaning on to his body for support, trying to wrestle off her top. But as he helped if off, the sleeve tugged on her cast, and she grunted.</p> <p>He froze. \u201cWait, are you sure?\u201d His body raged for her, aching for release after knowing such fear for her safety, but he didn\u2019t want to do anything she wasn\u2019t ready for. \u201cI can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t.\u201d She held his gaze, the firelight casting gold light along the side of her face. \u201cBilly, I\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>His heart was full as he smiled at her. \u201cThen I know what we need to do.\u201d He rolled onto his back, and she gave a little surprised chirp as he swept her above him. \u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a naughty smile as she sat astride him, nestling him into just the right spot between her legs. \u201cMm. This.\u201d She leaned down to steal a kiss. \u201cThis is good,\u201d she whispered against his mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s just one problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your arm hurting?\u201d He gripped her hips, ready to swoop her back onto the floor.</p> <p>\u201cWhat arm?\u201d She laughed, shaking her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I promise it\u2019s not the arm.\u201d She swayed her hips, grinding into him. \u201cThe problem is, too many pants.\u201d</p><p>He had to suck in a breath\u2014he would not accidentally lose it in his uniform trousers like a teenager. \u201cWe\u2019d best take care of this whole pants situation.\u201d</p><p>They made quick work of the rest of their clothes, and when he pulled her back atop him, he remained seated, keeping her straddled, facing him on his lap. The fire had warmed the room, and the afghan fell from her shoulders. He swept his fingers up her naked back, lacing them into her hair, luxuriating in the weight of it in his hands. \u201cI need you closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she purred. \u201cCloser is good.\u201d</p><p>He let those silky blond waves slide from his fingers and cradled her lovely face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you close forever, Sorrow. If you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>And she did.</p> <p>Forty-four</p><p>It was a gorgeous day for a festival, the sky a cloudless, robin\u2019s egg blue. Spring snowmelt had the falls rushing, visible in peekaboo glimpses from the picnic grounds.</p><p>Sorrow felt someone come and stand at her shoulder. She knew without looking that it was her sister. Tucking hands in pockets, she leaned back into her.</p><p>Despite all their sisterly bickering and rivalry, when the shift finally happened in their relationship, it\u2019d been a quiet one. She saw clearly now how the lodge was Laura\u2019s place, and that it was Sorrow\u2019s turn to spread her wings.</p><p>It was a giddy day when she\u2019d handed over her management duties. Her big sister\u2019s first order of business was putting Sorrow in charge of revamping the tavern menu. Dad had grumbled, but there was no arguing with a united front. As for Sully, he was as thrilled with the change as she was, claiming if he never baked another Prospector\u2019s Pie, it\u2019d be too soon.</p><p>She and Laura had been a team ever since, and the festival was the latest thing to benefit. It was still early in the day yet, but the festivities were already an obvious, unabashed hit. For a few minutes, the two of them simply stood there, watching in contented silence. Between Laura\u2019s marketing savvy and Sorrow\u2019s talent with people and cooking, it was shaping up to be the most successful event the town had ever seen.</p><p>Laura wrapped an arm around her, giving her arm a squeeze. \u201cYou done good, baby sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d She edged away to catch Laura\u2019s eye. \u201cYou were the one doing all the work behind the scenes. This festival never would\u2019ve happened without you.\u201d Sorrow raised a hand, silencing her sister\u2019s protests. \u201cSeriously. This whole town wasn\u2019t the same without you. I was stupid not to see it sooner.\u201d</p> <p>Their moment was broken by screams and laughter swelling in the distance. \u201cThat\u2019d be the pie toss,\u201d Laura said, looking toward the games at the far edge of the field.</p><p>They caught sight of Ruby and Pearl Kidd headed their way, with Marlene and Sully walking several paces behind. The two were holding hands.</p><p>\u201cHow awesome is that?\u201d Laura whispered.</p><p>\u201cTotally awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder what the old aunties think about it?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow chuckled. \u201cThey probably think Marlene has become a fast woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good on her,\u201d Laura said. \u201cWe fast girls need to stick together.\u201d</p><p>As they watched Marlene\u2019s elderly entourage make their approach across the festival grounds, Sorrow whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll regret to my dying day that I didn\u2019t get to see them the day I fell down that mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed it all right,\u201d Laura said, stifling a giggle. \u201cThose two ladies showed up like the SWAT team. They were quite a sight, speeding in, bouncing up and down on the bench of Marlene\u2019s old pickup, Ruby with a fistful of historical survey maps.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow had to dab tears of laughter from her eyes. \u201cI think if Billy and Dad hadn\u2019t found me, Pearl and Ruby would\u2019ve tracked down the mine and rescued me themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know it. You should\u2019ve seen Mom\u2019s face. \u2018Good Lord, it\u2019s the Kidd ladies,\u2019\u201d Laura mimicked, her voice a high-pitched exclamation that made Sorrow laugh even harder. \u201cThe way they peeled into the driveway, I thought for sure they were going to take out the porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh...\u201d Sorrow said, trying to stop her convulsive laughter. They were headed their way. \u201cThey\u2019ll hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations to us!\u201d Pearl exclaimed as they neared. \u201cIt\u2019s a smash!\u201d</p><p>Ruby nodded enthusiastically\u2014she and her sister were practically beaming. \u201cThere\u2019s record attendance, with both tourists and historians, too, from as far away as the Bay Area. I just wish Emerald were here to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Emmie.\u201d Pearl sighed. \u201cShe\u2019d have thought this a hoot.\u201d</p><p>Marlene greeted the Bailey sisters with kisses on cheeks. \u201cHow right you are. Ma would\u2019ve loved this.\u201d</p><p>Pearl interrupted with an impatient hand on Laura\u2019s arm. \u201cDid you know, I heard a reporter from the Sacramento Bee is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reporter indeed,\u201d Marlene said. She faced Laura. \u201cThat has you written all over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d Laura shrugged, but couldn\u2019t conceal her smile. \u201cI might\u2019ve known someone who knew someone.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow chimed in, \u201cThe biggest news seems to be how our \u2018Buck Larsen Festival\u2019 turned into the first annual Sierra Falls Gold Rush Women\u2019s Festival instead.\u201d</p><p>Laura met her eye. \u201cCan\u2019t hold a festival for someone who was a jerk.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow gave her a knowing smile. \u201cThanks for seeing the light. I like the new theme we came up with.\u201d At first, Laura had wanted to push the Buck Larsen affair, but in the end had trusted the youngest Bailey sister\u2019s opinion on the matter.</p><p>Laura nudged her shoulder. \u201cWhat man in his right mind leaves a woman named Sorrow anyway?\u201d</p><p>The comment made her feel a little shyly self-conscious, and not in a bad way. Only now was she realizing how loved she was in Sierra Falls, and it was Billy who\u2019d opened her eyes to it. Seeing the community from an outsider\u2019s perspective, she recognized just how precious Sierra Falls was. And with its snowcapped peaks on the horizon, the lakes and the wildlife, the rush of the falls in spring, and those fragrant pines so thick all around, she saw with new eyes just how glorious her home was.</p><p>The mountains were in her blood. She wasn\u2019t trapped in the town, rather she carried the town inside her, in her heart. She felt connected to Sierra Falls, just as she felt connected to her thrice-great-grandmother. Sorrow Crabtree had been a woman, just like her, trying to find love and go her own way.</p><p>She held Laura\u2019s gaze a moment, before telling her, \u201cIt was a stroke of genius dedicating this to pioneer women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept\u201d\u2014Sully spoke up, nodding toward one of the booths\u2014\u201cyour father is over there complaining that you didn\u2019t bake enough for the cakewalk.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed, and Laura clapped her on the shoulder. \u201cDad\u2019s become her biggest fan.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, no longer bothering to temper her smile. \u201cGo figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Bear finally saw the light,\u201d Marlene said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd more power to her,\u201d Sully said. He looked at Sorrow with pride in his eyes. \u201cThe new head chef of the Thirsty Bear Tavern\u2014it\u2019s about time, girl.\u201d</p><p>Their regular diners had all heard the news, too. It was hard to miss, seeing as Dad had taken to swaggering around the place, bragging about his youngest daughter\u2019s cooking and how folk better make a reservation now because they\u2019re booked solid through the month with her installed as their new head chef\u2014and he always stressed the word chef, as though he were actually speaking French or something.</p><p>\u201cWill you miss it?\u201d Laura asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all too happy to say good-bye to burgers for a while.\u201d Sully nestled Marlene closer. \u201cThe Harley is already in the shop getting tuned. Me and Marlene, we\u2019re going to take a tour come June. Maybe ride up to Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll miss you,\u201d Sorrow said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be too busy to miss us,\u201d Marlene said with a wink, implying more than just her kitchen duties.</p><p>Sorrow would never forget the day her parents announced their intentions to her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to cook,\u201d Dad had told her. \u201cEvery day of the week, if you want.\u201d</p><p>It was such an abrupt attitude shift, she didn\u2019t entirely believe it. \u201cI thought you were upset, you know, thinking the oven got ruined on my watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe oven? Aw hell, girl. Everyone knows the fire was that damned Dabney\u2019s fault. Screw the oven.\u201d His gruff voice had turned ragged with emotion. \u201cI could\u2019ve lost you in that fire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sentiment had humbled her. And honestly, it\u2019d shocked her, too. Something had happened that day at the mine. And part of the credit was owed to Billy, who\u2019d had her father pegged all along.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our baby,\u201d her mother had added.</p><p>Dad agreed\u2014and it\u2019d been tantamount to an emotional outburst. \u201cWe rely on you. We already have one kid so far away.\u201d His face had twisted up funny when he\u2019d said that last bit. If it\u2019d been any other man, the expression would\u2019ve looked angry, but with her father, she knew, it was deep emotion he masked.</p> <p>Even her mom was chiming in more than usual. She\u2019d interrupted, saying, \u201cWhat your father is trying to tell you is that we rely on you. How would we\u2014how would I\u2014have managed without you?\u201d Mom gave Dad a chastising look. \u201cI guess your father has held on to the past too tightly. Maybe he thought that a firm grip would keep you from running off like your siblings did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running anywhere. I just want to be given credit. Given responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Her father gave a gruff nod, visibly struggling with something. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard. The stroke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy.\u201d She reached for him then, and he wrapped her in his arms. \u201cIt must be hard. Just because you\u2019re not out there chopping wood every morning doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not as strong, or as vital, or as important to us as before.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d given her a pat on the shoulder as they parted, looking uncomfortable at the sudden roiling emotions. \u201cFine then. You run a tight kitchen. Now get to it. Lunch crowd will be coming soon.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019d been that.</p><p>Sully\u2019s voice interrupted her thoughts. \u201cOnly makes good sense,\u201d he was saying. \u201cNobody packs the tavern with hungry diners like Sorrow here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you taught her everything you know, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Marlene took his arm. \u201cThough it\u2019s a wonder Bear didn\u2019t see what was going on under his own nose. What a shock about Dabney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess Damien will get his shot at the helm of Simmons Timber sooner rather than later,\u201d Sorrow said. \u201cHis dad can\u2019t exactly run the company from prison, can he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrison,\u201d the Kidd sisters gasped, practically in unison.</p><p>\u201cJust what we need,\u201d Laura said, not bothering to conceal her scowl. \u201cAnother Simmons male sitting on the throne.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrow was quick to correct her. \u201cDon\u2019t count Damien out yet. There\u2019s a good guy in there\u2014he\u2019ll find his way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of changes...\u201d Marlene\u2019s gaze drifted across the grass to her grandson as he spread out a picnic blanket for him and his date. \u201cDid you hear the news? Craig is headed to Chicago after graduation. Decided to go Navy. Said he was tired of being landlocked.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good life.\u201d Sully tucked her arm more snugly in his, ignoring the scandalized glances Pearl and Ruby shot their way. \u201cHe\u2019s ready, Marlene. He\u2019s a man.\u201d</p><p>Marlene patted his hand, gratitude in her eyes. Those two made a great couple.</p><p>She glanced at her big sister to share a look, but when she saw those wickedly narrowed eyes, she braced herself.</p><p>Laura asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Boyfriend. Billy was so much more than just a boyfriend. He\u2019d become her world. She\u2019d have loved nothing more than to have him there for the entire day, but he was the sheriff, and his responsibilities never took a day off. And though they hadn\u2019t been together long, their bond was a powerful one. It was as though she felt him out there, their two hearts connected, no matter where they were.</p><p>But instead of saying all that, she just gave a casual shrug. \u201cOnce he saw the booths were all up and running, he said he had some quick department business to attend to.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until later that afternoon that Sorrow got a taste of just what that pressing business was.</p><p>He hated leaving Sorrow\u2019s side on her big day. But it was just for a little while. And it was necessary.</p><p>Because Billy had a ring to pick up in Silver City.</p><p>He\u2019d cut the timing close, but he wanted everything to be perfect\u2014perfect size, perfect fit\u2014when he presented it to Sorrow. And man, that ring was just right.</p><p>He\u2019d known the moment he saw it in the jewelry store window. It was an antique, a diamond surrounded by tiny sapphires in an engraved platinum setting. It was delicate and exquisite, but strong and solid, too. Not over the top. Nothing pretentious or splashy\u2014a classic.</p><p>Just like Sorrow.</p><p>As Sorrow Crabtree\u2019s great-great-great-granddaughter and namesake, she\u2019d been asked to join some of the other women in donning period dresses for the late afternoon supper show. A number of townsfolk had gotten into the spirit, dressing up like pioneers and prospectors from gold rush days. Everyone had migrated from the picnic grounds to the hall to enjoy the rousing music and saloon dance numbers just like the elder Sorrow might have performed.</p><p>Little did the audience know, they were about to get an even better show than they\u2019d bargained for.</p><p>Unable to resist Sorrow and her enthusiasm in the days before the festival, he\u2019d found an old-time sheriff\u2019s costume online. And, he had to admit, he felt like quite the badass clinking around the festival in his new spurs.</p><p>They\u2019d talked around marriage, so he had an inkling he\u2019d find a willing partner. Lately, though, he\u2019d been avoiding the subject. Not because he was no longer interested, but because he\u2019d wanted to keep his surprise.</p><p>His smile was wide, watching her laugh and fake her way through the old-time dance hall moves. For someone whose sense of responsibility and commitment to hard work and family was so hardwired, Sorrow sure did know how to experience joy. And the pleasure she took in her cooking was just the start of it. She embraced life with an easy, natural immediacy that\u2019d paved the way for him to engage in his own life once more.</p><p>To engage his heart.</p><p>The number ended, and for a moment he lost sight of her amidst the milling, cheering crowd. He searched for her, and he knew a funny spurt of discontent until his eyes found her again, standing at the edge of the stage.</p><p>The buzzing of the audience came to him as though through a tunnel. She was the reason he was there, happily wearing a silly getup with a diamond ring in his pocket.</p><p>He watched her, feeling calmed and contented by the very sight of her. Someone in the crowd had shouted something, and she was smiling down, one part of a three-way conversation that included June Harlan at the piano. Sorrow was openhearted, generous, thoughtful, down-to-earth, and quick to smile...everyone in town loved her. How he got to be the lucky man who got to keep her was beyond him.</p><p>And she was the one. His heart was clear of all doubts on that score. He wondered if, in the deepest part of his soul, he hadn\u2019t known it all along. Sorrow had renewed that part of him he\u2019d lost after Keri\u2019s death\u2014that inner wellspring that he\u2019d thought had died had simply been temporarily dried out, now replenished by her presence in his life.</p><p>She was the gift he thought he\u2019d never receive\u2014a chance at a second chapter. And this time, it was a love more profound than any he\u2019d ever known, because he understood now just how precious, how valuable was such a treasure.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. He went to her, parting the crowd as he made his way across the floor. The clink of his spurs amused him, widening the smile on his face.</p><p>He leapt up onto the stage and took her hand, distantly aware how the room had begun to hush.</p><p>She beamed. \u201cHey, stranger! There you are. I\u2019ve been wondering\u2014\u201d</p><p>As he got down on one knee, the crowd gasped and the words froze on her lips.</p><p>An elderly voice exclaimed, \u201cI knew it!\u201d It\u2019d been one of the Kidd sisters\u2014Pearl maybe. Laughs followed. Other voices chimed in, cheering him on.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give any of them a second thought. His eyes were only for his Sorrow. The silence became complete.</p><p>He smiled up at her, so pretty and flushed from her dancing. Tendrils of curling blond hair had sprung free, framing her face. She was a vision.</p><p>She met his eyes, looking a combination of bewildered and thrilled. He could see from the tight bodice of her old-fashioned dress how her breath stuttered, caught.</p><p>He sighed as something unclenched in his own chest\u2014she would say yes. She would be his, forever.</p><p>Calm and sure, he gave her hands a squeeze. He cleared his throat. \u201cSorrow Ann Bailey, would you do me the honor of becoming my bride?\u201d</p><p>Whoops and whistles exploded through the hall. He heard Bear somewhere in the crowd boasting how he had a lawman in the family now.</p><p>She laughed and cried, nodding away, her eyes serious but her expression light. She was radiant\u2014joyful and tearful and so perfectly herself. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>That one word reverberated through his soul. He\u2019d thought to be discreet\u2014he was the town sheriff after all\u2014but he couldn\u2019t help it. He stood and sealed it with a kiss.</p><p>The crowd erupted in cheers.</p><p>His next words were whispered for her ears alone. He knew how she longed to see the world, and he had to let her know she was free to do just that. He wanted nothing more than for Sorrow to follow her heart, and he\u2019d happily follow her till the ends of the earth. All he needed was home, and that was right by her side. \u201cWe can go anywhere,\u201d he told her. \u201cLive anywhere. I\u2019d even go back to the city, if that\u2019s what you wanted. You name it.\u201d</p><p>She cupped a hand on his cheek, and her touch was electric, crackling straight to the core of him. Those blue-green eyes connected with his, and the last ache in his heart melted away. \u201cWe\u2019ll travel,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I always want to come home with you. To Sierra Falls.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
