The worst possible idea imaginable. She had spent three years denying the desire, denying the truth of her own feelings. If she walked up to that room, then it would change things forever.</p><p>Marey pulled her little car into the parking lot of the motel and stared at the exterior nervously. Was she brave enough to do it? Could she actually walk in there and give in to all the desires she had kept hidden all her life, and then walk away as though it had never happened?</p><p>Her hands gripped the steering wheel, her fingers curling around it in a death grip as she fought the tremors that quaked through her body. She didn\u2019t know if she could do it. She had spent too many years fighting it. Unlike her friends, the merry five who had entered into marriages with infamous Trojans, Marey knew she likely didn\u2019t have what it took to carry this off.</p> <p>It was one night, her hormones screamed at her. One stupid night of wild, hot sex, stop philosophizing over it. She could do this.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t she?</p><p>Of course she could. She was thirty-five, not twenty, and she hadn\u2019t been a virgin for a long time. Damned good thing, she reminded herself\u2014Saxon Brogan would terrify a virgin.</p><p>She laid her head against the steering wheel, groaning pitifully as she tried to force herself from the car. Wasn\u2019t this what she wanted? she reminded herself. One hot, wicked night with the man of her dreams before reality came with the rising sun and she went back to the staid, sterile life she lived.</p><p>Why? Something snapped within her then. Why did she have to return to anything? There was no husband. No children. No parents to catch her in some naughty act. All she had were her friends. Friends that one by one had fallen into the clutches of a lifestyle that Marey might not understand, but didn\u2019t condemn. And it wasn\u2019t as if she was doing anything illicit.</p> <p>She ignored the flashing thought of the underclothes she was wearing. Or those she wasn\u2019t wearing, she reminded herself.</p><p>She could do this. She raised her head, nodding firmly. There was no law that said the man who fucked you had to love you, was there? Of course there wasn\u2019t. Besides, she loved Sax. The admission was one she rarely allowed herself to make. One she hid from herself as much as possible.</p><p>Fear had held her hostage for years. The fear that her ex-husband, Vince, would finally slip his hold on sanity and kill her. The fear that she was making another mistake, that her heart would pay the price this time. Her pride had been sacrificed to her ruined marriage and Vince\u2019s fury. But her heart. If Sax broke her heart, could she survive it?</p><p>She breathed in roughly. She would have to survive it. Now, dammit, she had waited too long. Fantasies could only sustain a woman for so long, and toys were a poor second to what she knew was waiting for her.</p><p>Sax, with his quirky little smile, his dark eyes, his voice whispering his need for her. The sight of his hands, so much darker than her pale flesh, coasting over her body, bringing her a pleasure she had never known before. Dominant, commanding, he was part of the exclusive men\u2019s club that had been nicknamed Trojans. They were dominant, forceful, but even more, they practiced sharing their women, bringing them to heights of arousal that were rumored to leave their women weak for days.</p><p>Her friends had married into the club. And though getting details was like pulling teeth without anesthesia, she had managed to pry out enough to fuel her own midnight fantasies.</p> <p>Was she brave enough? If she could fantasize about it, then surely she had the courage to do it. To go to Sax and take the pleasure she knew awaited her. To see if a future was possible, if the fantasies were a pale excuse for reality, or vice versa.</p><p>She pried her fingers from the steering wheel, grabbed her small purse and opened the car door before she could change her mind. She was a grown woman. A mature adult. And if there was one man in the world who could trip her switches, it was Sax. So what if he didn\u2019t love her, if he was miles out of her league. He wanted her. For tonight at least, she could be the woman she wanted to be, with no fear of gossip or reprisals.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, she moved across the parking lot and up the stairs to the second landing. Room two twenty-nine. She pulled the key card from the side pocket of her purse and gripped it with tense fingers. Nerves shook her body, pounded through her bloodstream. Adrenaline was a crashing crescendo in her ears as she approached the door and drew in a hard, deep breath.</p><p>She could do this. She had waited years, lusting after a man she feared she couldn\u2019t keep. Besides, it was almost Christmas\u2014well, almost Thanksgiving anyway. She could treat herself to something a little different this year. Something hot and wild, something she could carry with her forever, no matter what the future might hold.</p><p>She slid the card into the electronic lock, waited until the light flashed green, then turned the handle slowly.</p><p>See, she could do this. She pushed the door open slowly, and stepped in before coming to a shocking, mind-numbing stop.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Sax Brogan was enraged as he entered the ER, coming to a stop as James Wyman rose from one of the plastic seats and moved quickly to meet him.</p><p>He wanted to hit something. Someone. Every muscle in his body bunched, tightened with the impulse as the other man approached.</p> <p>An hour at the police department hadn\u2019t improved his mood. Being suspected of physical assault and attempted rape had been more than shocking. When he learned who he was accused of assaulting, he had nearly lost his mind.</p><p>His only thought was to get to her, to make certain she was okay, to see with his own eyes the damage done.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s conscious now,\u201d James murmured as he reached him, then waved him toward the elevators. \u201cThey have her sedated, though. The injuries aren\u2019t that bad, the concussion is mild. The doctor thinks she\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat crazy ex of hers?\u201d Brogan clenched his fists, fighting his fury. He couldn\u2019t believe this. It was inconceivable.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d James sighed as they entered the elevator. \u201cThe detective called a few minutes ago. They have him in custody now, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to help Marey when she faces you.\u201d</p><p>Sax glanced back at James with a frown. The investigator had told him Marey called the station herself, giving a statement over the phone and securing his release.</p><p>\u201cShe knows you\u2019re aware of what happened. That you know she thought she was meeting you in that motel,\u201d he explained patiently. \u201cYou know how she is. She\u2019s fought this thing between you two for too long. This isn\u2019t going to help things.\u201d</p><p>Sax remained quiet. He stared at the elevator display panel, ticking off the floors until the muted bell sounded and it came to a stop.</p><p>The bastard ex-husband had found her weakness, just as they had all known he would.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll get over it,\u201d he finally said, reining in his need for violence. \u201cStarting now.\u201d</p><p>He had stayed away from her out of respect for her, because she had asked him to. Her soft voice, her gentle gray eyes had pleaded with him not to press her, and he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Squire Port, Virginia, home base for Delacourte and Conover Electronics was a small little community. Everyone was at least acquainted with every one else, and many knew each other well. Delacourte Electronics promoted a friendly, casual atmosphere with its employees and their families, and because of that, Sax had known Marey for years. Before the messy divorce and her withdrawal from all but her closest friends. He also knew her ex well enough to know that any relationship he began with her would be marred by the man\u2019s possessive insanity.</p><p>\u201cHow did he know to use me?\u201d He stopped at her hospital door, keeping his voice low as he glanced at James once again.</p><p>Sax knew he had been careful, very careful over the past years, to heed Marey\u2019s wishes and stay away from her. He hadn\u2019t liked it. Hell, he hated it to his back teeth, but he had respected her wishes. So how had Vince known she would drop her guard for a secret assignation with him?</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d James shook his head, shoving his hands in his pants pockets and staring back at him somberly. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know, Sax. The police found a note, signed with your name, asking her to join you in that room. Her screams alerted a couple in the next room who called the cops. When they found her, she was unconscious. I think he meant to kill her.\u201d</p><p>And blame Sax for the crime. Son of a bitch. He ran his hand over his shaved head and breathed out roughly.</p><p>\u201cI have to make sure she\u2019s okay,\u201d he said roughly, his throat clogging with pain at the thought of what had been done to her. \u201cI have to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would.\u201d James nodded slowly. \u201cWhen she woke up, and Terrie explained what happened, she was horrified. She called the police herself. But she hasn\u2019t said much since. She knows you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>Sax nodded then reached for the doorknob. He turned it slowly, pushing the door open and stepped inside quietly.</p><p>Terrie, James\u2019 sister-in-law, came to her feet, her face still damp, her eyes red-rimmed as she stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d she whispered, glancing at the sheet-draped bed that Sax could only glimpse the bottom of. \u201cShe\u2019s resting. For now.\u201d</p><p>Sax entered the room, moving slowly as he passed the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be outside.\u201d She patted Sax on the arm gently as she passed him.</p><p>As the door closed, he turned, swallowing tightly before allowing himself to see the damage done.</p><p>God help the bastard, he thought when he saw her face, because he was going to kill him. Her face was horribly bruised, her eyes and lips swollen. Sax prayed that Vince Clayton wouldn\u2019t manage to get out of jail, because if he did, he was a dead man.</p><p>Her soft, pale blonde hair framed her face\u2014a face he knew was softly rounded, inquisitive, stubborn.</p><p>\u201cLooks bad, huh?\u201d Her voice was raspy, groggy as she opened her eyes, the soft gray barely visible through the swollen lids.</p><p>It was all he could do to restrain himself, to hold back. He wanted to pull her into his arms, hold her against his chest and swear he would never let it happen again. That he would protect her, keep her safe. But he was smart enough to know she would never accept it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him, Marey.\u201d He pushed his hands in his pockets, his fists clenching as rage ate through him. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll kill the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing hitched as she grimaced painfully.</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault.\u201d Tears clogged her voice then. \u201cI should have known better.\u201d A bitter laugh escaped her throat. \u201cIt was stupid of me not to check with you.\u201d</p><p>He moved to the side of the bed, his chest tightening with emotion. He couldn\u2019t believe this had happened, couldn\u2019t conceive that anyone would do this to her.</p><p>He sat down slowly in the chair beside her, shrugging off his suit jacket and flexing his shoulders as he sighed wearily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve considered it a time or two,\u201d he finally admitted with a grimace. \u201cActually, kidnapping you and tying you to my bed for a week was my favorite fantasy.\u201d</p><p>A short, groggy little laugh left her throat. \u201cTrojans and their whips and chains,\u201d she said with a little sigh.</p><p>He picked up her hand, noticing the flinch as he did so. It wasn\u2019t from pain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She pulled back from him, swallowing tightly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened. I\u2019m just sorry. But I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to that motel thinking I would be there,\u201d he said gently, staring down at the soft creamy flesh he gripped in his much darker hand. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected that, or I would have had you years ago. You can\u2019t back out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have.\u201d Despite the drugs and the pain, her voice was firm.</p><p>\u201cYou might think you have.\u201d He picked up her hand again, his fingers holding it in place as she stared at where they met. \u201cBut Marey, I can be relentless. I won\u2019t let you go now, not knowing this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Panic flared in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd he will never hurt you again.\u201d He leaned close, staring back at her intently, determination thundering through him. \u201cDo you hear me? The bastard will never touch you again, because to do so, he will have to go through me. You\u2019re mine, and when you get out of here, I intend to claim what belongs to me, Marey. Every sweet beautiful inch of you. Mine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>One Month Later</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Marey leaned against the doorframe, staring up at Sax as he stood on the stoop, looking too damned sexy, too tempting for so early in the morning. \u201cThis habit of yours is getting on my nerves, Sax. This is too early in the morning to be out of the bed.\u201d</p><p>In the past four weeks, if he had missed half a dozen mornings showing up for coffee and trying to wheedle breakfast out of her, then it would surprise her. And he was getting bolder. Touching her as she moved around the kitchen, stealing kisses when she couldn\u2019t avoid him, laughing at her irate expressions and teasing her when the morning grumpiness got the best of her.</p><p>\u201cYou should be used to it by now.\u201d His teeth flashed in a smile that made her pussy weep in loneliness as he stepped into the house, pulling the door from her grip and closing it softly.</p><p>He was going to drive her to an asylum before it was over with. The man was like an unstoppable force once he got something in his head, and since her attack, he had appointed himself her personal bodyguard whenever he deemed it necessary.</p><p>She sighed wearily. She was exhausted. Sleep was a thing of the past and paranoia whipped through the night like the rattle of ghostly chains.</p><p>\u201cVince call?\u201d he asked as he moved into the kitchen, heading straight for the automatic coffeepot. She had learned to time it for his visits.</p><p>She stood still as the question filtered through her morning grogginess, holding her still in shock.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know he was released?\u201d She frowned in irritation as she followed him. \u201cAnd since when did you decide to just make yourself at home here?\u201d</p><p>He pulled one of the mugs from a hook under the cabinet and poured the coffee with the ease of a man comfortable in his surroundings.</p><p>\u201cStop trying to sidetrack the conversation,\u201d he retorted calmly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me when you found out he was released? It\u2019s been a week.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her hands deep into the pockets of her baggy flannel pajama bottoms and hunched her shoulders defensively.</p><p>\u201cBecause it was none of your business?\u201d she suggested mockingly. \u201cI didn\u2019t make his bail for him and I\u2019m not taking his calls. There\u2019s nothing else I can do until the court date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been calling?\u201d The cup lowered back to the counter as his voice lowered dangerously.</p><p>Hell. It was too damned early to deal with this crap.</p><p>\u201cA few times,\u201d she answered waspishly. \u201cLet it go, Sax. You\u2019re not my father or my husband.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. The deep chocolate depths of his gaze sent a shiver of sensation through her. So far, he had been gentleness itself as she healed from Vince\u2019s attack. He hadn\u2019t really pushed her for anything other than breakfast, and though his sexuality was always present, he kept it reined in for the most part. She had a feeling, based on that look, it wouldn\u2019t last for long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit idly by while he beats the hell out of you again, either,\u201d he informed her, his voice cold, his expression shuttered as he watched her. \u201cAnd look at you, you aren\u2019t even sleeping anymore. Do you think I don\u2019t know what those shadows under your eyes mean, Marey? Why are you being so stubborn?\u201d</p><p>She breathed out roughly as she stalked to the coffeepot herself. No one should have to deal with this without that first cup of coffee.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t start again, Sax,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019m not moving in with you. It\u2019s not happening, noway, nohow.\u201d</p><p>Especially not now. She poured her coffee, reining in her own fury at the circumstances. To be honest, she had been giving in, considering the offer he had made after she came out of the hospital, tempted by the hot looks, the promise of passion and heat in his eyes. Vince\u2019s release from jail had canceled even the consideration of such a move. There was no way she would dare to push him that far now. The instability she only glimpsed during their marriage had become terrifying.</p><p>She poured the steaming liquid into her cup, ignoring him as he crossed his arms over his chest, straining the white silk shirt he wore and making him look impossibly strong. It was obvious he hadn\u2019t grown lax in the four years since he had left the Army and joined Delacourte. His body looked just as tight and hard as it had when he came home.</p><p>A woman really, really shouldn\u2019t have to face this so early in the morning. This amount of sex appeal, dominance, and pure male presence should be reserved for fantasies alone.</p><p>As she turned away, she stiffened as she felt the whisper of a touch over the curve of her rear. Balancing the hot coffee, she shot him an irritated glare.</p><p>\u201cThat was dirty and low,\u201d she snarled as he grinned back at her unrepentantly. \u201cKeep your hands to yourself.\u201d</p><p>He snorted at that, a male sound of disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, Marey. And we\u2019re not finished discussing this Vince thing, either. If you won\u2019t move in with me, then I\u2019ll park on your doorstep instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll have the sheriff drag you off.\u201d She sat down at the small breakfast table, her cup thunking on the glass top as she flicked him another irate look. \u201cSit down and drink your coffee, Sax. It\u2019s too early in the morning to argue with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdd that to the fact that you haven\u2019t slept in weeks.\u201d He frowned back at her. \u201cYes, I can see where your patience would be wearing thin. Aren\u2019t you sick of it yet? Being too damned scared to reach out for what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou being what I want, of course,\u201d she suggested sarcastically. \u201cDon\u2019t you get tired of running after women who don\u2019t want you?\u201d Lord forgive her for that lie. It was a whopper.</p><p>He laughed at her then. A low, deep chuckle that stroked over her senses and had her clit reminding her voraciously just how much it longed for his touch. It was swollen, sensitive, just as her nipples were, her breasts\u2014hell, every cell in her body was aching for him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re almost awake enough this morning to pull that lie off.\u201d If his frown was anything to go by, he was less than pleased. \u201cTry getting some sleep tonight and maybe I\u2019ll pay attention tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Maybe pushing Sax at seven-thirty in the morning wasn\u2019t a good idea, she thought a second later as he pulled her from the chair, one powerful arm hooking around her waist as he brought her flush with his very hard, very aroused body.</p><p>\u201cSax...\u201d She meant to protest. Really, she assured herself. She was outraged that he would be so dominant, so sexually determined at the drop of a hat.</p><p>Of course she was, her conscience mocked her as her lips opened beneath his, a moan shuddering from her chest as his tongue licked at her lips, possessive and intent on claiming the territory beyond.</p><p>She was going to protest this. She was going to tell him just how arrogant and completely, impossibly unfair he was being and all the reasons why this was a really bad idea.</p><p>Sure she was, she mocked herself as her hands gripped his shoulders, her lips opening beneath his as she felt his hands moving slowly beneath the loose material of her nightshirt, pressing against her stomach as he played with the strings that tightened the waistband of her pajamas.</p><p>He felt so good. So good and warm, and strong. All she wanted to do was immerse herself in it, let the sensations whipping through her body carry her wherever he wanted her to go. Just this, just for a brief time. Then she would make him stop. She would be strong again and she would reset the boundaries she knew she had to have between her desire and what she knew would protect them both.</p><p>For now, she was lost and she damned well knew it. This was why she kept as far away from him as possible. This was the reason she had fought the desire between them. Because of this, the pleasure, the incredible fiery sensations that traveled not just through her body, but through her soul as he lifted her closer, grinding her against him, the hard wedge of his erection pressing firmly into the engorged nubbin of her clit.</p><p>\u201cSo sweet,\u201d he whispered as his lips nipped at hers then, his teeth tugging at the bottom curve, his tongue licking over it as she fought for his kiss again. She didn\u2019t want to think, didn\u2019t want to let go of the incredible pleasure consuming her.</p><p>It was happening too fast, a part of her screamed. If she didn\u2019t stop now, she wouldn\u2019t be able to later.</p><p>Shut up! The aching core of her pussy wasn\u2019t having it. It flared with renewed demand, weeping its thick juices as he lifted her closer.</p><p>She sought his kiss again, her head tilting, her tongue licking at his lips, a moan shuddering from her chest as he gave her what she sought. Hot, moist, his tongue ravaging, his hands possessive as he lifted her, settling her against the table as he pressed between her thighs. Her bare thighs...</p><p>Oh God, she was so lost. How had he removed the pajama bottoms without her even noticing?</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby.\u201d He moved back despite her protest, his hands lifting the shirt, pulling it over her head before she could form a protest.</p><p>\u201cSax... Not fair...\u201d she cried out as he bent her backwards, his lips covering the hard tip of her breast as the words echoed around them.</p><p>She was going up in flames. She couldn\u2019t survive pleasure like this. It was too much. Too intense.</p><p>Her hands gripped his head, feeling the slick, shaved contours beneath her fingertips as she held him to her, gasping, crying out, fighting for breath as the intensity of his touch swirled through her.</p><p>This was what she had gone to that damned motel for. Because she couldn\u2019t resist the allure, the fire, the cascade of pleasure that infused every particle of her being.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not fair,\u201d he growled, his lips raking over the incredibly sensitive tip of her breast. \u201cI\u2019m at your breasts when I\u2019m dying to eat your pussy.\u201d</p><p>Shock held her motionless as he jerked a chair from under that table and pulled it to him. Sitting down, he spread her thighs, his eyes on hers as his head lowered.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI always did prefer sweets first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>His tongue swiped through the ultra-sensitive slit of her pussy. When his tongue reached her clit, he circled with a hum of approval, licking around it, causing her to arch closer, a strangled scream of pleasure tearing from her throat.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t allowing this, she assured herself. She wouldn\u2019t allow it. It was dangerous. Not just for her peace of mind and her own heart, but for him as well.</p><p>But she was, and she was glorying in it, she realized distantly. Her thighs were spread for him, her hands gripping his head, holding him to her as he devoured her with lustful greed.</p><p>His hands were just as busy as his lips, and he was proving the rumor that he was definitely an ass man where a woman was concerned. His fingers were caressing from her pussy to the small entrance of her anus. And though Marey had been certain that particular fetish wouldn\u2019t infect her as it had her friends, as his fingers massaged, caressed, pressed, she found her curiosity and arousal heightening.</p><p>His mouth kept her pussy from missing the touch of his fingers, allowing his fingers to spread the slick cream that wept from her vagina back to the small entrance to lubricate and prepare it for the gentle impalement of his finger.</p><p>\u201cSax...\u201d She was panting with the pleasure, unable to focus, no longer able to think. She could only cry out his name, lifting for him, poised on an edge of sensation she was certain would destroy her.</p><p>\u201cThere, baby,\u201d he crooned against her pussy, his voice vibrating against her clit. \u201cJust enjoy. Let me show you good it can feel.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another finger joined the first. She wasn\u2019t certain if her strangled cry was one of protest or encouragement, but she knew the slow, even thrusts of his fingers inside her\u2014first one, then two\u2014were pushing her past any boundaries she could have conceived.</p><p>He moved, shifted as his tongue dipped into the opening of her vagina, tracing the entrance, flickering over the sensitive tissue as he licked at the juices easing past it. She was so wet, so hot, it should have been humiliating.</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock as she felt his finger move back, felt the tip of another joining it. Cool, slick gel eased his fingers inside her, assuring her he was more than prepared for whatever his desires were that morning. Desires that were quickly becoming her own.</p><p>He prepared her slowly, easily, keeping her poised on pleasure so intense she was certain flames were going to begin rolling over her. Perspiration dampened her skin, fingers of heat ran over her repeatedly as the band of intensity tightened in her womb and the stretching fire increased in her rear. Fire that burned with a pleasure so mind-consuming there wasn\u2019t a chance of denying it. So soul-destroying that when he rose to his feet, releasing the straining length of his cock and pushing the waistband of his slacks around his thighs, she never thought to protest, never thought to consider that she was crossing a line she might never be able to return from.</p> <p>\u201cThis is what you\u2019re denying yourself, Marey. Only a part of what you\u2019re denying us both.\u201d</p><p>He pressed the head of his cock against the stretched opening of her anus, lifting her to him, his hands spreading the cheeks of her buttocks apart as she felt the thick crest begin to penetrate the little opening.</p><p>Pleasure and pain collided as his gaze caught and held hers. She felt him enter her slowly, unbearably slowly, stretching her impossibly, sending her senses screaming with the conflicting sensations.</p><p>She had never believed that line between pleasure and pain would tempt her, would draw her to the extent that nothing mattered except pushing that boundary further.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, baby,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDeep breaths. Close your eyes and press out for me. Let your body milk me in, don\u2019t force it.\u201d</p> <p>Her head thrashed on the table.</p><p>It was decadent. Splayed out on her breakfast table, Sax\u2019s cock slowly filling her ass as she stared back at him beseechingly. Her most perverted, most depraved fantasies were being played out, stripping her of control, leaving her pliable, willing, eagerly embracing the broad erection impaling her.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he crooned, his face twisted into a mask of pleasure. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight, Marey. It\u2019s like being consumed by flames.\u201d</p><p>She was the one being consumed. Inch by inch as he worked his cock inside her, filling her, stretching her until he sank in to the hilt.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe. She could feel the muscles of her anus convulsing, flexing and rippling around the length of flesh filling her. It was more pleasure than she could have envisioned. Deeper, more intense than the vibrators or plugs she had used there.</p><p>\u201cThink of this, Marey,\u201d he growled as he began to move, holding her to him, sending her senses careening as he began to fuck her slow and deep. \u201cThink of this, baby, the next time you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m chasing a woman who doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p> <p>She screamed as his movements began to quicken, one hand moving from her buttocks, his fingers going to her aching, empty pussy. Two fingers pressed inside, moving in tandem to his thrusts up her ass as reality began dissolve. The world centered on the dual penetration. His fingers moving inside the ultra-tight depths of her pussy, his cock fucking her ass with long, smooth strokes that steadily quickened, grew harder, more intense.</p><p>She writhed beneath him, straining toward release, begging for it, pleading as her body tightened to what she was certain was a breaking point.</p><p>\u201cNow, Marey.\u201d His voice was strained, rough as she felt his cock flex and throb inside the sensitive channel.</p><p>His fingers moved faster inside her pussy, his thumb moving to her clit, stroking it, pushing her higher, higher...</p><p>She screamed as she fell over the edge of oblivion. Ecstasy washed through her body, burned along her nerve endings, sending her flying into rapture as she felt him explode, the heat of his semen filling her as he thrust in hard and deep one last time, groaning fiercely as he came inside the hot depths of her ass.</p><p>She settled down to earth long moments later, her eyes opening as he slowly withdrew from her. She watched as he fixed his slacks then reached to the counter to tear a handful of soft paper towels from their holder.</p><p>He cleaned her gently, watching her with those chocolate eyes that seemed to see clear to her soul.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t turn back,\u201d he told her as he eased her up, holding her steady as she stood naked before him, fighting to find reality once again. \u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo matter how much it hurts me?\u201d she asked him then, her voice hoarse, filling with tears as realization began to wash over her. \u201cDoes that matter, Sax? Does it matter at all how much it\u2019s going to hurt me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cShe has to be the most stubborn, independent, irrational woman I\u2019ve had the misfortune to meet.\u201d</p><p>Sax slammed the file drawer in place, ignoring James\u2019 mocking snort behind him as he slapped the file he had pulled out on the desk between them.</p><p>He was irritated, horny as hell, and damn if he wasn\u2019t suffering from a guilt trip of major proportions.</p><p>No matter how much it hurts me? The words wouldn\u2019t leave his mind, ricocheting in his head as he fought against the pain he had glimpsed in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou act like you\u2019re surprised, buddy,\u201d James laughed as he leaned back in the chair in front of Sax\u2019s desk and watched him with amusement. \u201cYou\u2019ve been chasing her for three years and just figured that one out?\u201d</p><p>Sax sat down heavily in his own chair and regarded the other man with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate the amusement you\u2019re finding at my expense, James,\u201d he snarled back. \u201cDammit to hell, she enjoyed every minute of it. Drenched my fingers when she came and still had the nerve to try to guilt me out of her life. I should tie her to the damned bed for a week and fuck her until she\u2019s too tired to guilt or deny me.\u201d</p><p>James chuckled at that one, not that Sax could blame him. Sax had been making that same threat for three years now.</p><p>\u201cVince is out on bail,\u201d Sax sighed then, worry and fury clashing at the thought of all the ways he could hurt Marey. \u201cHe disappeared within hours. If she doesn\u2019t ease up on the stubbornness, he\u2019s going to kill her.\u201d</p><p>It was his worst nightmare, that Vince would attack her again, taking her from him forever. It was hard enough waiting on the sidelines all these years, certain she would give in eventually. But now...Sax knew the waiting was over. The question was would the fragile bonds of emotion between them survive the dominance rising inside him? He was sick of waiting. And he was sure as hell sick of her denying the very thing he knew both of them craved.</p><p>\u201cVince will self-destruct eventually,\u201d James agreed. \u201cAll we can do is watch her, Sax. Daniel will look for him, Drew Stanton owns the security agency she\u2019s using\u2014he has priority watch on her. The sheriff will keep a closer eye on the house during his patrols, and when he comes up for trial, Caleb will make certain he spends plenty of time behind bars. The members of The Club won\u2019t desert her. We watch out for our own, you know that.\u201d</p><p>Caleb Embers was the prosecuting attorney assigned to the case, and a member of The Club. Sax was well aware of the fact that if Vince made it as far as trial, then Caleb would fry his ass.</p><p>\u201cKeeping him the hell away from her until he gets to trial is what worries me,\u201d Sax bit out. \u201cShe\u2019s so determined to deny us both that she could end up giving him the opening he needs. I swear to God, James, I can\u2019t understand her. It\u2019s as though she thinks she has to deny herself. As though she\u2019s paying penance for something that only she\u2019s aware of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr terrified of a pattern repeating itself,\u201d James suggested then. \u201cShe put her life on hold for her parents. When they died, she wasn\u2019t a teenager any longer. Loneliness can do strange things to a woman, Sax. She married the first man who offered and learned within weeks the mistake she made. I have a feeling you\u2019re something Marey couldn\u2019t bear losing. So she\u2019s going to fight you harder.\u201d</p><p>Which was no more than he expected. But damn if it wasn\u2019t grating on his nerves.</p><p>\u201cTell you what.\u201d James leaned forward in his chair, watching Sax with a knowing glint in his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s head to the house for dinner. We\u2019ll have a drink and see if Ella has any ideas how to break her friend\u2019s control. She knows Marey better than anyone. If anyone knows how to find her weakness, it\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p><p>Sax tapped his fingers against the leather arm of his chair. He was right. And Ella would help too. She was worried as hell over Marey. She would make a great conspirator.</p><p>He moved quickly to his feet, ignoring James\u2019 amused laughter as they pulled on their suit jackets and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cSo, who\u2019s your third lately?\u201d Sax finally thought to ask his friend as they neared the door.</p><p>James snorted. \u201cIan came out of hiding. I think he\u2019s running though. Damn if he\u2019s not desperate to get as far away from his own house as possible since Dane\u2019s daughter moved in with him. Have you seen her?\u201d</p><p>Dane Mattlaw had been Ian\u2019s best friend while he lived abroad in his younger days. The older man had been a steadying influence, while also helping to develop some of Ian\u2019s sexual tastes in the high-class brothels they frequented before Dane\u2019s marriage.</p><p>The daughter was a vixen. Not that Ian had introduced any of The Club\u2019s members to her.</p><p>\u201cMattlaw will kill him.\u201d Sax grinned when James\u2019 comment finally registered. \u201cIf he\u2019s running from her, then he\u2019s a little too interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo interested and denying it too hard,\u201d James laughed as they left the office. \u201cWatching him fall is going to be fun, Sax. He\u2019s a little too superior in his attitude toward the rest of us after our marriages. We\u2019re all cheering for her. She\u2019s going to put a hurting on that boy that will bring him to his knees and make him cry for mercy.\u201d</p><p>That reminded Sax much too much of what Marey was doing to him. Damned woman.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d Marey stomped into Ella\u2019s house hours after the kitchen interlude, ignoring her grinning friend as she made her way to the kitchen and the wine Ella kept in steady supply.</p><p>Hell, she was married to a Trojan, a dominant, woman-sharing, sex-perverted male that likely made Ella as insane as Sax was making her at the moment.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sweetheart, Marey,\u201d she laughed as she came behind her, moving to slide two wineglasses from their position under the cabinet and set them on the work island.</p><p>A sweetheart. Yeah, he was a sweetheart all right, and he was making her fucking crazy proving it. Keeping an eye on her, checking the house all the time, calling to make certain she was okay. The sound of his voice, that deep baritone, rasping over her senses, had nearly been her undoing several nights in a row.</p><p>\u201cYou should know,\u201d Marey finally snorted mockingly. \u201cWasn\u2019t he James\u2019 little buddy that first time?\u201d</p><p>Ella cleared her throat, a light flush working over her cheeks at Marey\u2019s reply.</p><p>\u201cIf I had known you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d Marey waved the small guilt-ridden sentence away. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with it. I just need solutions here. How do I get rid of him?\u201d</p><p>She poured a half glass of wine, considered the amount then filled the glass. She needed definite liquid courage here. She smacked the bottle to the counter, lifted the glass and took a healthy swallow. She needed the strength right now, not to mention the balm to her nerves. The balm to her nerves was a definite must-have. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWine is for sipping, whisky is for swilling,\u201d Ella said mildly, watching her warily. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you care if I fucked Sax?\u201d</p><p>Marey was in the process of sitting her glass back down. She paused, glanced at her friend and lifted it for another healthy swallow. Ella\u2019s timing sucked.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let it happen again,\u201d she muttered as she refilled the glass moments later. \u201cI might not be so forgiving now.\u201d</p> <p>That was an understatement. She would be damned pissed, but she knew that Ella would never consider it after suspecting the feelings Marey had for him. Marey could confidently pat herself on the back that she had hidden her feelings for the man from even her closest friends. Ella had no idea until several weeks after she returned from her honeymoon. During one of Marey\u2019s late-night let\u2019s-consume-a-bottle-of-wine visits, Ella had revealed that Sax had been the third in the Trojan m\u00e9nage James had set up.</p><p>Marey flushed uncomfortably at the memory of what she said in reply.</p><p>Touch him again and I\u2019ll rip your tonsils out! she had informed her friend haughtily. James wouldn\u2019t find you near as attractive then.</p><p>She sighed wearily. She had fucked herself there. Ella had tried to throw her in Sax\u2019s company ever since.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t want him?\u201d Ella lifted a perfectly shaped brow with mocking inquiry.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t start lecturing me, Ella,\u201d she snapped, pushing her fingers restlessly through her hair and wishing she had taken the time to confine the long, blonde strands to a braid or something. Anything to keep it out of her face. It was aggravating her, and she didn\u2019t need the additional frustration.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s lecturing you?\u201d Ella shrugged as she poured a half glass of wine, refilled Marey\u2019s then picked up her glass and gestured to the living room. \u201cLet\u2019s at least argue in comfort. Why do you always have to come here looking for a fight? I have better things to do than fight with my friends.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Like fuck James Wyman with Saxon Brogan as a third in a m\u00e9nage that made Marey crazy to think about. Not that the past exploits bothered her. Ella was her friend\u2014more like a sister\u2014and really, if she had to share a man in such a situation, then it would be Ella she would choose, she thought whimsically.</p><p>Damn, that wine must strong.</p><p>Sighing, she plopped down in her favorite leather chair, wiggled a bit and then cast Ella an accusing stare.</p><p>\u201cJames has been sitting in my chair,\u201d she sniped. \u201cHe\u2019s messing it up.\u201d</p> <p>She watched Ella smother her chuckle. No one was taking her seriously anymore.</p><p>\u201cWell, sometimes, we share it.\u201d Ella wiggled her eyebrows suggestively as Marey gaped back at her.</p><p>\u201cEww.\u201d She jumped from the chair. \u201cYou fucked in my chair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I cleaned it later.\u201d Ella was definitely laughing now. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no evidence left of the event.\u201d</p><p>Marey shuddered and moved to the less comfortable recliner. \u201cHave you fucked here too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, every square inch of this house has seen action this year.\u201d Ella leaned back in her chair, her eyes sparkling with laughter as Marey grimaced in distaste.</p><p>\u201cI guess even the floor is grotty,\u201d she sighed as she collapsed back in her favorite chair. Dammit, she didn\u2019t want to think about sex right now. Didn\u2019t want to hear about it or know about it.</p><p>\u201cYup, even the floor is grotty,\u201d Ella laughed at the description. \u201cNow tell me, why would it bother you if I fucked Sax now, if it didn\u2019t bother you before?\u201d</p> <p>Marey shot her an evil look. She deserved it. She was so damned confident and sexually wicked now that she should be burned at the stake.</p><p>\u201cWomen like you were stoned a hundred years ago, Ella,\u201d she reminded her with aloof distain.</p><p>\u201cThat was two hundred years ago, dear,\u201d Ella pointed out, toasting her with her glass. \u201cAren\u2019t you glad we were born during a much more sexually aware time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not want me to answer that right now,\u201d she sighed wearily, staring back at her friend with a mixture of irritation and fondness.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, Marey,\u201d Ella demanded softly. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you alone until you do.\u201d</p><p>Marey sighed in resignation. \u201cHell, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m just as perverted as the rest of you.\u201d Ella shot her a disapproving look. One Marey ignored, just as she always had.</p><p>What the hell was she supposed to say? That jealousy just didn\u2019t come into it? She was smarter than that. Friends lasted forever, men didn\u2019t. Besides, she knew that Ella would have never let Saxon touch her if she had known Marey was even the least bit interested in him. Being angry over it now was nothing short of ludicrous.</p><p>\u201cThen what is your problem?\u201d Ella lifted her glass, sipping at her wine as she watched her with those probing blue eyes of hers.</p><p>Ella had always seen too much. She had known when Vince was abusing her, when she had taken enough and was preparing to leave, when she began to fear for her safety because of his threats. They had known each other for years, their parents had been best friends, and despite their age difference, they had always been close. That bond of friendship had only strengthened as they became adults.</p><p>\u201cElla, you have to make James talk to him.\u201d Marey finished off her wine before leaning forward and extending the glass for Ella to refill. \u201cHe\u2019s making me insane. He calls. Checks the house every night. And this morning, he had the nerve to show up demanding breakfast. He\u2019s trying to take over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see...\u201d Ella nodded somberly. \u201cThis would be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d Marey snapped, furious at the gleam of laughter in Ella\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want him there. James is going to have to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVince made bail the other day, didn\u2019t he, Marey?\u201d Ella said then, her voice gentle, but knowing.</p><p>Marey leaned back in her chair, lowering her head to stare into the pale liquid that filled her glass.</p><p>Yes, Vince had made bail.</p><p>\u201cThat has nothing to do with it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not a coward, Ella.\u201d</p><p>But she was. She could feel that knowledge crawling through her mind, mocking her with the sterile, lonely life she led.</p><p>\u201cI never thought you were a coward, honey,\u201d Ella sighed. \u201cJust frightened. And I never blamed you for that. But you have to fight back sometime.\u201d</p><p>Marey avoided her gaze, shaking her head as she swallowed past the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cHe would go after Sax,\u201d she finally whispered. \u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of that.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sax is man enough to rip his face off,\u201d Ella snorted. \u201cCome on, Marey. Vince only whips on people who are smaller than he is and you know it. Sax would grind that little bastard into dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Vince would hurt someone else, and frame him again,\u201d Marey snapped. \u201cOr do something to cause his brakes to fail, or any number of things that could end up destroying him. Dammit, Ella.\u201d She stared back at her miserably. \u201cI can\u2019t let that happen. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVince is out on bail. Once he goes to trial, he\u2019ll go to jail,\u201d Ella pointed out.</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d Marey sneered then. \u201cA year? Two?\u201d</p><p>She sat the glass of wine on the table that separated their chairs as she rose to her feet. Crossing her arms over her chest she paced to one of the wide windows on the other side of the room before turning back to face her friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve grown used to being alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of shit,\u201d Ella snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown used to hiding, Marey. Risking nothing and having nothing, and letting Vince terrify you. I won\u2019t have James talk to Sax.\u201d She lifted her chin stubbornly. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing the right thing, and I think he\u2019s the right man for you. So forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a bitch!\u201d Marey snarled.</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one,\u201d Ella snapped back childishly, frowning back at her mulishly. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky and Sax will spank it out of you. Oh, but you might enjoy that. I\u2019ll tell him to hold off on it for a while.\u201d</p><p>Marey narrowed her eyes warningly. Ella\u2019s response was a cool little smile as she moved to her feet, facing her defiantly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s low,\u201d Marey growled furiously.</p><p>\u201cNo, dear, low is telling you what a magical tongue he has,\u201d she sighed mockingly. \u201cAnd how much he fairly loves to eat pussy. The man is a connoisseur. He can go at it for hours, and leave you screaming for more.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she didn\u2019t need to hear that. Her pussy flooded, her juices easing from her vagina to coat the bare, waxed folds beyond as she remembered just how good his tongue was.</p><p>Ella\u2019s expression was mockingly ecstatic, her eyes gleaming in confrontation, her lips curved into a satisfied little smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd he has stamina...\u201d She drew the word out pleasurably as Marey breathed in slowly, reining in her response. \u201cHis cock stretches you, makes you burn, makes you beg...\u201d She closed her eyes dreamily. \u201cHe\u2019s almost as good as James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to know I rate in there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>The sound of James\u2019 amused, deep voice had both of them jumping in startled awareness as they turned to stare at the door.</p><p>He lounged against the doorframe, incredibly handsome, sinfully sexy. Marey well understood why her friend had been so besotted with him for so many years.</p><p>\u201cThis is a private conversation.\u201d Despite her furious blushes, Ella drew herself up haughtily and faced her husband. Though Marey had no problem seeing the arousal that flared in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo I heard.\u201d His lips curved in a smile, his eyes gleaming with laughter. \u201cVery interesting one as well,\u201d he mused as he crossed his arms over his broad chest. \u201cShould I let Sax know you\u2019re up for a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Marey\u2019s furious exclamation joined Ella\u2019s as they both faced him now.</p><p>He chuckled in response.</p><p>\u201cGo play or something, James.\u201d Ella waved her hand at him dismissively. \u201cThis is girl talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard,\u201d he drawled. \u201cBut maybe you would both like to know that Sax is due here in about ten minutes to go over a new product that\u2019s in design at the moment and to share a beer while he bemoans a certain woman\u2019s stubbornness. Marey might want to run while she has the chance. He\u2019s just waiting to catch her out of that fortress she owns, and she looks pretty primed right now.\u201d</p><p>He glanced to her breasts and Marey\u2019s gaze dropped to the royal blue silk covering the full mounds. Her nipples were poking against it like a four alarm signal for an all-night fuck.</p><p>Her gaze flew to Ella\u2019s in horror.</p><p>\u201cThis is your fault,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to hear any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still love me.\u201d Ella grinned.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Marey snarled again. \u201cAnd yes, I still love you. But I am gone like the wind.\u201d</p><p>And she wasted no time in running. Sax was on a very, very short leash right now, and she knew it. As much as she loved Ella, there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell she was sticking around to see him. Because her own desires were on an even shorter leash, and growing fiercer by the day.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>She locked her doors when she got home. Ignored the doorbell, thanking God that Ella hadn\u2019t given Sax the code into the house as she had the gates. The next morning, she did likewise. Cowardice? Hell yes, she told herself fiercely. Sax terrified her where her weakness to him was concerned.</p><p>She finally slipped out around noon, unable to cancel her meeting with Ella at Delacourte to complete the planning for the annual Christmas party. She slipped in without incident. Getting out wasn\u2019t as easy.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to stop running from me, Marey?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn.</p><p>Caught in the empty outer office where James\u2019 secretary should have been standing guard, but was absent instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running from you,\u201d she denied the charge calmly, despite the fact that she knew she was running. Every chance she could get for now on. \u201cI was heading home. I\u2019m finished for the day, Sax.\u201d</p> <p>He stood in front of her, too close, but she refused to retreat. She had run from her ex-husband for years\u2014that was humiliating enough. She wasn\u2019t going to back down from another man. Especially one she knew as well as she knew Sax. One that could make her senses sing with pleasure. Her body rock in orgasm. Her mind dissolve with no more than a touch. God, she was hopeless.</p><p>He towered over her, tall and broad, his shaved head gleaming in the light above them. Teak dark flesh was emphasized by the charcoal gray of his suit and his dark, chocolate eyes. Eyes that warmed as he watched her, just as his smile did.</p><p>How was she supposed to fight him and herself?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of waiting on you, Marey.\u201d Sax didn\u2019t beat around the bush. \u201cYou\u2019re tempting me into that little kidnap fantasy we discussed before. You might think hiding from me is achieving whatever objective you\u2019ve set, but I can assure you, baby, the day is going to come that I\u2019m not going to let you run any longer after yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She felt the flush that suddenly washed over her face.</p> <p>\u201cYou really need to forget about that,\u201d she muttered, crossing her arms over her breasts as he braced his arm against the doorway, leaning against it casually.</p><p>He was about as completely yummy as a man could get. Yummy enough that her mouth watered with the thought of tasting him, her hands itched to touch him. And she knew every muscle under that skillfully tailored jacket was as hard and tight as that bulge behind the zipper of his slacks. A bulge well capable of satisfying a woman in any and every way.</p><p>She risked a quick glance down. Oh, hell yes, definitely yummy.</p><p>\u201cYou can touch if you want.\u201d He was openly laughing at her as her gaze flew back to his. \u201cAfter yesterday, there\u2019s really no sense in being shy, honey.\u201d</p><p>Marey cleared her throat, not so much embarrassed and never shy, as she was aware of the tightrope she was walking. Fighting herself was hard enough. She didn\u2019t know if she could fight him as well.</p><p>Not considering the years of dreams and the silly emotional attachment she had developed to him after her divorce. Why she was running now made no sense to her, and she doubted it would make any sense to anyone else.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d she finally replied calmly, refusing the invitation to touch him. \u201cI do need to leave though, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave with me.\u201d</p><p>The offer left her stunned. Her eyes widened, her breath stuttering in her chest as he stared back at her somberly, intently. It was tempting. So very, very tempting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea, Sax,\u201d she finally whispered. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep running,\u201d he finally sighed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to keep chasing after you. How long are you going to let Vince run your life like this?\u201d</p><p>She glanced away from him, turning back as he straightened from the doorway and came closer. She stepped back, then stopped. She wasn\u2019t going to run from him. But God, how could she handle...</p><p>Her swift indrawn breath was fully audible as his hand lifted, smoothing down the silk covering her arm. The caress had her nerves tingling, but when his hand gripped hers where it rested on her other arm, she shuddered in response. The back of his hand brushed her hard nipple, sending shards of awareness whipping through her.</p><p>Her clit caught fire, swelling, burning out of control from no more contact than the back of his hand brushing the hard point. Her pussy clenched in empty hunger, reminding her that even her vibrators suddenly lacked the satisfaction she had once found with them.</p> <p>\u201cSax, this isn\u2019t smart,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>His head lowered, his lips smoothing over her forehead as she stared up at him. The warmth, the velvet roughness of the kiss had her eyes closing and weakness sweeping over her.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Marey,\u201d he whispered as his lips moved along the side of her face to her ear. There, his teeth caught the sensitive lobe, tugging at it erotically as she shivered, her arms unfolding, pressing against his hard chest, her fingers curling in the silk of his shirt. \u201cYesterday was just a small treat. I want all of you. Hot and wet, moaning beneath me as I show you just how good we can be together. Wouldn\u2019t you like that, baby?\u201d</p><p>She stood, dazed, pleasure sweeping over her as he lowered one hand to the curve of her buttock, his fingers shaping the flesh as his teeth raked her neck.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember how good it was? I do. Buried snug and deep up that sweet ass. I want to bury in your hot little pussy next. Deep and tight while I feel you milking me, hear your wild little moans in my ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not playing fair,\u201d she whispered, feeling the pleasure streaking through her womb, striking between her thighs and making her clit swell and throb with arousal.</p><p>She was so weak. Too weak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing,\u201d he whispered a second before his teeth raked her neck again and his hand clenched the flesh of her rear. \u201cNot in the least. Remember that, Marey. This isn\u2019t a game, and the next damned time you refuse to open that door to me, it\u2019s coming down. You can say no if you don\u2019t want to be touched, but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll worry if you\u2019re lying in that house bleeding to death or already dead. Don\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d</p><p>His voice had her shivering in trepidation. He was serious. Too serious, and she knew it.</p><p>He straightened then, staring down at her broodingly, his eyes glittering with a sensual hunger and an emotional intensity that shook her to the tips of her toes.</p><p>\u201cHurry and run,\u201d he said mockingly. \u201cOr you might not have the chance to get away again. The next time I have you cornered, I\u2019m going to fuck you until you never dare to run from me again. You won\u2019t be able to breathe, let alone deny what we both want.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in shock. Run.</p><p>She moved quickly around him and did just that. Reluctantly. Straight home, to her room, to her bed, eyes closed and vibrator running as she fought to ease the craving for Sax\u2019s touch.</p><p>Sax breathed out roughly, as she did just as he suggested\u2014she ran. He was growing tired of this. She was more skittish now than she had ever been before. And it broke his heart. He could see the yearning, the pain in her eyes, and wanted nothing more than to ease it. To love her until the pain vanished and the happiness shone through, as it did with Ella.</p><p>Dammit, he wanted her to choose, and there lay the bitter truth. He didn\u2019t want to force her to accept him, he didn\u2019t want to overcome her objections or override her shyness and fears. He wanted her to come to him. Arrogance? He snorted at that thought. Probably. But she had been running for so damned long that it was starting to grate on his ego.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll stop running, Sax.\u201d Ella stepped from the office she had been meeting Marey in, her voice concerned, compassionate. \u201cSometimes she gets stubborn and you just have to let her wear herself down.\u201d</p><p>A smile quirked his lips. Ella had been defending her friend for months now. That had begun about the same time James had informed him that Ella had refused to participate in another m\u00e9nage with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time, Ella,\u201d he breathed out wearily. \u201cI\u2019m going to get tired of waiting soon. When I do, she might have more to worry about than Vince. She\u2019s going to have to worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Ella ducked her head, though he caught the amused curve of her lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that perhaps you should consider,\u201d she finally said as she raised her head, her gaze direct then, somber. \u201cMarey doesn\u2019t always reach out for what she wants, Sax. She\u2019s too used to having it jerked away, just as she\u2019s within reach of it.\u201d</p><p>He wanted her to come to him. She had asked him, pleaded with him years before to leave her alone, to stop his campaign to seduce her, to hold her. He had promised himself then that when the time came, it would be Marey\u2019s decision. Perhaps that was where he had made his mistake. He hadn\u2019t known then the things he knew now. Her determination to hold herself aloof, to ensure she never lost anyone, nor was betrayed again.</p><p>He pushed his hand into the pocket of his slacks as he stared back at Ella, seeing the confident, sensual, loving woman she had become over the past year. She had run from James for nearly a decade, just as stubborn and determined as her friend was. She was happy now, glowing with it. Could he fill Marey\u2019s eyes with the same satisfaction, that glow of a woman confident and well satisfied with what she found in her lover\u2019s arms?</p><p>He lowered his head, staring at the rose carpet of the outer office as he fought to restrain the impulses that had been rising inside him for weeks now. After Vince\u2019s attack on her, he hadn\u2019t wanted her to feel as though she was confronting another extreme situation, a man unable to let go.</p><p>Perhaps instead of giving her the space to find the answers, he was doing as Ella suggested instead. Giving her a chance to hide. Marey didn\u2019t need to hide anymore. She had been hiding for far too long.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Someone was in the house.</p><p>Marey jerked up in bed later that night, terrified as she heard the sound downstairs. What the hell was it? Why hadn\u2019t her alarm gone off?</p><p>There it was again. She blinked in the darkness. Was that a whistle? She stared into the dark bedroom, her heart racing, the sound echoing in her ears as she fought to wake up, to make sense of the sudden panic ripping through her again.</p><p>The new alarm system was supposed to be foolproof. Alerting the police and sounding a wail that would raise the dead if the house was breached. Evidently, it wasn\u2019t as secure as the salesman had promised her.</p><p>There it was again. It was a whistle. And she knew that sound. The grating little tune was one Vince was fond of. He would sound it for hours at a time, working himself into a rage as he did so. It always heralded another accusation, another rage, and in those final weeks of their marriage, another physical blow against her.</p><p>Shit. She jumped from the bed, jerking her robe on as she grabbed her cell phone from the bed and punched in the sheriff\u2019s number. This was insane. How the hell had he managed to get through the alarm and into the house? And why was he being so stupid?</p><p>\u201cSheriff\u2019s office.\u201d The dispatcher answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cJaney, it\u2019s Marey Dumont,\u201d she snapped, her voice low. \u201cVince has broken into the house.\u201d</p><p>She had gone to school with Janey, knew her husband and her kids. None of them liked Vince. Not that she could blame them.</p><p>\u201cStay with me, Marey, I\u2019ll get someone on the way out there.\u201d</p><p>Marey listened as Janey\u2019s voice became more distant, imperative, as she called in the report.</p><p>\u201cI have a car on the way, Marey,\u201d she came back, her voice calm, cool. \u201cI want you to stay on the phone with me, honey, till they get there. You say the alarm didn\u2019t go off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a peep,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just happened to wake up when he made a sound downstairs. I don\u2019t know how he got through.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t make sense. Vince wasn\u2019t the brightest light in the house, and electronically, his skills were nil. He would have needed the code to the gates as well as the door.</p><p>There was a crash downstairs.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking whore!\u201d Vince screamed from the bottom of the stairs then, as something else could be heard shattering against a wall. Dammit, he was breaking her vases, she thought miserably. She had paid a lot of money for those damned things. Her insurance company was going to scream.</p><p>\u201cShit. Janey, tell them to put some lead on the gas,\u201d she breathed out harshly. \u201cHe\u2019s drunk and he\u2019s pissed. How the hell did he get past my alarm?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She moved quickly to the bedroom door, locking it before pushing the large, wing-backed chair over to it, and tilting it until the back was forced beneath the brass knob. It was the only security she could think of. Tomorrow, she promised herself, she was buying a gun.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be there fast, Marey, just stay calm,\u201d Janey assured her quietly. \u201cI want you to stay back from the door. Hide in the bathroom and lock the door there. Get as far away from him as you can until help arrives.\u201d</p><p>She could hear her voice fade as Janey turned to the radio and called in to report to whoever was headed to the house.</p> <p>She stood indecisively in the middle of the bedroom, staring around it in regret. She couldn\u2019t stay here. Vince was evidently insane. First the attack at the motel and now this. She couldn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t live this way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you this time, you fucking bitch.\u201d He was at the door, his fists hammering on the door as Marey began to tremble nervously. \u201cWhat makes you think you can whore around on me? I\u2019ll kill you for even thinking of letting another man touch you. You fucking slut. You\u2019re a dead woman!\u201d</p><p>Enraged, almost incoherent, his curses slammed into her, making her stomach knot in fear as she bit her lip to hold back the cry of rage that built in her throat. They had been divorced for years, and she had been careful. Very careful to make certain he had no reason to torment her as he had that first year after their split.</p><p>His fists hammered into the door again, shaking the panel. He was a brute of a man. The door was heavy but she had no doubt he would get through it.</p><p>\u201cJaney, this is getting serious,\u201d she breathed out, her voice shaking as she moved to the bathroom and locked the door there as well. There were no chairs to place against the door, nothing to hold him back. \u201cThese doors won\u2019t keep him out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo minutes, Marey,\u201d Janey promised her calmly. \u201cYou can hold on two minutes. Get a can of hairspray, anything harsh. If he makes it past the doorway, spray his eyes full. Do whatever you have to. Sheriff Richards and Deputy Carlson are almost there. You\u2019ll hear the sirens soon and so will he. Maybe it will run him off.\u201d</p><p>She was right. Seconds later the sound of sirens wailing in the distance could be heard. Relief poured through her as tears filled her eyes. Her nerves clashed as she felt the jolt of Vince throwing himself against the door.</p><p>\u201cThe gates are locked,\u201d Marey told Janey, moving along the wall as she heard him crash into the door again. \u201cThe code is six, four, eight, three, two, nine. That\u2019s going to delay them.\u201d</p><p>Janey relayed the code to the sheriff before coming back.</p><p>\u201cYou hear them now?\u201d The sirens were growing louder.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking whore. You slut,\u201d Vince screamed then. \u201cI\u2019ll get you, bitch. When I do, I\u2019ll kill you. That damned sheriff won\u2019t save you every time.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of running feet down the stairs assured her he was leaving. Breathing a sigh of relief, she collapsed against the wall, a tired, nervous little laugh escaping her throat as tears tightened her chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d she whispered then. \u201cJaney, he\u2019s going to fucking kill me. What the hell am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>The house was a mess.</p><p>Evidently Vince had found quite a few ways to amuse himself before she woke up. Curses had been spelled out in lurid detail in black and red permanent marker across the walls. Her living room furniture was slashed, vases and heirloom glassware shattered. Some of the items Marey knew she would never be able to replace.</p><p>She stared around at the destruction, dressed in jeans and a sweater to ward off the chill that filled her body as the sheriff and his deputy filled out their reports and called the security company. Within hours, the house was filled with people, and all Marey could do was stand and stare around in confusion at the mess her ex-husband had made.</p><p>\u201cYou need to find a hotel, or stay with a friend for a few days, Marey.\u201d Sheriff Richards stepped around the mess in the entry hall as he moved from the living room. \u201cThe security system is intact, but he obviously has the codes. You\u2019re not safe here.\u201d</p><p>Duh. No shit.</p><p>Marey kept the sarcastic comment to herself as she stared back at the sheriff.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about him?\u201d she asked him carefully. \u201cThey let him out on bail. He could terrorize me further, Sheriff. Now what the hell are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>He sighed roughly, propped his hands on his hips and shook his head. As handsome as the man was, right now, she wanted to kick his teeth in. He was being of no help whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pick him up. He\u2019s violated the terms of his release, so the bail will be revoked. But until we catch him, you\u2019re not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be.\u201d</p><p>Marey froze at the dark, dangerous voice behind her. She turned slowly toward the open front door and stared back at Sax Brogan with a sense of fatal resignation.</p><p>Now, why hadn\u2019t she guessed he was going to show up?</p><p>A man shouldn\u2019t be so sinfully sexy, she thought. He shouldn\u2019t steal a woman\u2019s last breath with a frown, or make her knees weak from one of those hot little looks from dark, chocolate brown eyes. And he sure as hell shouldn\u2019t make her pussy burn in the middle of a situation that was precarious to say the least.</p><p>\u201cHello, Sax, it\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d Sheriff Richards nodded back at him as Sax stepped into the house. \u201cI hope you\u2019re going to convince her to get out of here until we pick up Vince. She\u2019s getting a bit testy on me.\u201d He cast her an amused look.</p><p>Marey frowned back at him.</p><p>\u201cI am neither testy, nor a child, Sheriff,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need a man to take care of me. I can make decisions fine on my own.\u201d</p><p>She hated it when men acted as though a woman was only safe if she had a man in front of her. In Sax\u2019s case, if things went the way he wanted, she would have one behind her as well.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d The sheriff nodded. \u201cWhich means you\u2019re going to take my advice and get the hell out of here until I let you know we\u2019ve caught Vince Clayton. Aren\u2019t you, Marey?\u201d</p><p>Why did men always think they were right and she was wrong?</p><p>\u201cPack some clothes, Marey,\u201d Sax said easily, though she read the tense readiness in his body. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to Terrie or Ella\u2019s, but you are getting out of here. If I have to carry you out.\u201d</p><p>His dark face was set in lines of determination and resolve. Marey glanced away, knowing that if she left with him, he wouldn\u2019t leave her anywhere else. She would be going to his house. His bed.</p><p>She glanced back at him knowing she was losing a battle she didn\u2019t really want to fight any longer. She had set this in motion when she made that trip to the motel, when she had let her desires and her needs overcome her common sense. She had no one else to blame but herself.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Marey,\u201d the sheriff urged her. \u201cWe have an APB out on Vince, we\u2019ll have him in custody soon. Until then, protect yourself. Get the hell away from the house.\u201d</p><p>Like she had a choice at this point? She was well aware of the fact that she couldn\u2019t stay at the house, and she wasn\u2019t endangering her friends either.</p><p>Gritting her teeth in fury, she slanted Sax a fulminating look as she turned and stalked to the curved staircase.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking me to a hotel,\u201d she snapped, though she was careful to keep her back to him. \u201cNo questions, no alternatives. A hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, Marey,\u201d he called back, his voice carefully neutral.</p><p>Pausing, she turned back to look at him.</p><p>His expression was pure sin, sex in its most undiluted form. His dark eyes gleamed with it, his expression was filled with it. She was so fucked. Unfortunately, she had a feeling she was going to enjoy it. Too much.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>She knew he wouldn\u2019t do as she asked. How had she known? She was psychic, she sneered to herself. She had known because she knew Sax Brogan. Three years before, he had claimed her with no more than a kiss. A dark, sultry earth-shattering kiss that had filled her senses with visions of hot, carnal delights and her mind with her own screams of lusty need.</p><p>She had held him off with a simple request. A plea. And for years he had abided by it. Until the day he was arrested because she was attacked during a meeting that she thought would involve him. She had known when she stepped into that motel room that she had made a grave, tactical error. Not only was she losing the battle with Vince, but she had known, if she survived, she would lose another, much more personal battle, with Sax.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word after loading her large suitcase into the back of his Lexus and helping her into the passenger side. He had loped around the car, got into the driver\u2019s seat, put the car in gear and driven away from her home. Straight to his. A beautiful two-story contemporary home on the outskirts of the city, surrounded by trees on two sides and the haunting melody of the ocean on the other. It was as rugged and strong as he was.</p><p>And she had kept her mouth shut. She hadn\u2019t demanded he drive to the hotel. She had sat in the car, silent, watching the night pass by as her pussy grew wetter by the second.</p><p>\u201cNice place.\u201d She finally found the courage to speak as he closed and locked the door behind them. The room they stepped into was huge. There was no entryway, just a large, open ceiling living room that was roomy and comfortable and at the same time as enduring as she had always thought Sax was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s home. The bedroom is up here.\u201d He led her to the double doorway, stepping into a short hall with a tall, oak staircase that led to the upper landing.</p><p>Like the living room, the hallway had an open ceiling allowing her to glimpse the railed hall above. She followed him up the stairs silently, her heart thundering in her chest, knowing she wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t fight him any longer.</p><p>The bedroom he led her into was obviously his. The stark masculine furniture, a huge king-sized bed, tall, wide dresser and a low, mirrored chest. One wall was open, with a sturdy railing and a view of the living room. Beside it was a computer desk, the computer sitting atop it was still running, the last instant message he had received still displayed.</p><p>From Wicked, Janey just called Tally. Vince hit the house. Get there now!</p><p>\u201cWell, so much for confidentiality,\u201d she remarked as she stared at the screen. \u201cI thought dispatchers were sworn to secrecy or something?\u201d</p><p>He moved to the computer and flipped off the screen with a snap before turning away from her and tossing her suitcase on the low chaise lounge that sat in front of the doors of the upper deck.</p><p>\u201cYou can put your stuff wherever you can find room,\u201d he told her dispassionately. \u201cWe\u2019ll go after the rest of your clothes tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we?\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou and whose army?\u201d</p><p>She faced him fully then, aware of the tension whipping between them.</p><p>He shrugged out of his jacket as he turned to her, tossing it over her suitcase. He stared back at her, his gaze vividly hot as his fingers went to the buttons of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need an army, Marey.\u201d His lips pulled back from his teeth in an elemental snarl. \u201cStop baiting me. You know you\u2019re going to be here, at least for a while. Why not stop fighting it, and me, and we\u2019ll see where the hell this thing is going.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a short, quick breath.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cVince is insane, Sax. Do you enjoy placing yourself in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most danger I intend to face is that hot little pussy creaming between your thighs,\u201d he snarled back, jerking the shirt from his broad shoulders as his words left her knees trembling.</p><p>If her pussy hadn\u2019t been creaming before, it was now. Thick and hot, the juices seared the sensitive folds as her clit began to throb in an erratic, erotic rhythm. Her breasts became swollen, her nipples poking against her sweater, and she was certain every inch of her body was flushed from the heat rising inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re as direct as always.\u201d She crossed her arms over her breasts, facing him with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned to be, with you.\u201d His hands went to the waistband of his slacks, his fingers loosening the clasp of his belt with a rough movement.</p><p>\u201cSax.\u201d She swallowed tightly as the belt opened and his hands worked at the fastening. \u201cSlow down.\u201d</p> <p>He paused, staring back at her with hungry demand.</p><p>\u201cI heeded that plea three years ago,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cI won\u2019t this time, Marey. The time for games is long past.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t remove his pants. He came toward her instead, towering over her, making her feel weak, helpless. But protected. For such a large man, Sax had a way of turning her inside out and making her feel more feminine than any other man ever had.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he sighed as he came abreast of her, staring down at her with sensual demand. \u201cSo small and perfect, your eyes darkening with arousal. Every time you look at me, I watch that, watch your eyes get dark and hungry for me. Do you know how hard that\u2019s been to resist? How much I\u2019ve wanted to throw you over my shoulder and take you away someplace where objections don\u2019t exist? Where the world disappears around us and there\u2019s nothing but me and you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, now that really wasn\u2019t fair. She felt the breath suspend in her lungs as her womb convulsed in longing. To hear that sexy, deep voice saying something so wickedly hot that it had her trembling in need.</p> <p>How long had it been since she had known a man\u2019s touch? Three years since Sax\u2019s kiss. Years before that. She had held herself aloof, no matter the loneliness or the sense of isolation. It had been easier to deal with the deprivation than the rages she knew Vince was capable of.</p><p>She stared up at him, helpless, weak with the needs thundering through her as he reached out, his hands gripping the hem of her sweater.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to taste every inch of your body,\u201d he whispered as he drew the material over her midriff. \u201cI\u2019m going to eat you like candy, Marey, and listen to you scream for more.\u201d</p><p>He was going to have her screaming for more before he even got her shirt off at this rate.</p><p>\u201cSax.\u201d Her hands fluttered helplessly as the sweater cleared her swollen, unbound breasts.</p><p>No bra. She hadn\u2019t had time for one.</p> <p>\u201cHell, I could come in my pants just looking at you, Marey,\u201d he sighed as his hand gripped first one wrist then the other, lifting her arms so he could pull the sweater over her head.</p><p>She was bare to him now, her breasts heaving, her nipples aching in response to the heated look in his eyes. His hands smoothed down her uplifted arms, drawing them down until her hands rested on his broad shoulders.</p><p>She trembled, shuddered in driving response as his hands lowered, cupping her full breasts, lifting them in his palms as his thumbs and forefingers tweaked the tender, responsive nipples.</p><p>She arched, gasping for breath as heat struck from the hard tips to the center of her womb. Her pussy rippled, the slick juices flowing in a rich stream to coat and prepare her for his penetration.</p><p>\u201cTake my shirt off,\u201d he whispered. \u201cCome on, baby. Show me you need this as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him nervously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...\u201d She licked her lips in hesitation. \u201cI\u2019m not good at this, Sax.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers flexed against his chest as she stared up at him, imploring. Vince hadn\u2019t been her first lover, but his abuse had all but destroyed her confidence. She was terrified of disappointing him.</p> <p>Shame coursed through her. She had known it would be like this. He would expect her to participate, to know what to do, to know how to love him in turn. Her throat thickened with rage and tears as she realized she didn\u2019t know, had no idea how to touch him, how to pleasure him.</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with how good you are at something, Marey.\u201d His voice was dark, deep, as he shrugged the shirt from his shoulders, her fingers touching impossibly warm teak flesh then.</p><p>She trembled at the feel of him. Strong and heated, the muscles of his chest bunching beneath her touch as her lips moved along his chest.</p><p>\u201cJust touch me,\u201d he crooned gently, weaving a spell of sensuality around her that was impossible to resist. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of it, your hands on my flesh, your lips, your tongue, touching and stroking me with your hunger. Show me how hungry you are for me.\u201d</p><p>Hungry? She was starved. She could feel her hand soaking in the feel of him, sending the sensation to parts of her body that shouldn\u2019t even be considered erogenous zones.</p><p>As she stared up him, she licked her lips, her gaze centering on his. Perfectly, sensually full, they looked warm, inviting. She needed his kiss. She whimpered with the need, suddenly overwhelmed with the thought of touching and being touched. God, she needed him to touch her. Just a kiss. One small, light touch of his lips...</p><p>His head lowered, but there was nothing light in the possession he took of her. He groaned, a rough, desperate sound as his lips covered hers, his tongue stroking against the seam until she parted for him, gave him permission to raid the warm depths of her mouth.</p><p>One arm went around her, clasping her to him as her hand roamed over his chest, his steel-hard abdomen. He might work at a desk, but his body was in perfect shape, muscular and hard. So hard.</p><p>She moved against him, feeling the wedge of his cock behind his slacks, against her lower stomach. She trembled, pressing closer, her head falling back in surrender, her body sliding against his as her tongue reached out timidly to his.</p><p>Racing, desperate, clawing lust bit into her with a demon\u2019s razor-sharp bite. She arched, sizzling heat blooming in her belly and streaking to her clit, her pussy, her engorged breasts. Out of control, her hands slid up his chest, his strong neck, gripping the back of his head as his hands arched her closer, lifting her until he could grind the thick erection against the pad of her cunt.</p><p>She cried out, shaking in the grip of an arousal she had never known before. Never, even in the darkest dark, when dreams so erotic, so sensual attacked her, had she known such a powerful, driving need as what she felt now.</p><p>\u201cEasy, sweetheart.\u201d His lips moved from hers, his hands holding her still when she would have followed, would have begged for more.</p><p>When he refused the caress, her lips moved to his chest. Sleek, tough skin over powerful muscles. Her tongue stroked over the dark flesh, her hands moving from his head to his abdomen. She wanted him naked, wanted him hot and blistering with desire as she was. It was killing her, the sudden, powerful sensations sweeping through her.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, baby.\u201d His deep, crooning voice urged her in her madness.</p><p>And it was madness. She was setting herself up for a fall, a small weak portion of her mind warned her. This was destruction. It was a fall from which there would be no recovering.</p><p>Her lips moved to his abdomen, close, so close to the opened waistband of his pants. And beyond. Beyond lay the object of her desperation.</p><p>She nipped at his tight flesh as his fingers threaded in her hair.</p><p>\u201cLoosen my pants, Marey. Release my cock, baby. I\u2019m dying to feel your hands on me. Soft, silken hands. Do you know how often I\u2019ve dreamed of watching your hands stroke me?\u201d</p><p>She could feel the pressure burning in her clit as he urged her on.</p><p>Her hands trembled, fumbled with the tab of his zipper, but finally managed to work it over the straining erection. She heard him moan as her fingers brushed the tightly stretched cotton of his boxer briefs as her eyes opened, widened as she glimpsed the impressive length of him beneath the material.</p><p>His fingers tightened in her hair.</p><p>\u201cDo it, baby,\u201d he growled, his voice resonating with the same painful hunger whipping through her body. \u201cRelease my cock. Touch me, before I go crazy here.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the elastic waistband down, pushing at it as it cleared his thighs, freeing the dark length of his erection to her touch. She touched him timidly, amazed at the feeling of satin warmth, and beneath it, iron-hard strength. Thick veins ridged the length of his cock as the pulse of blood pounded at the flesh.</p><p>The head was flared, a perfect mushroom shape designed for pleasure, damp with pre-come and throbbing imperatively. Closing her eyes, Marey allowed her tongue to peek out, to wash over the crest, tasting the salty male essence of him as he moaned roughly.</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d His breathing was rough, his voice deeper. \u201cLet me feel that soft little tongue. Do you know it feels like hot silk?\u201d</p><p>She licked over the head again, moaning herself at the taste of him. She wanted him, wanted more, she wanted to consume him.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Sax knew he was walking a thin, fragile line with Marey. Her sexual confidence, as Ella had warned him, was extremely low. Nearly untried, hesitant, frightened, but so naturally sensual she was blowing his mind as she licked and probed at the tight, desperate flesh of his cock.</p><p>He wanted to push inside her mouth, wanted to fuck her lips and feel her sucking at him hungrily. But not yet. He had to let her take him as she needed him, explore and make him insane with the hot bite of lust.</p><p>His fingers tightened in her hair as her lips finally began to join the play. She sipped at the head of his cock, caressing him with feather soft strokes he was certain were designed to strip him of control. She was killing him, lick by slow, luscious lick.</p><p>\u201cOh hell. Yes. God, yes.\u201d The words were torn from him as her lips finally, blessedly, wrapped around the straining head of his cock and sucked him in.</p><p>Heat lashed at him, whipping through his shaft, tightening his scrotum and sending electrical impulses of sheer sensual pleasure streaking up his spine. He held her head, keeping her in position, holding her that she could only suck him deeper, but never fully release him.</p><p>She was moaning around the flesh stuffing her mouth, her tongue lashing at it as she sucked at him.</p><p>\u201cDamn, your mouth is paradise,\u201d he growled. \u201cAll silky and wet and hot. Suck it, baby. Suck my dick, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop the words from pouring from his lips. Each phrase made her hotter, made her mouth tighten on him, her little tongue to go wild along the underside of the bulging head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl,\u201d he crooned to her, closing his eyes, his head falling back on his shoulders as she sucked him like a little sex goddess. \u201cDamn, Marey, that\u2019s so good. So damned good it\u2019s all I can do to hold back, baby.\u201d</p><p>He could feel the tightening in his balls, feel his release gathering, threatening to break the fragile control he was fighting so hard for. He wouldn\u2019t come in her mouth, not yet, not like this. When he filled her with his semen, it would be in a far more satisfying place than her sweet, hot little mouth. At least, he hoped it would.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d His voice was a rasping sound of desperation as his fingers pulled at her hair in warning, intending to draw her back.</p><p>A sharp moan echoed around the stiff flesh she suckled as he pulled the strands. Her fingers clenched tighter at his straining thighs as her back arched.</p><p>Sax grimaced tightly, tugging at her hair again.</p><p>She whimpered, the sound one of dazed, intense pleasure. So he pulled harder.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>Her mouth moved on him, shuttling up and down, sucking him voraciously as her little tongue stroked and probed and pushed him further over the line. Her hands wrapped around the base of his cock, holding it steady, stroking in time to her mouth above as he pulled her hair again.</p><p>Slick wet heat engulfed him nearly to her throat. She was taking more of him, ravenous now. \u201cMarey, baby. I\u2019ll come down your throat,\u201d he warned her desperately. \u201cLet up, sweetheart, or you\u2019re going to get every drop of it.\u201d</p><p>She stroked him more intently than ever, her mouth consuming him as he bucked against her, fucking past her lips as his hands pulled at her hair, relishing the unbidden, kittenish little mewls of pleasure that erupted from her throat.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to take her like this first, he thought despairingly as he felt his balls tighten further, the tingling at the base of his spine intensifying. But it was paradise. Paradise and torment at once, and he was helpless against her. For now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held her steady, his hands exerting pressure on her hair as he deepened his strokes, driving into her suckling lips, his body tightening, sensitizing...</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch. Suck it, baby. Suck my dick, Marey. Take it all.\u201d</p><p>He felt the first hard pulse of semen as it shot from the head of his cock, splattering against the back of her throat as she began to swallow, moaning and twisting against him as he buried in deeper and gave her all he had. Harsh, rapid jets of seed spewing into her mouth, only to be caught by her hungry little tongue and consumed until he had nothing left to give.</p><p>He pulled back from her then, ignoring the soft cry of regret as his cock pulled free of her lips with a hollow little \u201cpop\u201d.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He urged her to straighten as his hands went to the metal snap of her jeans. \u201cKick your shoes off for me, baby.\u201d</p><p>He was pushing the waistband over her hips, going to his knees and burying his face in the soft flesh of her stomach as she shuddered in his grip.</p><p>\u201cYour mouth is destructive,\u201d he whispered before allowing his tongue to dip out and probe at the shallow indention of her navel as she struggled out of her sneakers. Then he was pushing her jeans to her ankles, lifting her feet free and opening his eyes to stare up at her.</p><p>\u201cYou were a very naughty little girl,\u201d he drawled as his hand stroked up her leg to curl around the curve of a buttock. \u201cDo you know what naughty little girls get?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darkened further, almost black now as he caressed her ass.</p><p>She shook her head sharply, her lips parted as she fought to draw in air. She looked dazed, almost uncomprehending as he licked at the damp, rounded flesh of her belly.</p><p>\u201cThey get spanked,\u201d he whispered then, watching her eyes, her expression.</p><p>Curiosity and trepidation filled both.</p><p>God, he couldn\u2019t believe how innocent she was, so sweetly untried that it would be the same as taking a virgin. Something he had never dreamed would turn him on until now.</p><p>He rose slowly to his feet, pulling her to the bed and sitting down as he stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to spank you,\u201d he told her, relishing the very idea of it. \u201cI\u2019m going to make your ass and your pussy burn so bright you\u2019re going to scream for me to take you. To fuck you until you can\u2019t breathe for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will now,\u201d she gasped, her engorged, hard-tipped breasts rising and falling sharply.</p><p>His cock jerked at her rough declaration.</p><p>He glanced at the crotch of her panties. A silky thong that left her ass bare and clearly showed the dampness seeping from her pussy. He was going to bury his mouth there and see if it was possible to lick her dry. His mouth watered at the thought.</p><p>\u201cYou will anyway.\u201d He pulled her to him, drawing her down across his knees as she shuddered, the soft curves of her ass clenching.</p><p>Stretched over his lap, her head hanging down, her feet lifted from the ground, his hand smoothed over the soft, creamy perfection of her ass. He lifted the little band of fabric from the cleft of her butt, grimacing in raging lust as he parted the cheeks of her ass and glimpsed the small, delicate entrance to her anus.</p><p>Tempting. Tight. His cock clenched at the memory of being buried there.</p><p>He returned the material to its resting place, smoothed his hand over her butt then lifted it for the first soft blow.</p> <p>She flinched, crying out at the first small smack. Not pain, he could tell by the arch of her sweet backside that it wasn\u2019t pain. Or at least, not a pain she didn\u2019t want to experience again.</p><p>The erotic, sensual burn on her butt was driving her crazy. She could feel her flesh heating, absorbing each small smack as it tingled and ached for more. She had never known anything so sexual, so completely naughty as being bent over Sax\u2019s knee, her ass burning from each erotic blow.</p><p>\u201cYou flush so pretty,\u201d he praised her, his voice dark and rough as another burning caress was applied to her rear. \u201cA soft beautiful little blush.\u201d She shivered, jerking and crying out as he landed another soft blow.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t painful. It heated her flesh by degrees and sent sensations whipping through her body with lightning fast precision. Each little smack heralded a sharp, burgeoning ache in her pussy, making her juices flow from the ache deep inside. Her clit was swollen, throbbing, desperate for his touch.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty, Marey.\u201d His hand smoothed her buttock a second before he smacked it again.</p><p>She writhed on his knees, pressing her pussy into his thigh and whimpering with the rising demand vibrating there. She was burning. Each well-aimed, carefully timed smack to her rear only increased the flames.</p><p>\u201cSax, please...\u201d she finally wailed as the next, firmer tap sent her senses careening. She jerked, shuddering as a burning lash flayed her clit and sent fiery fingers of sensation to attack her womb.</p><p>Her pussy was soaked. She could feel the juices clinging to her flesh, dampening her panties. Fire burned her from her ass to her cunt, making her writhe with a lust she hadn\u2019t thought was possible.</p><p>Before she could gasp, he lifted her, turning her in his arms and depositing her on the bed as he came over her. His cock stood out from his body like a flesh and blood lance, the tapered head glistening with pre-come.</p><p>His lips came down on hers again. A hard, deep kiss that had her moaning, twisting beneath him as her hands gripped his shoulders and her hips lifted to him.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he growled, his voice rough as his lips moved to her cheek, her neck. \u201cNot yet, Marey. I\u2019ve waited too long for this, I have no intention of rushing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSax, you\u2019re burning me alive,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this good. How was she supposed to survive losing something that felt this good, and he had even taken her yet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll burn brighter before I\u2019ve finished,\u201d he warned her, the dominance in his tone making her shiver in anticipation.</p><p>His hands cupped her breasts then, lifting them to his lips. She watched, spellbound, as his tongue curled around the stiff peak of her nipple, licking at it, sending lightning-bright sensation shooting to her clit.</p><p>She convulsed with the pleasure, shuddering beneath him as he sucked the tender tip into his mouth, rasping it gently with his teeth before sucking it firmly. Her head twisted on the mattress as she fought to breathe. Arousal pulsed through her body like a hard electrical current, sensitizing her nerve endings, whipping through her bloodstream and driving her closer to an edge of pleasure she could never have imagined.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re exquisite,\u201d he growled as his lips began to roam lower.</p><p>He spread her thighs wide as he licked and kissed his way over her midriff, her abdomen, growing steadily closer to the steamy pussy covered by little more than a scrap of silk.</p><p>Silk that a second later ripped beneath his hands.</p><p>Excitement burst through her bloodstream, anticipation electrified her flesh.</p><p>She stared down her body, watching as he pushed her legs apart a second before he licked his lips and lowered his head.</p><p>The first firm, broad lick of his tongue through the drenched slit of her pussy nearly threw her over the edge into climax. She shuddered in the grip of pleasure, crying out hoarsely as she lifted her hips, begging for that final stroke that would throw her over the edge.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d His voice was raw, carnal lust. \u201cI\u2019m going to taste you first, Marey. Every soft, slick, sweet inch of this delectable pussy is mine now. And I promise you\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d</p><p>She screamed a second later as his tongue plunged inside her. There were no gentle preliminaries, no warning. She was empty, then she was filled, his tongue stroking inside her as his hands gripped her buttocks and lifted her to his mouth.</p><p>He sucked at the juices that flowed from her, hummed his approval of her taste and her response against her clit until she was begging, screaming. She was dying in need of him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sax.\u201d Her hands gripped the comforter with desperate hands. \u201cPlease now. I can\u2019t stand it any longer.\u201d</p><p>He moaned against her flesh, his tongue suddenly flaying her clit, lashing at it with devilish greed as the pleasure grew and grew toward the explosion that would rip through her and destroy her mind. Her eyes widened, her lips opened to scream but all that emerged was a hoarse, brittle cry as her orgasm built, exploded through her with a force that left her convulsing, her muscles locking in desperate sensation as he came over her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not finished yet, Marey.\u201d</p><p>She felt the broad head of his cock press against the tender opening of her pussy, and while the spasms of her climax echoed through the clenching flesh, felt him begin to push inside her.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d He grimaced almost painfully as she arched, a throttled scream tearing from her throat as fiery pleasure-pain assaulted the muscles of her pussy as he began to stretch them open. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight, baby.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand it. She couldn\u2019t survive it. She felt every inch of his erection as it tunneled inside her, stretching apart unused muscles, stroking nerve endings she didn\u2019t know she possessed.</p><p>The previous climax wasn\u2019t given time to die away or to abate before he began building the next one. Marey stared up at him, her eyes locked with his, bemusement whipping through her as she gasped, tried to beg but could only cry out as he shifted against her and wedged tighter and deeper inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou feel like wet silk. Hot, tight wet silk.\u201d His voice was a hoarse rumble as he breathed roughly above her, but his words...his words had her pussy convulsing around him as more of her juices eased his way.</p><p>Retreat, reenter. Retreat, reenter. Pulsing, throbbing strokes opened her tender flesh as he thrust his cock inside her. In and out, probing, deepening, wringing gasping screams from her throat as each stroke drove her higher.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d he whispered as he lowered his head, kissing her lips, her neck. \u201cDo you know how good this feels? Your pussy tightening around me, milking me like an erotic little mouth, sucking me in even as it tries to force me out.\u201d</p><p>His voice was so deep, so rough it was like a physical caress, stroking over her, inside her.</p><p>She bucked against him, driving him deeper as they both moaned in rapture.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me, sweetheart,\u201d he whispered at her ear then. \u201cI\u2019m going to take all of you now. Every. Sweet. Fucking. Inch.\u201d</p><p>She screamed as he drove inside her the last few inches, filling her to the hilt with heat and hardness, with fiery pleasure and the rasp of pain. One hand held her hip as the other lifted her closer to his chest as he began to move.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t fucking. She didn\u2019t know what it was, how she was supposed to describe it, but this wasn\u2019t what she had done with her ex-husband. This was primal, elemental. She hung on to his shoulders, her nails biting into his flesh as each stroke seared her cunt and set her clit on fire.</p><p>She moved beneath him, pushing against each thrust, driving him deeper inside her as she writhed on the impalement.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he hissed at her ear. \u201cFuck me back, baby.\u201d</p><p>His hips rotated, his pelvis stroking against her clit as a white, bright light began to glow at the edge of her vision. She couldn\u2019t stand it. She couldn\u2019t breathe, she wouldn\u2019t survive the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d he snarled at her ear again as he began to fuck her harder, driving inside her, pushing her higher as she slammed her hips back at him.</p><p>\u201cSax. Sax, please...oh God... Sax, it\u2019s too good...too good...\u201d She felt the crescendo rising inside her. Her womb tightened, her clit began to pound with a steady hard throb until she exploded.</p><p>She felt herself come apart in his arms, over and over again. It wasn\u2019t a single, terrifying explosion, but multitudes of them washing over her, convulsing her entire body beneath him as a strangled cry wailed from her throat.</p><p>Another hard thrust as she heard him groan, his head lowering, his hips driving his cock deeper, harder, and she felt the first torrential explosion of his semen inside her. Each hard blast of his release had her shuddering in renewed pleasure as it echoed within her own climax. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It seemed to last forever, and yet it ended too soon.

Her dark blonde hair fell over her neck and shoulders and framed her profile like a silken cloud.</p><p>Her unique looks could never be described as beautiful, they were too strong, too stubborn for such a term. His lips quirked in a grin as he considered the stubborn part. Her expression often reflected the inner part of her, willful and determined, but it was subtle. A quality many people often missed because they were unaware of what they were looking at.</p> <p>But Sax knew. He had seen it in her the first time he met her, just before her divorce. He had seen the misery in her eyes, but her determination to hide it from her friends. When she thought no one was looking, weariness and resignation would draw her shoulders down before she would resolutely straighten them.</p><p>For years after the divorce, despite the hell he knew her ex-husband had put her through, she had maintained a dignity that he could do nothing but admire. And a body that drove him crazy to possess.</p><p>He loved her. Despite the fact that she had run from him, that she had denied him at every turn, the need for her wouldn\u2019t ease. It only grew stronger, deeper. He had her, for now, but he was smart enough to know that keeping her wouldn\u2019t be as easy and getting her into his bed had been. He would have to keep her off balance, keep her body humming, her mind immersed in her sensuality until she knew she couldn\u2019t survive without him.</p><p>He knew what she hid from herself. He saw it in her eyes, in her voice, in the hunger in her expression. He had her heart, she just had to realize it. And getting Marey to realize what she didn\u2019t want to see would be his hardest battle.</p><p>He drew the blanket further over her back before rising from the bed and heading for the shower. He had waited, watched, knowing the day would come when Marey would drop her shields and allow him the chance he needed to break into her heart. He was in there now, though he was certain she would deny it to herself as long as she could.</p><p>He also knew something else about Marey, something she had revealed hours before. She loved the sensual dominance he could give her. She liked the fiery pleasure-pain and walking that fine line of carnal intensity. He would push her, he couldn\u2019t give her time to think, to consider the evolving relationship he could see coming. If he did, she would run. And he couldn\u2019t allow her to run. He wouldn\u2019t allow her to run.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you get ready, I need to run in to the office for a few hours,\u201d Sax announced as Marey sat silently after breakfast, fortifying herself with caffeine, wondering how she was going to manage to escape this new situation.</p><p>Sex with Sax was incredible. Too incredible.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d She took the final sip of her coffee. \u201cI\u2019ll get ready and you can drop me off at a hotel.\u201d</p><p>The tension that filled the room was like a punch in the gut. She raised her eyes, staring back at him as he watched her silently, his eyes narrowed on her.</p><p>\u201cStay a few days,\u201d he finally suggested casually, as though it didn\u2019t matter either way, as though there was no risk in such an action. \u201cAt least until they\u2019ve picked Vince up, Marey. You aren\u2019t safe in a hotel. You\u2019re safe with me.\u201d</p><p>She breathed out wearily, pushing her fingers through her still damp hair as she sat back in her chair and watched him directly.</p><p>\u201cAnd if Vince decides to blame you for the fact that I\u2019m here, rather than where he can get to me?\u201d she asked him defensively. \u201cWhat then, Sax? He\u2019s not sane. He won\u2019t go after you with his fists as he does me. He could come after you with a gun.\u201d</p><p>A savage smile tightened his lips.</p> <p>\u201cI would look forward to it, Marey,\u201d he snarled. \u201cUnlike you, I know how to deal with bastards like that. He won\u2019t get to me easily, I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>Were all men insane? Or just the ones she knew?</p><p>She closed her eyes as she clenched her teeth and held back a furious growl.</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you think you\u2019re invincible all of a sudden?\u201d she snapped, coming to her feet, ignoring the glint in his eyes as they dropped to her bare legs beneath the long hem of one of his T-shirts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m invincible, Marey,\u201d he assured her, his voice deepening, thickening with lust as he watched her. \u201cBut I know the type of man Vince is. A bullet isn\u2019t personal enough, it doesn\u2019t prove his strength, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important to him, proving his superiority.\u201d</p><p>In that, he was right. Vince couldn\u2019t tolerate believing an opponent could be physically superior to him. He didn\u2019t own guns, he owned fists and knives.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to just accept the fact that you\u2019re placing yourself in his path,\u201d she snapped belligerently. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Sax. I don\u2019t need these problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he can beat me, Marey?\u201d Genuine amusement reflected in his expression then. \u201cAre you afraid your man can\u2019t protect you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t my man,\u201d she muttered, using the only defense she could come up with. \u201cAnd right now, you\u2019re acting like a little boy playing one-upmanship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne-upmanship is not a child\u2019s game,\u201d he informed her with a slow, sexy smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a man\u2019s game. Want me to show you?\u201d</p><p>Oh man, the sound of his voice, the look in those dark eyes. Her pussy was suddenly humming in need, creaming furiously to the pure sexuality there.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d She scuttled quickly out of his way, watching him warily now. He could turn her knees to mush and her resistance to no more than a passing thought. There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell she was going to let him touch her. \u201cYou go on to the office. I can just lounge around here. Use the hot tub.\u201d Call a cab and find a good hotel.</p><p>He tilted his head questioningly. \u201cIf you walk out of here now, we\u2019ll never know what could have been, Marey. Is that what you really want?\u201d</p><p>Was it? No, she didn\u2019t want that, but neither did she want to see Sax pay for her mistakes.</p><p>She drew in a harsh breath. \u201cAfter they catch Vince\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head before the words were out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a woman who can\u2019t trust me to protect her.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, staring down at her somberly. There was no anger, no fury, just pure male stubbornness.</p><p>Marey stared back at him, bemused. He should be furious, not calm. In hindsight, she realized she had more or less given the impression she didn\u2019t trust him to protect her. She hadn\u2019t meant to. She had never felt that way. But his male pride should have at least been pricked. There should have been anger, a snarl, snapping sarcasm. Something besides somber intensity, steadiness.</p><p>Her hands clenched in the material of the T-shirt as she fought to come to grips with this new brand of male species. Who knew they could be so damned hard to figure out?</p><p>\u201cI trust you to protect me,\u201d she finally answered, clearing her throat nervously. \u201cIt has nothing to do with that. I\u2019m used to protecting myself, Sax.\u201d</p><p>She had been doing it for a long time. She might have messed up a time or two, but for the most part, she thought she\u2019d done a fairly good job.</p><p>\u201cAnd Vince is determined to hurt you, no matter the cost to himself,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t fight him, Marey, you\u2019ve seen that. He tried to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to stand in front of me.\u201d She turned away from him, furious herself now as she paced to the sliding glass doors that led to the deck. \u201cDammit, Sax, why do you think I\u2019ve stayed away from you? Why do you think I\u2019ve lived like a nun in that damned fortress Father built, and forgot I was woman all these years? He\u2019s crazy. He could try to kill someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he could,\u201d he snapped, but not in anger, more in frustration. \u201cAnd that someone could be you. Because he knows you\u2019re not strong enough to fight back. Until the sheriff apprehends him and the courts put him away for good, you need to stay safe. I can keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>He said the last sentence as he moved behind her, pulling her against his much taller body, his strong, warm body, as she fought the weakness that filled hers. He made her weak, made her want to lean on him, trust him. How insane was that? She knew better than to trust anyone.</p><p>\u201cIf you walk away now, Marey, it\u2019s forever.\u201d He lowered his head, pressing a kiss to her hair as his eyes met hers in the glass. \u201cNow, are you going to the office with me, or do you want me to take you to that hotel?\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, their gazes locked in the glass of the sliding doors, and frowned fiercely.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to piss me off,\u201d she finally snapped.</p><p>Surprise flared in his eyes. Surprise and arousal.</p><p>\u201cBaby, that\u2019s a given,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cNow, make up your mind and let\u2019s get out of here. I have work waiting.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Sax watched from beneath his lashes as Marey lounged on the couch on the other side of the room, calmly flipping through a magazine as he worked on the reports he needed to finish up for the day.</p><p>She was driving him crazy. She was as calm and placid as a mountain lake right now, waiting on him, as though it was nothing unusual to have little or nothing to fill her day. He knew she was an editor for a small publishing company, one that published extremely erotic content. She hadn\u2019t been the one to reveal the information though, it had been Ella who had dropped that little bomb months before.</p><p>Was that how she had learned to sit so silently, immersing herself in whatever she was reading? Or had she learned patience and silence while caring for her ill parents so many years ago?</p><p>There was so much about her that he needed to know. So many ways he wanted to learn everything possible about this intriguing woman.</p><p>\u201cBored?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>She glanced up, her gaze a bit distant as it met his.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI have company.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the edge of the magazine before returning her attention to the article she was reading. It wasn\u2019t fluff. The news magazine was one of his favorites actually.</p><p>He shifted in his chair, attempting to ease the uncomfortable weight of his throbbing erection.</p><p>\u201cDo you need to run by your house before we head back to mine?\u201d he asked her then. \u201cPick anything up?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up again. \u201cNo. I should have enough for a few days.\u201d</p><p>Her attention went back to the magazine. It made him crazy. Made him horny. She was as calm and relaxed as a summer\u2019s day, and just as damned hot. He knew how hot she could get, how wet and sweet.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since you\u2019ve had a lover?\u201d he asked her then, shifting to relieve the discomfort of his hard-on.</p><p>He watched her tense before she looked back at him, narrow-eyed and suspicious, but hot.</p><p>She glanced at her watch mockingly.</p><p>\u201cEight hours maybe?\u201d She went back to the magazine.</p><p>Sax observed her for long moments. She looked cool as hell, but he could see the altered breathing, the heavy rise and fall of her breasts. She was aroused. Just that fast. Her nipples were pressing tight against her shirt, her face flushed just enough to testify to her heat.</p><p>\u201cBefore that,\u201d he bit out between clenched teeth, waiting, his erection throbbing in agony. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She flipped the magazine closed and turned to him defensively, her gray eyes sparkling in defiance.</p><p>\u201cExactly what do you want to know, Sax?\u201d she asked him. \u201cAnd why all the questions?\u201d</p><p>God he loved it when her eyes went hot like that. Anger and passion and complete female stubbornness mixed with arousal. It was invigorating, energizing. It was making him so fucking horny he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cDoes everything have to be a test?\u201d he growled back, coming out of his chair and stalking across the room. \u201cMaybe there are just things I want to know about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should pretty much know everything by now,\u201d she shot back, staring up at him as he towered over her. She didn\u2019t jump to her feet to even out the distance or to assert her own control. She kept her seat, though she leaned back against the couch to keep the arch of her neck at a more comfortable angle. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though we\u2019ve just met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the more I think about it, the less I know,\u201d he told her, frustration rising within him.</p><p>\u201cAnd how many lovers I may or may not have had is important?\u201d She arched her brow mockingly. \u201cFine, Sax, until you, there\u2019s been no one since my divorce. Before my marriage there were two. I\u2019m sexually inexperienced but not stupid. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you do all day besides flip through magazines and edit romances?\u201d His cock was steel-hard and driving him crazy with the need to fuck.</p><p>She smiled slowly, her eyelids drifting lower, giving her a mysterious, sensual look.</p><p>\u201cPlay with my favorite toys and fantasize about you,\u201d she drawled. \u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re home alone?\u201d</p><p>The little liar. He could see the devilry in her gaze, the deliberate teasing in the way her tongue stroked slowly over her full, lower lip.</p><p>\u201cJack off and imagine your ass burning red,\u201d he snarled, reaching down and pulling her to her feet. \u201cI won\u2019t let you hide from me forever, Marey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not hiding anymore, Sax,\u201d she reminded him, her hands moving up his chest, over his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m right here where you can see me.\u201d</p><p>God, she was a temptation. A sweet, beautiful little keg of dynamite standing placidly in his arms. For now.</p><p>She shifted against him then, her lower stomach pressing against the hard ridge of his cock as a light flush of arousal stained her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAre you finished working?\u201d</p><p>His fingers burrowed in the soft weight of her hair as he held her still, watching the heat flame in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished,\u201d he growled as he pulled at the silk he held, watching her eyelids drift lower as sensual weakness consumed her.</p><p>\u201cWe could go back to the house.\u201d Her hands moved from his shoulders to his waist, gripping the flesh there as his head lowered to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t make it to the house,\u201d he told her roughly. \u201cI want you here. Now.\u201d</p><p>A low, aroused laugh came from her throat as she tilted her head back, allowing his lips to caress her neck.</p><p>\u201cTrojans and their office sex. I\u2019ve heard about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou hear too damned much. Those women have loose lips.\u201d He nipped at her neck, imagining her stretched out on the leather sofa, naked and filled with his dick.</p><p>She gasped as his hands moved to her breasts, cupping the delicate weight, his thumb and forefinger testing the hardness of her nipple through the soft silk blouse she wore. He was dying to get it in his mouth, to feel the sensitive nub growing harder as he sucked at it.</p><p>\u201cYou know too much about things you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He nipped at her neck, feeling her shudder from the erotic little pain he delivered.</p><p>\u201cHmm, have to get my jollies somewhere,\u201d she moaned as he licked at the soft flesh he had nipped.</p><p>Oh, he could give her jollies, he thought with a grimace of building lust, more jollies than she could have imagined.</p><p>As his lips moved to hers, taking her in a kiss that had them both moaning at the heated pleasure of it, his hands went to the small buttons of her shirt. He wanted her naked, wanted her wet, wild and screaming out her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYou need to lock the door,\u201d she gasped as the sides of her blouse fell apart and his lips wandered down her neck.</p><p>Her breasts were swollen, flushed, her hard little nipples poking against the lace of her bra as his lips drew closer.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Live dangerously,\u201d he murmured as he licked over the delicate curves. \u201cConsider it a jolly.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Consider it a jolly? She was fucking going to go through the roof as it was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d She could feel the fires building in her body, the heat attacking her pussy like an inferno gone wild.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d He drew the shirt from her shoulders, dropping it to the floor as his fingers moved to the clasp of her silk slacks. \u201cIt\u2019s closing time, but anyone could still walk in. A lot of the Club\u2019s members come in to my office, Marey. They wouldn\u2019t touch you, but they would watch, see your little pussy flared around my cock, hear your cries as I go in hard, deep, and push you over the edge.\u201d</p><p>She trembled, her eyes closing at the insidious images he was provoking.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been watched, baby?\u201d Her pants dropped to her ankles, revealing the white lace thong she wore beneath them. \u201cSeen the arousal in another man\u2019s face as your lover pumps into you? And I would. I would give them a show. I would show them how sweet and tight your cunt grips me, draw out and let them see the slick, syrupy juices that flow from you before I\u2019d push back in, and let them hear your screams.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. This was just nasty. Depraved. It was killing her. She had never, ever done anything like that. But she had to admit, Terrie and Ella had piqued her curiosity, made her wonder if it could truly be as good as they claimed it was to be part of Sax\u2019s sexual lifestyle.</p><p>\u201cHow...\u201d She fought the moan that would have been more a scream as his hands gripped the cheeks of her ass and he pulled her closer to him. \u201cHow can you share like that? Why aren\u2019t you jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want your pleasure. All of it. I want to see the surprise and the sensual agony twisting your features, and know I\u2019m a part of it. I want to see you screaming, begging, every inch of your body caressed and pleasured. But we\u2019ll both know who you belong to, Marey,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWon\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>His lips lowered to her breast, his gaze still locked with hers as his tongue curled around the elongated nipple, sensitizing it further, sending currents of pleasure ripping into her womb.</p><p>Who she belonged to? She knew who she belonged to, and it terrified her. Marey shuddered as pleasure burned through every cell of her body and the truth of her own sensuality and emotions burned through her mind.</p><p>She had waited for this. Longed for this. Even before she knew the sexual lifestyle Sax embraced and what a relationship with him would mean. She had put her own sexuality on hold, waiting, knowing the day would come when she would have this chance, this brief time to be the woman she had always longed to be in his arms.</p><p>As his lips created havoc and mind-destroying pleasure with her nipples, Marey\u2019s hands moved to his shirt. Her fingers slipped the buttons free, her hands pushed the material from his broad shoulders. She needed to touch him, to feel him. She needed to memorize every rough indrawn breath, every groan that came from his chest, so she would have the memory later, when the man was gone.</p><p>Her hands smoothed over his bare chest, down the tight planes of his abdomen, to his slacks. She made short work of opening his slacks as his lips sipped at her nipples and his hands roamed over her back and shoulders. She needed him naked, close to her, warming her.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He pulled her to the couch, easing her upon it until she was stretched out and staring up at him with dazed need.</p><p>God, she ached. The sensual pain was destroying her. She had never, at any time in her life, been as aroused as she was now.</p><p>\u201cI could eat you forever,\u201d he whispered as he knelt on the floor, slowly pulling the thong from her body, his hands spreading her thighs, positioning her until her pussy rested at the edge of the cushions. \u201cYou have the sweetest pussy I\u2019ve ever tasted, Marey.\u201d</p><p>His lips lowered to her as she watched, his expression tight with lust, his dark eyes glowing with it as his tongue extended and swiped slowly through the shallow, bare slit of her pussy.</p><p>Marey jerked, flinching at the pleasure of his heated tongue licking her, caressing her waxed folds with hungry intent. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He parted the inner lips with his thumbs and explored the valley with destructive leisure as she tensed and fought to rein in her own pressing need for orgasm.</p><p>Her hands went to her breasts, her fingers plucking at her nipples as she watched him, entranced by the sight of him, so big and broad between her splayed thighs, as he made a sensual meal of the heated juices that spilled from her pussy.</p><p>His eyes flared at the sight of her pleasuring her breasts. It sent a sharp biting thrill shooting through her body to realize it had pushed his arousal higher. She fought to ignore the emotional impact, the chinks developing in the shields she had raised against him. She wanted to enjoy, to allow every fantasy she had ever had of him, life.</p><p>Her breath hitched as his tongue circled her clit, his lips surrounding it to suck at it gently as tremors of ecstasy began to ripple through her womb. Then his hand moved, his fingers sliding through rich feminine cream, easing it lower as he massaged the tiny entrance to her anus.</p><p>Her eyes closed. She couldn\u2019t watch him, couldn\u2019t let him see what it was doing to her. He prepared her slowly, drawing her juices back, pressing the pad of his finger into the small opening as she bit her lip and tried to hold back the pleas and cries that would have spilled from them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tight,\u201d he groaned, his voice a hard rumble in his chest. \u201cSo sweet and hot. But I want you hotter. So hot, that you have to have more.\u201d</p><p>She wanted more now. The small, tiny little bites of sensation weren\u2019t enough. She needed more.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d His finger slid in deeper, massaging the sensitive nerve endings just inside the entrance, making her tighten on him, then relax. She needed more.</p><p>\u201cSax...\u201d She was breathing hard, heavy. \u201cMore. Please.\u201d</p><p>She heard a growl, a hungry male sound of pleasure as he slid in further, his lips moving on her clit again, building the pleasure inside her to a lava-hot intensity. She couldn\u2019t bear it. She whimpered, her hips writhing, pressing closer, impaling herself further on the broad finger penetrating her ass.</p><p>Each surging, burning fork of pleasure that struck her drove her higher. She was panting, pleading, mewling sounds of need falling from her lips as she felt herself nearing the edge.</p><p>\u201cGo over for me, baby,\u201d he whispered roughly as his lips surrounded her clit, one hard finger penetrated her gripping pussy, while the one that teased her anus slid in, sending fire scorching through her body, pleasure tearing through her senses until she erupted, shuddering and screaming out her pleasure as her orgasm exploded through her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to come down, for the vibrations to ease away. He rose between her thighs, his cock jutting toward her, thick and hard as her gaze centered on it.</p><p>He pressed the erect flesh against the bare folds of her pussy as Marey gasped, watching as the flared crest pushed in, disappearing inside as flames began consume her. He held her legs over his arms, holding them apart, watching as she watched, filling her slowly as she began to tremble.</p><p>\u201cSax. It\u2019s so good,\u201d she cried out, her voice barely more than a low gasp as the pleasure began to consume her once again. \u201cIt\u2019s so good...so hard...\u201d Her back arched as she panted for breath, using her inner muscles to caress and milk the iron-hard flesh as it impaled her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re so soft,\u201d he growled. \u201cSo soft and tight you steal my mind, Marey.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pushed into her, stretching her slowly, filling her pussy with the incredible heat and pleasure that she knew she would only find with Sax.</p><p>Her gaze stayed centered on his dark cock as he impaled her.

Sax didn\u2019t take her gently, though he never hurt her. He held her firmly in place, his hips moving hard and fast, his cock jackhammering inside her with a frantic, almost desperate pace as the pleasure began to build, to whip through her in blistering bolts of sensation that had her screaming, her head falling back against the couch as she arched to him.</p> <p>It was too good. Too hard. Too much pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she screamed out as her orgasm began to peak, the slamming of his erection inside her stroking nerve endings too sensitive, too responsive, for her control to handle. \u201cHarder, Sax. Fuck me harder.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, the sound rough and primal as the thrusts increased, the heavy pressure building in her pussy, her womb, her soul...</p><p>She exploded, screaming out his name as she felt him drive in deep, felt the flexing of his cock, then the scalding release of his seed as it began to jet inside her, prolonging her own orgasm, driving it higher, hotter.</p><p>She collapsed minutes later, fighting to breathe, to make sense of the incredible lethargy and sense of peace that suddenly filled her. As though this was where she was meant to be.</p> <p>That evening, wrapped in a towel and carrying a bottle of chilled wine, Marey joined the five Trojan wives in Sax\u2019s hot tub. The impromptu meeting had been arranged before they left the office. As they were leaving, James had invited them to ride back with him and Ella in the company limo. With a knowing grin, he had informed Sax that Ella was becoming impatient to visit with Marey, and putting her off was evidently causing him a few sleepless nights.</p><p>Tess, Cole\u2019s wife, was stretched out on one end of the ten-seat tub, eyes closed as she smiled at something Terrie, Jess\u2019 wife, said beside her. Ella, married to Jess\u2019 twin brother James, sat on the far end beside Tally, the only woman lucky enough\u2014or was that courageous enough?\u2014to be in a relationship with the twins, Lucian and Devril Conover. Kimberly, Jared Raddington\u2019s wife, sipped at her wine as she watched everyone else. She was the quietest of the five women, but no less important within the small group.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking long enough, Marey,\u201d Ella smirked as Marey dropped her towel and eased naked into the bubbling water.</p><p>She snorted at her friend\u2019s comment as she poured a glass of wine and sat the bottle on the deck behind her.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother the rest of you when those men close themselves off like that?\u201d she asked, referring to the fact that the seven men were now closed in Sax\u2019s office, discussing only God knew what.</p><p>It bothered her. Made her nervous, especially considering the fact that her lover was one of them.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, maybe the rest of them are giving Sax advice,\u201d Ella drawled. \u201cYou know, on how to spank stubborn women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, that\u2019s a treat,\u201d Tess countered with a laugh. \u201cThey\u2019re in there convincing him of the merits of abstinence. Punishment lies in doing without, not getting extra. Ask Cole, he\u2019s learned that fact several times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Terrie snorted at that one. \u201cCome on, Tess, \u2018fess up. What\u2019s your best holdout time? An hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d Tess laughed back. \u201cOr until he pulls out the toys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. I shouldn\u2019t have to listen to this.\u201d Ella covered her ears in mock horror. \u201cThat\u2019s my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrude,\u201d Tess chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore, Tess,\u201d Terrie pointed out with a laugh. \u201cJames and Sax reformed her.\u201d</p><p>Ella\u2019s blush covered her upper chest, neck and face as she splashed water back at her friend.</p> <p>Marey glanced at Kimberly then, seeing the flush that filled her face, the way her eyes lowered. Ella had admitted it had been damned near impossible to talk Kimberly into joining the group, because of her past exploits with Sax at the Club.</p><p>\u201cSax as a reformer,\u201d Marey drawled. \u201cNow that one is hard to imagine.\u201d</p><p>She ducked as Ella splashed water at her, before chuckling easily. It was odd, being amongst this group, all of them together at once. She had avoided the larger gatherings over the past year, unwilling and unable to bear the frank discussions she knew arose within them.</p><p>\u201cOf course he is, Marey,\u201d Tally entered the joviality then. \u201cHe\u2019s reforming you. I bet he\u2019s already choosing prospective seconds now. Maybe that\u2019s what all the secrecy is all about.\u201d</p><p>Her tilted eyes sparkled with amusement and fondness as Marey shot her a dark look.</p><p>\u201cIt occurs to me, that the five of you are finding much too much amusement in this,\u201d she announced haughtily. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll reform Sax.\u201d</p><p>Laughter erupted around her at her comment.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can see that one happening,\u201d Ella toasted her with her wineglass. \u201cLet me know when it works, hon, and we\u2019ll all enjoy our fun and games in your memory as we make a note to keep our men away from yours. If you reform the Trojans, we might all have to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Marey rolled her eyes, shaking her head at the knowledge that her friends relished the occasional threesomes their husbands provided, and the more extreme sexuality they possessed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see Sax reforming,\u201d Kimberly spoke then as though forcing herself to face a problem head-on. \u201cAny more than the others would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSax definitely does seem to enjoy the screams he inspires,\u201d Ella chuckled. \u201cAre you screaming yet, Marey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me to kill you, Ella,\u201d Marey growled affectionately. \u201cHow do the five of you do this? Sit and discuss this? Jess had sex with Tessa, but I\u2019ll be damned, Terrie, if it bothers you in the least. Lucian had fun and games with Terrie. The five of you should be mortal enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Sax played really nice with me and Kimberly,\u201d Ella pointed out with a smirk. \u201cBut you still love us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still debating your worth, Ella,\u201d Marey gave her friend a mock snarl. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t just as perverted as the rest of you, I\u2019m just pointing out how damned odd we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo odder than the men of that Club,\u201d Kimberly pointed out then, accepting the refill of her wineglass from Ella. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many men gather in one place, and actually get along. They don\u2019t stress over their women fucking around, and they don\u2019t get pissed over the games. I\u2019ve actually heard them discussing positions and how loud it would make the women scream.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re worse than us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many are in that damned club now?\u201d Tess opened her eyes for that one.</p><p>Kimberly, though she no longer had limited membership after her marriage, had been one of the few women allowed the freedom to come and go within the mysterious estate that housed The Club.</p><p>\u201cThe last I heard, there were more than fifty members.\u201d Kimberly shrugged. \u201cThough, I would say twenty regulars.\u201d</p><p>According to Ella, they had stopped pressing the other woman for names months before.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Kimberly was their practice piece,\u201d Tally laughed as the other woman flushed crimson.</p><p>\u201cIt amazes me no one has murdered you yet,\u201d Kimberly growled, narrowing her eyes on the other woman. \u201cThat was snide, Tally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, that was Tally\u2019s jealousy,\u201d Marey assured the other woman with a slight wink. \u201cShe\u2019s still pissed you were able to get in and she wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tally sniffed arrogantly. \u201cI would have, of course, been a perfect choice,\u201d she declared, surveying her nails with an air of offended pride.</p><p>\u201cSure you would have,\u201d Terrie drawled. \u201cIf they wanted to follow your orders and obey your unwritten, unvoiced little rules. You were supposed to submit, Tally,\u201d she reminded her with a laugh. \u201cNot them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Lucian and Devril keep having to remind me,\u201d she sighed, though the wicked glint in her eyes gave lie to her put-upon tone of voice. \u201cMaybe I can get them to remind me again tonight. I did point out that exceptionally designed paddle we found on the internet.\u201d</p><p>Laughter filled the tub again as wineglasses were refilled and the conversation began to dissolve into hilarity.</p><p>\u201cHey, what happened to Sax\u2019s car?\u201d Tally suddenly asked, her question creating a ripple effect that had silence filling the tub.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the car.\u201d Marey frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff\u2019s office was towing it off as Lucian and I left the office. I was just curious... Ouch, Ella, why the hell did you pinch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t play dumb nearly well enough,\u201d Ella snapped, her eyes glinting in anger as she set her glass on the deck behind her. \u201cLet\u2019s hope we\u2019ve all had enough to last us for a while because I bet we get cut off for a long time after this one.\u201d</p><p>Marey\u2019s eyes narrowed as her heart began to beat furiously in her chest. She turned to Kimberly. She was now part of Delacourte\u2019s security team and would know more than any of the rest of the ladies.</p><p>\u201cI like my job, Marey,\u201d she sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t make me jeopardize it. But I promise you, everything is under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVince,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe did something to the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I overheard someone mentioning a damaged brake line and possible deterioration before the car reached the cliffs.\u201d Tally was on a roll, and her own anger showing now. \u201cShe\u2019s not a child, she deserves the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Lucian and Devril don\u2019t spank you for a week,\u201d Ella muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou and James lied to me.\u201d Marey turned on Ella, fury flaming inside her. \u201cYou were going along with it, Ella?\u201d</p><p>Ella stared back at her unapologetically.</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d she admitted defensively. \u201cDammit, Marey, you\u2019re ready to run from Sax at the least excuse. I wasn\u2019t about to see you get an excuse. I don\u2019t want to see you dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather see Sax dead?\u201d she yelled back, jumping to her feet as she stumbled from the hot tub, pulling the towel around her as Ella joined her. \u201cWhat do you think that would do to me, Ella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no one is dead this way,\u201d Ella shouted back as she knotted the towel between her breasts. \u201cYou\u2019re so stubborn, Marey, you\u2019d cut your own nose off to spite your face. Sax can protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need his protection or yours,\u201d Marey spat furiously. \u201cDamn you, Ella, you had no right to lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou lie to yourself all the damned time. It shouldn\u2019t bother you so fucking bad when someone else tries to do no more than protect you from your own foolishness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here aren\u2019t I?\u201d Marey nearly screamed. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping in his damned bed and he\u2019s fucking me regularly. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore to the point, it\u2019s what you want and deny yourself with any and every excuse,\u201d Ella accused her, crossing her arms over her breasts, her expression mulish, defiant. \u201cI just wanted to make certain you didn\u2019t come up with a new excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was none of your business...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it wasn\u2019t. Do you think we enjoyed sitting in that goddamned hospital room with you after he nearly killed you?\u201d Ella yelled, her own voice hoarse with her anger. \u201cGet a clue here, Marey, he wants you dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a clue here, Ella, you\u2019re a nosey bitch,\u201d Marey snarled.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a stubborn bitch.\u201d Ella was nearly in her face now, nose to nose, her face flushed in anger. \u201cAnd if you try to walk out on Sax over this I\u2019m going to beat you myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, be careful, baby, you might make me hot,\u201d Marey mocked her heatedly. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be a new stroke of pleasure for the bastards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwww. They\u2019re going to get all pissy and gross now,\u201d Tess announced to one and all. \u201cSomeone go find Sax and James to cool them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Tess.\u201d They both turned on her, snarling furiously before turning back to each other.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can see we left you ladies alone too long,\u201d Sax spoke from the sliding doors, his voice calm, a shade mocking as Marey turned to him slowly.</p><p>His arms were crossed over his broad chest, his teeth flashing in a mocking smile as the others stood behind him, watching the scene outside with varying expressions of disapproval.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed on him before she looked to each one in turn.</p><p>\u201cRemember me telling you that you were going to piss me off?\u201d she asked him then, her voice sarcastically sweet.</p><p>His brows lifted slowly.</p><p>\u201cConsider me pissed off.\u201d</p><p>She swept into the house, shaking with rage and fear. Fear uppermost. It crawled through her system, twisting her stomach in knots that threatened to send her to the bathroom heaving.</p><p>Vince wouldn\u2019t stop, she knew. He was proving it. And dear God, she didn\u2019t know if she could bear losing Sax.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cThis is a mistake, Marey, please don\u2019t do this.\u201d The driver pulled the limo into the parking lot of the hotel as Ella voiced yet another plea that she return to Sax\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI have to think,\u201d she muttered, staring out the window into the brightly lit interior of the hotel lobby.</p><p>\u201cVince isn\u2019t sane...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Ella,\u201d Marey sighed tiredly.</p><p>\u201cSax loves you, Marey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla.\u201d James voice was low, soothing. \u201cSax and Marey have to fight this out themselves.\u201d</p><p>Marey looked over at James, the concern on his face, the worry, before she looked back to Ella.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you old harpy,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAnd I know he cares. I just have to figure out what I\u2019m doing here. I can\u2019t do that with him hovering over me. I\u2019ll be careful though, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Ella sighed regretfully. \u201cFine. And I love you too. Even if your decisions do suck sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time,\u201d Marey admitted with a sigh, already missing Sax, uncertain if the decision she had made in anger was one should stick to now that the rage was dimming.</p> <p>\u201cWe can take you back, Marey,\u201d James offered, his voice gentle.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She drew in a deep breath as the driver opened the door and stood aside patiently.</p><p>She hugged Ella quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She jumped from the car before she could change her mind, striding purposely into the hotel, refusing to look back.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if stubborn had a name, it would be Marey.\u201d</p><p>Marey froze in the act of securing the hotel door and turned slowly.</p><p>Sax.</p><p>Well, this explained why James had the chauffer drive around aimlessly while Ella argued with Marey.</p><p>\u201cBoy, when they say Trojans stick together, they mean it,\u201d she snorted. \u201cHow much did you have to bribe the concierge to arrange this one?\u201d</p><p>The hotel was the best in the city, security had always been exemplary.</p><p>\u201cDelacourte/Conover holds an account here,\u201d he informed her, his voice cool. \u201cThe owner also happens to be a member of The Club.\u201d</p><p>She snorted at that. She should have figured that one out on her own.</p><p>She stood silently, her hands fisting in the loose material of her dress as she stared back at him.</p><p>He stood in the center of the room, his feet braced apart, his head tilted as he watched her, his eyes dark and brooding.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re finished being pissed, we can go back to the house now,\u201d he said patiently.</p><p>Her teeth snapped together angrily.</p><p>\u201cCan you get any more arrogant?\u201d she snapped. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe you like to lie to both of us too damned much,\u201d he suggested silkily, moving to her, slow, relaxed, his steps stalking.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to run from him, she promised herself. She wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction. Or was that, deny herself the satisfaction? She was as sick as Ella and the others.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Marey,\u201d he whispered, his voice soft, dangerous. \u201cIt occurs to me that somewhere, somehow, you\u2019re going to have to trust someone. Trust starts here and now. Bend over on the bed.\u201d</p><p>She gaped back at him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly. \u201cExcuses are over. Bend over, baby. Now...\u201d</p><p>Running from him wasn\u2019t going to work. She had admitted that while she was arguing with Ella. It was useless. He was her weakness, the one she feared most, and was most helpless against. She moved slowly to the bed, licking her lips nervously at the determined, dominant glint in his eyes. Her pussy was heating, dampening, her breasts swelling in anticipation. Perv, she accused herself. But she moved to the bed, gave him one last nervous glance then bent over slowly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good girl.\u201d Marey knelt on the bed, her rear in the air as Sax slid the last inches of a butt plug slowly into her ass nearly half an hour later.</p><p>She was stretched, burning. Her hands were clenched in the comforter as she fought to breathe through the sensations, to think past the dazed sexuality that filled her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to wear that until we get home,\u201d he whispered as his hand smoothed along the curves of her butt. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to fuck you. While your ass is filled with that plug, and you\u2019ll be ready for me, Marey. So wet and so ready that when I slide inside your tight cunt you won\u2019t be able to stop screaming.\u201d</p><p>She believed it. She was going to scream now.</p><p>\u201cCome on, stand up for me.\u201d</p><p>He helped her from the bed, drawing her up until she faced him, swaying, the muscles of her ass clenching around the fiery width of the dildo penetrating her.</p><p>She stared up at him, trembling, increasingly aware of the stuffed depths of her rear, and the aching emptiness of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d He held out his hand for her, a small smile quirking his lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can walk.\u201d She swallowed tightly, attempting to still the tremors racking her body.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you can.\u201d His hand smoothed over her rear. \u201cSlow and easy. And let it feel good.\u201d</p><p>She snorted sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m going to get off just walking, Sax. This is cruel and unusual treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll just wish you could.\u201d He chuckled as he drew her to the door. \u201cAnd just think how good it\u2019s going to feel when we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been raped, Sax?\u201d she asked conversationally then, almost missing the surprise that crossed his face as she picked up her purse and headed for the door, a hard breath exhaling from her chest as pleasure tore through her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cI can\u2019t say as I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpect it,\u201d she warned him with a snap as he opened the door for her and she swept from the room. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>Raping Sax was going to be delayed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is he doing here?\u201d Marey snapped out with a groan as they pulled into the tree-shaded driveway of Sax\u2019s home late that evening beside a black Mercedes and the brooding, dark-haired man standing beside it.</p><p>He straightened as Sax stopped the rental car, his arms unfolding from across his chest as he shoved them in his pants pockets instead. Daniel Conover was as well known to Marey as Tally\u2019s lovers, Lucian and Devril. He was a top-notch private investigator, and a pricey one as well. He was also part of the exclusive little club Sax belonged to if the woman was to be believed. And Marey knew her well enough to know she wouldn\u2019t lie about it.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t too hard on the eyes. Thick black hair, intense gray eyes and a brooding expression that made more than one woman sigh in longing. He was a bad boy, wild and dangerous, and you could see it in his face.</p><p>Her pussy was blazing, her ass was on fire and every nerve and cell in her body was screaming out for release. She didn\u2019t want to wait. She wanted Sax in the house, naked and fucking her. She didn\u2019t want to socialize. No matter how easy the company was to look at.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hired him to find your ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>Marey gnashed her teeth. \u201cWe\u2019ll argue over that one later. Get rid of him, Sax. I\u2019m dying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible,\u201d he promised, opening his door and moving around the front of the car to open her door.</p><p>He helped her out of the car as a sharp, indrawn breath hissed between her teeth. She clenched the muscles of her anus, feeling her juices leak from her pussy, burning her clit and sending ripples of incredible hunger convulsing through her vagina.</p><p>\u201cHurry.\u201d She felt like snarling. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to be polite. To anyone.</p><p>His hand cupped her hip as he closed the door and led her to the house.</p><p>\u201cCome on in, Daniel,\u201d he invited, causing Marey to elbow him in his tight abdomen.</p><p>She wanted to be fucked. She didn\u2019t want company.</p><p>Sax punched the security code quickly on the control panel, which automatically unlocked the door for him to swing it open. Lights flipped on inside the house, casting a gentle, soft glow through the large living room.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, you know Marey Dumont.\u201d Sax introduced them as he headed for the bar at the side of the room. \u201cWould you like a drink, Daniel?\u201d</p><p>A drink? He was staying long enough for a drink?</p><p>Marey cast the other man a glare from beneath her lowered lashes. In return, she got a slow, wicked smile and she was going to ignore what that did to her overly aroused body, she assured herself.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ms. Dumont.\u201d He nodded, his deep voice a rumbling in his chest as he watched her closely. \u201cYou\u2019re looking lovely as ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, Daniel.\u201d She nodded briefly before turning to Sax. \u201cI\u2019ll wait on you upstairs...\u201d</p><p>She turned to leave the room. If she didn\u2019t get the hell away from him, she was not going to control herself.</p><p>\u201cMarey.\u201d His voice stopped her as she turned from him. Turning back slowly, she watched him with narrow-eyed warning. \u201cDaniel might need to ask you some questions. You should stay.\u201d His voice hardened.</p><p>Okay, she hated bossy men, but the sound of his voice, the warning implicit in it, had her pussy clenching spasmodically.</p><p>She licked her lips quickly, fighting to control her breathing as she faced him, aware of Daniel watching the scene. She bared her teeth at him, ignoring the flare of amusement in his eyes as she did so.</p><p>Daniel was a Trojan. For a moment, her knees weakened at the suspicion and the arousal that overwhelmed her at the thought. Sax was moving faster than she had anticipated if he had planned this.</p><p>She breathed in deeply. She had waited years for this. She had known the day she pulled into the parking lot of that damned motel what would happen if she ever went to Sax\u2019s bed. This would be part of it, she had known. The sharing. And she wanted it.</p><p>For a moment, she wondered if she should have felt shame. It wasn\u2019t every relationship that began with the understanding that there would often be more to the sexual depth than was considered decent. If so, then she guessed she was shameless. She had known for years that Sax was more sexual, more dominant than other men. She had gone to that motel knowing, knowing it would never end with one night, knowing that eventually, she\u2019d be part of the lifestyle she knew he led, if she managed to hold onto him long enough to experience it.</p><p>She ignored the little voice in the back of her head that warned her this was more than sex. The part of her heart that weakened, softened, and laughed gently at her refusal to look beyond the sexual, or to delve deeper into the fact that it was a lifestyle she would have never embraced with another man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She would eventually walk away. Most likely sooner than later, simply because she knew she couldn\u2019t bear the fear, day in and day out, that he would leave her. That the day would come that he would wake up, bored by her, having realized it was only the sex holding them together rather than any emotion on his part. Though she had to admit, he played the loving suitor quite well.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll have a glass of wine if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d She tried to relax, to still the trembling in her hands, in her body as she met his gaze.</p><p>A slow smile shaped his full lips as he nodded slowly.</p><p>Walking slowly, swallowing tightly, she moved to the couch and sat down. Sweet mercy. Her muscles clenched, convulsed around the thick plug as she moved. She wasn\u2019t going to survive this.</p><p>She watched as Sax handed Daniel his whisky on ice then moved to her with the wine he had poured. She needed something to still the nerves rising inside her, and the depraved images running through her mind.</p><p>\u201cDoes your ex-husband have any computer skills, Ms. Dumont?\u201d Daniel sat in the chair across from her, his gray eyes watching her curiously, knowingly.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d She accepted the wine from Sax, forcing her attention on the questions as he sat beside her. Close. Reminding her of how well they seemed to fit together.</p><p>\u201cAny friends who do?\u201d Daniel leaned back in his chair, crossing his ankle over the opposite knee. \u201cYour security company\u2019s computers were hacked into night before last. We think this is how he managed to get the security codes. He didn\u2019t break the system.\u201d</p><p>Geez, she was supposed to think right now?</p><p>\u201cVince\u2019s friends rarely called or came to the house.\u201d She concentrated on trying to control her breathing, but it wasn\u2019t easy when Daniel flicked a glance to her breasts. Her nipples were standing out, hard and tight and getting worse as Sax began to stroke her neck with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember any of his friends? Names, anything?\u201d</p><p>She breathed in deeply. \u201cWe were barely married a year, Daniel. And I can\u2019t remember the few people he did introduce me to.\u201d</p><p>She could barely remember her own name right now.</p><p>Sax\u2019s fingers drifted to her collarbone, then the upper edge of her breast.</p><p>Marey lifted the wine to her lips and took a heavy drink. Her hand was trembling and she couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, maybe questioning Marey should be done later,\u201d Sax said gently.</p><p>Daniel shifted in his chair, his gaze going to her breasts as Sax slid the first button of her shirt free. Her head fell back against his shoulder, weakness filling her. She was going to do it. God, she couldn\u2019t believe she was actually living the fantasy that had filled her dreams for so long.</p><p>\u201cSax, if this is solo event, you better let me know now,\u201d Daniel half groaned as Sax caressed the upper mounds of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cIs it a solo event, Marey?\u201d Sax whispered, taking her wineglass as his finger glanced over her nipple, causing her to jerk in reaction.</p><p>\u201cI knew what I was getting into.\u201d She breathed in harshly as Daniel stood to his feet, moving slowly to the couch, his eyes lowered sensually as Sax moved her until she was stretched out, her head on his opposite shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did know, didn\u2019t you, baby?\u201d he crooned. \u201cWere you looking forward to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking forward to you,\u201d she whispered, unable to lie to herself or to him. \u201cAll of you... Oh God!\u201d</p> <p>Her entire body convulsed from no more than Daniel loosening the belt of her slacks and sliding the button that held it together free.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful aroused,\u201d Sax whispered as his fingers flicked the buttons of her blouse open. \u201cBut I want to see you insane with it. There\u2019s a pleasure that women find, only when taken like this, Marey. A pleasure we only find in seeing you experience it. One that makes us as high as it does you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh?\u201d she gasped as Daniel lifted her, sliding her pants over her hips as he removed them, sending her senses reeling, her nerve endings flaming in response. \u201cSax, this is passing \u2018high\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Her blouse fell away from her breasts as her pants slid from her body. The plug in her ass felt like an erotic wedge, burning her with the knowledge of what was to come as her panties slid as easily from her body as her pants had.</p><p>Minutes later, she was naked, staring up at the two men who had quickly disrobed, their fingers wrapped around their straining cocks, two sets of hungry eyes\u2014one gray, one chocolate brown\u2014watching her intently. She wasn\u2019t willing to lie there and wait. Rising, she turned on the couch, her hand reaching out for the bronzed length of Sax\u2019s cock, her mouth opening as he pressed the wide head to her lips.</p><p>She sucked him in hungrily, tasting male heat and desire as Daniel moved to her side.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby.\u201d Sax pulled back from her, ignoring her protesting cry as his cock slipped from her mouth.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to protest too hard though. Instantly, Daniel\u2019s lips covered the straining peak of one breast as Sax knelt at the arm of the couch and similarly captured the other.</p><p>Oh God. Her hands tangled in Daniel\u2019s hair, clasped Sax\u2019s smooth head.</p><p>This was paradise. Their lips tugging on her breasts, sucking her deep, tongues flaying her nipples as their hands roved over her body. She was being consumed, devoured. She shuddered in their grip, her head falling back as she whimpered with the storm rising within her.</p><p>\u201cSax...\u201d His name escaped her lips, though she was certain she couldn\u2019t breathe, let alone form words. \u201cSax...\u201d</p><p>She wanted to say so much, and yet the words wouldn\u2019t come. Wanted to whisper whatever that emotion was burning in her soul, yet she couldn\u2019t make sense of it.</p><p>\u201cSo sweet.\u201d His lips trailed from her nipple, down her torso as he lifted her, propping one knee on the cushion to allow his tongue freedom to dance over her swollen, saturated pussy.</p><p>He circled her clit, licked at it, breathed over it, until she was straining against him, begging for more. Heated, calloused fingertips trailed up her thigh until they were parting the trembling folds, one finger working its way inside her burning vagina.</p><p>She pushed against it, moaning, begging for more as Sax covered her clit with his lips and sucked it into the fiery heat of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSax, damn you,\u201d she cried out, twisting, thrashing in their grip as lips, tongues and fingers drove her on a spiraling ride she wasn\u2019t certain she could survive.</p><p>The lash of his tongue on her clit had her straining, begging for her orgasm. The firm, suckling pressure at her nipple sent arcs of near violent sensation shooting to her womb as the finger filling her pussy worked in and out, stroking her ever closer to what she knew would be a destructive climax.</p><p>Then just as quickly, both were gone.</p><p>She screeched hoarsely, reaching for them, only to have Sax return her to her previous position as he once again filled her mouth with his cock.</p><p>Daniel knelt behind her, his lips smoothing over the curves of her ass as his fingers moved to the cleft, gripping the base of the plug and turning it slowly.</p><p>She cried out around the erection filling her mouth, sucking it firmly, her tongue lashing at it as Daniel began to torment the filled tunnel of her ass. She ached. She whimpered with the pain, her hips moving, backing against him as he drew the flared end back then impaled her slowly with it again.</p><p>Sax moved until he stood at the arm of the couch, forcing her to brace her upper body over the thick cushion to maintain the deep penetration of her mouth. His cock stretched her lips, his hands burrowed in her hair, holding her still as he thrust in and out easily.</p><p>Behind her, Daniel slowly removed the plug as Marey screamed at the sensations the action invoked. She was going to come. Oh God, she was going to come from no more than the erotic pain of the thick bulb blistering the small ring of muscles it passed. Almost, she was almost there.</p><p>Her nails bit into the cushion of the couch as the impending release slowly drifted away, leaving her to growl furiously. She needed that release, desperately.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Sax, she\u2019s wet.\u201d His fingers slid through the drenched folds of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cWet and wild,\u201d Sax whispered, staring down at her as she raised her eyes to his, her mouth filled with his cock as she moaned in excitement.</p><p>She worked her mouth on him as much as the hands in her hair allowed, but as she felt the cooling sensation of lubrication gel being applied to the stretched entrance to her ass, she stilled.</p><p>She watched Sax, seeing his expression tighten as he watched Daniel slowly stretch and lubricate her ass. His face was twisted with arousal, but something more. Something undefined as Daniel moved and the head of his cock nudged against her.</p><p>His eyes came to hers again, the dark color flaring with emotion, pleasure. Pride. Then she couldn\u2019t see, couldn\u2019t hear anything but her own strangled screams as she felt the thick cock easing inside her.</p><p>Sax eased back, pulling his cock from her mouth, though he continued to hold her head up, to watch her as Daniel slowly worked his cock up her ass.</p><p>\u201cSax. Sax...Oh God...it burns...\u201d Hard hands held her hips as she bucked against the penetration, desperate to force more of the hard flesh inside her. \u201cMake it stop...\u201d</p><p>She was screaming, arching, her pussy so hot, so wet now she could feel the excess dampening her thighs.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty.\u201d His thumbs smoothed over her cheeks as she stared up at him imploring, feeling every bulging inch of Daniel\u2019s cock as it slowly filled her. \u201cLet it go, Marey,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust let the pleasure control. Not you.\u201d</p><p>She tried to shake her head. She couldn\u2019t allow that. If she did, she might not survive never having it again.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he crooned, glancing past her as Daniel groaned roughly. \u201cYou\u2019re tight, Marey, he\u2019s having to work his dick inside you. Do you know how good that feels, having to move so slow and easy? Can you feel it, Marey? The edge between pleasure and pain. It\u2019s the same for Daniel, working his cock up your ass as you tighten on him, wondering which sensation is stronger and dying for more.\u201d</p><p>She tried to shake her head. She needed him to just shut the hell up. She couldn\u2019t fight him and these sensations.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Marey.\u201d His voice hardened as her eyes closed. They opened again slowly. \u201cLook at me. He\u2019s almost filling you, just a few more inches, baby. He\u2019s going to work that tight ass open then fuck you slow and easy. And I\u2019m going to watch your face, sweetheart. Watch you fly over the edge while you scream.\u201d</p><p>Scream? She couldn\u2019t breathe, how was she supposed to scream?</p><p>All she could do was concentrate on the rising tension in her body, feeling Daniel slide in those inches until he was seated inside her to the hilt, filling her with every inch of cock.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t enough. She whimpered, shaking, staring up at him, terrified to ask for what she needed. If she did, how would she maintain her distance from him?</p><p>Behind her, she felt Daniel\u2019s hands grip the curve of her buttocks, pulling them further apart as she watched Sax glance behind her. Daniel pulled back then, causing her to clench her teeth tight, to hold back a scream as he began to work his cock in and out. Long slow, deep thrusts and retreats, shafting her rear with measured thrusts as she felt the pleasure building inside her. Pleasure, pain, fire and ice. The alternating sensations shuddered along her nerve endings as each stroke of Daniel\u2019s erection inside her pushed her past the point of control.</p><p>She needed more.</p><p>She strained against Sax\u2019s hold on her face, needing to bury her face in the pillowed armrest, to chant her needs in silence so he couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>He smiled down at her tightly, his lips pulling back from his teeth, his teak dark face twisted in pleasure as he watched her, his gaze going from her face to the point where Daniel was fucking her ass with diabolically slow strokes.</p><p>\u201cSax...\u201d she whimpered his name, unable to hold back the unspoken plea raging through her body. \u201cPlease...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease what, baby?\u201d His hands held her face steady. \u201cTell me what you want, Marey. All you have to do is ask me for it. That\u2019s all. Anything you want. It\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to make it. She moaned at the knowledge that he had known her better than she knew herself. She couldn\u2019t deny it, the pleasure, the edge of pain, or her need for him.</p><p>\u201cMore...\u201d she mouthed silently.</p> <p>His thumb smoothed over her lips.</p><p>\u201cI have to hear you, baby,\u201d he groaned, compassion and more reflecting in his gaze.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to see that more.That emotion she couldn\u2019t admit to, even to herself.</p><p>Behind her, Daniel continued to move, each stroke breaking her control further. She was full, yet she was empty. She needed more, needed that something that would push her over the edge and send her screaming into climax.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she demanded roughly, driving back on Daniel\u2019s cock as his hold slackened.</p> <p>Instantly, a light, reproving smack was delivered to the curve of her buttock.</p><p>Sax chuckled as she jerked, snarled and drove back again. Another smack sounded on the opposite cheek. It was making her crazy. How the hell was she supposed to survive this, to hold on to any part of her heart if he kept forcing her to relinquish so much to him?</p><p>\u201cSax, fuck me.\u201d She tossed her head, jerking from his hold, tossing her head in demand. \u201cDamn you, fuck me now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cEasy, sweetheart. We\u2019re going to do this slow and easy...\u201d</p><p>Together, Daniel and Sax had eased her up, keeping her impaled on the cock penetrating her ass as Sax stretched out on the couch beneath them. Her legs spread, knees bent as together they began to lower her.</p> <p>How they kept her suspended in such a way, she didn\u2019t know and she didn\u2019t care. All she knew was finally, finally, Sax\u2019s cock was tucking against the folds of her pussy, pressing against the weeping entrance as she was lowered by slow degrees.</p><p>Daniel\u2019s erection throbbed in her ass, filling her so full that she feared Sax would never be able to work his inside her convulsing pussy. But slowly, by smooth, thick degrees, he began to fill her, working in and out as Daniel had done, forcing her muscles to stretch, her cream to flow faster and slicken his way until he slid into the very depths of her.</p><p>Her head lay against his chest, her arms around his neck, and she swore she wasn\u2019t crying as she listened to his crooning words.</p><p>\u201cSo good, baby...hot and sweet...so fucking tight... That\u2019s it, love, take all of me now. All of me, Marey...\u201d</p><p>He had all of her.</p><p>\u201cSax.\u201d She was dazed, weak, despite the fires erupting from nerve ending to nerve ending and the pleasure-pain consuming her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, love,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust lay there. We\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>They began moving then. Perfect, practiced moves that drove Sax\u2019s cock deep in her pussy as Daniel retreated from her rear, only to then have Sax retreat as Daniel pumped inside her ass. At first, their movements were slow and easy, allowing her to accustom herself to the fullness, the hunger. Allowing the inferno building from the dual penetration to destroy her mind.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t just lay against him, she fought the arms that held her close, her hips writhing, struggling to increase the strength of the thrusts as the sensations began to grow, to build, to tear through her body until every inch of her flesh was sensitized, pulsing, waiting...</p><p>When it came, she screamed. The words that escaped didn\u2019t matter, the tears ran down her cheeks unheeded, all that mattered was the release exploding through her, deep, brutal detonations that convulsed her quaking pussy and sent her cream spilling past the cock shuttling hard and deep inside her. She was consumed by it, destroyed by it, barely able to understand that the men filling her were finding their own release as well, pumping her body full of hot semen, sending another series of contractions ripping through her.</p><p>Finally, she collapsed wearily on Sax\u2019s chest, her body still shuddering almost violently as she felt Daniel ease slowly from her rear, his hand sliding over the curves gently as Sax whispered soothing nonsense at her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to shower, buddy,\u201d she heard Daniel breathe out roughly. \u201cShould I stay or go after I\u2019m done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang around,\u201d Sax grunted. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The words drifted around her as she lay against Sax, feeling him ease from her, holding her close as he lifted himself from the couch then swung her in his arms.</p><p>She was only distantly aware of the trip upstairs, or of how he washed her tenderly before tucking her into his bed. She curled beneath the blankets, into his pillow and let sleep overtake her.</p><p>\u201cDid that a little fast didn\u2019t you, Sax?\u201d Daniel walked into the kitchen later, dressed, toweling his hair dry as he watched Sax quietly.</p><p>Sax glanced up from the sandwiches he was making, grimacing at his friend\u2019s comment.</p><p>\u201cI have to keep her off balance,\u201d he admitted with a sigh. \u201cShe runs scared as hell when she has time to consider things. Until Vince is in custody, I\u2019m walking a fine line.\u201d</p><p>Daniel snorted. \u201cShe\u2019s crazy about you. We\u2019ve known it for years. She runs if she just thinks you\u2019ll be in the vicinity. Her face flushes if your name is mentioned, and according to Tally, toys can be a girl\u2019s best friend and all hers are named Sax.\u201d</p><p>Sax grunted rudely. \u201cSo I was told.\u201d</p><p>Ella had been a font of information lately where Marey was concerned. That bit of information he could have done without though.</p><p>\u201cVince has disappeared, Sax,\u201d Daniel said wearily as he took his seat at the small breakfast table, accepting the saucer that held his sandwich and the bottle of beer Sax handed him. \u201cI have several men on his trail, but nothing has come up yet. The sheriff is scratching his head too. We\u2019re tracking whoever hacked the security company\u2019s computers. It was a good job, but they messed at a pivotal point. Sheriff found Vince\u2019s prints all over your car though. He definitely did the tampering on the brakes. We\u2019ll find him, but I don\u2019t know how soon.\u201d</p><p>Sax breathed out roughly. \u201cShe\u2019s scared of him,\u201d he growled. \u201cMarey\u2019s not scared of much. She has a backbone of steel, but Vince scares her.\u201d</p><p>Daniel shifted uncomfortably. \u201cYou read the report you hired me to put together three years ago, man. He\u2019s not sane. He played a good game to get her. A lonely rich woman. She spent her life taking care of her ill parents, putting her own on hold. They die, she\u2019s ripe for the picking. Vince picked. You\u2019re lucky she was smart enough to get rid of him before he killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want him found.\u201d Sax took his seat, keeping his voice calm despite the fury rising inside him. \u201cHe damned near killed her at that motel and the next time, she might not be so lucky. Find him, Daniel, I don\u2019t care how many men it takes or how much it costs. I want him gone.\u201d</p><p>Daniel stared back at him broodingly.</p><p>\u201cGone how?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>Sax lifted his gaze, staring back at his friend coldly.</p><p>\u201cHowever it takes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Marey awoke slowly the next morning, her eyes fluttering open, the dark beams of Sax\u2019s ceiling the first thing she saw. Sax slept deeply beside her, his arm lying over her hips, his head lying next to hers as he kept her tucked close to his body.</p><p>He had awakened her in the early morning hours for a hot shower, washing her carefully, gently, before drying her and tucking her back into bed before crawling in beside her.</p><p>He had taken care of her.</p><p>She frowned deeply up at the ceiling, wondering if there had ever been a time when anyone had taken such care of her. She couldn\u2019t remember it if there had. Perhaps as a child her parents had, but if so, she had been so young that those memories had been lost over time.</p><p>She had cared for them since she was a teenager. First her mother, who had conceived her only child in middle-age then contracted cancer when Marey turned thirteen. She had fought it for ten years, but she had been weak. So weak that her heart had given out before the renewed cancer had taken her.</p><p>A year later, her father had a stroke that had left him bedridden.</p><p>She could have hired someone to care for him. She could have deposited him in a nice little nursing home and resumed her life. But she loved her father. With his gentle smile and soft voice and his remorse that her life had been spent caring for him and her mother rather than being the woman she should have been.</p><p>There had been no regrets. But there had been no time for relationships. She had known her father would be gone within a short time, and she hadn\u2019t been willing to desert him, to leave him to strangers to care for him any more than she had to.</p><p>But she had found an escape. From the pain and the depression of watching her parents dying in front of her eyes, Marey had found an escape in the books she loved. First as a reader, then as an editor. She had worked the past six years as an editor for an erotic book publisher. The books were blistering, incredibly hot. And for a while they had eased the dark, sexual fantasies that haunted her. After her father\u2019s death...</p><p>She breathed in deeply. What a fool she had been. She had married the first man to ask her no more than a few months after having met him. Within weeks the rages had started. Within six months he was hitting her. It had been a horrible blow to her confidence. Within weeks of the divorce, she had learned that Vince had no intentions of letting her go. If he even suspected she was interested in another man, accidents began to happen.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she could live if something happened to Sax because of her. To this point, Vince had always struck at her, but she knew Vince had never felt truly threatened that she would find someone else to share her life, or her money with.</p><p>It was all about the money and the power he thought it would bring him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop thinking so hard, I\u2019m going to have to fuck you again,\u201d Sax mumbled at her ear, his deep voice rumbling in his chest with morning drowsiness.</p><p>A smile quirked her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou play dirty pool,\u201d she told him quietly. \u201cSometimes I have to think, Sax. This is one of those times.\u201d</p><p>He grunted mockingly. \u201cI don\u2019t like how you think sometimes, have I mentioned that?\u201d</p><p>He pushed the sheet away from her body before his hand flattened against her belly, his lips smoothing over her shoulder. She stared down at the rich coffee tone of his skin contrasting so exotically with her pale skin.</p><p>\u201cNow, I would have never guessed that,\u201d she countered, allowing the amusement to weigh heavily in her voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve surprised me, Sax.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, a low sexy sound that had her womb clenching in response.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a smart-ass first thing in the morning.\u201d He stroked her stomach slowly, his fingertips lightly drawing over her flesh, sending soft, though destructive sensations washing over her nerve endings.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t so much sexual as it was caring...loving. She tried to steer clear of that. She couldn\u2019t let daydreams get mixed up with reality. She had made that mistake once before.</p><p>He cared. She was certain he cared for her. Sax was often a brutally honest person, he rarely pulled his punches with anyone. But for three years he had moved on the outer edges of her life, always there, always watching her. He had never, not at any time, unleashed his infamous biting sarcasm on her. He had never looked at her with the brutal icy-eyed gaze she had seen him give others. He had never done anything but treat her with the utmost consideration and heated hunger.</p><p>Yes. He cared. And perhaps he could have loved, if she was strong enough to be as brave as she had needed to be three years before.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ella calls me a smart-ass often,\u201d she finally answered, her gaze going back to the ceiling as she smiled fondly, thinking of her friend. \u201cActually, I think her favorite insult is bitch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot hardly.\u201d His fingers strummed over her hip. \u201cSmart-ass I\u2019ll accept though.

The caresses as calming as they were arousing.</p><p>\u201cJust stuff,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI was shameless last night, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She heard the note of pride in her voice and almost winced.</p><p>\u201cYou were indeed shameless,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cAnd wet and wild. So fucking hot you were incredible.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you share, Sax?\u201d she asked him then. \u201cYou\u2019ve said it\u2019s for the women\u2019s pleasure, but that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He propped his head on his hand as he levered up, watching her curiously. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t find pleasure in it, Marey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t find pleasure in seeing another woman touch you.\u201d She frowned at that thought. She would feel murderous.</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t ever have to,\u201d he promised. \u201cBut you can\u2019t deny you enjoyed what happened last night with Daniel. That you haven\u2019t thought of it, looked forward to it. I heard it in your voice, saw it in your eyes and your response. Why did you enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a pervert,\u201d she snorted sarcastically. \u201cNow your excuse?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a smile curving those sexy lips as he stared down at her reprovingly.</p><p>\u201cShame on you,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou\u2019re not a pervert. You\u2019re a very sexy, very sexual woman. That edge of the forbidden is exciting though, isn\u2019t it? Makes the pleasure higher, hotter. Maybe that\u2019s why we like it. I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t want to do without. Seeing you like that, embraced between myself and Daniel, your eyes dazed, your face flushed, pleasure swamping every particle of your being is addictive. It\u2019s a high, baby, only unlike any other I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats drugs, huh?\u201d She rolled her eyes expressively.</p><p>His grin kicked in again, his chocolate brown eyes watching her closely, warmly.</p><p>She was so lost, she thought. She had lost her damned heart to this man so long ago and now she faced losing him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know.\u201d He said the words so simply, so matter-of-factly that for a moment, she was certain she hadn\u2019t heard him correctly.</p><p>\u201cBoy, you really like to play dirty pool,\u201d she snapped then, anger, helplessness washing over her. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t at least wait until this was settled? Until Vince was caught and I could make sense of any of this?\u201d</p><p>She jumped from the bed, casting him a furious glare as she jerked the shirt she was using for a gown from the small chair beside the bed and pulled it on. He was lying back on the pillows, watching her somberly, his eyes piercing her, filling her with guilt.</p><p>\u201cI like things clear,\u201d he amended calmly. \u201cDon\u2019t play dumb, baby. You knew this was more than an affair when you went into it.\u201d</p><p>There he was, just lying back in the bed, his erection tenting the sheet, staring back at her in that calm, solemn way of his. What the hell was she supposed to say? To do?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even think about this.\u201d She pushed her fingers through her hair in irritation. \u201cI won\u2019t think about this. Not until Vince...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis excuse is getting old.\u201d His voice never changed inflection but it still hardened, grew deeper. \u201cIt\u2019s like you pull it around you whenever you can\u2019t face what\u2019s growing between us. It\u2019s a crutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t true,\u201d she snapped back defensively. \u201cHe\u2019s dangerous...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you refused to stop him when his violence escalated.\u201d She flinched at the calm accusation, staring back at him furiously.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why it happened.\u201d She breathed in deeply, fighting to make sense of the clash of emotions rising inside her now. \u201cI can\u2019t make decisions about the future now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to make decisions, Marey.\u201d His smile was a wolf\u2019s snarl, predatory, confident.</p><p>Rising from the bed, completely unashamed of his nudity and the erection jutting from between his thighs, he stalked toward her.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a decision.\u201d Gripping the neckline of the T-shirt with both hands, he tugged forcefully, ripping it down the front as she stared back at him in shock, gasping in arousal. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take anything from you, baby. I\u2019m not asking for anything. I don\u2019t have to ask. I know what\u2019s mine and I know how to claim it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to him, a strong, forceful movement as he gripped her hips. His head lowered, his lips covering hers, possessively, dominantly.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold back her moan. There was nothing like Sax\u2019s kiss or the way he held her to him. He seemed to surround her, his heat and his strength protecting her even as his kiss ravished her senses.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t fight him. There was no fight in her. She could only grab his shoulders, hold on tight and absorb him into the very depths of her soul. There was nothing so hot, so tempting, so completely overwhelming as Sax\u2019s embrace.</p><p>As his lips moved on hers, gentle and sure one moment, hard and possessive the next, Marey moaned in rapturous pleasure, her hands clenching on his shoulders, rubbing her body against him, loving the way his hands stroked her back, drew the remnants of the T-shirt from her body, and sipped at her lips with hungry demand.</p><p>This was what she had run from for three years. As insane as it sounded, and inconceivable as it was, she could feel him sweeping not just through her heart, but through her soul.</p><p>\u201cI know how to love my woman,\u201d he whispered as his lips slid from her lips to her ear. \u201cI know how to protect her, and I know how to hold her. And I will hold you, Marey.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her back to the bed, lifting her against him as he lay back, staring up at her with heavy-lidded sensuality as he cupped her buttocks in his hands, moving her until she straddled his hips, lifting her until the head of his cock seared the sensitive opening of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cRide me,\u201d he growled, arousal thickening his voice as his hand raised to her heaving breasts, his head lifting to allow his tongue to lick at her hard, distended nipples.</p><p>Marey whimpered at the sensuality of having the control, staring down at him, his body reclining beneath hers, his cock hot and erect, waiting to pierce the willing depths of her pussy.</p><p>She lifted up, her breath hitching as she moved against him, whimpering as his cock began to penetrate the slick, heated entrance to her hungry pussy. Her head fell back as she took him slowly, working the hard flesh inside her by increments, driving herself crazy with the incredible sensations streaking through her body. She loved it. Loved feeling his cock stretch her, burn her.</p><p>His hands were on her breasts, fingers tweaking her nipples as she rode him with long, slow strokes, fighting the need to rush, to drive herself to madness on the thick stalk of flesh filling her.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, baby,\u201d he whispered as he tensed, obviously holding himself back as he allowed her to take her pleasure as she needed.</p><p>Her juices were flowing between them, the sounds of wet, suckling flesh echoing around her, driving her arousal higher. His hands, warm and slightly calloused, rasped her nipples as his voice crooned in that rough, deep baritone and sent her mind spiraling with her pleasure.</p><p>Her pace increased, their moans mingling as the intensity and the heat grew. She could feel her womb tightening, fingers of fire racing through her pussy. She was going to come...</p><p>\u201cSax. Harder. Oh God, fuck me...\u201d She couldn\u2019t gain the force she needed, the rhythm he used to power into her and throw her over the edge.</p><p>She shook, shuddered, fought her own weakness and pleasure in her drive for ecstasy.</p><p>His hands moved from her breasts to her hips. They held her still, his fingers clenching there as he began to move. He drove his cock inside her with enough power and force to cause her to arch in his arms, a strangled scream leaving her throat as her orgasm began to race through her body.</p><p>She convulsed above him, her thighs tightening, her hands clenching into the muscles of his chest as she felt herself come apart around him. His strangled groan met her scream as he drove in one last time, tensed further and then found his own release. Hard, rapid jets of semen burning her, the feel of the silky fluid flooding her, throwing her higher.</p><p>The aftershocks seemed to last forever. She shuddered through them as he drew her to his heaving chest, his lips pressing to her forehead, his hands stroking over her back. Soothing her. Easing her down from the almost painful heights of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cCan you walk away, Marey?\u201d he asked her then, his voice gentle, understanding. \u201cNo matter the risks, can you really walk away?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Could she walk away?</p><p>Later that evening, Marey stepped onto the back deck of Sax\u2019s home and eased into the hot tub bubbling merrily in the corner.</p><p>The hot water wrapped around her, the massaging pulse of the jets beating against her weary muscles. Sax was insatiable. She ached in places she had no idea she could ache. But for the first time in years, her body was relaxed, even if her mind wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He was right, she couldn\u2019t walk away. He terrified her. Loving him terrified her. And not because of what she was scared Vince would do, though that was a worrisome aspect. No, he terrified her because she knew she had already given him so much of herself. If she stayed, if she accepted this relationship for what it was, then he would own her soul.</p><p>She had been alone for most of her life, even before her parents\u2019 deaths. Sharing it with someone determined to take such an active role wasn\u2019t easy to accept. Sax wouldn\u2019t go his way as she went hers. He was a possessive man, not controlling, but possessive all the same.</p><p>He would expect to share her life, not just exist within it.</p><p>She leaned her head wearily against the rim of the tub and breathed out roughly.</p><p>She loved him. She had always known she loved him, but she hadn\u2019t known how much until he began to fill her life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to finish up a few reports.\u201d Sax stood at the glass sliding door, chest bare, his teeth gleaming in his dark face as he watched her with a wicked glint in his eye. \u201cNeed anything before I go up?\u201d</p><p>Marey chuckled at his suggestive tone. \u201cI think you\u2019ve more than taken care of anything I could have needed,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI\u2019m just going to lay here and relax for a while. You go work.\u201d</p><p>He moved to the deck, kneeling behind her and pressing a kiss to the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cJust yell if you need me,\u201d he whispered warmly. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the bedroom window open just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She closed her eyes as his kiss moved to the shell of her ear, his tongue lapping at it heatedly. \u201cGet out of here. You\u2019re insatiable.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that, a male sound of pleasure and pride as he rose to his feet and walked back to the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back down in about an hour,\u201d he promised. \u201cDon\u2019t overheat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you upstairs, there\u2019s no danger of that,\u201d she laughed back at him, watching as he flashed her a wicked grin and turned away.</p><p>She closed her eyes, fighting the need to call him back.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sax,\u201d she whispered, knowing he was gone, unable to hold back the words any longer.</p><p>What the hell was she going to do with him? She couldn\u2019t let him go. She couldn\u2019t walk away. He fulfilled too many parts of her soul. He fulfilled her, period. Laughed with her, loved her, touched her with such passion and hunger that she knew she would never be the same again.</p><p>\u201cWell, you look comfortable enough, bitch!\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>Her eyes flew open, fear and disbelief clamoring through her as she met Vince\u2019s furious gaze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou really have lost your mind,\u201d she said, amazed at his daring. She had pretty much caught on to the fact that Vince wasn\u2019t too bright, but this was ridiculous. \u201cVince, Sax will kill you if he catches you here. Don\u2019t you realize that?\u201d</p><p>His brown hair was still kept shaggy short, but stood on end, unkempt and dirty. His brown eyes narrowed in hatred, his fists clenched. The faded denim shirt he wore was streaked with dirt, his jeans ripped at the knees.</p><p>\u201cThe son of a bitch,\u201d Vince snarled. \u201cHe\u2019s too busy playing his computer geek games upstairs. And you\u2019re not going to scream, are you, Marey?\u201d he sneered. \u201cLittle Miss Too Much Pride. I heard you screaming for him, though, didn\u2019t I, you little whore? Him and that bastard he put up your ass!\u201d</p> <p>She flinched at the fury rising in his voice.</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, she tensed. Sax would be down soon, he rarely left her long while he worked upstairs, checking on her often. Being naked and at the mercy of a man she knew wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill her with his bare hands was a frightening prospect.</p><p>\u201cHow did you evade the sheriff?\u201d she asked him, hoping to buy some time, to distract him just long enough for Sax to make his way downstairs.</p><p>His thin lips twisted in disgust as a dark, brick flush rose under his skin, barely noticeable in the dim light of the deck. It wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you actually had the nerve to file charges.\u201d The low, evil chuckle that came from his lips had her shuddering in terror. \u201cThat was very bad of you, Marey, you should have taken your punishment and kept your stupid mouth shut.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou nearly killed me, Vince,\u201d she snapped, refusing to let him see her fear. \u201cAnd you tried to frame Sax for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have been sniffing around you,\u201d he snarled. \u201cWhat makes him think he can take what belongs to another man? He\u2019s a trespasser and you\u2019re a whore, always watching him, eating him with your eyes. Did you think that just because you forced that divorce that it changed anything, Marey? The vows were until death do us part.\u201d His lips curled in a feral sneer. \u201cAnd only death will part us!\u201d</p><p>She was rising from the hot tub, a scream on her lips as he tensed to jump for her, knowing her time had run out. As she turned, Daniel rushed from the house, his hard hands gripping her as he pushed her against the side of the house. Sax rushed past them, leapt the distance of the tub, tackling Vince as he moved to run.</p><p>Eyes wide, she watched as Daniel quickly followed. His voice rose as he informed Sax of all the legal ramifications of murder. Not that Sax seemed inclined to listen as his hands tightened around Vince\u2019s throat, a snarl of fury twisting his lips.</p><p>It was over quickly, too quickly for her to process the fact that Vince was unconscious on the deck, and she was still standing naked in the cool fall air, staring back at Sax in amazement as he rose from the deck.</p><p>\u201cI should paddle your ass,\u201d he yelled, staring at her over the churning water of the tub. Furious. His eyes were blazing, anger contorting his expression as she watched him in amazement. \u201cWhat in the living hell possessed you, woman, to sit and bait him like that? To just sit there, calmly talking to him in a tub of water knowing fucking good and well he was capable of drowning you?\u201d</p> <p>Screaming. He was screaming at her, his body so tense, so tight, she wondered if something would break.</p><p>\u201cI knew you would save me,\u201d she whispered, blinking back at him in surprise. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t let him hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Shock filled his face then. \u201cI wasn\u2019t here!\u201d He wiped his hands furiously over his slick head as he yelled again. \u201cHow the hell was I supposed to save you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did, Sax,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cI knew you would be here. I knew you would be...\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes as she stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t leave me alone, Sax,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re always close, touching me, embracing me, needing me. How can anyone have a chance to hurt me when you love me so well?\u201d</p><p>A heavy frown darkened his brow. \u201cThat is not getting you out of trouble,\u201d he assured her through gritted teeth as he stomped around the hot tub, jerking her in his arms and holding her rapidly chilling body close to his warmth. \u201cBut God help me, Marey, the next time you do anything so stupid, I\u2019m going to paddle your ass.\u201d</p><p>A tearful smile crossed her lips as she tilted her head, her hand reaching up to touch the dark features of his face, the sensual curve of his lip.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Sax,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI was going to tell you that tonight, while you held me, while you loved me. I\u2019ve always loved you.\u201d</p><p>A hard breath shuddered through his chest as he buried his head in her hair, his arms tightening around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely spanking you,\u201d he groaned. \u201cGod baby, I love you. So much you terrified the hell out of me sitting there talking to that bastard so calmly, knowing how easily he could hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing you would be there,\u201d she said against his chest as he lifted her into his arms while Daniel called the sheriff.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even bring a robe out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo warm me.\u201d She burrowed against his chest, her arms wrapping around his neck, her head resting naturally on his shoulder. \u201cWarm me, Sax...\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cSomehow, Vince managed to hire an ex-employee of the security firm to hack into their computers for the code to Marey\u2019s house,\u201d Daniel reported the next morning after the sheriff and his deputies had arrested Vince, taken their statements and then left them in peace.</p><p>Marey was sitting tiredly on the couch, bleary-eyed, certain she had never been so exhausted in her life as she listened to what Daniel had come to the house the night before to tell them.</p><p>Neither she nor Vince had heard the car pull up at the front of the house, but Sax had. Just as he had heard Vince through the opened bedroom window seconds before. Moving carefully, he had let Daniel in, then together they had contained Vince. A few broken bones were the least of her ex-husband\u2019s problems now.</p><p>\u201cWhat will they do with the hacker?\u201d Marey asked, fearing the moment when Daniel would leave and she would have to face Sax alone. She was suddenly terrified. Not of him, but of herself.</p><p>When he had jumped across the hot tub, the rage that had filled him had been palpable. He would have killed Vince if Daniel hadn\u2019t stopped him.</p><p>Son of a bitch, I\u2019ll fucking kill you for touching her. Vince\u2019s eyes had been bugging from his head, his face turning purple. Do you understand me? My fucking woman, you low-life motherfucker!</p><p>His woman. Conviction, determination, commitment had filled every hoarse word, every finger that tightened on Vince\u2019s throat before Daniel managed to pull him away.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll arrest him.\u201d Daniel watched her closely, but not near as close as Sax was watching her.</p><p>She nodded, lowering her head again as she stared at the floor, her arms wrapped around her chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head out of here, Sax,\u201d Daniel announced then. \u201cI still have to stop at the sheriff\u2019s office and take care of some more paperwork. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again, Daniel.\u201d Sax moved across her line of vision, his powerful legs moving slowly across the floor.</p><p>\u201cI can see myself out,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cTake care of your woman. The night has been hard on her.\u201d</p><p>Marey shuddered.</p><p>Seconds later, the front door closed, leaving her alone with Sax.</p><p>Silence filled the house.</p><p>Emotions rose within her with a force that had her shaking in their grip.</p><p>\u201cMarey.\u201d Sax knelt before her, his broad hand lifting her chin as he stared back at her somberly.</p><p>Oh God. He shouldn\u2019t look at her like that, she thought. His expression so tender, loving. She had fought so hard not to believe in happily-every-afters, in warmth and love. How was she supposed to protect her heart?</p><p>But she knew, had known for days that such protection was a long time past.</p><p>She felt a tear slip down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cEveryone I really love leaves me,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t love Vince, and I knew it. I barely cared, but I was so damned tired of being alone.\u201d Her breath hitched in her throat as he continued to watch her, his dark face intent, his expression filled with love. \u201cWhen I met you,\u201d she continued. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe. If I believed, I would have had to face how I\u2019ve hidden for so long. The coward I\u2019ve been.\u201d She pulled away from him as a sob shook her.</p><p>\u201cMarey, don\u2019t do this to yourself,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe can talk about this later. After you\u2019ve rested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have the courage then,\u201d she cried painfully, moving away from him as she rose to her feet, tightening her arms around her chest as she turned her back on him. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You were right. All along. Vince was a crutch. An excuse to keep you away.\u201d She turned back to him, staring back at him, refusing to hide any longer. \u201cI had to keep you away, Sax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He pushed his hands into the pockets of his slacks as he stared back at her, his brown eyes wary.</p><p>\u201cBecause you could hurt me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd I knew it. You could rip the heart from my chest, and you terrified me because of it. Because Sax, in a matter of months, as you tried to make me laugh, to talk me into your bed and your life, I fell in love with you. And I didn\u2019t know what to do with that love. Or how to handle it if you ever walked away from me... Or if you were taken from me...\u201d</p><p>She thought of her father, his patient resolve, his gentleness and the hole his and her mother\u2019s deaths left in her life. She had spent her own life caring for them, putting it on hold, forgetting her dreams, her needs in the face of theirs.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t die, Marey,\u201d he whispered, and in the rough tone, what she heard, she heard with her heart, not her ears. Hopes, dreams... \u201cAll I can promise you is that while I live, as long as I draw breath, I\u2019ll love you. And I\u2019ll pleasure you with everything I have.\u201d</p><p>His arms wrapped around her then, his hands smoothing up her back as she clutched at him, tears flowing freely from her eyes, sobs tearing at her chest.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she cried out, her hands clutching at his shoulders as he lifted her, moving until he was sprawled into the chair Daniel had vacated, drawing her over him, her thighs clasping his while his hands tore at her robe.</p><p>\u201cFeel me, Marey,\u201d he groaned, throwing the robe to the floor before he shifted, his hands tearing at his pants as hers ripped at the buttons that held his shirt together.</p><p>Naked. She needed him as naked as she was, bodies, hearts and souls bare to one another. Embracing each other.</p><p>When he surged into her, her head fell to his shoulder, her arms wrapping around his neck as his circled her back. He moved into her powerfully, thrusting hard and deep as she undulated against him, driving him deeper, gasping, crying out as he whispered his love, his lips moving over her shoulder, her neck, his tongue stroking trails of moist flames as his arms tightened around her, holding her still as he began to drive inside her harder.</p><p>Waves of pleasure suffused her, overtook her. Perspiration built along her body as she fought to breathe, to reach the peak of rapture that she knew she could find only in Sax\u2019s arms.</p><p>The closer she came, the more she could feel opening inside her soul.
