I can still wipe the floor with your scrawny ass.\u201d</p><p>Connor wiped his hand over his short hair and clamped down on the top in an effort to pull it out. Nathan Tucker had the right idea by shaving his head. It was something Connor was going to have to look into if he kept getting bombs dropped on him.</p> <p>\u201cPop,\u201d Connor said in exasperation. \u201cWe install security systems. Sophisticated, state-of-the-art computer monitoring equipment. We do consulting. We evaluate security for other people. We are not a goddamn bodyguard service.\u201d</p><p>Pop huffed, crossed his arms over his chest and leaned back against his adopted daughter\u2019s desk. Faith stared wide-eyed at her father and brother but didn\u2019t say a word. She was too glued to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d stop your yammering for two seconds, I\u2019d explain why you\u2019re perfect for this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh boy,\u201d Connor muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear this. I\u2019d better sit down for it.\u201d</p><p>He flopped into one of the chairs in front of Faith\u2019s desk and waited for his father\u2019s latest harebrained scheme. Not that his father wasn\u2019t a smart man. He was one of the most intelligent and cunning men Connor knew. It was the cunning part that bothered the hell out of him right now. He wasn\u2019t sure how, but he knew he was fucked. And it looked like he was about to find out.</p> <p>\u201cPhillip Armstrong is a longtime friend. We go way back. Served together in the marines. He\u2019s a big-shot record executive now and he has a big-name artist on his label.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the name?\u201d Faith piped in.</p><p>\u201cLyric Jones.\u201d</p><p>Faith frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the frown for?\u201d Connor demanded. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of her?\u201d Faith asked.</p> <p>\u201cDoes she sing country music?\u201d</p><p>Faith chuckled and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen I rest my case. So why the frown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s difficult,\u201d Pop said with no preamble. \u201cBut you\u2019ve dealt with difficult before. She won\u2019t be a problem for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is she my problem at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause most of her security detail was fired. What was left quit. She has two bodyguards that are as useless as tits on a boar hog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to fix this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPhillip is scrambling to hire a replacement firm. One better than the last since they sucked ass. His words, not mine. She only has one more show and then she\u2019s going to be sort of on vacation here in Houston.\u201d</p><p>Faith lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWhy the hell would she willingly vacation in Houston? I mean, a girl with that kind of money ought to go to Paris. Or Italy. Maybe a beach house in the Caribbean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said sort of because she\u2019s doing a show at the Houston Livestock and Rodeo but she\u2019ll be here a total of two weeks. She also has some signing and fan meet-and-greet at one of the downtown music stores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I get it,\u201d Connor said as he pushed himself forward in his seat. \u201cWhat they want is a babysitter. They want someone to sit on her so she\u2019ll be good for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Pop had the grace to look abashed. \u201cWell, yes and no.\u201d</p><p>Connor made a rude noise. \u201cWhy the hell are you asking me? There are three other guys in this office all capable of doing this job.\u201d</p><p>Faith made a show of blowing on her nails and whistled softly.</p><p>\u201cBecause everyone is either married or getting goddamned married and you\u2019re the only single guy left. If I try to send one of the other guys to spend twenty-four/seven with a gorgeous pop star, I\u2019ll have three pissed-off women on my ass. No, thanks. No offense, Connor, but you have nothing on the girls. I\u2019ll take my chances with you.\u201d</p><p>Faith smiled sweetly in her brother\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t get you for this,\u201d Connor muttered at Faith.</p><p>\u201cLook, at least fly out to L.A., catch her last show, introduce yourself, see how it goes. What can it hurt? I think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s not as bad as you think. You\u2019ll spend two weeks with her here keeping her out of trouble and keeping her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how unsafe is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the usual celebrity shit, I\u2019m sure. Everyone wants a piece of her. Without adequate security, it could get dangerous. Phillip is going to get a local firm to do the peripheral security but he wants someone he can trust next to her until he can go through and interview larger firms that will handle her security on the road. He\u2019s worried, and Phillip doesn\u2019t worry about much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell don\u2019t they just cancel the rodeo appearance, stash her somewhere private for two weeks and get their shit together for when she goes back on the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d Pop said in irritation. \u201cWhen has show business ever made any goddamn sense? These people don\u2019t think with their brains. They think with their checkbooks and use dollar signs as their guides. It\u2019s your job to be their brains for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Connor groaned. \u201cDifficult and brainless. I can hardly wait.\u201d</p><p>The door to Faith\u2019s office opened and Angelina Moyano poked her head through. When she saw the two men, she hesitated. \u201cAm I interrupting anything?\u201d</p><p>Connor grinned and motioned her in. \u201cOf course not. How are you, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>Angelina walked in, graceful and petite despite her bulging abdomen. Most women her size would be down to a waddle by now, but she still moved with ease.</p><p>She smiled at Connor. \u201cI\u2019m good. How are you?\u201d She bent down to hug him tight and he put his hand on her belly.</p><p>\u201cIs Miss Priss moving around today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling her that,\u201d Angelina said in exasperation. \u201cHer name is Nia. Hi, Pop,\u201d she said as she brushed a kiss over the older man\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself, Angel. Where\u2019s Micah? Shouldn\u2019t he be working? For that matter, where the hell is Nathan? And Gray? Are we the only people working?\u201d</p><p>Connor and Faith exchanged eye rolls. Pop was on his way to working himself into a dither.</p><p>\u201cI came by to get Faith. Julie offered me a pregnancy massage and Faith is going to go hold my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like get her own massage,\u201d Connor muttered. \u201cYou girls don\u2019t fool me one bit. I\u2019ll go hold your damn hand and then maybe Julie will massage me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind your own woman\u2019s hand to hold,\u201d Micah Hudson growled from the doorway.</p><p>Pop looked up and scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you decided to show up. What is this, come to work late day?\u201d</p><p>Micah ignored Pop. All his attention was on the curvy Latina woman heavily pregnant with his child. It amused Connor to no end to see Micah so gobsmacked over a woman. Not that he didn\u2019t love women as a rule, but there was nothing casual or flirty about Micah\u2019s relationship with Angelina. The poor boy was whipped and it was pretty pathetic to watch.</p><p>\u201cHow sure is Julie that a pregnancy massage is good for the baby?\u201d Micah asked.</p><p>Angelina paused and turned with one hand on her hip. \u201cI think the point is that it\u2019s good for the mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will it hurt the baby?\u201d</p><p>Angelina smiled. \u201cYou worry too much, Micah. Go do some work so Faith and I can go have some girly time. We\u2019re going to be late, and Damon expects Serena to be home by noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d Connor murmured. He always wondered what the hell went on in Damon and Serena\u2019s marriage. Of all the people who worked for Pop, Connor was the furthest out of the loop when it came to Damon Roche. From what he\u2019d gleaned the man was a control freak and he kept Serena under his thumb.</p><p>Faith grinned, and he should have known by the devilish glint in her eye that she was going to say something outlandish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure if she\u2019s late, she gets a crop to her ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething Gray needs to think about for you,\u201d Connor said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cWho says he doesn\u2019t?\u201d she teased as she grasped Angelina\u2019s arm and the two headed for the door.</p><p>Was the whole damn world crazy around him? He\u2019d heard enough to know that his sex life had to be the only normal one in his group of friends. He didn\u2019t even want to know what kind of shit Micah put Angelina through. It would probably only piss him off. And Faith. God. His sister, for Pete\u2019s sake.</p><p>He shook his head. No, he didn\u2019t want to know the depravities that his friends indulged in. He was perfectly happy to be the boring vanilla one in the bunch.</p><p>He turned to eyeball Micah after the girls had gone. \u201cAny luck getting her to the altar?\u201d</p><p>Micah snorted. \u201cI\u2019m trying. Believe me. I\u2019m a persistent man. It\u2019ll happen soon.\u201d</p><p>Pop grunted. \u201cThe problem with men today is they\u2019re too busy being politically correct. You ought to just snatch her up and haul her to a priest. Or to Vegas like Gray did with Faith. If you wait around for a woman to make up her mind, you\u2019ll be old and impotent by the time your wedding night gets here.\u201d</p><p>Connor cracked up. \u201cThis might explain why you\u2019ve now embraced bachelorhood indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Pop shook his finger at Connor and Micah. \u201cMark my words. I\u2019m right. Look at what happened when Nathan stopped pussyfooting around Julie. He went over to where she was and hauled her out over his shoulder. Then he told her how it was going to be and voil\u00e0. Now they\u2019re married. He\u2019s happy. She\u2019s happy. End of story. Not like Micah over here who mopes around like a friggin\u2019 kicked puppy because he can\u2019t convince the woman he loves that he really loves her and really wants to marry her. Jesus has to be crying up there somewhere. Or laughing hysterically. I can\u2019t figure out which one.\u201d</p><p>Micah\u2019s lips curled into a snarl. \u201cEnough already, Pop. You know I fucked up with her. I can\u2019t just run over her and make her do what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you could damn well put your foot down and make her believe how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen try harder,\u201d Pop grumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to be like some couples\u2019 retreat around here. It\u2019s damn nauseating.\u201d</p><p>Connor knew when a good time to escape was. Right now, when Pop was busy bitching about something else. Maybe by the time he remembered what he wanted Connor to do, the record company would have given up and hired someone else.</p><p>He was almost to the door. One more step and he would have made it home free.</p><p>\u201cYour airline ticket is on your desk,\u201d Pop called. \u201cYou fly out tomorrow morning. Now go home and pack a suitcase.\u201d</p><p>Fuck a goddamn duck.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>The arena reverberated with frantic music and a rainbow of cascading lights. Connor stood at the top of the stands, staring over the railing at the stage below. His ears were going to explode at any second, and he felt so dizzy from the rapid staccato of flashing lasers that he gripped the cool metal bar in front of him to steady himself.</p><p>With his free hand, he reached back and massaged a kink out of his neck. He\u2019d been tense ever since this circus had started. How in the hell could anyone stand this cacophony on a regular basis? This wasn\u2019t his type of music. How could it be anyone\u2019s? How the hell did anyone even understand the screeching, if they could even hear it over the band? He\u2019d much rather throw down with some Montgomery Gentry or Jason Aldean if he was going to subject himself to a concert.</p><p>Finally, the screeching stopped. There was a god.</p><p>Connor glanced back at the stage to see Lyric Jones saunter back out after her last hasty departure. Costume change, though why she bothered with this one, he wasn\u2019t sure. He didn\u2019t even have to be close to the stage to know she was barely wearing anything at all.</p><p>He glanced to the side where the record executives from Cosmic Records were taking in the show with him. They\u2019d met his plane and drove him out to the arena in a limo. The whole thing was ridiculous, and he was still cursing the fact that he\u2019d gotten saddled with flying out to talk to the parties involved.</p><p>As the music assaulted his ears again, he turned his attention back to the stage, just in time to see another scantily clad woman stroll toward Lyric. Best he could make out, the words to the song sounded something like \u201cGirl Love.\u201d He snorted.</p><p>The two women faced each other as Lyric sang. They were a study in contrast, probably well coordinated. Lyric was small and blackhaired, if you didn\u2019t count the god-awful pink streak in it. The other woman was tall, luscious and blond, with a set of tits that had to be bought and paid for. He didn\u2019t need binoculars to see that.</p><p>Then they moved closer, undulating their bodies in a suggestive manner. The crowd went nuts as the women pressed against each other. Lyric held the mic to her chest as she swayed in the other woman\u2019s arms. As the song continued, Lyric turned and nestled her ass right into the blond woman\u2019s crotch. The two continued their little bump and grind as the crowd roared their approval. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why couldn\u2019t Micah have taken this job? This would be right up his alley. Watching two women go at it? Micah would be drooling like a rabid pit bull. Of course, Angelina might kick some serious ass over it, but still. All Connor wanted was a good stiff drink and a bottle of ibuprofen.</p><p>By the time the song was winding down, the two women were meshed tighter than a snag in a fishing line. When the music died, Lyric let the mic fall and got into a lip-lock with the blonde that a fire hose wouldn\u2019t have separated.</p><p>There was no way he could do this. Everything about the woman got on his last nerve, and he hadn\u2019t even met her yet. He didn\u2019t have to. It was all there for everyone to see. The record executives would be pissed, and Pop probably wouldn\u2019t be too happy, but if he wanted the gig so bad, he could either do it himself or make Nathan or Micah do it. Their women would just have to get over it. Connor would take good care of the girls while Nathan and Micah were gone. That image made him grin.</p><p>He was ready to turn around and walk out when a softer, melodious tone poured into the arena. It made him pause for a brief second and look back at the stage. Lyric stood in the middle, a single spotlight focused on her. The rest of the stage was blacked out.</p> <p>Her eyes were closed, and he got the crazy image in his head that she looked vulnerable. Then she opened her mouth, and for the first time that night, he could clearly hear her voice. It poured out of her like smooth, sweet honey. It crawled right over his skin and sent a shiver down his spine.</p><p>He stared, entranced by the image of her alone, her haunting, beautiful voice filling every nook and cranny of the packed house. He was struck by the sadness he felt radiating from her. More than sadness, it was pain.</p><p>His hands gripped the railing as he moved closer, his attention focused entirely on the woman singing. It wasn\u2019t one of those insipid, self-reflection songs. It was about going home. He could feel the ache in her voice. It made him ache. Hell, it made him want to go home.</p><p>Across the arena, cigarette lighters flared and bobbed as hands shot into the air holding them. They waved in time as she stood, so still, face turned to the ceiling. He imagined her eyes were closed as the last of the words spilled from her lips.</p><p>The music faded, and for a moment, silence descended on the crowd. Then shrill whistles rent the air, followed by raucous cheers.</p> <p>Lyric stepped back and waved to the crowd. She bowed once and hurried off the stage.</p><p>The record executives shifted beside him, and Connor looked over to see them staring at him.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go meet our girl?\u201d Phillip Armstrong asked.</p><p>Connor nodded, forgetting for a moment that all he really wanted to do was get the hell out while the getting was good. With a resigned sigh, he followed the suits to the backstage area.</p><p>Security, if you could call it that, was minimal. Fans swarmed the corridor, pushing, shoving and screaming. When a beefed-up, musclebound security guard standing outside the backstage door looked up and saw them coming, he snapped to attention and started shoving rabid fans to the side so they could pass.</p><p>When the door opened, Connor was pushed forward as the fans tried to rush past him. He stumbled inside, a string of obscenities dying to blow past his lips. He managed to keep his cool. Barely.</p> <p>Phillip and his sidekick, Barry, smoothed their suits and looked questioningly at Connor. Connor\u2019s lips thinned but he gritted his teeth and kept his expression neutral.</p><p>They motioned him toward a slightly less congested area and the two men accepted a drink from a gangly boy who couldn\u2019t be more than a teenager. When they offered Connor a glass, he shook his head. Not that the idea of a pint of vodka wasn\u2019t vastly appealing, but at this point, if he started drinking, he wasn\u2019t going to stop.</p><p>He peered around the room, which, after more consideration, was much larger than he\u2019d first thought. It was just crowded. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and tried not to look as bored and as uncomfortable as he felt.</p><p>A few seconds later, the door burst open and Lyric stumbled in, a wide grin on her face. Two men he could only assume were her bodyguards flanked her. He arched one eyebrow as the bodyguards proceeded to get very up close and personal as they staggered in Connor\u2019s direction.</p><p>As one hand closed around her breast, she swatted playfully, then smiled up at the bodyguard with a \u201cnot now, later\u201d look.</p><p>Another man stepped in front of Lyric, halting her progress toward the record execs. She frowned and her eyes narrowed but just as quickly her expression became neutral as she stared up at the guy.</p><p>\u201cYou looked and sounded like shit out there, Lyric. What the hell is your problem?\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s brows drew together and he found himself frowning at the blatant disrespect in the other man\u2019s tone. Whoever the guy was, he wasn\u2019t worried about the repercussions of his outburst. Connor glanced over at Lyric, fully expecting her to tear the guy a new asshole, but he couldn\u2019t read a thing on her face or in her eyes. It was like she wasn\u2019t even there anymore.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to use this time off to get your act together,\u201d the guy continued. \u201cGet a massage. Get laid. Whatever it takes, but don\u2019t show up in Houston sounding like a screechy has-been.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. This was starting to get entertaining.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the guy?\u201d Connor asked Phillip casually.</p><p>\u201cHer manager, Paul.\u201d</p><p>Connor couldn\u2019t read any disapproval in Phillip\u2019s tone. Maybe Paul was saying what everyone else was thinking. But then Connor caught the look in Phillip\u2019s eyes. He looked murderous.</p><p>\u201cHe always talk to her like that?\u201d</p><p>Phillip gave a short nod. \u201cYeah. Look, you\u2019re going to have to deal with him. There\u2019s nothing I can do about that. But you work for me. Not that little prick. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>The men went silent as Lyric finally pushed by her manager and then she came up short when she laid eyes on Connor. Connor took his time acknowledging her presence. The problem was, the woman was clearly used to having people come to attention when she entered a room. Hell would freeze over before he\u2019d be one of them.</p><p>When he finally lifted his gaze to meet hers, he saw crystal blue eyes staring back at him with the same disinterest he knew had to be reflected in his gaze. She adopted a bored look as her two minions continued pawing at her.</p><p>His gaze moved purposefully to her hair. Jet-black strands shot in different directions and a neon pink streak of color ran from the top of her scalp down the side of her head on the left side.</p><p>\u201cNice hair,\u201d he said.</p><p>Amusement glimmered for a moment in her eyes before she looked pointedly at Phillip and Barry.</p><p>Phillip stepped forward, a broad, indulgent smile on his face, and why should he be anything else when this chick was likely making him millions?</p><p>\u201cLyric, I\u2019d like you to meet Connor Malone. He\u2019s here from Malone and Sons Security. We\u2019re talking to him about your upcoming stop in Houston.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a challenging stare and didn\u2019t extend her hand, but then, neither did he.</p><p>Finally she broke and looked over at Phillip. \u201cYou know my feelings on this. Why is he here?\u201d</p><p>Connor almost smiled. Apparently she wasn\u2019t any happier about the whole thing than he was. She crossed her arms over her chest, which only served to plump her small breasts upward. The swells peeked over the top of her corset and the pale skin glowed in the harsh light. Soft. A direct contrast to her demeanor.</p><p>Barry frowned and stepped forward. \u201cNow, Lyric, we\u2019ve discussed this. Malone and Sons comes highly recommended. You don\u2019t have nearly enough security, and after the last few months, you of all people should see that you need more.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to shove one of the bodyguards, who was nuzzling at her neck. Instead of being rebuffed, he settled back, a lazy smile on his face that suggested he\u2019d be satisfied later.</p><p>If these were the morons charged with her safety, it was no wonder her record label was screaming for more. Their only concern seemed to be how quickly they could get into her pants.</p><p>Her gaze found his again, and her eyes narrowed. He looked calmly back at her, refusing to be the one who backed down. He didn\u2019t much care if she could read his disgust. It was doubtful he could hide it anyway. No one was that good an actor.</p><p>His skin started prickling in peculiar awareness. The back of his neck itched something fierce, but he wouldn\u2019t give an inch in this silent tug-of-war.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>To his utter horror, he went hard.</p><p>He smiled then. A lazy, \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d grin. It was either that or groan at his growing discomfort, and he\u2019d eat nails before allowing her to know how affected he was by her. \u201cThe feeling, Ms. Jones, is entirely mutual.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, then slipped an arm around one of the giants at her side, who immediately leaned down to kiss her cheek. The other huddled in close on her other side and she slanted a sly grin up at him.</p><p>She may as well have worn a sign that said \u201cI\u2019m fucking both of them\u201d for all the discretion she exercised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d invite you to join us, Mr. Malone, but somehow you seem too uptight.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and prayed she couldn\u2019t see his erection, because . . . damn. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a bit choosier than you are when it comes to my bed partners.\u201d</p><p>Color tinged her cheeks and then she turned away, both guards immediately surrounding her as she walked to the door.</p><p>Phillip cleared his throat next to Connor. Connor glanced up.</p><p>\u201cLyric is, uhm, shall we say a little difficult?\u201d Phillip began.</p><p>Connor was beginning to think it was her standard description. He held up his hand. \u201cSave it. You don\u2019t have enough money to make me take this job. I\u2019d have to be fucking insane.\u201d</p><p>He was already goddamn insane because from the moment she said she didn\u2019t like him, his cock had roared to life and said, Come get me.</p><p>The very last thing he wanted was a bratty pop star around him twenty-four/seven, one who gave him a hard-on every time she argued with him.</p><p>He\u2019d be nothing but a walking erection.</p><p>Lyric walked into her suite and fended off Trent when he went for her top. Surprise flashed in his eyes when she instead headed for the minibar to pour herself a glass of water.</p><p>R.J. sidled over to her and put an arm around her shoulders. \u201cSomething wrong, Lyric?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged him off, unable to explain why she could suddenly not bear for either of them to touch her.</p><p>\u201cJust not in the mood,\u201d she said darkly.</p><p>Trent chuckled. \u201cBut, sugar, you\u2019re always in the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cI just want to be . . . alone. Okay?\u201d</p><p>The two men looked at each other in shock, then stared back at her as if she\u2019d lost her mind. And maybe she had. Alone? What was she thinking? She didn\u2019t do alone. Ever. The only thing worse than being alone was being one-on-one with someone. She didn\u2019t like either option and surrounded herself with people even in sleep.</p><p>But tonight? Yeah, she could do alone. Connor Malone\u2019s disapproving stare had rattled her. Way more than she\u2019d ever admit aloud. She got plenty of that on a regular basis. Thrived on it, even. She didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what people thought of her and had made it her mission in life to give the public as much ammunition as possible. So why did one condescending asshole get under her skin so badly?</p><p>She shook her head but couldn\u2019t get his sneer out of her mind. He made her uncomfortable. As if he could see right past her shields, all her secrets and all her fears. It was as if he\u2019d seen her naked and vulnerable and hadn\u2019t been at all impressed. But then, why should he be?</p><p>\u201cLyric, are you all right?\u201d R.J. interrupted. She could hear the worry in his voice, but at the moment she didn\u2019t care and didn\u2019t have the mental energy necessary to reassure him.</p><p>She waved dismissively at them and turned away. It was a clear signal for them to leave, and they\u2019d be fools to ignore it. They might be intimate with her, but sex was all they offered. They weren\u2019t her friends. Weren\u2019t her confidants. She didn\u2019t have those.</p><p>When she heard the door open and close, she turned back to survey the empty suite. Cold panic clawed at her throat and she took several long, steadying breaths. Sweat that had nothing to do with her exhaustive performance beaded on her forehead, and she could feel nausea well in her throat.</p><p>She gazed around, absorbing the loneliness that surrounded her like fog. It seeped into her skin. Wrapped around her bones until she was paralyzed by its grip.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. Gripped her arms with her fingers and then rubbed up and down to assuage the coldness that emanated from the inside out.</p><p>Connor Malone had looked inside her. He\u2019d looked past the flashy, brassy veneer and stared coldly at her. Disapproving. She\u2019d felt stripped bare before him and it pissed her off. He was nobody to her. Just some flunky that her record label wanted to hire to babysit her. Fuck that.</p><p>They wanted someone to rein her in, and that cold bastard would probably delight in doing just that. Over her dead body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grabbed on to the anger, harnessed it like someone desperate to ride the wind. The alternative was fear.</p><p>A knock sounded at her door and she flew to open it, relief rocketing through her system. She yanked it open to see Phillip and Barry standing there in their smarmy executive clothing, but in that moment, she was so relieved to see them, she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cLyric, are we disturbing you?\u201d Phillip asked.</p><p>She shook her head and opened the door wider. \u201cCome in. Can I get you a drink?\u201d</p> <p>They walked inside and looked around, surprised, she knew, to find her alone. Phillip shrugged out of his expensive coat and tossed it over the back of the couch. \u201cWe need to talk, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>She bristled at his tone and donned her best belligerent sneer. \u201cYou can talk. I don\u2019t have to listen.\u201d</p><p>Barry, who didn\u2019t do confrontation very well, looked as though he wanted to be anywhere but here. Which was fine because she wasn\u2019t too crazy about here either.</p><p>\u201cYou need Connor Malone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anybody,\u201d she said icily.</p> <p>\u201cYou need him,\u201d Phillip said firmly. \u201cI\u2019ve let things go on as long as I\u2019m going to. You\u2019re in breach of contract and I\u2019ve let it go. Until now. Connor Malone basically told me to fuck off and headed back to Houston. You\u2019re going to go there and do whatever it takes to make him reconsider.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cI\u2019m not giving you a choice, Lyric. You\u2019ll do this or you\u2019ll be out on your ass, and trust me, even as big as you are, I don\u2019t see another record label lining up to pick you up with all the shit you\u2019ve pulled.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me, Phillip.\u201d</p><p>His expression softened just a bit, but determination still glinted in his eyes. \u201cThings can\u2019t go on as they are, Lyric. You\u2019ve been lucky, but sooner or later, your luck is going to run out. We need Connor Malone to buy us some time to hire more security whether you like it or not. He\u2019s not any happier over the arrangement than you are. I\u2019ve put in a call to his boss, who\u2019s going to lean on him. I want your ass in Houston to reinforce the issue. You\u2019ll be nice. You\u2019ll be accommodating. You\u2019ll do what it takes to make him agree to the job. And then,\u201d he said, putting up a finger, \u201cyou\u2019re going to behave yourself.\u201d</p><p>She set her jaw until her teeth ached. She opened her mouth to argue but he shut her down with one swift shake of his head.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak. You\u2019ll fly out after the show this weekend. That\u2019ll give him and you a few days to cool off.\u201d</p><p>He snapped his fingers at Barry and the two of them walked out of her room, closing the door with a sharp bang. She sank onto the couch like a deflated balloon.</p><p>She ran agitated fingers through her hair, pulling on the ends in repetition. Connor Malone was an arrogant ass. But more than that, he frightened her. And that pissed her off.</p><p>He was smug and too damn good-looking. Her brow wrinkled in irritation. Good-looking? Yeah, he was. It might get her goat to admit it, but he was exactly the sort of man she was attracted to. Tall. Strong and silent. And blond. Muddy blond with different tones and shades, like he spent a lot of time out in the sun. He wasn\u2019t pretty blond, but rugged, yummy blond. She had a weakness for blonds. She didn\u2019t normally go for the good guy, military-type cut, but on him it looked good. It looked damn good. Just added to his badass appearance.</p><p>He had those piercing green eyes that saw way too much. He cut through the layers at supersonic speed. Maybe he was some goddamn superhero. She laughed. Maybe he was supposed to be her goddamn superhero.</p><p>Yeah, she could have taken him back to her room if not for the fact they loathed each other on sight. She couldn\u2019t even say she\u2019d had an instant reaction to him. Her dislike had been in self-defense. More of an \u201cI hate him because he hates me\u201d response.</p><p>And now Phillip wanted her to fly to Houston and grovel? Jesus. She didn\u2019t grovel. Ever. The mere thought nearly choked her.</p><p>Why did she need Connor fucking Malone? She didn\u2019t need goddamn anyone, and that was the way she liked it. Connor could take his self-righteous prig self and take a long walk off a short pier.</p> <p>She leaned farther back on the couch and propped her feet on the coffee table. She shouldn\u2019t have sent Trent and R.J. away. They could be having hot, sweaty sex right now and she could slip into oblivion. Instead she was mad as hell because if she wanted to stay employed, she was going to have to go play nice with some good old boy without a sense of humor.</p><p>For a moment she was tempted to call Trent and R.J. back. They\u2019d be more than happy to climb into bed with her, and then she wouldn\u2019t feel so terribly alone. But try as she might, she couldn\u2019t make the disapproving look on Connor Malone\u2019s face dissolve from her memory. And it pissed her off even more that it had mattered.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Connor stalked into Malone\u2019s with the beginnings of a headache already wracking his brain. His flight from L.A. had been delayed. He\u2019d spent six hours in Dallas, and just when he was ready to say fuck it and hire a damn car and drive the five hours to Houston, his flight had boarded.</p><p>Then, when he\u2019d landed, he had six voice mails, three of them from Pop and another three from Micah, who\u2019d delighted in giving him hell about his meeting with the pop diva. Asshole.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re back,\u201d Faith called from her office as he passed.</p><p>His frown eased into a smile, and he backed up to Faith\u2019s doorway. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m back. Finally. You\u2019re a sight for sore eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard it didn\u2019t go too well,\u201d she said, her green eyes bright with sympathy.</p><p>He gave up the idea of sneaking to his office to blow off some steam and sauntered into Faith\u2019s office, where he slouched in a seat in front of her desk.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. Micah has been regaling you with tales of my torture.\u201d</p><p>Mirth glistened in her eyes as she tried to stifle her laughter. \u201cWell, uhm, yes. I\u2019m afraid he has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackass,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>\u201cWas it that bad?\u201d</p><p>Connor sighed. He loved his sister dearly, and he had no intention of bitching at her for the better part of an hour. So he ignored the question. \u201cWhere\u2019s Gray and Nathan?\u201d</p><p>She accepted the change in subject with her usual good nature, but her eyes gleamed speculatively as if to say she\u2019d get the dirt later. Yeah, she was sweet, but she could also be downright evil.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re out on a job. Pop should be in shortly, and, to be honest, I have no idea where Micah is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvoiding Pop?\u201d she asked, her lips quivering with another smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pointless. The old coot would just show up at my apartment.\u201d</p><p>Faith did laugh then. \u201cYes, he would. He\u2019s been muttering under his breath about insubordination and hardheaded employees ever since the record execs called to tell him you\u2019d walked.\u201d</p><p>Connor rolled his eyes. \u201cIf he wants the job so damn bad, he can send Micah. He\u2019d totally dig the chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s . . . she\u2019s . . . I don\u2019t have words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, Connor Malone speechless. And over a woman. Never thought I\u2019d see it.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. She\u2019s . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t even finish. Faith burst into laughter, her long blond hair shaking over her shoulders. She reached up to wipe tears from the corners of her eyes and kept on laughing.</p><p>He rolled his eyes heavenward and wondered if asking for a sudden lightning bolt would be asking for too much.</p><p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>Connor flinched when Pop\u2019s raspy voice filled the room. \u201cHere I am,\u201d he muttered, not turning around in his chair.</p><p>Pop ambled up and smiled at Faith. \u201cYour husband said to tell you that he\u2019s going to be running late and for you not to wait on him.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks pinkened, and a soft smile spread over her features. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll head out, then.\u201d</p><p>Traitor, Connor mouthed at her.</p><p>She winked, then collected her purse and headed for the door.</p><p>Pop turned his hard stare on Connor. \u201cNow. You.\u201d</p><p>Connor held up his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it, Pop.\u201d</p><p>Pop grunted. \u201cWell, you\u2019re going to hear it.\u201d He leaned against Faith\u2019s desk and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t care what happened in L.A. This job is a personal favor to a friend. I told him we\u2019d do it, and I can\u2019t spare one of the others to do it. You\u2019re it.\u201d</p><p>Connor set his teeth together. \u201cJust because they all had the poor sense to get all fucked-up over a woman and think they need to all be married does not mean that I get every shitty job that crosses your desk now.\u201d</p><p>Pop snorted. \u201cNo sense getting your panties in a wad. You\u2019re acting as bad as that pop star you don\u2019t want to babysit.\u201d</p><p>Connor scowled but Pop held up his hand. \u201cI\u2019m asking as a favor.\u201d</p><p>Connor groaned.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s flying in this Friday. You\u2019re meeting her for dinner Friday night and then she\u2019s coming in to the office on Saturday for a meeting with you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I meeting her for dinner?\u201d Connor demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause the two of you are obviously off on the wrong foot, and you need to kiss and make up if we have a hope of making this work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Pop. You go out to dinner with her. I\u2019ll make the Saturday meeting, but I have no desire to spend five minutes with her alone, much less an entire dinner.\u201d</p><p>Pop stared at him for a long moment. \u201cAre you refusing the job?\u201d</p><p>Connor swore long and hard. \u201cNo, I\u2019m damn well not turning down the job. You\u2019ve made it personal by asking a favor and you know damn well I\u2019m not going to tell you no. But I don\u2019t have to like it.\u201d</p><p>Pop grinned. Cagey old bastard. \u201cPhillip Armstrong will be e-mailing all the pertinent information as well as what they want from us as far as security. Tomorrow afternoon I want you to sit in on the conference call that he and Barry Kennedy will be heading up. Then you and I will hash out a game plan so that when she arrives on Friday, you two can discuss what will be done during her time in Houston. I left a detailed file on her on your desk. It will give you a very good idea of what this job will entail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>Pop straightened and started for the door. Grudgingly, Connor stood and turned around to follow. Pop paused in the doorway and faced Connor. The old coot was working to keep a straight face. \u201cThink of it this way. You\u2019ve been bitching about wanting to take vacation for a long time now. Now you get two whole weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Connor growled.</p><p>Connor sat at the bar in Cattleman\u2019s, sipping a cold beer as he waited for Lyric Jones to make an appearance. He checked his watch again, irritated that she was fifteen minutes late.</p><p>Pop was disgruntled that he hadn\u2019t picked a classier spot, but then, from what he\u2019d seen, Lyric wasn\u2019t the epitome of class, and if he was going to be forced to endure this meeting, then she could damn well come to him on his turf.</p><p>He\u2019d spent the better part of yesterday reading the notes that Pop had compiled. Micah had even made an appearance, only too happy to shove the latest tabloid under Connor\u2019s nose with a smug, shit-eating grin. How one woman could cause so much trouble and garner so much press was beyond him.</p><p>His trip to the grocery store to get a steak and a six-pack of beer had been soured when he noticed that every single magazine at the checkout had some tale of her latest antics or publicity stunt plastered over the covers.</p><p>It would seem that nothing the woman did was shielded from the world, and worse, she seemed perfectly okay with that.</p><p>He downed the last of his brew and shoved the empty bottle across the bar. As he glanced sideways, he saw her come in. To his surprise, she wasn\u2019t accompanied by her bodyguards. Not very smart.</p><p>She was dressed in tight-fitting jeans and a regular white T-shirt. There wasn\u2019t a hint of pink in her hair and not a spot of makeup dotted her face. She looked remarkably clean-cut and wholesome. Good grief.</p><p>Her fingers were shoved into her jeans pockets, and she looked around warily. Unease billowed off her body in a cloud. She looked uncertain, and again he was struck by the odd vulnerability he had glimpsed during her last number at the concert. Clearly he was losing his mind.</p><p>Finally her gaze locked on to his and he lifted his hand in greeting. Her eyes glazed over, and it was as if she locked the attitude in place. The cockiness was back in spades.</p><p>She twisted her lips and sauntered over, throwing her bag over the bar stool as she slid up to the bar beside him.</p><p>\u201cNice place,\u201d she drawled.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d He held up a finger and motioned to the barkeep. \u201cDrink?\u201d he asked her when the bartender walked over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeer and a water,\u201d Connor ordered.</p><p>She leaned forward and rested her elbows on the scarred wood of the bar. As she wiggled her body to move closer so she could lean, he caught a whiff of her perfume. To his surprise it smelled soft, nice even. He would have expected something strong and overpowering. Like her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said as she made a V with her fingers and pressed them to her lips. \u201cHere we are.\u201d</p> <p>Connor nodded.</p><p>She sighed and turned sideways to look at him. \u201cLook, let\u2019s at least be honest. I don\u2019t like you. You don\u2019t like me. Neither of us wants to be here and you don\u2019t want to babysit me any more than I want a goddamn nanny.\u201d</p><p>Despite himself, he chuckled. He couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cNot bothering to deny it, are you?\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNope. Don\u2019t see the point in blowing smoke up your ass.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed again. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you weren\u2019t given any more choice than I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a man of many words, are you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou pretty much said it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s obvious that we aren\u2019t going to be best friends forever, so why don\u2019t we sit here for a few minutes, you can have a beer or two, and then we can leave and pretend we played nice?\u201d</p><p>Connor smiled and, though it pained him, he found himself not quite hating the thought of spending a few more minutes with her.</p> <p>\u201cI can play nice for a few minutes,\u201d he conceded.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou mean if we ignore each other.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. He glanced over her again, noting the absent flash and glitz. \u201cYou look . . . different.\u201d</p><p>She cast him a baleful stare. \u201cJust in case you think that the pink hair and flashy clothes are just part of the stage show and that underneath I\u2019m this really nice, boring girl, let me dissuade you of that notion. I just didn\u2019t want to get my ass kicked by coming into a place like this in anything but good-ole-boy gear.\u201d</p><p>Connor was fascinated by the snarl on her lips. It almost looked cute. Then he shook his head. She had as much personality as a pit bull and the pit bull was probably friendlier.</p><p>She spread her hands and turned up her palms in a supreme \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d gesture. \u201cWhat you see is what you get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you trying to convince? Me or yourself?\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed over her face and her eyes narrowed. He could get off on pissing her off. She rose to the bait so easily.</p> <p>\u201cJust tell me what it is you\u2019re supposed to do for me so we can get this over with,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Connor studied her for a moment, her stiff posture, her obvious discomfort being here with him. She shouldn\u2019t have come alone, especially not in light of the details he\u2019d gotten from Phillip.</p><p>\u201cHow bad has it been?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>She looked up, her blue eyes flashing in surprise. Then she shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ve talked to Phillip and Barry, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t been with you,\u201d Connor pointed out. \u201cA few visits on the road and phone calls from their office don\u2019t count. Not with me. If I\u2019m going to be responsible for your safety, then I need to know exactly what I\u2019m dealing with.\u201d</p><p>For a moment it seemed her shell cracked, and he could see the lines of fatigue grooved around her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as they make it out to be. I bring a lot of it on myself.\u201d She lifted one small shoulder in a gesture of indifference. \u201cI never wanted to surround myself so tightly with security that the public couldn\u2019t get in. But now . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d Connor guessed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting. There have been a few threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Phillip wants to crack down, not make you so accessible.\u201d</p><p>Lyric nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me. How hard is my job going to be?\u201d</p><p>A small smile curved the corners of her mouth upward. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you. I\u2019m used to doing things my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to get along for this to work, but you do have to listen to what I tell you. Every word. And you have to follow directions.\u201d</p><p>She made a rude noise under her breath. \u201cJust stay out of my way as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>She glanced sideways and appraised him with a seeking stare. \u201cI think I like that you\u2019re not kissing my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your ass I want to kiss.\u201d</p><p>The statement stunned both of them. Holy fuck, had he just said that? She blinked in surprise and then visibly retreated. The cocky, self-assured veneer was back, but for a moment, he\u2019d seen something in her gaze that spoke to him. Longing.</p><p>With a smirk, she leaned forward and planted her lips solidly on his. Heat scorched a path from his mouth straight to his dick and flayed open every nerve ending along the way. She licked over his lips as if challenging him to open to her, but before he could, she pulled away and slid off the bar stool.</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then.\u201d She gave him a flip wave and strode out of the bar.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>After an early morning jog, Connor showered and headed into Malone\u2019s, hoping for some time to go over the file on Lyric Jones before everyone else showed up for this farce of a meeting. He should have known that Pop would already be in.</p><p>When Connor let himself into the office, he heard voices from the conference room and frowned. Pop wasn\u2019t the only one in way ahead of time.</p><p>He went to the doorway to peer in and saw Phillip Armstrong having coffee with Pop. Pop looked up and motioned Connor in.</p><p>\u201cGlad you came in early, son. Phillip has something he wants to discuss with you before Lyric arrives.\u201d</p><p>Barely able to control his sigh, Connor pulled out one of the chairs and took a seat across from the two men.</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate you rethinking this,\u201d Phillip said. \u201cWilliam tells me you\u2019re well suited for this job, and the truth is, I need someone I can trust.\u201d</p><p>Connor shot Pop a glare. Well suited? What qualified him to be a babysitter slash bodyguard? His years in the army didn\u2019t exactly prepare him to hover over a spoiled diva.</p><p>Pop glared back and Connor refocused his attention on Phillip.</p><p>\u201cThe danger to Lyric is more specific,\u201d Phillip admitted.</p><p>And Connor hadn\u2019t thought this could get worse. \u201cCare to explain what you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve received what we believe to be credible threats. I pay a team a hell of a lot of money to discern whether a threat is merely someone mouthing off and wanting attention or whether it\u2019s something we need to pursue.</p><p>\u201cMostly it\u2019s the former and we nip it in the bud. People aren\u2019t terribly smart and the trail back to them is usually easy to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting threats you can\u2019t trace back to an identifiable source.\u201d</p><p>Phillip nodded. \u201cExactly. What concerns me is that whoever is doing them is delivering them in person. It started five shows ago and he\u2019s followed her from city to city.\u201d</p><p>Connor raised an eyebrow. \u201cHe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe assume it\u2019s a he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn obsessed fan?\u201d</p><p>Phillip frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Typically when you have some fan who\u2019s obsessed or fancies themselves in love with a star, there\u2019s a courting stage and then anger because their feelings aren\u2019t acknowledged or reciprocated. This . . . this is just plain weird and unsettling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always leaves a note. Where varies. Once, it was taped to the bus. Once, it was on her guitar case. Another time it was in her dressing room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you fired her security,\u201d Connor muttered. \u201cNo one should be getting that close to her.\u201d</p><p>Phillip nodded. \u201cOne of the many reasons. I also couldn\u2019t be certain it wasn\u2019t one of them. I got rid of everyone I had the power to fire. Unfortunately, Pete and Repete, her two pet bodyguards, are hers. She hired them. But I want you to keep an eye on them. I don\u2019t trust them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyric didn\u2019t mention any of this when we met last night,\u201d Connor said. \u201cShe mentioned that it had gotten harder to keep a distance from the fans and that she\u2019d made a mistake in making herself too available.\u201d</p><p>Phillip shifted uncomfortably in his chair and glanced over at Pop. Pop grunted. \u201cYou may as well tell him. You should have told us all this from the beginning. Last thing he needs is to go in blind.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. What now?</p><p>\u201cLyric doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Phillip said. \u201cI\u2019ve kept a tight lid on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to say that again?\u201d Connor asked.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Connor shook his head in disbelief. Pop was right about one thing. People in show business had no common sense.</p><p>\u201cWhat could you possibly hope to gain by keeping this from her? She has to be careful, which means she has to be aware of the potential threat to her. She can\u2019t do that if no one tells her that some creep is stalking her. I don\u2019t understand why you haven\u2019t canceled her show or at least her appearance at the music store. Are you just trying to get her killed?\u201d</p><p>Phillip\u2019s lips pressed together. Connor hadn\u2019t come out and said, You\u2019re a dumbass, but his tone certainly implied it. Phillip didn\u2019t look happy, but if the shoe fit . . .</p><p>\u201cLyric is her own worst enemy at times,\u201d Phillip said. \u201cIf she knew some weirdo was leaving notes for her, there\u2019s no telling what she\u2019d do. She\u2019s not the type to be cautious and play it safe. And we can\u2019t go around canceling events every time some whack job starts threatening her. If we did that, we\u2019d be out of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me, whether there\u2019s a threat or not, she does whatever the hell she wants and damn the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phillip said wearily. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if she\u2019s doing it either way, it makes no sense not to tell her what\u2019s going on. At least then she might adopt a little self-preservation. Especially if you aren\u2019t going to cancel a public appearance that most definitely puts her at risk.\u201d</p><p>Phillip\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cLook, you don\u2019t know Lyric\u2014\u201d</p><p>Connor held up his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know her. I don\u2019t have a desire to get to know her. But if I\u2019m going to take this job, I\u2019m not coddling her, which means I\u2019m going to be straight with her from the start. She\u2019s going to be briefed on everything. And then she\u2019s going to do what I tell her, when I tell her, or I walk. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never going to go for such heavy-handed treatment.\u201d</p><p>Connor shrugged. \u201cIt seems to me you need me a hell of a lot more than I need you. I\u2019d love nothing more than for her to fire me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work for me,\u201d Phillip was quick to say. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess she better get used to a heavy hand. She\u2019s too used to having her ass kissed.\u201d</p><p>Phillip surprised Connor by laughing. \u201cI suppose to you that\u2019s the way it looks. When someone makes your label as much money as she has, you do whatever\u2019s necessary to keep her happy. That\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to make her happy,\u201d Connor said evenly. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>Phillip smiled broadly. \u201cYou know what, son? I think I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m going back to L.A. It might be worth being a fly on the wall for the next two weeks. I\u2019m not sure Lyric\u2019s ever met someone she couldn\u2019t steamroll in two seconds flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now she has.\u201d</p><p>Lyric tapped her finger on the steering wheel of the BMW and glanced over at the GPS guidance system. She was just a block away from the place she was supposed to meet Connor Malone. It was tempting to show up late, just because, but to be honest, she wanted to get the whole thing over with as soon as possible.</p><p>She could have showed up in a limo and made an entrance, but Connor would probably be expecting that\u2014he did seem to expect the worst\u2014and while she\u2019d normally enjoy feeding it to him with a silver spoon, she preferred to be perverse and surprise him.</p><p>How pathetic did it make her that she\u2019d actually spent an inordinate amount of time analyzing what he would expect and therefore go the opposite direction?</p><p>She glanced at her manicured nails as she turned into the parking lot, relieved that she\u2019d gone an entire day without breaking one\u2014a new record.</p><p>Her outfit was hot, again, in a totally-not-what-he\u2019d-be-expecting way. She didn\u2019t really care for the slutty pop rocker look except onstage because, well, it worked there. She loved expensive clothes, or, more important, clothes that looked expensive. She liked they way they felt on her. The way they looked.</p><p>She\u2019d come a long way from Bum Fuck, Mississippi, and it would be a cold day in hell before she\u2019d ever go back. She wouldn\u2019t even do shows there. Not that there were many places to put on a concert the size of hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hell, she wouldn\u2019t even drive through the godforsaken state. She was sure her road crew thought she was nuts because she made them detour around the state when they\u2019d driven from New Orleans to Atlanta.</p><p>She got out of her car and straightened her suede miniskirt. She had on a killer pair of heels. They were total fuck-me shoes and gave her a much-needed three inches in height. She liked looking good. It gave her confidence, especially in situations where she felt at a disadvantage. Not that she\u2019d ever admit such a thing to anyone. Only a moron admitted weakness to her enemies.</p><p>She slipped her shades down over her nose like a shield and entered the building.</p><p>\u201cMs. Jones?\u201d</p> <p>Lyric turned in the direction of the feminine voice to see a blond woman standing in the doorway to the front office.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lyric Jones,\u201d she acknowledged.</p><p>The woman smiled and walked forward, her hand stuck out. \u201cFaith Montgomery. I\u2019m Connor\u2019s sister. They\u2019re waiting for you in the conference room. I\u2019ll show you back.\u201d</p><p>Lyric shook her hand and felt distinctly uncomfortable. Faith struck her as one of those genuine, disgustingly nice people, and Lyric was never sure how to act around them. Nobody was genuine in her world.</p><p>Silently she followed Faith down the hallway. Faith walked through the open door and the room went quiet. All eyes fell on Lyric when she came in behind Faith. Lyric surveyed the room with a frown, noticing quite a few faces she didn\u2019t recognize.</p> <p>\u201cPlease have a seat,\u201d Faith said. \u201cCan I get you some coffee?\u201d</p><p>Lyric shook her head but managed a smile since Faith was being so . . . nice.</p><p>\u201cLyric, glad you made it,\u201d Phillip said as he stood.</p><p>There was surprise in his voice. He\u2019d expected her to be late. A quick glance at Connor told her nothing about what he thought or didn\u2019t think. She wasn\u2019t going to admit that she was disappointed. She\u2019d wanted a reaction of some type. Even if it wasn\u2019t a good one. This seeming indifference he showed toward her irritated her.</p><p>The older man who\u2019d been sitting next to Phillip also stood, and he made his way to where Lyric stood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Pop Malone, Connor\u2019s father,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Ms. Jones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too, Mr. Malone,\u201d she said smoothly as she extended her hand.</p><p>\u201cI want you to meet the rest of my staff,\u201d Pop said as he turned in the direction of the seated men. \u201cYou\u2019ve already met my daughter, Faith. That\u2019s her husband, Gray Montgomery. Next to him is Nathan Tucker and sitting by Connor is Micah Hudson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they going to be my security team?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cTheir women would chew you up and spit you out,\u201d Connor said dryly as he stood.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cThen why are they all here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see me suffer.\u201d</p><p>Color rose in her cheeks. She couldn\u2019t think of a single comeback for that one. She was used to being a veritable circus act. It shouldn\u2019t surprise her that Connor\u2019s coworkers had come to see the train wreck.</p><p>She took a seat at the very end of the table so she\u2019d be as far from the others as possible. To her surprise, Connor moved to the chair next to her.</p> <p>He was way too close and she fidgeted nervously in her seat. He glanced her way once and lifted a brow. Damn, but the man was sexy in a disdainful, you-annoy-me kind of way. She had to be a masochist. It was the only explanation for her bizarre attraction to him. Rejection wasn\u2019t her thing. Neither was hooking up with someone who looked at her like he would dirt on his shoe.</p><p>But the truth was, she\u2019d thought a lot about that kiss. It had kept her up the previous night\u2014that and the fact that she was alone, and she hated being alone.</p><p>There was some serious chemistry between her and Connor</p><p>Malone, and it was a pity, because they could barely stand the sight of each other. He was probably the only man on earth who\u2019d turn her down flat anyway.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to offer your opinion, Ms. Jones?\u201d Connor asked dryly.</p><p>She blinked and realized that the entire table was looking at her, obviously waiting for her response. She faked a yawn, adopted a bored look and studied her nails.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t get much sleep last night.\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s eyes narrowed and she gazed at him with wide eyes, a look she knew to be successful on most men. But then, Connor wasn\u2019t most men. He didn\u2019t look impressed even if the other men at the table looked a little gobsmacked.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re through wasting our time,\u201d Connor began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying for your time, so it\u2019s mine to do with what I want,\u201d she drawled.</p><p>Connor stood and looked down the table at the others. \u201cWould you all excuse us? I believe Ms. Jones and I have things we need to discuss. Privately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>The look he gave her stopped the protest before it could be fully launched. For the first time, she felt herself backing down. The man made her nervous, and that pissed her off. Didn\u2019t just piss her off. It made her furious.</p><p>When everyone had left, Connor turned and planted his palms on the table in front of her. \u201cLet me get something straight. You didn\u2019t hire me. You can\u2019t fire me. You have nothing I want or need. I don\u2019t give a shit if you like me. I don\u2019t particularly like you. It\u2019s my job to keep you safe, and I\u2019m going to do just that. Which means you\u2019re going to listen to everything I tell you.\u201d</p><p>How utterly ridiculous that she flinched when he\u2019d baldly said he didn\u2019t like her. Like that should come as a surprise? Nobody liked her. People tolerated her. They used her. But they didn\u2019t like her. Why should Connor Malone be any different? Why did she want him to be?</p><p>\u201cWhat your idiot of a record label executive hasn\u2019t told you is that they\u2019ve been monitoring threats over your last five shows. Some asshole is leaving you notes in places he shouldn\u2019t have access to.\u201d</p><p>Lyric curled her fingers into fists and stared up at Connor. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I said. They\u2019ve found notes on your bus, in your dressing room, on your guitar case. Whoever\u2019s doing it is getting way too close to you.\u201d</p><p>She forced her hands to relax and then wiped her palms down the soft suede of her skirt. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t trust you not to do something stupid.\u201d</p><p>She blew out her breath in frustration. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cDo they have reason to believe any other way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether or not they thought they knew how I\u2019d react, I had a right to know.\u201d</p><p>Connor nodded. \u201cOn that point we agree, which is why I\u2019m telling you now. Maybe now you\u2019ll see that this isn\u2019t some fucking game. This is your life, and it\u2019s my job to make sure you stay alive. Now, are you going to help me or are you going to do everything you can to make my job harder?\u201d</p><p>Slowly she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhich is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll . . .\u201d She swallowed and then turned her gaze up to meet his once more. \u201cI\u2019ll cooperate. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest and leaned against the edge of the table. \u201cYou\u2019ll do more than try.\u201d</p><p>She held her hands up in surrender. \u201cWhatever. You\u2019re the boss.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and it made him look so arrogant she was tempted to haul him down and kiss him senseless again.</p><p>\u201cGlad you recognize that fact. We\u2019ll get along just fine as long as you remember that little tidbit.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she got to her feet. \u201cAre we finished now?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She reached into her bag for her keys and walked toward the door, unsure of what the hell had just happened. She was a little shell-shocked and off balance. She needed a little time to process the storm that was Connor Malone.</p><p>Connor fell into step behind her but she paid him little attention. She walked into the reception area where the others were all standing around talking. She didn\u2019t miss the way conversation stopped or the way they all stared at her as she went by.</p><p>\u201cBye, Ms. Jones. It was nice meeting you,\u201d Faith called.</p><p>Lyric looked up and smiled, because really, not smiling at the really nice blond woman was like kicking a puppy. You just didn\u2019t do it. And the truth was, there was something about Faith that just made a person a little warm on the inside.</p><p>Clearly Lyric needed a drink to get over that little burst of poetry. She could get drunk and write a song about sunshine and dedicate it to Faith.</p><p>She bit her lip to call back the laughter and offered a wave to everyone as she left the building.</p><p>Ah, freedom. Not that she liked being alone, but somehow, right now it was preferable to being cooped up in a room full of people who made her feel vastly inferior. She was the famous superstar, and yet a group of good ole boys and Miss Sunshine made her feel not good enough.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she reached her car that she realized Connor had followed her out. She frowned as she unlocked her doors. He was taking his job a little too seriously for her liking.</p><p>Determined to ignore him, she slid into the driver\u2019s seat just as he opened the passenger door and got in beside her.</p><p>She paused after she put the key in the ignition and looked questioningly at him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her like she was a moron for asking the obvious. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve been over this. You\u2019re in danger. I\u2019ve been hired to keep you safe. Therefore, for the next two weeks, where you go, I go.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth gaped open. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>He gazed coolly at her. \u201cDoes it look like I\u2019m joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m just going back to my hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope you have a double, because I\u2019m not sleeping on the floor.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Lyric flexed her hands as she navigated the busy streets back to her downtown hotel. Connor rode in silence next to her, his gaze fixed out of his window as if he found her company tedious.</p><p>She frowned. She did not want him in her hotel room. He wouldn\u2019t fit! He was too big. Too overbearing. Maybe she could inquire about an adjoining room and he\u2019d be satisfied with having access. Then if she forgot and locked the door, she could say oops and he wouldn\u2019t be invading her space.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t reserved a suite. Too much empty space with no people to fill it up and make her feel less lonely and . . . panicked. She\u2019d taken a ridiculously small room and then filled it with all the stuff she\u2019d brought with her because it had made her feel like she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>No way she wanted Connor Malone intruding. The mere idea had her breaking out in a cold sweat. She embraced a crowd. But being one-on-one? Especially with someone like Connor?</p><p>God.</p><p>She drove up to the front entrance and the valet opened her door for her. She dropped the keys into his hand and strode around to the revolving doors that led into the lobby.</p><p>Connor was waiting and walked in practically attached to her hip. The man was tall and muscled and he took over her space to the point that with every inhale, his scent was permanently imprinted on her.</p><p>He frowned when she resisted him herding her to the elevator and headed to the front desk instead.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing if they have another room for you,\u201d Lyric muttered. She put on her widest smile when the desk clerk asked if her if he could help.</p><p>Connor put his hand over hers and squeezed. A warning. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no separate room.\u201d</p><p>The clerk raised his eyebrows and glanced between Connor and Lyric with undisguised interest.</p><p>Lyric tried to wrest her hand from his grip but he tightened his fingers over hers.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t room for you,\u201d she hissed. \u201cNot even on the floor! I have a single. It\u2019s barely a shoe box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re only spending tonight here, we can deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my reservations are for two weeks!\u201d</p><p>Connor turned to the clerk and smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s had a change in itinerary. We\u2019ll be checking out in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Before she could utter another word, Connor took her elbow and propelled her toward the elevator. She had to hoof it to keep up with his pace, and the heels she wore weren\u2019t conducive to a footrace. It was hard to look sexy and elegant when she was worried about tripping over her own feet.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Malone,\u201d she huffed when the elevator doors closed. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you were hired to do. You aren\u2019t staying in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe name is Connor. Use it. And get over it. We\u2019re going to be up close and personal for the next two weeks. My advice is to quit bitching and resign yourself to the inevitable.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and bumped her head against the back of the elevator. She knew she sounded petulant and unreasonable, but the idea of him being in her personal space was seriously freaking her out.</p><p>Her breath huffed out in jerky little spurts until her vision blurred and she grew light-headed. She was dimly aware of Connor\u2019s frown and a muttered curse, but then, that shouldn\u2019t surprise her. It seemed it was all he did around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The elevator doors opened but that didn\u2019t relieve the tightness in her chest. She stood helpless against the wall, unable to make her legs cooperate.</p><p>Black spots danced in front of her eyes and the world seemed to get smaller and dimmer with each passing second.</p><p>Connor yanked her from the elevator and she found herself plopped onto one of the leather couches in the small sitting area on her floor.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Lyric. Look at me.\u201d</p> <p>When she didn\u2019t immediately do as he\u2019d demanded, he coaxed her chin upward with gentle fingers. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he said again. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Focus. Now breathe with me. Just like this.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he inhaled deeply and then exhaled in one smooth motion.</p><p>\u201cThink about what you\u2019re doing. Watch me. Do what I do. I won\u2019t let anything hurt you. You can trust me.\u201d</p><p>If she could manage the breath, she\u2019d laugh. Trust him? He had no idea what he was asking. Trust was as foreign to her as the things most people took for granted. Love. Friendship. Companionship.</p><p>His fingers stroked soothingly over her cheek and it was all she could do not to lean into his touch and rub like a cat. It shocked her how good it felt to be comforted, to be touched by someone who didn\u2019t want something from her she wasn\u2019t willing to give.</p> <p>She sighed and closed her eyes as some of the awful pressure in her chest eased. She could literally feel her lungs open up and shudder with relief as fresh air rushed in.</p><p>Her hands shook and her knees were so wobbly she\u2019d never make it down the hall to her room. How humiliating to fall apart all because she was faced with the prospect of sharing her space with Connor Malone. Wouldn\u2019t the tabloids have a field day with this? Superstar suffers panic attack and passes out in hotel elevator.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your room key?\u201d Connor asked quietly.</p><p>Her fingers trembled so much she nearly dumped her clutch on her feet.</p><p>He took the purse, and, after a moment of digging, he flashed the room card. He handed her back the bag. \u201cWe need to get you to your room. Can you make it if I help you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, furious with herself for allowing this to happen. Embarrassed. Gutted for making such an idiot of herself.</p> <p>Gritting her teeth, she clutched at his arm as she rose from the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat room number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the way to the end,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLast one on the left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, take it nice and slow. Hold on to my arm and don\u2019t get in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>With each step, she regained more of her strength and some of the panic abated. By the time they reached her room, her knees had stopped shaking. Connor slid the card into the slot and opened her door. A rush of cool air blasted her in the face and gave her a much-needed shock.</p><p>\u201cChrist, it\u2019s like a meat locker in here,\u201d Connor said as he ushered her inside.</p><p>\u201cI like sleeping in the cold,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cWith the covers up to my ears.\u201d</p><p>Connor sat her on the edge of the bed. \u201cDo you have anything to drink in here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s water in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need something a little stronger than water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cNo matter what you might read about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting alcohol,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cIf anyone will be drinking, it\u2019ll be me. I was thinking more along the lines of something with caffeine in it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaffeine makes me jittery and I don\u2019t sleep well.\u201d</p><p>He went over to the fridge and returned with a bottle of cold water. He opened it and shoved it toward her. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>She sipped at the refreshing liquid and took in several steadying breaths. \u201cI\u2019m fine now. Really. I\u2019m sorry. I feel like an idiot for losing it like that.\u201d</p><p>He sat beside her on the bed and was silent for a long moment. He seemed to be studying her\u2014or the issue\u2014she wasn\u2019t sure which. The idea of him analyzing her made her twitch. Enough shrinks had done that to last her a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you lose it, Lyric?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. She hadn\u2019t expected him to be so . . . blunt. Most people danced around her. The few times she\u2019d ever had a panic attack in front of someone else, they\u2019d pretended it didn\u2019t happen, and she was more than happy to do the same.</p><p>He cocked his head sideways, and she could feel his gaze boring into her. Lifting and peeling back layers that she was helpless to defend against.</p><p>\u201cDoes my being in your room scare you that badly?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Her nostrils flared and it was on the tip of her tongue to deny that anything scared her. But that would be pretty stupid, and Connor Malone wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t like it. I doubt you\u2019ll like it. But I get it. My record label thinks I\u2019m in danger and they hired you to babysit me. I\u2019m not the idiot you think I am. I have no desire to die at the hands of some lunatic. Or be kidnapped and forced to live in a basement somewhere as a sex slave.\u201d</p><p>Connor let out a chuckle. \u201cYou have a vivid imagination. That\u2019s good. The more hideous a fate you can imagine if this guy gets his hands on you, the easier you\u2019ll make my job because you\u2019ll stick like glue to me.\u201d</p><p>She turned so that their gazes met. \u201cI thought you were supposed to stick to me like glue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too. If we stick to each other, then we won\u2019t have to worry, now, will we?\u201d</p><p>Coming from him, in his sexier-than-sin voice, the innocent words sounded like seduction. She\u2019d never been wooed and seduced in her life and damn if he didn\u2019t make her want to be.</p><p>She\u2019d be willing to bet he was one of those rare males who took his time with his lover. Coaxing, pleasuring. Unselfish. She\u2019d bet money he\u2019d give a woman complete and total satisfaction.</p><p>Chill bumps danced down her arms, raising the tiny hairs on her skin. She could feel the heat radiating off him and it made her want to burrow against his broad chest and absorb him.</p><p>What would it be like to lie in his arms? To have him hold her. Nothing else. Just . . . be.</p><p>It was a ridiculous fantasy given the fact she didn\u2019t want to be that close to anyone. The only thing worse than being alone was being one-on-one. Allowing someone to see inside her. To see the truth.</p><p>Connor stood, shaking her from her reverie. \u201cYou were right about this room. It\u2019s barely bigger than a closet. I wouldn\u2019t have thought you\u2019d be caught dead in anything smaller than a suite. You have so much stuff stacked up in here that you can barely take a piss in the toilet.\u201d</p><p>She smiled faintly. \u201cI was supposed to be here for two weeks. I need my stuff. I didn\u2019t bring my tour bus and I don\u2019t have anywhere else to put everything. I gave my crew time off. I\u2019m doing the show with a skeleton band. It\u2019s just a few songs. The rodeo isn\u2019t a full concert and they do the stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bitch to move all this stuff,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>She looked up sharply. \u201cWhy are we moving it? Why did you tell the clerk I was checking out tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are.\u201d</p><p>She raised her hands in exasperation. \u201cBut why? Where am I going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeplace safe. No one but Phillip will know and the only reason he will is because he\u2019s making the arrangements.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut that\u2019s ridiculous. I can\u2019t just fall off the face of the earth. I have things to do.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against a stack of luggage and eyed her. \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Yet. But I\u2019ll need Trent and R.J. You\u2019ll need them too. They\u2019ve been my personal bodyguards since I began touring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBodyguards or fuck-buddies?\u201d</p><p>She flushed and looked away, and then it infuriated her that she allowed him to shame her.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re fucking me, then someone else can hardly hurt me,\u201d she taunted.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re fucking you, they aren\u2019t doing their job,\u201d he said through tight lips. \u201cTheir first and only priority is your safety. If they\u2019re focused on you and the next time they can get in your pants, they aren\u2019t watching what\u2019s going on around them.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to acknowledge that he had a point. Trent and R.J. weren\u2019t around for their security skills. She didn\u2019t even know if they had any prior experience before coming to work for her. They were glorified male prostitutes and the truth of it hit her like a punch to the face.</p><p>She paid them. They slept with her\u2014or at least they used to. She wasn\u2019t about to admit to Connor that she hadn\u2019t had sex with them for the last few shows because it would seem too much like she wanted his approval.</p><p>Oh, it wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d hired them for the purpose of sex, but it had dissolved into that and nothing more, so really what were they if not prostitutes?</p><p>Nausea swirled in her stomach. When had her life become such a sad mess? When had she become so desperate not to be alone that she paid people to surround her? And then anyone who got too close was quickly shoved as far away from her as possible.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fire them. They have a contract,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cThey can have their duties reassigned,\u201d Connor said with a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit whether you pay them or not. But they aren\u2019t going to be trusted with your safety.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, aware of the headache that was intensifying rapidly. She was tired. She hadn\u2019t lied when she\u2019d said she hadn\u2019t slept the night before, and it wasn\u2019t for the reason she\u2019d led Connor to believe.</p><p>She\u2019d lain awake in this very room, like she did so many other nights, afraid of monsters from her past, afraid to turn out the lights because she was alone.</p><p>Giving her crew vacation time had been a necessity. They were as burned out as she was. But right now, she\u2019d sell her soul to have them with her, surrounding her, to lose herself in the noise and chaos of so many people.</p><p>But no, she\u2019d sworn to herself that the next two weeks were going to be a test of her mettle. She was going to step out and face her fears. Even if it killed her.</p><p>Only now, if Connor was telling her the truth, someone might do the job for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really just supposed to step back and let you take over.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question and she didn\u2019t phrase it as such. It was more of a resigned statement that she already knew the answer to.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t even attempt to soothe her and offer platitudes. But then, that would have shocked her, and strangely, it would have disappointed her.</p><p>She swept out her hand to the piles of luggage and boxes. \u201cWhere do you propose to sleep tonight?\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a long moment. \u201cThat depends. If it won\u2019t frighten you, we can sleep on the bed. You under the covers. Me on top of the covers. We can put pillows between us. If that idea scares you, I\u2019ll make do on the floor.\u201d</p><p>She managed a smile although her heart started thudding painfully as adrenaline spiked through her veins. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t do floors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you I\u2019ll make an exception.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t worry about boundaries much, do you? I mean, most people would never dare to push like you have. I can\u2019t decide if you\u2019re really stupid or just plain ballsy.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter as long as I do my job.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the bed, judging how much of it Connor would take up. It was a king bed stuffed into a really small room and Connor was a really big man. He\u2019d need at least half the bed, and then the pillows would take up a fourth, which left her with the remaining fourth.</p><p>Or she could just make him sleep on the floor.</p><p>All she had to do was say the word, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell him she was afraid.</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep on the bed,\u201d she said before she changed her mind.</p><p>\u201cLyric.\u201d</p><p>She looked back up at him and saw something other than scorn or irritation in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and a hundred butterflies were released into her belly.</p><p>He surveyed the room again with a grimace. \u201cI had planned to hole up in your room for the afternoon, but I think we\u2019ll both go crazy if we have to spend too much time here. It\u2019s probably not your speed, but I thought I\u2019d take you over to see some friends. I don\u2019t want you out in public. You\u2019re going to keep an extremely low profile for the next little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my speed?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe get together, have some beer and shoot the shit. You met them all today\u2014or most of them.\u201d</p><p>It actually sounded fun and she felt a twist of jealousy that he had friends\u2014good friends\u2014that he kicked back with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re going to behave. Micah, Gray and Nathan are all very attached. To women I care a lot about. I don\u2019t want you upsetting them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She swallowed the hurt and bit back a scathing remark. Every time she thought Connor might be different, he said something to make her remember that to him she was a spoiled, bratty diva who went through men like most people went through toilet paper.</p><p>She was a job. A job that he obviously didn\u2019t want but for whatever reason had agreed to. She needed to remind herself of that before she did something stupid like care what he thought about her.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Lyric didn\u2019t argue when Connor walked her to the passenger side as the valet brought the car around. After she was in, she laid her head back on the rest and closed her eyes.</p> <p>The car rocked when Connor got in and shut his door.</p><p>\u201cHead still hurt?\u201d Connor asked as they drove away from the hotel.</p><p>She cracked one eye open to look at him. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure it out. You\u2019ve been sensitive to light and sound all afternoon. Have you taken anything for it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p> <p>He made a sound of exasperation. \u201cWhy not? Are you a masochist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to take anything unless it\u2019s necessary,\u201d she defended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say a headache deserves an Excedrin or two. I\u2019ll stop by a drugstore on the way and get you something.\u201d</p><p>Dumbfounded, she watched as he pulled into a CVS and parked at the front entrance. He glanced over with a regretful expression. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t want to get out, but where I go, you go, so you\u2019ll have to come in.\u201d He switched off the engine. \u201cSit tight. I\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>She was used to a certain amount of deference. People tended to fawn over her and kiss her ass. She didn\u2019t have any illusions it was anything personal to her. You could be a complete asshole and be famous and people would still line up to bow and scrape. She wouldn\u2019t lie and say she didn\u2019t enjoy it. Who wouldn\u2019t like being treated like a rock star?</p><p>But Connor\u2019s consideration meant something, and she couldn\u2019t even say why. Maybe it was because he wasn\u2019t the type to give a damn about her fame. It was obvious he wasn\u2019t impressed with her as a person. And yet he did things he didn\u2019t have to do, and it gave her more pleasure than she would have guessed.</p> <p>He opened her door and extended his hand. She slid her fingers into his, enjoying the warmth and strength of his grip. He helped her from the car and held her elbow so she was flush against his body as they walked inside the pharmacy.</p><p>They fit, which was stupid of her to notice or to dwell on. But they fit perfectly. His body shielded hers like it was made to do so.</p><p>Never once did he actually look at her, which was fascinating because she was used to people staring at her and watching her every move. No, Connor looked at everyone else. He sized them up, assessed the potential threat and hurried Lyric toward the back of the store.</p><p>Not that anyone would recognize her. Out of deference to Connor\u2014and because she was too tired for a fight\u2014she\u2019d dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. Her hair was pulled back into a ponytail and she wore no makeup. With a pair of sunglasses to shield her eyes from the sun that made her head pound, she could be anyone and no one.</p><p>Connor stopped in front of the array of pain relievers. \u201cDo you have any drug allergies?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even believe he thought to ask. Was there anything he didn\u2019t think of? She shook her head in response.</p><p>Nodding, he selected the box marked \u201ctension headache,\u201d then touched her arm and herded her toward the checkout.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t figure you out,\u201d she said a few minutes later when they\u2019d gotten back into the car.</p> <p>He opened the box, shook out two pills, then handed her a bottle of water he\u2019d also bought at the checkout. \u201cWhat can\u2019t you figure out? I\u2019m a pretty straightforward guy. We aren\u2019t hard to learn. Women, on the other hand . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, you\u2019re anything but simple. One minute you act like I\u2019m below pond scum, and the next minute you\u2019re nice to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you wanted me to like you.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he had her there. Or so she thought. Did she want him to like her? It was obvious she did from the ridiculous way she acted around him. She hadn\u2019t been this aware of her actions and how they were perceived by others in years. Not since her last stint as a ward of the state where she finally learned that she was just another case number in an unending stack of paperwork.</p><p>Not giving a damn was freeing. If it didn\u2019t matter whom you hurt or whom you offended, then you never felt bad when you did so.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I wanted you to like me,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cJust that you do and then you don\u2019t. Thank you for the headache medicine. It was thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>Connor shrugged. \u201cIt was obvious you were hurting and you didn\u2019t have to be. You need to learn to take better care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at that assertion but let it go. \u201cSo where is it we\u2019re going exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my sister and brother-in-law\u2019s house. They\u2019re having everyone over for beer and barbecue. It\u2019s practically the law down here that you have at least one a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife in the South, huh.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help the disdain or the way her lip curled. She tried to hold it back. Really, she did.</p><p>He lifted a brow as they stopped for a light. \u201cYou have a bit of a drawl. Bet you were born south of the Mason-Dixon.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, aghast. No one had ever commented on an accent. She\u2019d worked damn hard to remove any instance of it in her speech.</p><p>\u201cI do not have a drawl!\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, you do. It\u2019s subtle, but it\u2019s there. More of a lazy lilt to your words than a distinct accent. You definitely have the flavor of the South, though.\u201d</p><p>She was utterly appalled. Her stomach churned and her head throbbed painfully. \u201cWhere do you think I\u2019m from?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I dunno. Like I said, it\u2019s just a hint. You don\u2019t have to look quite so disgusted. We\u2019re not all backwoods hicks, you know.\u201d</p><p>She could still hear the drawn-out, slow drawl in her nightmares. Whispered in her ear. It made her physically ill. For some people, a Southern drawl was like brown sugar. For her it was like nails on a chalkboard.</p><p>\u201cHey, no reason to get uptight. It was just an observation. I\u2019m wrong once or twice a year.\u201d</p><p>She tried to smile at his joke but her face felt too tight. She decided a change in subject was the best course before she did or said something to make an even bigger ass of herself.</p><p>\u201cSo all your friends are married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicah\u2019s not. Not for lack of trying. Angelina is pregnant, and he\u2019d like to get her to the altar before she pops the kid out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her,\u201d Lyric said. \u201cJust because a guy gets you pregnant doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s the right guy to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently he was right to sleep with,\u201d Connor said dryly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like a guy gets a girl pregnant by himself. There\u2019s definitely some cooperation on the egg\u2019s part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh huh-uh. The boy sperm chases down the girl egg and throws himself on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like the girl egg crooks her finger and then when the poor unsuspecting sperm comes near, she sucks him in.\u201d</p><p>Lyric wrinkled her nose. \u201cI think this is perhaps the most unromantic reproduction talk I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>Connor chuckled. \u201cMicah loves Angelina, and she loves him. They\u2019ll get married. She just wants to make sure it\u2019s what he wants.\u201d</p><p>They pulled into a neighborhood that had all the hallmarks of middle-class suburbia. The entrance was manicured and mowed, trimmed to the nth degree. All the lawns looked like showcases.</p><p>The houses were cute cookie-cutters and it was like a scene from Currier and Ives with children playing in an idyllic setting. She\u2019d never been to a scarier place in her life.</p><p>\u201cGood God, it\u2019s a Stepford neighborhood,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Connor snorted and pulled into a driveway at the end of a cul-de sac. Lyric\u2019s brow went up as she viewed the Welcome sign just off the walkway to the front door. She burst out laughing and got out.</p><p>\u201cYour sister and brother-in-law can\u2019t be all bad,\u201d Lyric said as Connor motioned her to go in front of him.</p><p>There in the middle of a neighborhood filled with houses without so much as a grass blade out of place was a house with a sign that read: Beer served here daily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed. The grass looks like it\u2019s gone a week without cutting,\u201d Lyric said with a grin.</p><p>Connor rang the doorbell and laughed. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s Gray\u2019s way of rebelling against the Homeowners\u2019 Association. It pisses him off that they presume to tell him what to do with his house and lawn, so he waits until he says the neighborhood watchdog starts twitching and foaming at the mouth before he mows the lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to like your friends,\u201d she said just as the door opened.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope so,\u201d Gray Montgomery said. He gestured at Connor. \u201cYou can\u2019t judge us by this knucklehead.\u201d</p><p>Again Lyric was struck by how out of her element she felt. And how intimidated she was by these people. Average, everyday, normal people. It didn\u2019t compute. She should have all these good ole boys kissing her ass just like the rest of the country.</p><p>She winced even as the belligerent thought crossed her mind. It was a natural reaction, one she had to fight with increasing regularity. When threatened, lash out. Cover up. Never let them see you at a disadvantage.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>It was then she realized Connor had already stepped inside the house and she was still on the doorstep gawking like a moron.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d she said lamely.</p><p>She followed the men inside the house and heard distant laughter. Her palms went damp and she rubbed them down her jeans when they entered the living room.</p><p>She recognized Faith, and she remembered Nathan Tucker and Micah Hudson from her meeting at Malone\u2019s. Sitting on Micah\u2019s lap with Micah\u2019s hand splayed possessively across her swollen belly had to be Angelina.</p><p>Micah was more her usual speed with his floppy hair that hung to his shoulders and the earring glinting in his ear. Nathan Tucker was just downright yummy, though, with his bald head, earring and total badass body. If the woman sitting next to him didn\u2019t look like she could kick Lyric\u2019s and Connor\u2019s asses both, she\u2019d allow herself to drool over the man.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lyric!\u201d Faith called out. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came.\u201d</p><p>The blond woman walked over and took Lyric\u2019s hand before Lyric could draw away. She tugged Lyric forward until she stood in front of the other two women.</p><p>\u201cGuys, this is Lyric Jones. Superstar pop singer Lyric Jones, just in case you\u2019ve been living on another planet.\u201d</p><p>Lyric had certainly been introduced in more glowing terms than that, but for some reason the implied praise in Faith\u2019s voice discomfited her.</p><p>\u201cLyric, these are two of my best friends, Julie Tucker and Angelina Moyano. I\u2019m just sorry Serena isn\u2019t here to meet you. She and her husband, Damon, are fans. They caught one of your shows in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Lyric smiled and fidgeted under the other women\u2019s scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lyric,\u201d Angelina said with a sweet smile. \u201cI\u2019d get up but it would require a forklift.\u201d</p><p>Julie snorted and rose from her perch beside Nathan, though Nathan\u2019s hand lingered on her hip. She stuck out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Julie. It\u2019s nice to meet you, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>Lyric shook her hand and smiled again. Now came the awkward part where either uncomfortable silence fell or they made inane small talk about nothing. She hated both options.</p><p>To her surprise, Connor came to her rescue. He touched her arm and motioned her back toward Faith while Julie took her seat next to her husband.</p><p>\u201cConnor said you haven\u2019t eaten today, Lyric,\u201d Faith said. Her brow creased with concern. \u201cHe also said you have a headache. I wanted to ask you what you\u2019d like to eat. Connor wasn\u2019t sure you liked barbecue. Are you a vegetarian? I can make you a salad.\u201d</p><p>Lyric threw a puzzled look in Connor\u2019s direction. It was really nice that he\u2019d noticed the fact she hadn\u2019t eaten and that he\u2019d spoken to his sister about her potential likes or dislikes, but where had she gotten the idea that Lyric was a vegetarian?</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a vegetarian. And barbecue is fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith, you dork,\u201d Julie said. \u201cJust because she\u2019s a celebrity doesn\u2019t mean she eats tofu and bean sprouts.\u201d</p><p>Faith\u2019s cheeks reddened but guilt flashed in her eyes. Lyric laughed. She couldn\u2019t help it. Of all the assumptions made about her, this was by far the tamest one yet. She wanted to hug Faith.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very sweet to think of me,\u201d Lyric said sincerely. \u201cBut to be honest, I\u2019m a huge carnivore. I don\u2019t eat vegetables. I think I\u2019m still rebelling against my childhood when I was told to eat my veggies or go to bed without eating. More often than not, I snuck crackers and cheese after everyone went to bed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julie grinned. \u201cMy kind of woman.\u201d</p><p>Faith hooked her arm through Lyric\u2019s and pulled her toward the kitchen. \u201cThen how about a little snack before dinner? Gray just fired up the grill before you and Connor got here, so it\u2019ll be a while yet before the meat is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnack?\u201d Lyric asked hopefully. \u201cIt\u2019s not carrots or celery sticks, is it?\u201d</p><p>Faith\u2019s eyes twinkled and her smile broadened. \u201cNo, I made cupcakes.\u201d</p> <p>Lyric decided she was really a lesbian and immediately plotted to steal Faith away from Gray. She loved anyone who offered her a cupcake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love one,\u201d Lyric said with a little too much excitement.</p><p>The two women entered the spacious kitchen and Lyric caught her breath. It sounded silly, but this was the first time she\u2019d been in an actual home in a long time. The kitchen was cheerful and warm and it reminded Lyric of long-ago moments with her own mother.</p><p>\u201cI have strawberry with cream cheese frosting, or vanilla with chocolate frosting,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>Lyric hesitated and stared at the perfectly iced cupcakes on the platter in the center of the island.</p> <p>\u201cOr you could have one of each,\u201d Faith offered.</p><p>\u201cSold!\u201d</p><p>Faith laughed and handed over two of the cupcakes.</p><p>Lyric bit into the strawberry cupcake first and sighed. It had been a long time since something so simple as a cupcake made her happy, but at the moment she couldn\u2019t imagine anything better.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something for your headache? I have ibuprofen and Tylenol.\u201d</p><p>Lyric licked frosting from her lip and shook her head. \u201cConnor took good care of me. He bought some Excedrin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Faith said softly, \u201cthat he\u2019s taking good care of you. Connor . . . He can be difficult.\u201d</p><p>Lyric cracked up. She couldn\u2019t help it. Faith gave her a bewildered look and Lyric set the chocolate cupcake down on the island.</p><p>\u201cMost people would say I\u2019m the difficult one. You know, spoiled pop star diva? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all been said more than once.\u201d</p><p>Faith frowned. \u201cWe women have to stick together. Never admit you\u2019re more trouble than a man even if it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s better if they get it in their heads early that they are the source of all angst in this world.\u201d</p><p>Lyric smudged her finger over the top of the cupcake and sucked the frosting from the tip. \u201cI think you are a very wise woman, Faith. I had you pegged as a total Susie Sunshine, and when I saw your neighborhood I figured you for a Stepford wife. I\u2019m relieved that I was wrong on all counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Susie Sunshine. That\u2019s a new one. I\u2019ll have to remember it for when Gray starts complaining that I\u2019m mean.\u201d</p><p>Lyric grinned.</p><p>\u201cI want one of those cupcakes!\u201d</p> <p>Lyric turned to see Angelina enter the kitchen, her gaze fixed on the cupcake in Lyric\u2019s hand like she was about to attack.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have it,\u201d Faith said in exasperation. \u201cMicah would kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to know,\u201d Angelina said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you give her one,\u201d Faith said when Lyric started to hand a cupcake to Angelina. \u201cShe has to watch her blood sugar. She failed her first glucose tolerance test and they want to do a repeat. Until they get the results, she has to watch her sugar intake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, I take back what I said about you being nice,\u201d Lyric said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty ruthless. Withholding sugar from a pregnant woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that,\u201d Julie said as she walked by and lifted the cupcake from Lyric\u2019s hand.</p><p>Lyric shot her a dark look. \u201cI\u2019ve killed people for less.\u201d</p><p>Julie\u2019s eyebrow shot up. \u201cAnd you people call me vicious. If she keeps that up, I\u2019ll have to tell Connor to collar her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want it wrapped around your mouth,\u201d Lyric drawled.</p><p>\u201cDid you all desert the guys?\u201d Faith asked as she frowned at Julie.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re out bonding over charcoal,\u201d Angelina said with a wave of her hand. \u201cYou know what happens when you mix men, lighter fluid, a grill and beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Faith directed Angelina. \u201cI swear I don\u2019t know how you stand. You\u2019re all belly. It seems like you\u2019d teeter over.\u201d</p><p>Angelina scowled at Faith but hoisted herself up onto a bar stool. Julie took a seat across the bar from Angelina and arched an eyebrow in her direction.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so give us the scoop, Angelina. When are you going to put Micah out of his misery?\u201d</p><p>Faith shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. We had this same conversation with Serena before she married Damon.\u201d</p><p>Lyric shifted from one foot to the other. As if sensing Lyric\u2019s discomfort, Faith turned to explain.</p><p>\u201cSerena is our other best friend and she made Damon wait before she agreed to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she waited because she wasn\u2019t sure,\u201d Angelina softly interjected. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case here. I\u2019d marry Micah tomorrow, but I have to be sure this is what he wants. I won\u2019t be second best. I won\u2019t have him marry me because he feels it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Faith moved beside Angelina and wrapped an arm around her. \u201cHe loves you, honey. He loves you and Nia so much. You\u2019re all he talks about at work. The guys avoid him because he drives them crazy asking them baby stuff they don\u2019t have a clue about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet,\u201d Lyric murmured.</p><p>Angelina sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s great. Really, he is. He\u2019s been so wonderful with me and the baby. I\u2019m crazy about him and I don\u2019t want to be without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you driving yourself crazy?\u201d Faith asked gently.</p><p>Angelina chewed on her lip, her dark eyes shadowed by worry. \u201cI have this fear that he\u2019ll wake up one day and think to himself that I\u2019m not the one he wanted. That he\u2019s trapped. That I pressured him into a relationship he didn\u2019t want. You have to admit, I pursued him relentlessly.\u201d</p><p>Lyric raised an eyebrow. Her opinion of the other woman just went up by several notches. She liked a woman who knew her mind and didn\u2019t sit around waiting for what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about taking a chance,\u201d Julie said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought the same thing about Nathan more times than I care to admit. I used to worry that he\u2019d get tired of me and move on. But he convinced me to give him a chance, and really, there aren\u2019t any guarantees. Men do stupid shit all the time. There\u2019s a trigger when they hit middle age that they want dumber, younger and prettier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus, Julie.\u201d Faith groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping here.\u201d</p><p>Julie shrugged. \u201cJust telling the truth. The point is, you have to take a chance and you have to not only love your guy but you have to trust that he loves you just as much. What else can you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you put it like that,\u201d Angelina said ruefully.</p><p>Faith squeezed Angelina again. \u201cYou almost make me want to give you a cupcake.\u201d</p><p>Lyric laughed at the disgusted look on Angelina\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI hope we haven\u2019t bored you, Lyric,\u201d Faith said anxiously. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re used to a livelier party.\u201d</p><p>Lyric held up her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t, please. This is great. Really. It was really nice of you to have me. I know you weren\u2019t expecting us.\u201d</p><p>Faith reached over and impulsively squeezed Lyric\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came. It\u2019s so interesting to see the woman behind all the gossip and realize you\u2019re nothing like everyone says you are.\u201d</p><p>Horror crawled across Faith\u2019s face as soon as the words were out. She clapped a hand over her mouth. \u201cOh, that was stupid. I didn\u2019t mean . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Lyric said lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize. Half of what they say is likely true and the other half is probably a variation of the truth.\u201d</p><p>Julie\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cSo you really had an orgy on your tour bus?\u201d</p><p>Lyric hadn\u2019t heard that one. \u201cSure, why not. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s written in the rule book somewhere that all rock stars have at least one on the bus per tour.\u201d</p><p>She kept the hurt from her voice and wondered what demon possessed her to perpetuate the rumors. She figured if people were dumb enough to believe that crap, they didn\u2019t deserve the truth. They probably wouldn\u2019t believe it anyway.</p><p>\u201cI totally made that up,\u201d Julie said darkly.</p><p>Lyric shrugged. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the first.\u201d</p><p>Faith frowned. \u201cThat must be an awful way to live, Lyric. How do you stand it?\u201d</p><p>What to say to that? She could leave her life at any time, but it wasn\u2019t like a new life awaited her. Maybe one day she\u2019d figure out what to do beyond her singing career, but the thing was, she loved to sing. She even liked the fame, the hoopla, the fans and the crowds. She wouldn\u2019t apologize for that as many celebrities felt compelled to do. She\u2019d worked damn hard to get to where she was and she wasn\u2019t about to piss it away over false guilt.</p><p>\u201cI like it. It pays well,\u201d Lyric cracked.</p><p>She hated the sympathy shining in all their eyes. It was like they looked at her and thought, Oh, you poor thing. Whatever. There were millions of people who had it far worse than she did. What were a few rumors and a bad reputation next to starving in some shithole in Mississippi?</p><p>The people she grew up with were probably still there, dirt-poor in the same pissant town, married to the same shitty people and raising the same shitty kids.</p><p>\u201cJulie, would you go out and ask the menfolk how much longer on the meat? I need to make the salad and bread,\u201d Faith said, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go. I can\u2019t sit in one spot for too long. Makes me crazy,\u201d Angelina muttered. \u201cMy back is killing me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Angelina had left the kitchen, Julie leaned forward with a wicked grin and whispered, \u201cI keep telling her she\u2019s really having twins and that they missed one of the babies when they did the sonogram.\u201d</p><p>Faith shook her head and laughed. \u201cYou are so evil, Julie.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Male voices drifted through the screen as Angelina approached the door leading into the backyard. She paused for a moment to rub at her aching back. Micah was so sweet and attentive. If he knew her back was giving her problems, he\u2019d be rubbing it. She was tempted to drop a hint because right now she\u2019d give anything to have his hands soothing away the discomfort.</p><p>She was just about to go out when she heard her name. Then she smiled when she heard the guys give Micah a hard time about impending fatherhood. No matter what she may have thought in the beginning, Micah had embraced the idea of being a father with both hands.</p><p>He fussed endlessly over her. He went to every doctor\u2019s appointment and drove her crazy with innocuous pregnancy trivia, some of which she was convinced he made up.</p><p>She went still when she heard Micah\u2019s determined voice rise above the sounds of the neighborhood and distant lawn mowers.</p><p>\u201cI want her to marry me, but I\u2019m at a loss as to how to convince her that I\u2019m not doing it out of obligation. I know she worries that she\u2019s somehow trapping me into a relationship I don\u2019t want, and it\u2019s making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re putting too much stock into marriage,\u201d Connor said. \u201cAngelina\u2019s a great girl. If she loves you and stays with you, does it really matter if it\u2019s official or not?\u201d</p><p>Angelina could visualize Micah\u2019s scowl perfectly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the marriage thing. It\u2019s that she still has doubt. Not that I blame her, but I don\u2019t like to think of her worrying that I\u2019m not dedicated to her and Nia. They\u2019re my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should back off for a while,\u201d Nathan said carefully. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant and vulnerable. From what I hear, their emotions are a mess when they\u2019re pregnant. Maybe she feels pressured.\u201d</p><p>Micah sighed. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m pissed at myself for not seeing it sooner. I don\u2019t deserve her after the way I acted. I love her, and more than that I don\u2019t want her to ever think I don\u2019t, that she\u2019s not the most important thing in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t force trust,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt\u2019ll come. The more she sees that you\u2019re in it for the long haul, the more she\u2019ll trust in the truth of your relationship.\u201d</p><p>Angelina lifted trembling fingers to her mouth. Trust? Trust had never been an issue for her with Micah. She trusted him implicitly. There was no way she could cede absolute and total control in their relationship to him if she didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>The idea that she\u2019d hurt him by making him think she didn\u2019t trust him was painful. She loved Micah and it was for him that she\u2019d hesitated in accepting his marriage proposal.</p><p>Now she wondered if she wasn\u2019t doing more damage to the future of their relationship by holding back. If he ever doubted her love, it would kill her. It was the one thing she\u2019d always given him unreservedly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Micah was her future. She knew it without a doubt. She rubbed her hand over her protruding belly. Micah loved her. He loved their daughter. He wanted them to be a family. Micah had always wanted a family. Right now she was the one standing in the way of his happiness.</p><p>How stupid and shortsighted she\u2019d been. She didn\u2019t regret not relenting right away. She and Micah had desperately needed time to work out their issues and to find their way amid the tumultuous beginning to their relationship.</p><p>But for the last few months, Micah had done and said all the right things. He\u2019d once told her that when she knew without a doubt that he loved her more than life and when she trusted him fully to cherish her gift of love, that was when he wanted her to marry him.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered. How must her continued resistance look to him? Like she didn\u2019t trust him. That she didn\u2019t believe he loved her.</p> <p>None of that was true.</p><p>Suddenly she wanted to nothing more than to go home and spend the evening in Micah\u2019s arms. His hand on her belly and them talking about Nia and their future. Tears stung her eyes. Micah had said when that day came. It was here and she didn\u2019t want to wait any longer.</p><p>\u201cI think Angelina must have gotten lost,\u201d Faith said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cEither that or she made another trip to the bathroom,\u201d Julie said. \u201cAnother reason I have no desire to get knocked up in this millennium. I can\u2019t imagine spending that much time in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Lyric raised her brow. It was nice to know she wasn\u2019t the only one with no desire to pop out a kid anytime soon. Or ever.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go see what\u2019s keeping her,\u201d Lyric said.</p><p>Faith nodded. \u201cThanks, Lyric. I\u2019m going to start on the salad and pop the bread into the oven.\u201d</p><p>Lyric was relieved to escape the kitchen. It wasn\u2019t that she found the other women annoying, but she was ill at ease around the warm friendship between them. Lyric had no experience with closeness. She\u2019d never allowed herself to have that sort of relationship with anyone. Physical, yes. Emotional, no. And she had plenty of business relationships. Nothing that qualified as an actual friendship.</p><p>When she entered the living room, she saw Angelina standing near the door to the backyard, a peculiar expression on her face. Both hands were palmed over her belly and she looked like . . . She looked like she was upset over something.</p><p>It was tempting to turn back and pretend she hadn\u2019t seen the other woman. Lyric had zero experience with emotional, pregnant women. What did you say to one?</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t kill her to be sympathetic. Everyone had been nice to her. Other than Julie\u2019s snottiness\u2014which, she was realizing, was part of the woman\u2019s natural charm\u2014they\u2019d all treated her like she was normal. To her surprise, she liked it. She liked it a lot. Not that she wanted to start leading a normal life, but it was a nice change.</p> <p>She took a few steps forward and delicately cleared her throat. Angelina\u2019s head whipped up and she didn\u2019t look thrilled that Lyric had found her. That made two of them.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Lyric asked gently. \u201cDo you want me to get Micah?\u201d</p><p>Angelina\u2019s lips quivered and she inhaled sharply, like she was tightly controlling her emotions. Then she let out a soft laugh, and her lips turned up into a rueful smile.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever come to the realization that you\u2019re an idiot and that what you thought was the right thing was completely wrong?\u201d</p><p>Lyric snorted. She couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cHoney, you\u2019re talking to the queen of fuckups. If there\u2019s a way to screw something up, I\u2019ve mastered it.\u201d</p><p>Angelina cocked her head. \u201cYou seem so well put together. I\u2019ve watched you, you know. The few TV specials you\u2019ve had and I saw a recording of one of your concerts. You seem so confident and sexy and smart.\u201d</p><p>Lyric blinked. \u201cWow. Thanks, I think. But wow. You couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Not that I want to go into all the ways you\u2019re wrong, but I\u2019m glad it at least looks like I have my shit together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Angelina said again. \u201cA pregnant, hormonal moron. I\u2019ve spent so much time worrying that Micah would want to walk that it\u2019s a wonder I haven\u2019t made him do just that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing wrong with being sure,\u201d Lyric said with a shrug. \u201cI admire you for that. A lot of women don\u2019t look before they leap.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Angelina whirled around, a guilty look on her face. Relief lightened her eyes when Connor walked in.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie,\u201d Connor said as he pulled Angelina into a hug.</p><p>Sweetie? Lyric cocked her eyebrow at the endearment and the obvious affection in Connor\u2019s voice. He was such a grumpy hard-ass, it was difficult to imagine him being so cutesy with another woman. Her eyes narrowed. A pregnant woman who was involved with another man.</p><p>When Angelina pulled away, Connor frowned as he stared down at her. \u201cYou okay? You look upset.\u201d He glanced over at Lyric and her eyes widened at the accusation in his. Did he honestly think she was responsible for Angelina\u2019s crying jag?</p><p>Angelina smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. You can stop fussing over me. Lyric made me feel much better. I think I\u2019m going to go out and let Micah take over.\u201d</p><p>Connor glanced up, fleeting apology in his gaze, but Lyric shot daggers back at him with hers. As Angelina walked out the door, Lyric shook her head and turned on her heel to stalk back to the kitchen.</p><p>Connor caught her wrist before she took two steps and pulled her back around to face him.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>It was a sincere apology, but hurt still crowded her chest. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why you brought me, Connor. It\u2019s obvious you think I\u2019ll be an asshole to your precious friends. They seem to like me, which is more than I can say for you. They\u2019ve also been nice to me, which again\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled her against his chest and sealed his lips over hers, effectively halting her angry tirade. \u201cShut up. Just shut up,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She went stock-still against him as he plundered her mouth. There was nothing gentle or tentative about his kiss. His lips scorched over hers, stealing her breath and returning it as his tongue probed and explored the inside of her mouth.</p><p>It should piss her off. She should be shoving him on his ass. She should be doing a lot of things, but what she did was kiss him back. She was tentative, and the truth was she wasn\u2019t entirely sure what to do, but his taste intoxicated her and made her dizzy.</p><p>A whisper of charcoal danced through her nostrils and it blended with his natural masculine scent until she wanted to lick him to see if his skin tasted as good as he smelled.</p><p>She\u2019d been kissed before many times but never like this. Most men were intimidated by her and it showed in how they touched her. Connor took charge and it was clear he had plenty of self-confidence.</p><p>He cupped her face, his fingers splaying over the sides of her neck. They pressed possessively into her flesh, branding her.</p><p>Shivers danced along her spine as his tongue rubbed sensuously over hers, stroking and coaxing until she responded in kind. Her response was automatic. She didn\u2019t have to think about whether she wanted to kiss him or whether she wanted him to continue kissing her. It wasn\u2019t like she had a choice. She was a helpless prisoner to his overwhelming power.</p><p>When he finally let her go, she staggered back, her lips swollen. She raised a shaky hand to her tingling mouth and stared wordlessly at him, unable to comprehend that he\u2019d just kissed the daylights out of her. He hated her!</p><p>He closed the distance again, regret in his eyes. He touched her shoulder, a light gesture meant to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was an ass.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head to rid herself of the lingering effects of his wicked mouth.</p><p>\u201cNot for kissing you,\u201d he amended. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being an asshole, but not for kissing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you?\u201d she asked faintly. \u201cYou don\u2019t even like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drive me insane. I look at you and you make me instantly crazy.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and some of the euphoria evaporated. \u201cThe feeling is quite mutual.\u201d</p><p>His grin was cocky and arrogant and it was so damn sexy she wanted to march back over there and finish what they\u2019d started.</p><p>\u201cEvery time you get all pissy and mean, I get a hard-on from hell. I wonder if you have any idea how sexy you are when you turn that nose up and start throwing attitude.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. It closed and then opened again like a fish out of water. Then she glared. \u201cYou\u2019re full of shit. You\u2019re just saying that so I\u2019ll be nice to you from now on.\u201d</p><p>His laughter rang out. \u201cWell, I suppose that\u2019s one way to get you to stop being a bitch.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms, prepared to give him the look of death when she realized what the result would be. Instead she threw up her hands and stomped back toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThat goes double for tantrums,\u201d he called after her.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>\u201cI wonder if any of you are free tomorrow morning. I need someone to look out for Lyric while I meet with the security firm her record label has hired,\u201d Connor said over the dinner table.</p><p>In the process of raising her fork to her mouth, Lyric dropped it onto her plate with a clatter, and she stared mortified across the table at Connor.</p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about where you go, I go, and vice versa?\u201d she demanded. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t need babysitters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe team providing peripheral security and I will be deciding what needs to be done to ensure your safety,\u201d Connor said evenly. \u201cYou\u2019ll just interfere and argue. We can get it done a lot quicker if you aren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in disbelief. She\u2019d been accommodating so far. She\u2019d conceded on goddamn everything. What else did he want from her? A note signed in blood avowing her compliance?</p><p>She itched to bolt from her chair and get the hell out of there, but he\u2019d expect that. He watched her even now as if waiting for her to throw a fit.</p><p>She decided to ignore him instead.</p><p>She lowered her gaze and stabbed at the meat with her fork. She tuned out what the others were saying. She didn\u2019t give a shit about these people. Or Connor fucking Malone. Every time she thought it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to be tethered to him for the next two weeks, he had to remind her what a huge asshole he was.</p><p>To her absolute mortification, tears stung her eyelids. Hell would freeze over before she\u2019d ever let him see her cry.</p><p>Damn it, she\u2019d tried her best to work with him. She knew she could be difficult and usually she didn\u2019t give a flying fuck, but she\u2019d honestly tried with him and his friends. She\u2019d done everything humanly possible to tone it down because secretly she\u2019d wanted his approval.</p><p>Fuck that and him. She didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s goddamn approval. Only her own.</p><p>\u201cYou are such an asshole, Connor.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Lyric thought she\u2019d totally lost control of her tongue and aired her thoughts. But when she looked up, she saw Faith glaring holes in her brother.</p><p>Connor raised an eyebrow at his sister.</p><p>Even \u201csweetie\u201d looked at Connor like he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you to be such a jerk,\u201d Faith continued. \u201cLyric doesn\u2019t deserve that from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have the full story,\u201d Gray said in a diplomatic voice.</p><p>Faith glared at her husband. Then she turned to Lyric, who had her teeth sunk firmly into her bottom lip so she didn\u2019t humiliate herself further by showing how affected she was by Connor\u2019s attitude.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, Julie and Angelina to Serena\u2019s house tomorrow. The men can all go find something else to do.\u201d</p><p>Connor held up his hand. \u201cNow wait a damn minute. No one\u2019s going anywhere with Lyric. What part of her being in danger don\u2019t you understand? I\u2019m not risking any of you girls by sending you off together on some girls\u2019 day out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Nathan said with a scowl.</p><p>Lyric rose as gracefully as she could under the circumstances. She smiled in Faith\u2019s direction. \u201cThank you for dinner and your hospitality. I had a really good time. But I should be going now. I appreciate the offer, but Connor\u2019s right. None of you should be around me. In addition to having some crazy person lurking after me, apparently I\u2019m a toxic influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Lyric,\u201d Connor ordered.</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Connor.\u201d</p><p>She turned and stalked away from the table.</p><p>Connor watched her leave but didn\u2019t go after her. She couldn\u2019t get far without the car keys. She needed some time to cool off and he\u2019d just do something stupid again. Like kiss her senseless.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Micah drawled. \u201cAnd you once accused me of being an SOB.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s driving me crazy,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her you have to worry about right now,\u201d Gray said carefully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Connor looked up to see three very pissed-off women glaring holes through his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat was all that crap?\u201d Angelina demanded. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you, Connor. You\u2019ve always been so . . . sweet. And protective.\u201d</p><p>Connor winced. She made him sound like a pussy.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t seem that bad to me,\u201d Julie said with a shrug. \u201cAnd you were a jerk even if you didn\u2019t mean to sound like one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t come to Serena\u2019s tomorrow,\u201d Faith said as she frowned at Connor. \u201cDamon has tight security. No one is going to get onto his property without him knowing about it. And he has Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Sam?\u201d Connor grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHis mountain of a driver slash bodyguard,\u201d Micah said dryly. \u201cHe has great affection for our women. He\u2019s like a mother hen with them. The one time they didn\u2019t let him go with him, Damon said he had a kitten.\u201d</p><p>Connor frowned. \u201cYou think Lyric would be safe there? This is serious. I can\u2019t just leave her anywhere, but if I take her with me, she\u2019s going to balk at the constraints we\u2019re going to put on her. I know you all think I\u2019m being a jerk, but the truth is, I\u2019m going to do whatever is necessary to keep her safe, whether she likes the measures or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can go with them,\u201d Micah said. \u201cI\u2019ll call Damon tonight and let him know the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Connor\u2019s frown deepened. Yeah, he needed a place to stash Lyric so he could get her security straightened out. What he hadn\u2019t mentioned was that if he didn\u2019t get a good feel for this team her record label had hired, he was going to tell them to take a hike.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go find her and apologize,\u201d Faith sniffed. \u201cIf I were her, I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so mean to her?\u201d Julie asked.</p><p>Connor sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not mean to her, Julie. I just don\u2019t kiss her ass like everyone else in her universe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d Angelina said. \u201cShe\u2019s refreshingly honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou like everyone, sweetie,\u201d Connor said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you right now,\u201d she said pointedly.</p><p>He winced. \u201cOh ouch. Damn. That hurt. Okay, okay, I\u2019ll ease up. I\u2019ll even apologize. The last thing I want is to fall into you girls\u2019 bad graces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man,\u201d Nathan murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou go find her and tell her she\u2019s coming with us tomorrow,\u201d Faith said. \u201cDamon will take care of things. He always does.\u201d</p><p>That earned her a glare from every man at the table.</p><p>\u201cWell, he does,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to remind me of all he\u2019s done for you,\u201d Gray said mildly.</p> <p>Faith blushed and Connor promptly tuned them out. He was pretty tired of hearing about Damon Roche himself. Him and his damn sex club or whatever the fuck he called it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking her to his damn club, are you?\u201d Connor demanded.</p><p>Faith turned bright red. \u201cGood God, no! We\u2019re going to his house. Not The House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Julie said thoughtfully. \u201cLyric might enjoy a night at The House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie,\u201d Nathan growled. \u201cYou aren\u2019t setting foot in that place ever again.\u201d</p><p>Julie grinned cheekily.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Faith asked. \u201cGo, go, go. Shoo already.\u201d</p><p>Connor sighed and got to his feet. Women were a plague. There was no doubt about it. He had his share of crazy ex-girlfriends, but they had nothing on the women currently in his life. He loved them all dearly, but he didn\u2019t envy their men one iota.</p><p>He should have known that Lyric would fit in beautifully.</p><p>He stalked through the house, annoyed that everyone had turned on him. He never wanted this pain-in-the-ass job in the first place.</p><p>She was probably out in the car pouting. He\u2019d have to go out and be nice. She\u2019d probably pop off at him and his dick would stand up and pay attention. Then he\u2019d start having fantasies about kissing her again.</p><p>He really had to do something about this masochistic streak. It seemed the more she got mad at him, the more he wanted her. She was a beautiful woman, but never more than she was spitting fury at him like a pissed-off kitten.</p><p>He grinned as he opened the door and stepped out into the night. When he looked in the direction of where he\u2019d parked the BMW, his jaw dropped.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>He glanced down the street to see the taillights of the car fading as it roared through the neighborhood.</p><p>He dug into his pocket and pulled out the keys. What the fuck? She\u2019d hot-wired the car?</p><p>He closed his eyes and shook his head. Then he trudged back into the house to face the others.</p><p>\u201cI need a ride back to the hotel,\u201d he said before they could say anything to him.</p><p>Everyone looked up from the table, all wearing puzzled looks.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong with the car?\u201d Micah asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Connor muttered. \u201cShe hot-wired it and took off.\u201d</p><p>Julie burst out laughing. One by one the others followed suit until the entire room erupted in hoots.</p><p>\u201cIt was stupid,\u201d Connor growled. \u201cShe has some crazy stalker leaving her creepy notes and she takes off alone. This is why I don\u2019t want her at my meeting tomorrow. She\u2019s high-strung and unreasonable. And she doesn\u2019t have one ounce of self-preservation.\u201d</p><p>Micah stood and reached down to help Angelina to her feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll run you by. We were going to call it an early night anyway.\u201d</p><p>Connor would have liked to have called it a night, but he had a feeling he was going to be up for a long time. When he got to the hotel, he and Lyric were going to have a come-to-Jesus meeting. And he was as hard as a rock just thinking about it.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Despite the fact she\u2019d just hot-wired a car and ditched her only \u201csecurity,\u201d Lyric wasn\u2019t an idiot, no matter what Connor Malone might think. She had no desire to be kidnapped or murdered by some psycho. She liked her life, thank you very much, even if she gave new meaning to the word dysfunctional.</p><p>Amazing, the words you learned from therapy.</p><p>She kept her eyes peeled, particularly to her rearview mirror to make sure no one was tailing her. She also kept a sharp eye out for a cop. Because what moron would try anything if she had a cop escort her to her hotel?</p><p>She uttered a triumphant \u201cAha!\u201d when she saw a patrol car parked at a gas station. She whipped in and parked directly in front of him, just in case he had any ideas about driving off before she could get her story across.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look happy with her parking choice and before she could get out of her car, he was already out of his and walking her way, a frown on his face.</p><p>What was it with men and being so damn grumpy?</p><p>She got out of her car as he approached.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You see, I have this crazy person stalking me and I had to hot-wire my BMW because the guy who\u2019s supposed to be my security was being a dick and he has the keys, but I don\u2019t want to be driving around by myself or go back to my hotel room in case the crazy stalker is waiting to kidnap me or make me his sex slave or whatever it is that crazy stalkers do. So I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could follow me back to my hotel.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together and she could swear he muttered \u201cWhy me?\u201d under his breath. Then he sighed and started to reach for his radio. He had that look that suggested he thought she was the crazy one.</p><p>\u201cHow much have you had to drink tonight, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>This time she frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you taken any drugs I should know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a crackhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho does the vehicle belong to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belongs to me! Oh wait\u2014Well, it sort of belongs to me. I rented it because I flew here. I mean, I have one just like it but I didn\u2019t want to drive it all the way from California when I\u2019m just doing one show here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and raised the mic on his radio and proceeded to tell someone that he had a 10-96 and he was requesting backup.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cLook, all I need is someone to follow me to the hotel. And well, I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could walk me in but I could always have hotel security do that if you\u2019re too busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a better idea. Why don\u2019t you take a ride with me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d rather not leave the BMW, but I suppose I could make Connor come get it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Connor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the guy who\u2019s supposed to be protecting me but was being a dick so I ditched him.\u201d</p><p>The cop gripped her elbow and herded her toward his squad car. \u201cTurn around,\u201d he directed. \u201cThis is for your protection as well as mine. You aren\u2019t being arrested. I\u2019m detaining you for further questioning.\u201d</p><p>Before she realized what was going on, he had her handcuffed and was stuffing her into the backseat of his car. Damn, but the man was good.</p><p>But he\u2019d handcuffed her! She stared at him in outrage. \u201cWhat the hell did you cuff me for?\u201d</p><p>He shut the door and then proceeded to talk on his radio. A few seconds later, he opened his door and slid into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>Realization hit her. \u201cYou\u2019re the crazy stalker, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re not even a real cop. Have you been following me?\u201d</p><p>He eyed her in the rearview mirror as he pulled away. \u201cLady, you came to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he wasn\u2019t the crazy guy. Which meant he thought she was crazy. She flopped her head back against the seat and stared upward. Helpless laughter escaped. Oh well, at least she was safe!</p><p>While it irritated Connor to leave immediately because he didn\u2019t want Lyric to think she had him on a leash, he was being paid to protect her, which meant he had to go chasing after her when she pulled a stupid stunt.</p><p>Hot-wiring a rental and taking off on her own qualified.</p><p>He leaned against the hood of Micah\u2019s truck and waited impatiently as Angelina was fussed over by Faith and Julie. Micah walked out ahead of Angelina and stood beside Connor.</p><p>\u201cYou realize I\u2019ve waited a long time for this,\u201d Micah said casually.</p><p>Connor raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo I even want to know what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>Micah chuckled. \u201cBeing able to give you shit over a woman.\u201d</p><p>Connor scowled. \u201cYou say that like this situation can be compared to yours or Nathan\u2019s. Lyric is a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. She\u2019s a beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? That matters why?\u201d</p><p>Micah shrugged. \u201cJust an observation. She\u2019s beautiful and brassy. A little unconventional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say she\u2019s perfect for you,\u201d Micah said with a shit-eating grin.</p><p>Connor held up his middle finger. \u201cJust remember. I didn\u2019t want this job. I thought it would be perfect for you, but Pop threw a fit because he said Angelina wouldn\u2019t like it. Same for Nathan and Gray because their women wouldn\u2019t be happy.\u201d He snorted. \u201cSo I get stuck with a woman who drives me crazy so it doesn\u2019t interfere with your love life.\u201d</p><p>Micah\u2019s grin broadened. \u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>Angelina hurried up. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to take so long. I know you have to go, Connor.\u201d</p><p>Micah pulled her up against him and kissed the top of her head. \u201cYes, by all means. He\u2019s chomping at the bit to get back, so let\u2019s get on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Connor grumbled as he climbed into the extended cab.</p><p>It was a good bit out of the way for Micah to drive Connor to the downtown hotel, and Connor fumed the entire way. They were just a few blocks from the hotel when Connor\u2019s cell phone rang.</p><p>He fished it out of his pocket and frowned when he looked at the number. It wasn\u2019t in his contact list but the number was a local one.</p><p>\u201cConnor Malone,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>\u201cMr. Malone, this is Sergeant Willis with the Houston Police Department. I believe you know a Lyric Jones?\u201d</p><p>Connor closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers. \u201cWhat\u2019s she done?\u201d he asked wearily.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Connor climbed out of Micah\u2019s truck in front of the police station where Lyric was being held.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want us to wait?\u201d Micah asked.</p><p>Connor shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll call a cab. You and Angelina go home. This could take a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, man. Let me know if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Connor waved and stalked toward the entrance. At the front desk, he asked for Sergeant Willis, and the clerk jerked a thumb over his shoulder.</p><p>Connor walked through the swinging gate to the array of desks separated by thin partitions. He stopped and stared when he caught sight of Lyric sitting on top of one of the desks holding court among a half dozen policemen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her legs dangled and she was talking and waving her hands in animated fashion. Her cheek dimpled with a smile and her eyes twinkled. It dawned on him that she hadn\u2019t smiled much and certainly not so unreservedly.</p><p>Micah was right. She was fucking beautiful.</p><p>Her eyes dimmed when she caught sight of him and she crossed her arms over her chest as she stared past the cops. They turned and followed her gaze to where Connor stood, and he got the impression he wasn\u2019t a very popular guy right now.</p><p>He folded his arms in an imitation of hers and cast a baleful look in her direction.</p><p>One of the cops, a guy who made Connor feel small, and Connor wasn\u2019t a small guy, headed in Connor\u2019s direction, a frown etched into his face.</p><p>\u201cYou the guy who\u2019s supposed to be looking out for Lyric?\u201d</p><p>Connor sighed and nodded. \u201cYou Sergeant Willis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am. Lyric said you were being a dickhead so she took off. She stopped me to ask me for an escort. Said some crazy stalker is after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least she had the sense to ask for help,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be out on her own.\u201d</p><p>Connor stared the officer down. \u201cTry telling her that.\u201d</p><p>Sergeant Willis nodded. \u201cWe did. We sat her down after we figured out who she was. We gave her a Breathalyzer. I thought she\u2019d been drinking.\u201d</p><p>Connor chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s a handful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nice. Not at all uppity like some of the magazines say. She gave all the boys autographs and let them take pictures with her. She even offered us tickets to the rodeo the night she\u2019s performing.\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Lyric to make conquests and make Connor look like a first-class asshole for not falling under her spell. She could be positively charming when she wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cCan I take her home now?\u201d Connor asked cautiously.</p><p>Sergeant Willis hesitated. \u201cIf she wants to go.\u201d</p><p>Connor scowled. \u201cShe\u2019ll go. She\u2019s been enough trouble for one day.\u201d</p><p>He stepped around the sergeant and strode to where Lyric was still sitting on the edge of the desk.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>Lyric frowned. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to go anywhere with you. You\u2019re fired. These nice officers have offered to take me back to my hotel.\u201d</p><p>Connor sighed and resisted the urge to wrap his hands in her hair and kiss her right there on the desk. The last thing he needed was to get arrested.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fire me, Lyric. We\u2019ve been through this before.\u201d</p> <p>Her frown grew fiercer and she glanced toward Sergeant Willis. \u201cHe can\u2019t make me do anything, right?\u201d</p><p>Sergeant Willis shook his head. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am, he can\u2019t. If you want him gone, say the word. You can even get a restraining order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of God, Lyric. Be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cMe be reasonable? You\u2019re the asshole here. I\u2019ve been accommodating. I\u2019ve done everything you asked me to. I even wore this ridiculous outfit so I wouldn\u2019t offend any of your friends. I agreed to let you stay in my hotel room. How am I the unreasonable one here?\u201d</p><p>He arched one eyebrow. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with your clothes?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look of disgust. \u201cI\u2019m wearing jeans and a T-shirt and no makeup what so ever.\u201d She glanced up at the officers and let her lips quiver. \u201cHe humiliated me in front of his friends.\u201d</p><p>They all turned and glared at Connor. Hell. Just what he needed. A bunch of pissed-off cops with their protective instincts riled. He glared back at Lyric, not at all fooled by her acting job. Next she\u2019d probably turn on the tears and they\u2019d all kick his ass.</p><p>\u201cAre they going to be able to stay with you every hour of the next two weeks?\u201d Connor challenged. \u201cThe threat against you is for real, Lyric. I need you to take it seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it very seriously,\u201d she gritted out. \u201cIf you took it so damn serious, you\u2019d work harder not to piss me off.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so she had a point. He blew out his breath and shoved his hands into his pockets. \u201cAll right, Lyric. Truce.\u201d</p><p>She stared suspiciously at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late. You need rest. You\u2019ve had a headache all day. Let\u2019s go back to the hotel so I can give you some more medicine and get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>As he\u2019d hoped, the other cops nodded their agreement. Score one for him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea, Ms. Jones,\u201d Sergeant Willis said.</p><p>She scowled at the sergeant. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgiven you for cuffing me yet, so you don\u2019t get a vote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cuffed her?\u201d Connor demanded.</p><p>It was the sergeant\u2019s turn to look uncomfortable. \u201cI thought she might be a little unstable.\u201d He tapped his temple as he spoke to indicate what he meant.</p><p>Lyric\u2019s mouth popped open in outrage. \u201cIs that what ten ninety-six means?\u201d</p><p>Sergeant Willis gave her a sheepish look. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. We don\u2019t normally use call signs, but I thought if you understood what I was saying over the radio, you might prove more difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d she muttered. \u201cAll assholes. I ask you for help and you think I\u2019m psycho.\u201d</p><p>Connor held in his laughter at her disgruntled look. \u201cCan we go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. I\u2019ll go with you. But if you piss me off again, I\u2019m going to get that restraining order Sergeant Willis said I could have done.\u201d</p><p>Every single one of the policemen fished a card from his wallet and thrust it toward Lyric. All with the assurance that if she ever needed anything, she had only to call.</p><p>Lyric smiled and took each of the cards and thanked the officers for their help. Connor had to hand it to her. She knew how to work a crowd. She had every one of the cops eating out of her hand. Hell, if she kept it up, she\u2019d have him eating out of her hand.</p><p>\u201cThe BMW is still at the gas station,\u201d Lyric mumbled when she got to him. \u201cHow are we getting to the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of us will be happy to drive you back to the gas station to pick up the car,\u201d Sergeant Willis offered. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you have the keys this time.\u201d</p><p>Connor pulled the keys from his pocket and then turned to Lyric. \u201cYou and I have a lot to talk about, starting with how the hell you learned to hot-wire a car.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Angelina walked into the bedroom where Micah was already lying on the bed. Propped on his elbow, he watched as she closed the bedroom door and the glitter in his eyes told her what was to come.</p><p>Her breath hitched in her throat. She never got tired of that look. It was tender and possessive. It was dark and loving. It was all the things that made her feel cherished beyond measure.</p><p>\u201cUndress for me,\u201d he commanded in a quiet voice. \u201cI want to see you and our baby.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed without question, her hands sliding to the buttons of her shirt. Slowly she pulled away her clothing, letting the shirt and then her pants drift to the floor until she was clad in only her panties and bra.</p><p>Then she reached behind her to undo the clasp of her bra. The straps slid over her shoulders and the cups came away, baring her breasts to his avid gaze.</p><p>They were heavier now. She\u2019d always been a bit small, or at least she considered them small. Micah had never complained. But now she\u2019d gained at least a cup size, and they were tender and swollen from her pregnancy.</p><p>Micah took extra care when they made love. As demanding and as dominant as he was, he was terrified of hurting her. He was no less commanding than ever, but he was exquisitely gentle now that she carried his child. She hadn\u2019t felt the kiss of a whip in months. Hadn\u2019t felt the thrill of the rougher edge of his dominance.</p><p>In time it would return. For now they delighted in a new way to make love. It was as much a discovery as the rest of their relationship, and Angelina cherished every moment.</p><p>When her underwear whispered down her legs to coil at her feet, she heard the swift intake of Micah\u2019s breath.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how beautiful you are?\u201d he asked in a hoarse, low voice.</p><p>She raised her gaze to meet his and drowned in the warm chocolate of his eyes. They burned with so much love and desire. Her heart swelled with love. Her love for him. He was hers. She was his. They had created a child together. They had created love.</p><p>\u201cI feel beautiful when you look at me,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>His eyes softened. \u201cI want you to always see how beautiful you are when you see the way I look at you. I want you to know how loved you are.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and waited quietly for his command. She loved moments like these when she awaited his pleasure, knowing he was content to just look at her.</p><p>\u201cCome to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She crawled onto the bed and sank to her knees as she stared down at his muscled body. So perfect and beautiful. He was dark\u2014nearly as dark as her own skin, though he had no Hispanic heritage. His hair was dark brown, so dark it looked black.</p><p>The same dark hair coiled at the juncture of his thighs and his cock lay to the side, semierect as if awaiting her attention.</p><p>She remained still, content to wait for Micah\u2019s command.</p><p>He ran his hand up her thigh, to the curve of her waist and then higher to cup the swell of her breast. He toyed idly with one nipple, careful as always with the highly sensitive tips.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired tonight, Angel. Is your back still hurting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was earlier. I think I stood too long. It\u2019s better now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her down, arranging her so she faced away. His hand glided up and down the curves of her body. He ran it over her hip and up to palm her belly. Then he lowered his head and kissed the curve of her neck.</p><p>A delicate shiver raced down her spine, spreading goose bumps in its wake.</p><p>There was a dip in the bed as his hand left her and he repositioned his body. Then he began rubbing and kneading her back, his hands working sweet magic over her tired, aching muscles.</p><p>She moaned softly as he worked slowly down to her buttocks and then back up again to massage her nape.</p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Tears pricked her eyelids. It was wonderful, but every day with him was wonderful. After surviving her attack months before, she was grateful for every moment she had with Micah. She lived as if each moment could be their last together, and it was ridiculous because she had the power to cement their lives together.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you okay, Angel girl?\u201d</p><p>The worry in his voice made her heart squeeze. How could she find the words to tell him she\u2019d never been better than right here, right now, in his arms?</p><p>She turned awkwardly, and in the end, he had to help her as she rotated to face him. Their noses were just an inch apart and she twined her legs with his, allowing his heat to seep into her body.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to ask me to marry you again?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>There was a brief flash in his eyes she could swear was pain. He stroked her cheek with one finger and then ran it slowly back and forth over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, Angel. I\u2019ve been pushing too much. I swore I wouldn\u2019t pressure you but I\u2019ve been doing just that.\u201d</p><p>She put her finger to his mouth to cut off the words.</p><p>\u201cAsk me again. Please.\u201d</p><p>A wild spark lit his eyes and the pupils dilated, turning the brown to black. There was hope and fear simultaneously, one warring with the other. She hated the insecurity and hesitancy she saw as he came to grips with what she\u2019d asked.</p><p>To her surprise, he pushed himself up and got off the bed. For a moment she wondered if she\u2019d royally screwed up. But he reached for her, holding out a hand.</p><p>She slid her palm over his and he helped her to the edge of the bed until she sat with her legs hanging over the side, her feet just brushing the floor.</p><p>Still holding on to her hand, he knelt on the floor so they looked each other in the eye. Nervousness bunched in her stomach and her breathing shallowed until she realized she was holding it.</p><p>Micah raised her hand to his mouth and pressed a kiss into the softness of her palm. Then he slowly pulled it away and gazed directly into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me, Angel? Will you spend the rest of your life with me? Love me the way I love you? Have my children, grow a family with me, grow old with me and spend a lifetime allowing me to love you the way you deserve to be loved?\u201d</p><p>Completely undone by the heartfelt words, she stared in wonder as tears slid silently down her cheeks. She raised her hands and cupped his face, gazing into the eyes of the man she adored\u2014had always adored.</p><p>\u201cYou once told me that when I knew without a doubt that you loved me more than life and that when I trusted you with my heart, it was then you wanted me to marry you. I should have said yes a long time ago,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll marry you. I love you. I\u2019ll always love you.\u201d</p><p>He rose up and crushed her to him. He held her tight, his entire body trembling against her. She felt every breath, every beat of his heart as it pounded wildly against her throat.</p><p>\u201cOh God, I love you, Angel girl. So much. So damn much. I thank God I didn\u2019t destroy your faith in me, that I didn\u2019t destroy your love. I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I had. You and Nia are my world. I love you both so much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pulled away and then took his hands and guided them down to mold to her belly. \u201cWe\u2019re your family, Micah. She and I. She\u2019ll love you as much as I love you.\u201d</p><p>His smile made her heart ache. There was such joy in his eyes. It wasn\u2019t until now that she noticed the shadows he\u2019d worn for the past months. But now they lifted away and there was such relief in his face.</p><p>He lowered his head and pressed his lips to the hard bump of her belly. She threaded her fingers through his long hair and held him lovingly against the gentle patter of their daughter.</p><p>She closed her eyes and let the sweetness of the moment envelope her. They\u2019d been through so much in such a short amount of time. But it was all worth it because here and now, she held everything she\u2019d ever wanted in her arms and cradled in her womb.</p> <p>Micah and their daughter. Her family.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but think her brother, David, and Hannah were smiling down on them from heaven.</p><p>Micah lifted his head, then curled his hand around her nape and pulled her until their foreheads rested against each other. Their noses brushed and she felt his erratic breaths puff out as if he was valiantly trying to maintain control of his emotions.</p><p>\u201cTell me again,\u201d he whispered. \u201cTell me you\u2019ll marry me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll marry you, Micah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you say when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI think we\u2019ll need a little longer than that. While I don\u2019t want a huge wedding, I do want our closest friends\u2014our family,\u201d she amended, \u201cto be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is what you want, Micah? You\u2019ll be happy?\u201d</p> <p>He pulled away and cupped her face as she\u2019d cupped his a moment earlier. \u201cI\u2019ve never been happier in my life than I am right at this very moment. But as overjoyed as I am right now, nothing will match the day you become officially mine in the eyes of the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been yours, Micah. But now you\u2019re mine. And I\u2019m never going to let you go.\u201d</p><p>He smiled then and the last remaining shadows faded away, leaving only hope and joy. \u201cI see I\u2019m not the only possessive one in this relationship. I like it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Connor pulled under the hotel awning and stopped behind two other cars waiting to valet park. He cut the engine and sat there for a long moment while they watched the valet tend to the first car in line.</p><p>She could sense his irritation, which was fine, because it wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t have plenty of her own.</p><p>Finally he looked over at her. \u201cWhat the hell was all that about tonight?\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids narrowed to slits as she glared over at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think you did anything wrong in this scenario?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I piss you off and you find that sufficient reason to hot-wire a car, get arrested and be hauled off to jail?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms and huffed. \u201cI was not arrested. I was specifically looking for a cop. It\u2019s not my fault he overreacted and thought I was some lunatic off her meds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d think something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the sarcasm. It makes you sound like an even bigger asshole,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cDo you always react this strongly about everything? I mean, most people would have just called me a dickhead and been done with it. Not many people would hot-wire a car, then flag down a cop and try to convince them you\u2019re off your fucking rocker.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him again. \u201cI was being smart. I didn\u2019t want to be driving around alone and I damn sure didn\u2019t want to come back to the hotel by myself. I mean, what if the demented dude was waiting for me in my room?\u201d</p><p>He looked like he wanted to beat his head against the steering wheel. Luckily the valet walked up and Connor opened his door to collect the ticket. Lyric got out and forced herself to wait for Connor. Whatever he might think, she really didn\u2019t want to go back up to her room alone. She didn\u2019t want to stay alone, for that matter, but neither did she want him in such close proximity for the entire night. She was fucked either way and she was resigned to spending another sleepless night. She would be a freaking zombie by tomorrow.</p><p>Connor put his hand to her back and herded her toward the door. All the way to her room, he was silent. His glower spoke volumes, and to be honest, she was happy he wasn\u2019t talking. He\u2019d just gripe at her some more.</p><p>That deference thing she was used to would certainly come in handy right now. Unfortunately she imagined he\u2019d cut his own nuts off before ever deferring to her.</p><p>He made her remain to the side in the hallway while he opened the door and took a look inside. Satisfied that no one was going to jump out of the closet at them, he motioned her in and then shut and bolted the door behind them.</p><p>She made her way to the bed and flopped indelicately onto the mattress. The message light was blinking on her phone and she frowned, wondering who even knew she was here. Phillip did. But she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d even let her band or crew know where she was staying yet.</p><p>She leaned over, picked up the receiver and punched the button marked messages. Exhausted from the day\u2019s events and no sleep in longer than she could remember, she flopped back onto a pillow and closed her eyes as she waited for the recording to start.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from me, Lyric. Your pathetic little bodyguard can\u2019t protect you.\u201d</p><p>She bolted straight up, not believing what she\u2019d heard. Her hands shaking, she punched at a series of buttons to replay the message but was so upset she botched it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong?\u201d Connor demanded. He snatched the phone from her hands and put it to his ear. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here. What upset you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe message,\u201d she stammered out. \u201cReplay the message. I didn\u2019t erase it. It should still be there.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and depressed the button to cut the connection and then he punched the message button again. After a moment, his expression grew stormy and his eyes went so cold she shivered.</p><p>He replayed the message several times before finally replacing the receiver. He put his hand down to gently push her leg over so he could sit on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded but she wasn\u2019t really. She knew she had some creep sending her weird notes, but her record label had kept her in the dark and she had only Connor\u2019s word to go on. Not that she doubted him\u2014she had no problem believing him at all. It was why she had been so determined not to go anywhere alone. But now that she\u2019d heard the threat, it was much more real. It shocked her to her core.</p><p>\u201cLyric, look at me.\u201d</p><p>The command snapped her gaze to him.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I\u2019m so pissed that you took off without me,\u201d he said, a distinct edge to his voice. \u201cNow will you take this seriously?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, upset and shaken by the threat but just as upset over his assumption that she didn\u2019t take this very seriously.</p><p>But she was too tired to defend herself. Too tired to argue with his ironclad opinion of her. It wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d change it.</p><p>She nodded wearily, too tired to say the words. There was no way she\u2019d keep the bitterness out of her voice anyway. It was better to just shut up and take the path of least resistance. For once.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day. It\u2019ll be another long day tomorrow. You should get some sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to check with the hotel to see if we can get a trace.\u201d</p><p>As if that was going to happen. Still, she wouldn\u2019t mind getting comfortable and laying her head on her pillow. Without a word, she got up, rummaged around in a still-packed suitcase until she found a pair of cotton pajamas and then headed for the bathroom.</p><p>Her pajamas were her comfort item. Much like a security blanket or a special stuffed animal. They were old and probably had holes, but they were soft and comfortable and they made her feel safe.</p><p>Connor would probably laugh, and she\u2019d be lucky if he didn\u2019t sneak photos to send to the tabloids. What a blow to her image if she were photographed in pajamas with faded smiley faces on them.</p><p>When she came out of the bathroom, she blinked in surprise to see Connor shirtless on one side of the bed. He wore a pair of sweat pants\u2014thank goodness\u2014because she couldn\u2019t handle seeing him in nothing but his underwear, although it did bring up the tantalizing question of whether he wore briefs or boxers.</p><p>Or . . . boxer briefs. She\u2019d bet money he was a boxer brief kind of guy. Or maybe she just really liked the image of him in tight cotton, butt-molding briefs that hugged those muscular upper legs.</p><p>Mmmmm.</p><p>Okay, she had to stop because this was just ridiculous.</p><p>She trudged to her side of the bed, pleased to see that he\u2019d already erected a barrier between them using cushions from the sofa. She wouldn\u2019t have to forfeit any of her pillows to the cause.</p><p>He watched her as she pulled back the covers. She could feel his gaze resting on her, but she refused to look up. She crawled onto the mattress and turned her back to him as she pulled the comforter up over her shoulders.</p><p>There was a pregnant silence and then, \u201cGood night, Lyric,\u201d he murmured. She heard the click of the lamp and the room was plunged into darkness. Only a thin beam of light from the street squeezed through a tiny gap in the room darkening curtains.</p><p>Her heart thumped in her throat and she lay there so wound up and tense that her muscles ached. She hated this. Hated that being so close to Connor\u2014in the same bed\u2014made her so nervous she wanted to puke.</p><p>She forced her breathing to even out because even she could hear it stuttering past her lips. She gripped the covers protectively around her and huddled there, staring at the opposite wall.</p><p>She was never going to sleep.</p><p>\u201cConnor?\u201d</p><p>There was a brief pause. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She gripped the covers a little tighter until her fingers went numb. \u201cWhy do you hate me so much?\u201d</p><p>There was an uncomfortable pause. Then she felt him turn toward her on his side. She lay still, her fingers wrapped tightly around the sheet she held to her chin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou decided before you ever met me that you despised me. Nothing I do or say is going to change that.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t exactly help your case when we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked at me like I was scum. No one is going to react well to that kind of judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like me either,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI was a jerk tonight. I\u2019ll be honest. I didn\u2019t want this job. And you\u2019re right. I had my mind made up about you before we ever met. That wasn\u2019t . . . fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do take this seriously.\u201d</p><p>Connor shifted again, and the next thing she knew, light flooded the room as he switched the lamp back on. She glanced over her shoulder to see him sit up in bed.</p><p>\u201cTurn over so we can talk,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She rolled and clutched one of the cushions between them to her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou need to consider the possibility that someone close to you is involved in this.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut no one knows I\u2019m here. I gave my band and my crew two weeks off. I was careful, Connor. I know you don\u2019t think I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Paul? And your two . . . bodyguards?\u201d</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t called them her fuck-buddies again. She sighed. Her head hurt. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever gotten rid of the headache she\u2019d had earlier.</p><p>\u201cLyric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Paul knew too,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cAnd Trent and R.J. too. Don\u2019t say it. I already feel like an idiot. But no one else knows. Or rather I didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think the cops you introduced yourself to will keep your cover?\u201d</p><p>She flushed and hugged the pillow a little tighter. \u201cI was angry. You humiliated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always react so outrageously when someone pisses you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always allow people to get under your skin so badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9. So we\u2019ve both reacted badly. I\u2019m more at fault than you. This is a job. I\u2019m supposed to be a professional. No matter how much you irritate me, it\u2019s my job to keep cool and protect you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up, watching the soft glow of the lamp slide over his muscled shoulders. He had a great chest. He was a tall man. Lean but tightly muscled. Not in a bulging Neanderthal way, nor did he look like he worked out a bazillion times a week. But his body was tight and there wasn\u2019t a spare ounce of flesh anywhere on his waist.</p><p>He had a great jaw. Firm and determined. Already he had a shadow of a beard that only made him look sexy in a scruffy, totally male way. He wasn\u2019t pretty and polished.</p><p>He had a quiet arrogance that suggested he was comfortable in his skin and didn\u2019t much give a damn what others thought. He wasn\u2019t impressed by celebrity. He thought she was a spoiled jerk. He was right, but it still bothered her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo I irritate you that much?\u201d</p><p>He cracked a grin and glanced over at her. \u201cYeah. You do.\u201d</p><p>The acknowledgment was more of a dry laugh at himself and the smile took the sting out of his words.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to work this out,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow I\u2019m meeting with the firm your label hired. You\u2019ll be surrounded by security at all times and I\u2019m going to stick to you like glue for the next two weeks. If someone wants you, they\u2019ll have to go through me.\u201d</p> <p>She took great comfort from the vow. It didn\u2019t come across as a boast. There was complete and utter confidence in his voice, and his eyes sparked with determination.</p><p>She bit her lips and met his gaze again. \u201cI know I\u2019m not . . . easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re definitely not easy,\u201d he said in a lazy voice. \u201cBut I can handle difficult.\u201d</p><p>He reached over to touch her hair. It was a simple brush. He didn\u2019t even make contact with her skin, but an electric sensation snaked all the way through her body.</p><p>\u201cYou should get some rest,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re exhausted and you\u2019ve had a headache all day.\u201d</p> <p>She grimaced. \u201cI won\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>One of his eyebrows went up in question. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She looked away and clutched the covers to her chin again.</p><p>\u201cLyric?\u201d</p><p>His voice gentled and there was a soothing lilt to the way he said her name.</p><p>\u201cYou make me nervous. It\u2019s not just you,\u201d she rushed to say. \u201cIt could be anyone. I don\u2019t like having someone so . . . close.\u201d</p> <p>When she peeked up to gauge his reaction, his brow was furrowed. \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding you always have people around you. That you\u2019re never alone. I\u2019d think if that was the case, you\u2019d be glad to have me here with you so you aren\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being alone,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making no sense.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and turned onto her back to stare at the ceiling. \u201cIf I have a choice between alone and being alone with one other person, I choose alone, no matter how uncomfortable it makes me.\u201d</p><p>She could feel his stare burning over her skin, like he was trying to peel back the layers even further and see her darkest secrets.</p><p>To her surprise he sat up and threw his legs over the edge of the bed. She watched from the corner of her eye as he reached for the hotel directory on the nightstand.</p><p>He rotated back around and began flipping through the pages. \u201cWell, if we\u2019re going to be up all night, I\u2019m going to order room service. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cBut you ate a huge supper. I mean, it looked like it was the entire cow. Or pig. Whatever we ate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a growing boy. Need food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to stay up just because I can\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at her. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d He held up the menu. \u201cYou want something?\u201d</p><p>She slowly sat up and arranged one of the cushions behind her so she was propped against the headboard. Then she smiled. \u201cYeah. I could eat.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Connor said softly.</p><p>His voice was a tickle in her ear and she scrunched up her nose in her sleep and batted at the offending sensation.</p><p>A husky chuckle blew a strand of her hair over her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Sleeping Beauty. We have things to do today and Damon Roche is sending a driver to collect you in an hour. I thought you\u2019d want to take a shower and put on something killer before he arrives.\u201d</p><p>She cracked one eye open and stared at Connor\u2019s face just inches from her own. For a moment she was confused and then realization pushed aside the veil of sleep.</p><p>\u201cI slept,\u201d she said in wonder.</p><p>Connor nodded. \u201cYeah, you did. You crashed around five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight. I would have let you sleep longer, but I\u2019ve got to get your security squared away today and then we have to move you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He eased back and she struggled to push herself up, her brain clouded and fuzzy. She blinked to try to clear the cobwebs and for a moment she simply stared around the room, amazed that she\u2019d fallen asleep with him next to her in bed.</p><p>Maybe her exhaustion had finally caught up to her and she\u2019d simply passed out. Even more surprising was the fact that she really wanted to lie back down and sleep for several more hours.</p><p>She should be jumping at the opportunity to surround herself with people for the day. Being on her own and with Connor had been a strain, and she was starting to show signs of cracking.</p><p>She rubbed at her face and then glanced over at Connor, who was sitting at the end of the bed watching her. \u201cAre you done in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ve already showered. It\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll need a bit to get ready.\u201d</p><p>She threw the covers aside and swung her legs over the side of the bed. Damn, but she was tired. As she trudged toward the bathroom, Connor said, \u201cYou want breakfast? I was going to order room service. I\u2019d rather you not go down and eat. More chance of you being recognized.\u201d</p><p>She covered a yawn and nodded. \u201cYeah. Sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEggs? Bacon? Pancakes? What\u2019s your poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes and yes.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll order everything they have. It\u2019ll look like a buffet because I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in amazement. \u201cYou put away a lot of food just a few hours ago. How can you possibly be starving again?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her and picked up the phone.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, she stepped out of the shower feeling somewhat revived, and after drying herself, she put her hair up in a towel, pulled on one of the big, fluffy robes the hotel provided and padded back into the room to figure out what to wear.</p><p>She was back in the bathroom drying her hair and fluffing it out when Connor hollered that the food had arrived. She didn\u2019t have makeup on yet, but she was tempted to go au naturel. She didn\u2019t often go without full treatment, hair, nails, outfit and makeup because she literally never knew when and where she might be photographed.</p><p>Today she just wanted to be . . . normal. Unrecognized. Anonymous\u2014and not only because she had some lunatic freaking her out. Okay, so that was the biggest reason, but the other was simply she was looking forward to being around people she could actually be herself with.</p><p>She walked back into the hotel room to see Connor putting a dent in the array of food arranged on the serving cart. If she wanted to eat, she needed to wade in and rescue something before he ate it all.</p><p>\u201cDo you always eat so much?\u201d she asked once she was cross-legged on the bed, her plate in front of her.</p><p>He frowned and stopped chewing for a minute. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten much in the last couple of days. Been too busy with you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. If he considered what he\u2019d eaten \u201cnot much,\u201d she\u2019d hate to see what he considered a normal appetite.</p><p>\u201cI bet you ran your parents ragged trying to keep you fed. You probably ate them out of house and home.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cPop may have complained a time or two.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze roved up and down his lean, muscled body and she shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you put it. I think I hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work out,\u201d he defended. \u201cNot like all I do is sit around and eat.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYeah, I bet you work out like once a week. It\u2019s obvious you\u2019re one of these people blessed with good genes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you? You aren\u2019t exactly a delicate miss when it comes to eating and what are you, a size two?\u201d</p><p>She nearly choked on her food. Maybe this guy didn\u2019t have as much experience with women as she thought. \u201cI\u2019m a twelve. Sometimes a ten. I\u2019ve been as high as a fourteen. No, nothing huge but not bone-thin either. I have to work hard to keep it under a ten. When I\u2019m on tour I keep my weight down because performing almost every night keeps me fit. But when I\u2019m not on tour and writing songs or in the recording studio, I gain weight just looking at food. I have to have a strict exercise regimen to keep it under control.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI think you\u2019re pretty damn perfect as you are. You don\u2019t need to be any thinner.\u201d</p><p>Then again, maybe he had plenty experience with women, because he sure knew what to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m straining the waists of my size twelves right now,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m at the end of my tour and the shows are further apart and I\u2019ve been stress-eating. Not the best habit in the world, but there you have it. I have a weakness for salty and sweet. Carbs. I love carbs.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed and she could feel his gaze examining her. His frown grew fiercer as he met her eyes. \u201cYou look just fine like you are.\u201d</p><p>Warm pleasure bathed her cheeks until she was sure she glowed. In her world she was never perfect. She had fitness trainers telling her she needed to shed pounds. Her manager telling her what she could or couldn\u2019t eat. Even her stylist waded in with her opinion and clucked at Lyric whenever her outfits got too tight.</p><p>And yet Connor was positively glowering at the idea that she needed to lose weight.</p><p>She beamed at him and polished off her breakfast, then chugged down an entire glass of orange juice. She nearly groaned with pleasure. She loved juices but had been forbidden to drink pretty much anything but water.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Connor asked when she pushed her plate away.</p><p>\u201cYum. That was fantastic.\u201d</p><p>He checked his watch. \u201cYou have a few minutes. Micah and the driver are coming up for you. I don\u2019t want you standing around in the lobby where you\u2019re visible while you wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I need to brush my teeth.\u201d</p><p>She bounced off the bed feeling better than she had in days despite the fact she hadn\u2019t caught up on her sleep. She brushed out her hair one more time and left it loose. Then she cleaned her teeth, gargled with mouthwash and checked her appearance in the mirror.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t stop traffic but she didn\u2019t look all bad. And there was a lightness to her eyes she hadn\u2019t noticed in a long time. She smiled back at her reflection, decided she\u2019d survive being seen without makeup again and then left the bathroom.</p><p>Connor was on the phone. He turned and held a finger up to Lyric and then said, \u201cI\u2019ll have her right down.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow as he shoved his cell phone back into his pocket. \u201cI thought they were coming up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam is parked at the side employee entrance. We\u2019re going to go out that way. You won\u2019t even be outside a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my office to meet with the security team your label hired. I want to make damn sure they\u2019re competent enough to do the job. I\u2019ll come get you when I\u2019m done. In the meantime, I\u2019m having a few guys come in and clear out your hotel room, so if there\u2019s anything you need, get it now.\u201d</p><p>She scooped up her purse, looked to make sure her wallet, sunglasses and phone were still in it and then slung it over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, Connor rushed her into the back of a Bentley and she blinked at the sumptuous leather and the obvious expense of the luxury car. She was a freaking rock star and she didn\u2019t get to ride around in vehicles like these. Any wannabe could hitch a ride in a limo, but these wheels cost some serious cash.</p><p>The driver was a broad-shouldered boulder of a man who filled the driver\u2019s seat. The steering wheel looked small in his hands, like it would break off if he turned it too hard. He flicked a glance at her in the rearview mirror but his eyes were covered with dark shades, and his bald head gleamed like he\u2019d just shaved it that morning.</p><p>Micah Hudson slid into the backseat next to her and Connor slammed her door. The driver roared off down the side street and pulled into traffic.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d Micah asked conversationally.</p><p>She eyed him warily, not comfortable with the fact that it was he and not Connor who was riding with her.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Angelina?\u201d</p><p>Micah\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cNo way I\u2019d let her come along. I don\u2019t want her anywhere near potential trouble.\u201d</p><p>Lyric shrugged. Like she wanted to be near \u201cpotential trouble\u201d either?</p><p>A half hour later they drove through the entrance of a sprawling estate. She glanced back to see the heavy security gate swing closed behind them. To her further surprise she caught a glimpse of a big dude who looked suspiciously like he was carrying an automatic rifle. Holy hell, was she at some compound for a crazy cult?</p><p>They pulled around the circle drive and parked directly in front of the palatial house. Micah got out and the driver opened her door and hovered protectively over her as he escorted her the few steps to the entrance.</p><p>Okay, she liked safety as much as the next person, but this seemed a little . . . overdone. It wasn\u2019t as if she was rolling up to a concert and had thousands of fans all pushing to get a glimpse or a piece of her. There was . . . no one. The grounds were so quiet that she could hear birds chirping. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was ushered inside the McMansion and the driver took her into the living room where she saw women sprawled all over the furniture.</p><p>Lyric relaxed and smiled. She recognized Faith, Julie and, of course, Angelina right away, but there was another woman, long and sleek and so freaking beautiful that she made Lyric take a step back and curse the fact she hadn\u2019t worn makeup. She was tempted to pull the shades over her eyes, not that it would hide the fact she wasn\u2019t even wearing concealer.</p><p>To cover up her nervousness, she spread her hands out, palms up, and announced, \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>The women turned and Faith shot up from the couch and hurried over to give Lyric a hug. Which was kind of weird but at the same time gave her an honest-to-God warm fuzzy. Lyric was a little shell-shocked as Faith dragged her over to the others.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met Julie and Angelina, of course, but you haven\u2019t met Serena Roche yet.\u201d</p><p>Tall and elegant, Serena rose from the couch, her long black hair swinging like silk down her back. Lyric couldn\u2019t help but stare. The woman had such an exotic beauty and startling blue eyes to contrast the midnight hair.</p><p>She extended her hand and for a moment Lyric just stared at it\u2014and the glittering, huge-ass diamond ring that adorned her third finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to meet you, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d</p> <p>A tall, extremely handsome man walked into the living room, and when his gaze rested on Serena, he lit up. It didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out this was her husband, Damon Roche.</p><p>He had that rich GQ look. Polished, arrogant and extremely confident. He came up to stand beside Serena, his hand sliding up her back to tangle in her hair.</p><p>\u201cMs. Jones,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cWelcome to our home. Serena and I are happy to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m sorry to be a bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no bother. Micah tells me you\u2019ve had some trouble. I can assure you that while you are here, nothing will bother you.\u201d</p><p>Strangely enough, she absolutely believed him. He didn\u2019t strike her as a man who made empty boasts. He was too damn self-assured.</p> <p>\u201cCan I offer you refreshment, Ms. Jones?\u201d Damon asked.</p><p>Remembering just how much she\u2019d eaten at breakfast, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cCome sit,\u201d Faith urged. \u201cWe have a complete girly day planned. Julie\u2019s even going to give us massages later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know who the hell\u2019s going to give me a massage,\u201d Julie grumbled.</p><p>\u201cOh, hush. You know Nathan will be more than happy to give you one later,\u201d Serena said impishly.</p><p>\u201cNot that girly fun isn\u2019t high on my list of priorities, but us menfolk are going to excuse ourselves,\u201d Damon said dryly.</p><p>He drew Serena to him and kissed her forehead. There was such a look of possession in his eyes that Lyric shivered. Did every one of these women have a man who absolutely adored her? Lyric had never wanted to stab anyone more in her life. And now she had to spend an afternoon with them, and they\u2019d probably go on and on and on about how wonderful their husbands or significant others or whatever the hell they called them were.</p><p>Damon and Micah departed, talking among themselves, but the driver remained conspicuously behind, taking position in the doorway to the living room.</p> <p>The women retook their positions and Lyric plopped on the couch next to Angelina, who had her feet curled beneath her and was propped against a pillow.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you due?\u201d Lyric asked as she glanced down at Angelina\u2019s belly.</p><p>Angelina grimaced. \u201cI still have three months if you can believe it. I swear I\u2019m ready to burst now.\u201d</p><p>Lyric\u2019s eyes widened. Maybe it was because Angelina was so petite but she looked like she\u2019d swallowed enough helium to float a hot-air balloon.</p><p>\u201cSo tell us what\u2019s going on with this freak who\u2019s stalking you, Lyric,\u201d Julie said.</p><p>Lyric sighed. \u201cWell, since my record label didn\u2019t see fit to tell me anything and Connor just informed me day before yesterday, I don\u2019t know a whole lot. Apparently he\u2019s been sending me creepy notes and putting them in places he shouldn\u2019t have access to. Then yesterday he called and left a message on my hotel phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what is Connor going to do?\u201d Faith asked anxiously.</p><p>Lyric shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s meeting with whatever security firm my label hired, which is why I\u2019m here. Makes more sense for me to be there, but I think Connor is afraid I\u2019ll throw some tantrum.\u201d</p><p>Julie eyed her with a glimmer of humor in her eyes. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Depends on what they had to say. Or how brainless they thought I was. And I don\u2019t throw tantrums. I just voice my displeasure in a loud manner.\u201d</p><p>Serena and Angelina laughed. And then Serena leaned forward. \u201cI have to admit you look a lot different than I expected. Damon and I saw one of your shows in Vegas. You were so flashy and glamorous.\u201d</p><p>Lyric winced and Serena put her hand to her mouth. \u201cNot that you aren\u2019t now. Oh hell. I\u2019ll shut up now.\u201d</p><p>Lyric laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t usually go anywhere without full makeup and wardrobe, but Connor seems to think the lower profile I am, the better. I haven\u2019t even colored my hair since my last show. The first time Connor met me, I had pink hair. I don\u2019t think he was impressed.\u201d</p><p>Faith snickered and Julie rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s because Connor has a stick up his ass,\u201d Julie retorted.</p><p>\u201cJulie, he does not,\u201d Faith defended. \u201cYou\u2019re always accusing him of being uptight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good assessment, I\u2019d say,\u201d Lyric muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a total sweetheart,\u201d Angelina said.</p><p>Lyric rolled her eyes. \u201cOh sure, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>The other women burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cShe totally has you there,\u201d Serena snickered.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I could do your hair,\u201d Julie said thoughtfully. \u201cIce blue would look awesome with all that black hair. If you don\u2019t want to be too noticeable, we could just do the tips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lyric asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a terrific stylist,\u201d Faith said in a proud voice. \u201cShe owns her own business. She does hair, nails, massages.\u201d</p><p>Serena nodded. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s our Jill\u2014or Julie\u2014of all trades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor would have a kitten if I left here. Maybe we could work it out one day when you\u2019re free,\u201d Lyric said.</p><p>Julie grinned. \u201cOh, we could send Sam out for what I need and we could do it here. One of you might have to forfeit a massage, but it could totally be done.\u201d</p><p>Lyric twirled the ends of a thick strand and pulled it up to look, imagining how it would look dyed blue. She shrugged. \u201cHell, I\u2019ll try anything once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I like her,\u201d Angelina said, her eyes sparkling with mischief.</p><p>\u201cYou would,\u201d Serena said. \u201cShe\u2019s our resident wild child,\u201d she explained to Lyric.</p><p>Lyric\u2019s brows went up. Sweet, angelic-looking Angelina? Beneath Angelina\u2019s dusky skin, color bloomed and she ducked her head.</p><p>\u201cBoy, that was a guilty look of acknowledgment if I ever saw one,\u201d Lyric said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s true what they say. It\u2019s the innocent-looking ones you have to watch out for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Julie chimed in. \u201cFaith being a very close second in the heathen department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulie! Hush!\u201d</p><p>Faith had turned bright red as a flush crept all the way up her throat and into her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to feel frighteningly boring and normal,\u201d Lyric said in bemusement. \u201cI assure you that never happens. I\u2019m usually the one people are looking at like I just lit my hair on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to do hair and whatever else we get inspiration for, I say we need wine,\u201d Serena spoke up.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t drink,\u201d Lyric was quick to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Julie scowled. \u201cHow can you be such a famous diva and not drink? Haven\u2019t you ever gotten drunk and been arrested for indecent exposure or something?\u201d</p><p>Lyric smirked. \u201cDepends on which tabloid you read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You don\u2019t drink?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cToday you do,\u201d Serena said as she turned and motioned for the driver. \u201cSam, can you bring us a few bottles of wine? Ask Damon for a suggestion. He\u2019ll pick something good.\u201d</p><p>As Sam departed, Serena turned and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m pretty wine stupid. I mean, I love it, but know nothing about it. Damon, on the other hand, knows what wine you\u2019re supposed to have with what food and what occasions, et cetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does serve good wine,\u201d Faith agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy with any of you,\u201d Angelina pouted. \u201cI can\u2019t have any wine, which means you all will have all the fun while I\u2019m sitting here as big as a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get the first massage,\u201d Julie soothed.</p><p>Two hours and six wine bottles later, Lyric couldn\u2019t remember what her aversion to alcohol was. The wine was good. The world was good. The company was good. Everything was good.</p><p>And the room was spinning like a merry-go-round from hell.</p><p>She was sitting dutifully still as Julie worked on her hair.</p><p>\u201cHow much has she had to drink?\u201d Lyric asked, gesturing over her shoulder to Julie.</p><p>Julie reached over Lyric\u2019s shoulder and plucked a half-full wineglass and drained it. She set it back down with a thump. \u201cNot nearly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching her. She hasn\u2019t had so much that it would impair her hair-doing skills,\u201d Serena said in a solemn voice.</p><p>Faith giggled. \u201cHair doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what else do you call it?\u201d Serena asked in exasperation. \u201cYou look like an alien with all the aluminum foil, Lyric. Very impressive.\u201d</p><p>Lyric smothered her laughter. Of any of them, Serena had drunk the most, and the girl was flying high. Although Lyric had to be close behind her because Serena kept filling her glass. And then the wine disappeared. It was the damnedest thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done here,\u201d Julie announced. \u201cWell, for the next twenty anyway. Then we\u2019ll rinse you and dry you and voila, you\u2019ll be Smurftastic.\u201d</p><p>Angelina shot Julie a baleful look. \u201cSmurftastic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, the Smurfs. Little blue people? Smurfette? Get it?\u201d</p><p>Angelina\u2019s expression was blank.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too young,\u201d Julie grumbled. \u201cAnd clearly your education is lacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmurfette was hot,\u201d Lyric said gravely.</p><p>Faith nodded. \u201cAgreed. Maybe we should all get our hair blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that would be fun!\u201d Serena exclaimed. \u201cIt would be worth it to see the looks on the guys\u2019 faces. How long does the color last, Julie?\u201d</p><p>Julie scowled. \u201cLike I want Damon kicking my ass?\u201d</p><p>Serena waved in Julie\u2019s direction like she was an annoying insect. \u201cCome on. We could do it in support of Lyric. Our sister from another mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how much have you had to drink, Serena?\u201d Julie asked.</p><p>Serena paused to pour another glass and tipped it in the direction of the other women. \u201cNot nearly enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Faith said slowly. \u201cWould blue tips look good on blond?\u201d</p><p>Julie arched an eyebrow in Faith\u2019s direction. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It could be fun. We could be like Lyric\u2019s fan club, and if Connor tries to give her shit, we could beat the crap out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you the good sister defending him a while ago?\u201d Angelina asked, her eyes dancing with merriment.</p><p>\u201cJust because I don\u2019t think he has a stick up his ass doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be a typical mule-headed male. Oh, I know! We could even get tickets to go see Lyric at the rodeo. We\u2019ll be all in the know since we\u2019d have hair just like hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer concert is sold out,\u201d Julie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOh I could get you guys tickets if you really wanted to come,\u201d Lyric said and then promptly hiccupped. Then she giggled. Then everyone started laughing. Lyric hiccupped some more and the room dissolved into fits of laughter. Why hiccups were so funny, Lyric wasn\u2019t sure, but the more she hiccupped, the more she laughed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, if we\u2019re going to get this done, I need to get you girls started pronto. Otherwise Damon and Micah are going to come lurking to be nosy and then we\u2019ll be busted. You in, Angelina?\u201d Julie asked, looking over at her.</p><p>Angelina grinned. \u201cYeah. I think it will be fun.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Connor got out of his truck and waited for Nathan and Gray to catch up to him before he went up to Damon Roche\u2019s front door. He\u2019d asked Nathan and Gray to sit in on his meeting with Lyric\u2019s security team, and the two men had agreed to lend their services whenever Connor needed them. It made him feel better to have at least two men that he could trust.</p><p>Gray gazed up at the imposing stone and wooden home and then grinned over at Connor and Nathan. \u201cThe house is still standing, so that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Connor frowned. \u201cLyric isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>Nathan chuckled. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t referring to Lyric. Interesting things happen when our women get together.\u201d</p><p>Gray knocked on the door and the three waited. A moment later, Sam opened the door and gave them a slightly wary look. He crossed his arms and managed to fill most of the doorway as if he was reluctant to let them past.</p><p>\u201cThe ladies are currently unavailable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Nathan muttered.</p><p>Gray wiped a hand over his face and just shook his head.</p><p>Connor eyed them all in confusion.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it would be best if you waited in the sitting room while I inform the ladies that you are here,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cHell, Sam, we\u2019re not going to beat them,\u201d Gray grumbled.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s way protective of the women,\u201d Nathan whispered to Connor. \u201cHe spoils them shamelessly and indulges them in their every whim.\u201d</p><p>Sam glared at Nathan. \u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Damon asked from behind Sam. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you invited them in?\u201d</p><p>Sam turned and grimaced. \u201cHave you been in to see the ladies yet, sir?\u201d</p><p>Damon frowned and shook his head. \u201cMicah and I have left them to their own devices.\u201d</p><p>Sam sighed and stepped back so that Connor, Nathan and Gray could enter. \u201cThey\u2019re having fun. Remember that.\u201d</p> <p>Micah muttered an expletive, and Damon\u2019s forehead creased with worry.</p><p>Connor fell into step between Micah and Damon and Nathan and Gray as they headed farther inside the house. As they drew closer, peals of laughter filled the air. Then there was quiet. And suddenly another chorus of laughter.</p><p>Damon held up a finger, motioning for the men to be quiet as they rounded the corner and stood back from the doorway to the living room.</p><p>Connor blinked as he absorbed the scene in front of him. \u201cWhat the ever-loving hell?\u201d</p><p>He stared in astonishment as all five women, each holding a wineglass with the exception of Angelina, were gathered in the middle of the room dancing. Perhaps more notably, every last one of them had blue hair! Or at least partially blue. The last two inches of their hair looked like it had been dipped in blue dye, and he supposed that was what had happened given that Julie was a stylist.</p><p>Faith and Serena each had an arm around Lyric while Angelina and Julie stood across from them, and they were all singing loudly. Or trying to. They\u2019d get a few lines out and then dissolve into laughter.</p><p>They swayed and danced, though it was obvious copious amounts of alcohol had compromised any grace they possessed. Faith nearly went down and Lyric made a grab for her. Faith held up her wineglass\u2014it was a miracle the floors weren\u2019t covered with wine\u2014and the women cheered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sin to waste good wine,\u201d Serena said solemnly. \u201cDamon always says so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind when I said that,\u201d Damon muttered beside Connor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that!\u201d Faith said as she raised her glass.</p><p>Julie held up her glass with exaggerated solemnity. Lyric followed suit, then Serena. Connor gaped as they drained their glasses, then set them down with a bang.</p><p>Angelina shot them disgruntled looks and stuck out her bottom lip.</p><p>Julie patted her. \u201cWe\u2019ll get together after Nia is born. Micah can babysit and we\u2019ll take you out. Lyric could even fly in for the occasion. Don\u2019t all you rock stars have private jets and the like?\u201d</p><p>Lyric held up her empty glass and peered inside it as if wondering how it got that way. \u201cYeah, sure. I\u2019ll tell my manager I want one. Should be a snap.\u201d She tried to snap her fingers and giggled when she couldn\u2019t get her fingers to perform right.</p><p>\u201cWell, if not, I\u2019ll make Damon send his jet for you,\u201d Serena promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you forget this,\u201d Angelina said.</p><p>\u201cWell hell,\u201d Micah muttered from his position behind Connor.</p><p>Nathan snickered and Gray wiped at his wide grin.</p><p>\u201cBoy, does this bring back memories,\u201d Gray said with a chuckle. \u201cThe last time they got this drunk, Nathan found them all on the floor of Cattleman\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Connor sighed. Then he laughed. He couldn\u2019t help it. They were all pretty damn cute. Drunk as skunks and about as steady as an alcoholic who hadn\u2019t had a drink in twenty-four hours.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s going to break this up?\u201d Nathan asked.</p><p>\u201cOr we could just leave them,\u201d Damon said.</p><p>Serena pulled loose from Lyric and Faith and stumbled over to the coffee table where several empty wine bottles rested. \u201cUh-oh. We\u2019re out of wine. Sam? Sam! Sam, we need more wine. Can you bring us some?\u201d she called.</p><p>Connor looked at Sam with new respect. \u201cWhat all have they had you bring them, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Sam straightened his stance. \u201cIt would be disloyal of me to give any detail of their afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that hair color sticking out of your pocket?\u201d Damon asked as he stared down at Sam\u2019s pants.</p><p>Sam clamped his hand over his pocket and backed away. \u201cI\u2019ll go see to their wine if you have no objections, sir.\u201d</p><p>Damon laughed and looked up at the other men. \u201cWell, what do you say? We can go out on the patio and have a beer or two while we wait for them to wind down. Unless you need to go, Connor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m having her stuff removed from her hotel right now and transferred to the house we\u2019ll be staying at. Her label has rented a place for her to stay and the team has gone ahead to take make it ready and take position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go have a beer. Sam will take good care of them and we can check on them later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a confession to make,\u201d Lyric said as she flopped onto the couch. She leaned forward and put her finger over her lips. \u201cBut shhhh! You can\u2019t tell anyone. If it shows up in the tabloids, I\u2019ll know you told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we won\u2019t tell,\u201d Faith said as she slashed her fingers over her chest in a cross-my-heart gesture.</p><p>\u201cSpill,\u201d Julie said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to know the deep, dark secrets of the rich and famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t dance,\u201d Lyric slurred out.</p><p>The other women broke into laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call what we\u2019ve been doing for the last hour?\u201d Serena demanded.</p><p>Lyric held up a finger, though it waved precariously. \u201cPerformers can do just about any ridiculous move onstage and it looks cool. But really, if you really look at it, it\u2019s hysterical. I have no rhythm. I never could dance. I just sort of make up stuff as I go, but once, I got carried away and tripped onstage. For weeks the magazines reported that I\u2019d been high while performing.\u201d She shook her head back and forth. \u201cNope. Never been high.\u201d She giggled. \u201cUntil now. I just can\u2019t dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssholes,\u201d Faith said solemnly. \u201cShitheads.\u201d</p><p>Angelina cracked up. \u201cAre you practicing your naughty words, Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucktard,\u201d Julie added.</p><p>Serena got into the spirit. \u201cPissant. Dickhead. Twat.\u201d</p><p>Lyric covered her ears. \u201cYou guys have to stop. I\u2019m not used to such vulgar language.\u201d</p><p>They all stared with raised eyebrows while Lyric blinked innocently. Then they all fell back in their seats and died laughing again.</p><p>Sam appeared, looking discomfited. He held two bottles in his hands but hadn\u2019t opened them. \u201cIf you would pardon the observation, I can\u2019t help but think maybe you\u2019ve had enough to drink today. I wouldn\u2019t like for any of you to become ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean he doesn\u2019t want us to puke?\u201d Julie asked blearily.</p><p>\u201cThat too,\u201d Sam added.</p><p>Lyric waved him off. \u201cFine by me. I hate puking. Did I tell you guys I don\u2019t drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did,\u201d Julie snickered. \u201cNo one resists our charm for long. And it\u2019s not every day we get to be a bad influence on a pop diva.\u201d</p><p>Lyric yawned widely. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>Faith patted the pillow at her hip. \u201cLie down and get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bad idea,\u201d Serena said. \u201cMaybe then the room would stop spinning.\u201d</p><p>Lyric sprawled on the couch and leaned against Faith. She meant to close her eyes for just a moment but the next thing she knew she was being gently shaken awake.</p><p>She blinked but all she could make out was a blurry face. His mouth moved and she could swear he sounded like Connor\u2014if Connor were to talk to her through a really long tunnel.</p><p>She frowned and tried to shove him away, then snuggled against Faith\u2019s hip again. Faith\u2019s hip? Lyric pushed herself up to see that Faith was passed out, half hanging over the arm of the couch. Lyric was sprawled over Faith and when Lyric looked down, she saw that Serena was half lying over Lyric\u2019s legs.</p><p>Julie was sprawled in an armchair and only Angelina was awake and alert, her eyes dancing with amusement.</p><p>Then Lyric glanced around to see that the room was full of men who were all valiantly trying to keep from laughing. She scowled at them all but it only broadened their grins.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name did you all do to your hair?\u201d Connor asked in exasperation as he fingered one of Lyric\u2019s blue tips.</p><p>\u201cAt least they didn\u2019t get tattoos,\u201d Gray muttered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give them any ideas,\u201d Nathan snapped.</p><p>Serena stirred and lifted her head, her eyes so blurry that Lyric was sure she had no clue where she was.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s talking?\u201d Serena demanded. \u201cSam, make them shut up.\u201d</p><p>Damon chuckled and reached down to run his fingers through Serena\u2019s hair. \u201cDoes your head hurt, Serena mine? It should. You put quite a dent in my wine cellar.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and arched into his touch, and it was then that Lyric saw the intricate gold band around Serena\u2019s upper arm, bared when her sleeve rose with her movements.</p><p>Damon\u2019s hand ventured lower to stroke the band, his fingers tracing the lines. He stroked her skin and the jewelry in a possessive manner that clearly told anyone watching she belonged to him.</p><p>It made Lyric\u2019s chest tighten in a funny way she didn\u2019t understand, and she shifted to alleviate the discomfort.</p><p>\u201cWe need to be going, Lyric,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>She appreciated that he kept his voice low. She already felt overwhelmed. And while it had been fun while it was going on, she was pretty sure she never wanted to drink again.</p><p>Connor chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone says after the high is gone.\u201d</p><p>She cracked her eye open again as she realized she\u2019d spoken the last part aloud. Or maybe he was just a good mind reader.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get up,\u201d she said. And she couldn\u2019t. \u201cI can\u2019t even feel my legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m lying on them,\u201d Serena volunteered.</p><p>Damon laughed and then reached down and lifted Serena from the couch.</p><p>\u201cFaith is comfy,\u201d Lyric mumbled.</p><p>Connor carefully slid his arms underneath Lyric and she found herself lifted weightlessly into the air. It was a little disconcerting since the room immediately began spinning again.</p><p>She glanced over to see Nathan leaning over Julie in her armchair. Micah sat next to Angelina and both of them looked on with amusement. She glared at Angelina. \u201cDon\u2019t forget you\u2019re next. And I\u2019m damn well flying in for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay good-bye, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>Lyric held up a hand and fluttered her fingers. \u201cGood-bye, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a party pooper, Connor,\u201d Faith said with a frown. \u201cWe were just starting to really have fun and now you\u2019re taking her away.\u201d</p><p>Gray snorted. \u201cBaby, you were all passed out cold on the furniture. I\u2019d say you already had more fun than human beings should be allowed.\u201d</p><p>Lyric laid her head on Connor\u2019s chest and sighed. \u201cYou have a really nice chest, Connor. Has anyone ever told you that?\u201d</p><p>He grunted in response and started toward the door.</p><p>\u201cBye, everyone,\u201d she called back. \u201cLove you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love you too!\u201d the women chorused.</p><p>The men rolled their eyes and Connor continued on out of the living room. Sam appeared at the door to open it for Connor. Then he followed Connor to Lyric\u2019s BMW and opened the back door so Connor could slide her in.</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself, Miss Lyric,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>She smiled and blew the older man a kiss. \u201cYou rock, Sam. I\u2019m going to steal you away from Serena.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and then retreated, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever need me, don\u2019t hesitate to call,\u201d Sam said to Connor.</p><p>Connor hesitated, wondering just what this man\u2019s background was. \u201cThanks. I appreciate that, and I\u2019m sure she does as well.\u201d</p><p>Sam turned to walk back to the house and Connor slid into the driver\u2019s seat. He glanced back at Lyric in the rearview mirror to see that she was already out like a light, sprawled across the backseat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed and shook his head as he cranked the engine and drove away.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Lyric wouldn\u2019t meet her security team under the best of circumstances. She was still out cold in the backseat when Connor drove up to the guard station of the house that would be Lyric\u2019s temporary home.</p><p>Two members of the security team manned the gate and waved Connor through. He drove up the drive and into the garage. As soon as he stepped out, Kane Murphy, who had command of the team, met him in the garage.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is the subject?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>Connor didn\u2019t answer him and opened the door to the backseat. He reached in and carefully pulled Lyric into his arms. She was as limp as a rag doll but when he hoisted her against his chest, she turned and cuddled into him.</p><p>Kane raised one brow. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and the girls got drunk,\u201d Connor said dryly.</p><p>\u201cMust have been one hell of a party.\u201d</p> <p>Connor pushed by him and into the house. \u201cHave her things been delivered?\u201d</p><p>Kane shut the door. \u201cYeah. Master suite is arranged. Yours is the adjoining room. My men are stationed around the perimeter and we\u2019ll be rotating watches in twelve-hour shifts.\u201d</p><p>Connor nodded and carried Lyric up the stairs to her bedroom. It was a far cry from the tiny hotel room where she\u2019d holed up. The entire house was a study in luxury without being over-the-top. Whoever had built it had ultimate comfort in mind.</p><p>He set her down on the king-sized bed, hesitated and then moved into the master bathroom. A huge overflow bathtub was the focal point and stood in the middle of the room on a raised platform. There was a dual-head shower to the far right and a separate compartment for the toilet.</p><p>A bath might sober her up, but she might drown in it too. Maybe a shower was a better option.</p><p>He walked back into the bedroom and shook his head in amusement again. \u201cLyric. Lyric,\u201d he said louder. \u201cCome on, honey, wake up. Time for you to sober up.\u201d</p> <p>She made a sound of irritation and turned on her side away from him. He crawled onto the bed, following her over. He touched her shoulder and pulled her until she was on her back again.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get up and do it yourself, I\u2019m going to strip you and put you in the shower myself.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open at that.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThought that might get you moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cGet off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on you. If I\u2019m ever on you, you\u2019ll know it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and he heard the swift intake of her breath. He couldn\u2019t tell if it was panic or curiosity that invaded her gaze. If she wasn\u2019t shit-faced, he\u2019d test the theory and kiss her. But she was, and he was a flaming hypocrite.</p><p>He bitched about her fuck-buddy bodyguards and how if they were fucking her, they weren\u2019t protecting her, and now he was thinking of little other than what it would be like to be buried balls deep in her sweet heat.</p> <p>Christ. He hadn\u2019t been on this job for a week yet and he\u2019d already lost focus.</p><p>He shoved himself off the bed and strode for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll give you an hour before I\u2019m back. I need to take you down and introduce you to your security team. For the next two weeks, you\u2019ll eat, breathe and sleep these guys. You go nowhere without them\u2014or me.\u201d</p><p>Lyric sat up and dragged her hair behind her ear. \u201cOkay. I get it. Don\u2019t get all pissy with me.\u201d</p><p>Connor nodded and then stalked out the door, needing to put as much distance between them as he could. His hands shook. Never in his life had he been so helpless in his attraction to a woman. He could control a response. He\u2019d never lost his cool or his control, but Lyric threatened both.</p><p>The next two weeks were going to be a test of his will that he didn\u2019t think he had a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of passing.</p><p>Lyric rubbed furiously at her eyes to try to dust the cobwebs from her muddled brain. She shoved up from the bed and waited to gain her bearings before trudging toward the bathroom.</p><p>She turned on the shower and went over to check her appearance in the mirror. She grinned in delight when she saw the blue shimmer at the ends of her hair. It looked great. Julie had done a fantastic job. Lyric wished she hadn\u2019t been quite so drunk so she remembered Connor\u2019s reaction to it.</p><p>She turned, looking for her toiletries, and to her surprise saw her bags neatly stacked on the vanity. She rummaged through one of the boxes and dug out a scrunchie to put her hair up in.</p><p>Steam poured from the shower as she stripped out of her clothes. She couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>Hot water sluiced over her skin and she moaned in sheer delight. Some of the muck rinsed and her mind cleared as she tilted her head up and let the water run down her body.</p><p>For several long minutes, she simply stood there, vowing all the time that she\u2019d never drink again.</p><p>About the time she was on the verge of boiling herself, she turned off the water and stepped out to dry off.</p><p>She wandered back into her room wrapped in a towel and went through the clothes that hung in her closet. If she had to meet a bunch of men charged with babysitting her, she wanted to look killer.</p><p>Connor said an hour, but she took an hour and a half. When she walked out of her bathroom, makeup and hair perfectly arranged, Connor was sitting on the edge of her bed. He made a show of looking at his watch as she sauntered over.</p><p>\u201cSober?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun with the girls?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYeah, I did. I like them. I like them a lot. I don\u2019t have many women friends. Okay, try no women friends. Or friends period. It\u2019s kind of nice to think they might fill the bill even if they\u2019re just pretending.\u201d</p><p>Connor frowned. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t pretend. They\u2019re good girls. None better anywhere. They\u2019re genuine. And trust me, Julie doesn\u2019t pretend to like anyone.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle escaped Lyric. \u201cYeah, I got that impression. She\u2019s cool, though. I like her. It\u2019s hard to find honest, straightforward people in my line of work. Everyone lies. No one tells the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour line of work sucks.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYeah, I suppose to someone like you it would. I don\u2019t expect honesty. I assume everyone is out to fuck me. At least that way I\u2019m not disappointed and I can do my job without being an emotional wreck every time I figure out someone isn\u2019t who I think they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no way to live. Damn it, Lyric. Don\u2019t you think you deserve a better life than that?\u201d</p><p>Startled by the vehemence in his voice, she cocked her head to the side. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad life, Connor. Singing\u2019s what I always wanted to do. Putting up with disingenuous people is just a part of it all. A sacrifice for getting to do what I love.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and touched her cheek, his palm sliding gently over her skin. \u201cYou deserve better.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and rubbed her cheek against his hand. For once the idea of being . . . alone . . . with him didn\u2019t bother her. She liked this. Something so simple as his touch. It was nonthreatening. He wasn\u2019t like the others and she took great comfort in that.</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like for the next two weeks, at least, I\u2019m going to have better,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>His gaze bored into her, caressing her skin as surely as if he touched her. \u201cCount on it.\u201d</p><p>God help her, but she was actually looking forward to her confinement with Connor Malone. What started out as a giant pain in her ass had turned into a break from reality that she desperately needed\u2014and wanted. She wanted it so bad she ached.</p><p>He reached slowly for her hand and curled his fingers around hers. \u201cCome on. I need to introduce you to the guys who are going to make sure you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>She followed him down the stairs, her hand tucked into his the whole way. Only when they got to the bottom did he let hers fall away. His demeanor changed and he became all business as soon as they entered the living room where half a dozen men were watching television.</p><p>One of them pointed the remote and turned off the TV as the rest rose and focused their attention on her.</p><p>\u201cMs. Jones,\u201d the one with the remote said as he stepped forward. \u201cKane Murphy. I\u2019ll be heading your security team for the next two weeks.\u201d</p><p>She frowned even as she took his extended hand and shook it. The man was drop-dead gorgeous. He had the look of a total badass. Muscular. Menacing. He had a \u201cdon\u2019t fuck with me\u201d look and piercing blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought Connor was in charge.\u201d She didn\u2019t like that panic raced up her spine at the thought of Connor bailing. She looked over at him, for some sign of reassurance.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely he is,\u201d Kane said smoothly. \u201cI report to him. The rest of the team, however, reports to me. They\u2019re my team. We work together. Connor sticks to you. We stick to you and him.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed and even managed a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you then, Kane.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and then turned to the other men assembled. \u201cThis is Davidson, McElroy, Hennesey, Tatum and Markowitz. I don\u2019t expect you to remember their names. You won\u2019t be seeing much of them unless you need to. If you yell, we come running. No names are necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness. I\u2019m terrible with names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is only half of my team.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. How many people did it take to protect one person?</p><p>\u201cThe other half is posted on the perimeter of the grounds. We rotate watches. In addition to the security system that is available at this residence, my team will mount around-the-clock surveillance. No one gets in or out of the grounds without our permission. That means you. You don\u2019t go anywhere without Connor and the men I assign to your detail. You\u2019ll listen to everything we tell you, and when we give an order, do not question it. Your hesitation could mean the difference between life and death. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>She was tempted to come to attention and snap a salute. If she wasn\u2019t half-afraid of him, she\u2019d do just that, but he didn\u2019t strike her as a man who had a sense of humor. And to think she thought Connor was uptight.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said crisply, unable to ignore the demon propped on her shoulder.</p><p>Kane eyed her coolly. \u201cI\u2019ve never lost a person in the ten years I\u2019ve been working personal security. I damn well won\u2019t start now. Give me any trouble whatsoever and I\u2019ll lock you in your room for the next two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. Damn if he was going to get away with bossing her around like that. Connor was the only one who could get away with issuing her orders, and she had no explanation for why that was.</p><p>\u201cYou just try it, Mr. Murphy,\u201d she bit out.</p><p>Connor\u2019s hand smoothed over her shoulder and he gave her a warning squeeze. \u201cEnough, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>To her irritation, she quieted and went still. Like a freaking dog coming to heel. What the hell ever.</p><p>\u201cYou keep him away from me,\u201d Lyric said to Connor.</p><p>\u201cBehave and I\u2019ll gladly oblige,\u201d Kane offered smoothly.</p><p>Again Connor\u2019s hand tightened on her shoulder, a silent warning that she resented. Apparently she was expected to be on her best behavior and everyone else got to treat her like an idiot.</p><p>She hated how her life kept spiraling more out of control. She hated not being in control.</p><p>She turned to Connor and had to resist walking into his arms. \u201cAre we done here?\u201d</p><p>Connor nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get something to eat then.\u201d</p><p>Connor let his hand slide from her shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go into the kitchen. I\u2019m sure we can rummage up something. Phillip made sure the house was completely stocked before we moved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some calls to make tomorrow,\u201d Lyric said as she opened the fridge to take stock. She frowned as she glanced over the array of deli meats, cheeses, fruits and fresh vegetables.</p><p>What she really wanted was a cupcake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put stuff off for too long. While this is a semivacation, I still have a ton of stuff to do before my show at the rodeo. I\u2019m supposed to be writing songs, which I haven\u2019t even begun thinking of. How am I supposed to be creative when my life has been turned upside down?\u201d</p><p>Connor slid his hands over her shoulders and massaged as she stood staring into the fridge. \u201cRelax, Lyric. Right now your focus is on staying safe. It\u2019s only two weeks. I\u2019ll help you in any way I can.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and shut the refrigerator. \u201cThanks. I appreciate it. I know I probably don\u2019t show it, but I really do.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked up into a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s part of your charm.\u201d</p><p>She went to the pantry and shoved aside boxes and cans.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything in particular you\u2019re looking for?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat are you hungry for? I\u2019m not great in the kitchen, but I can manage until the chef gets here tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She turned around, arching her eyebrow. \u201cChef?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Phillip hired someone to cook for you while you\u2019re here. I assumed this was something you were used to. Don\u2019t all rock stars get the royal treatment?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She searched his tone and demeanor for sarcasm, but he didn\u2019t have a hint of snottiness in the question. Just light teasing.</p><p>\u201cI have someone who takes care of that on the road. I hate eating out all the time. I already told you I have to watch what I eat or I gain weight too easily. But usually when I go off tour, I\u2019m on my own. Again, which is why I gain weight when I\u2019m not on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you get a chef tomorrow afternoon. Supposed to be here before lunch. He wants to meet with you so he can plan a menu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCupcakes. I just want cupcakes.\u201d</p> <p>Connor laughed. \u201cYou can have all the cupcakes you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d she said mournfully.</p><p>Connor\u2019s laugh died and his expression grew serious. His eyes darkened and he gazed intently at her. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful just as you are, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>Heat rose in her cheeks, and to her horror, she felt the sting of tears. Hell. The man was lethal to her composure. She swung back around and grabbed a box of macaroni and cheese.</p><p>\u201cThis okay?\u201d she blurted as she shoved the box toward him.</p> <p>\u201cLove mac and cheese,\u201d he said.</p><p>Another thought occurred and she frowned. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to feed Kane and his crew, do we? Because if I have to eat with that man, I\u2019m not going to keep an appetite.\u201d</p><p>Connor shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s not that bad, Lyric. He\u2019s just doing his job. Believe me, you want the biggest, baddest son of a bitch on your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, as long as he doesn\u2019t get pissed at me and throw me to the bad guy,\u201d Lyric muttered.</p><p>Connor chuckled. \u201cNot going to happen, and no, he\u2019s not eating with us. They have kitchen privileges, but I got the impression they like to keep to themselves and a low profile. I doubt you\u2019ll see much of them except when you go somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuits me just fine.\u201d</p> <p>Connor took the box and put a pot of water on the stove to boil while Lyric took a seat at the bar. After pouring the noodles into the pot, Connor turned and leaned against the counter.</p><p>\u201cTell me something, Lyric. Do you trust anyone at all?\u201d</p><p>She went still, caught completely off guard by the question. It was one she didn\u2019t even know how to answer. Well, she knew how to answer, but not without it making her sound like a paranoid bitch.</p><p>Deciding to make it short and to the point, she simply said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Then she held up a hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to start in again on how sad and pathetic that is, save it. I\u2019m not in the mood to be picked apart and analyzed. I already have a bad enough headache.\u201d</p><p>Connor frowned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d</p><p>He went over to one of the cabinets and pulled out a bottle of pills and returned a few moments later with two in his hand. After handing them to her, he went to the fridge and returned with a bottle of water.</p><p>\u201cTake them,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to suffer.\u201d</p> <p>She threw the pills to the back of her throat and then chased them down with the water. Connor returned to the stove to watch over the mac and cheese, and Lyric sat there wondering how the hell she was going to get through the next two weeks with her sanity intact.</p><p>\u201cCan we have company here?\u201d she asked suddenly.</p><p>He glanced sideways at her. \u201cWhat kind of company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe Faith, Serena, Julie and Angelina could come for lunch or dinner, or just to visit.\u201d</p><p>She needed the company. She would go nuts in this big house alone or, worse, just her and Connor. She alternated between wanting to jump his bones and being freaked-out that he was close to her. It was exhausting being such a basket case.</p><p>Maybe Phillip was right. Maybe she was on the verge of a breakdown. Maybe when all this crap with the stalker was resolved, she\u2019d take a long vacation somewhere.</p><p>Connor frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Lyric. I hesitate to involve them any more than we have to. Their husbands won\u2019t be thrilled with them going where there\u2019s potential danger.\u201d</p><p>Lyric sighed. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Some freak is after me and I\u2019m a toxic influence. They\u2019re nice girls and I\u2019d hate for me to rub off on them.\u201d</p><p>Connor stalked over and planted his hands on the bar in front of her. He looked . . . pissed.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019re better than you? Do you think I think they\u2019re better than you?\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him for a long moment. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I do. Doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure that one out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you thought it not so long ago. You weren\u2019t so gung ho to expose me to your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Connor said quietly.</p><p>That shut her up.</p><p>\u201cThey loved you. You were great with them. I was an asshole. We\u2019ve covered that. Those girls mean a lot to me. Yeah, in the beginning I was worried that there would be friction. I don\u2019t want them over here, but that has nothing to do with you. I don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Lyric smiled. \u201cYou know what, Connor Malone?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She sat back with a satisfied grin and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cYou like me. You don\u2019t want to. You didn\u2019t want to. But you like me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over, snaked his hand behind her nape and all but hauled her over the table as his lips melted over hers. Hot and so breathless she grew light-headed.</p><p>Man, but he could kiss.</p><p>She braced her palms on the countertop and leaned farther, hungry\u2014so hungry\u2014for him.</p><p>His tongue traced the line of her mouth and then delved inward. She sucked at the tip, wanting more. She licked at him, meeting his tongue in a flirty duel that had him sucking back.</p><p>She nipped at his lip, first his bottom and then the top. Oh, but she wanted to devour him.</p><p>A hissing sound from the stove had him pulling away and he glanced to where the water boiled over the rim of the pot. But before he went to rescue the macaroni, he stroked his thumb over her bottom lip and his eyes glittered with intense need.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a very observant woman,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Connor stood in the doorway of the room Lyric had commandeered as her studio. Her guitar and sound equipment had been delivered and set up and she\u2019d been sequestered in solitude all morning long.</p><p>She had her guitar cradled against her chest and she strummed a series of chords as her haunting voice echoed through the room and slid over his skin like silk.</p><p>It was a far cry from the noisy, raucous show she\u2019d put on when he\u2019d seen her in concert. He\u2019d be hard-pressed to even believe they were the same woman if he didn\u2019t know for sure they were.</p><p>She slapped her hand over the strings, silencing the guitar, and made a sound of frustration. Then she began again and rearranged some of the words.</p><p>If you only knew</p><p>If you could only see</p><p>If you could only come inside</p><p>And see the heart of me</p><p>She paused for a moment and then looked up and saw him standing in the door. Her hand fell away and she looked discomfited by his presence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Is it a new song you\u2019re working on?\u201d</p><p>She set aside her guitar and rubbed her hands down her pants. \u201cYeah. Something a little different. I\u2019m going for a new sound for the next album. I haven\u2019t run the songs by my label yet, so I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll go for it.\u201d</p><p>Connor took a seat in the chair across from Lyric. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI can either play by their rules and record the music they want or I can go out on my own, find another label or start my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhillip seems pretty damn committed to keeping you. I don\u2019t see him telling you no. I\u2019m not sure he knows the meaning of that word when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a baleful look.</p><p>Connor grinned. \u201cOh, come on. Admit it. No one tells you no very often. I doubt you\u2019d listen to them if they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on whether or not they\u2019re saying what I want to hear,\u201d she said cheekily.</p><p>He chuckled. She was pretty darn cute when she was being sassy. And not that he\u2019d ever admit it in a million years, but he liked the blue on her. It just . . . fit.</p><p>\u201cConnor, you need to see this,\u201d Kane said from the door.</p><p>Connor glanced up. Kane\u2019s expression said it wasn\u2019t good. He got to his feet and started to tell Lyric to stay put, but Kane pressed his lips together and then said, \u201cBring her. She\u2019ll need to see this too.\u201d</p><p>Lyric shot Connor a worried look and rose to stand beside him.</p><p>Not caring how it looked, Connor held out his hand to her. She slid her palm over his and he curled his fingers tight around hers. Then he tugged her toward the door and after Kane.</p><p>They traveled down the stairs and to the living room where one of the other men had the television programming paused. Kane nodded at him and then stood back, arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>It was the local newscast, but as soon as Lyric\u2019s face appeared, Connor flinched.</p><p>\u201cPop singer Lyric Jones is in town early for her rodeo appearance, and by all accounts, the star is never far out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>The reporter segued into footage from the police station and then of Lyric leaving the station with Connor. To make matters worse, two of the police officers who\u2019d been involved in Lyric\u2019s detainment were interviewed. While no actual details were given, the implication was certainly clear that she\u2019d been involved in yet another undesirable situation.</p><p>Beside him, Lyric stiffened and she stared stonily at the TV.</p><p>At the end, the reporter wrapped up by saying that her rodeo appearance was sold out.</p><p>Kane turned the television set off and turned to face Connor and Lyric. \u201cThis complicates matters.\u201d</p><p>There was little he could say. Kane was right, but he had no desire to rip into Lyric. He was as much at fault for the incident as she was.</p><p>\u201cIt changes nothing,\u201d Connor said flatly. \u201cOur job is still the same. We protect Lyric, keep her out of compromising situations and make damn sure no one gets to her.\u201d</p><p>Kane stared at Lyric, his eyes glittering. \u201cI need your assurance this won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Lyric\u2019s head jerked up, and her lips twisted into a snarl. Connor stepped in front of her and faced Kane.</p><p>\u201cThe situation has already been handled. It was a simple misunderstanding. Lyric is my direct responsibility. Yours is to provide peripheral security.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s lip twitched but he didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>\u201cI need a schedule of her appearances. Any appointments. Basically if she\u2019s going to set foot off this property in the next ten days, I need to know about it so I can plan accordingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have you one before today is over,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cI have work to do,\u201d Lyric said tightly.</p><p>She turned away and stalked back up the stairs, and in the distance, Connor heard the door to her studio slam.</p><p>He looked back at Kane. \u201cCut her some slack. I doubt you\u2019re this hard-ass with all your clients. She\u2019s not as bad as she seems. It\u2019s all a front.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s eyes glimmered with amusement. \u201cI do whatever it takes to get the job done. If it means me being an ass, then that\u2019s what happens. Your girl doesn\u2019t strike me as the type to take things seriously if you coddle her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not . . .\u201d Hell. He blew out his breath. \u201cAgreed. I don\u2019t think she needs coddling. I\u2019ve been a few rounds with her myself. But she really is taking this whole thing seriously. I can\u2019t make up my mind about her. One minute she seems so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSane?\u201d Kane interjected.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and then the next she seems completely . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsane?\u201d</p><p>Connor laughed. \u201cOkay, yeah, maybe. But I think it\u2019s a defense mechanism with her. How belligerent she is seems to be in direct proportion to how vulnerable she feels. The greater the disadvantage, the more mouthy she becomes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have her all figured out,\u201d Kane drawled.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Kane blinked and studied Connor for a long moment. \u201cI think you know what it means. Just do me a favor. If you start sleeping with her, give me a heads-up so I can adjust accordingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do my job just fine,\u201d Connor said icily.</p><p>Kane offered a shrug. \u201cLook, man, I don\u2019t give a shit what you do. But know this. A man never sees the enemy coming when his dick is occupied, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s cell rang, and he gave Kane one last glare before he turned away and put the phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cMalone here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on down there?\u201d</p><p>Phillip Armstrong\u2019s voice boomed over the line, and Connor sighed. Just what he needed right now.</p><p>\u201cEverything is under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say. I get a report that Lyric is on the local news because she was arrested. Mind telling me what the hell for? You were supposed to be on her every waking moment. How can you protect her if she\u2019s out pulling stupid stunts?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Connor stalked out of the living room and onto the back patio. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t arrested. She went to the police for safety. She\u2019s not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you when she was doing all this? She shouldn\u2019t have had to go to the police if you were doing your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the way I\u2019m doing my job, then fire me,\u201d Connor said bluntly. \u201cI never wanted this gig to begin with. Lyric ditched me. I took care of the situation. It won\u2019t happen again. We\u2019ve reached an understanding. She\u2019s promised to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>There was a pregnant silence. Then Phillip let out another curse. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t damn well want to fire you. Hell, no one else would take the job and definitely not on such short notice. I\u2019m still interviewing firms to take over her full-time security while she\u2019s on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t treat her like a brainless idiot, I think you\u2019d find she\u2019d be a lot more accommodating,\u201d Connor said through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cLook, son. You\u2019ve known Lyric for a week. I\u2019ve known her for several years. I know how to handle her. Just do your job. Sit on her until I find a replacement and then you can wash your hands of her.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead and Connor shoved his phone back into his pocket. Wash his hands of her. Phillip made her sound like the most undesirable job on the planet. It was little wonder she had such a cynical attitude about life if these were the kind of people she trusted with her future.</p><p>It pissed him off and made him see red at the lack of respect she commanded from people she made a shitload of money for. He wanted to tell them all to go fuck themselves.</p><p>He wanted to . . . Hell, he didn\u2019t know what he wanted. He just knew he hated the fleeting hurt in Lyric\u2019s eyes\u2014hurt she didn\u2019t think others could see and that she tried like hell to cover up. Behind the brassy, ballsy, obnoxious facade was a vulnerable woman that intrigued him. He was dying to know what made her tick.</p><p>And yeah, he was absolutely dying to fuck her too.</p><p>It pissed him off that evidently he wore a neon sign when it came to her, because Kane had been quick to pick up on his attraction. In so many ways it didn\u2019t make sense. Lyric was the type of woman he stayed the hell away from. High-maintenance chicks weren\u2019t his thing. And Lyric definitely qualified.</p><p>She was like an expensive exotic car. You might test-drive one, but you never signed on the dotted line. And you damn sure couldn\u2019t afford the insurance.</p><p>Connor turned when he heard the patio door open. Kane stuck his head out.</p><p>\u201cConnor, the chef is at the gate. My guy is checking him out now. If he\u2019s on the up-and-up, he\u2019ll be waved through. Thought you might want to know so you could meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll go up to get Lyric.\u201d</p><p>Connor stepped back into the house and went up the stairs to her studio. He drew up short when he saw the metal Do Not Disturb sign hanging from the doorknob.</p><p>He sighed. She\u2019d made it clear that when the sign was out, she wasn\u2019t to be disturbed for any reason. He didn\u2019t believe for a minute she was deeply involved in her music.</p><p>As much as the belligerent Lyric had gotten under his skin, he preferred that to quiet resignation. He\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let anyone beat her down. She was too vibrant. Too alive. She was like holding a stick of dynamite. You never knew when she\u2019d go off.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t trust anyone\u2014Connor included.</p><p>He put his palm flat on the door and rested his forehead on the wood as he heard the faint sounds of her guitar floating through the air. He remembered the words she\u2019d sung so softly just a short time ago.</p><p>If you only knew</p><p>If you could only see</p><p>If you could only come inside</p> <p>And see the heart of me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to trust me, Lyric Jones,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see that I\u2019m not like everyone else in your life.\u201d</p><p>He turned and went downstairs to meet Lyric\u2019s chef. The man had cupcakes to make.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>Lyric put her guitar down and flexed her neck, then extended her arms above her head to stretch her tired, aching muscles. She glanced at her watch and saw that it was late.</p><p>She was hungry, but she had no desire to go down and eat. What she wanted was a hot shower and a comfortable bed, in that precise order.</p><p>She let herself out of the studio and turned the sign over so that Connor would know she was no longer working. She went straight for her bathroom and turned on the shower.</p><p>A long soak in the gorgeous bathtub would be wonderful, but she was too impatient and edgy to enjoy it. She opted instead for a quick shower, careful to keep her hair from getting wet.</p><p>When she was done, she wrapped herself in a towel and shook out her hair from the clip she\u2019d shoved into it to hold it up. She spent another five minutes removing what makeup hadn\u2019t washed off in the shower and applying moisturizer.</p><p>Eager to crawl into bed, she walked out of her bathroom only to find Connor propped against the wall in her bedroom.</p><p>She clutched the towel although the ends were securely tucked at her breasts, covering most of her from his view.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve been hiding up here long enough?\u201d Connor asked as he pushed off the wall.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI was busy. I have work to do. I told you that.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou let Kane get to you. Kane and the newscast. I saw you, Lyric. You can\u2019t hide from me.\u201d</p><p>Her nostrils flared and she turned away. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t I get, Lyric? Why don\u2019t you explain it to me?\u201d</p><p>She kept her back to him, her arms folded protectively over her breasts. \u201cThe whole thing was my fault. I was a complete idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019ve established that I had responsibility in that fiasco.\u201d</p><p>She curled her lips in disgust. \u201cNo, Connor. I let you hurt me. I\u2019m a study in don\u2019t-give-a-damn, but I let you get to me. That\u2019s why I left. That\u2019s why I took off the way I did. I didn\u2019t want to let you see how much you hurt me.\u201d</p><p>His hands closed over her shoulders and he gently turned her to face him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away from his grasp and had to clutch at the towel to keep it from falling. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be sorry. I don\u2019t want you to . . . be anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Her gaze flew to his and something remarkably like panic skittered up her spine and wrapped around her neck. He had a look in his eyes that she didn\u2019t like. It untied her like a knot and peeled back her skin, leaving her naked and vulnerable. She hated that feeling.</p><p>She opened her mouth but couldn\u2019t for the life of her think of what to say to that. How could he know? How could he possibly know that she had the craziest thoughts about him? She was absolutely stupid when it came to him and she was helpless to control it.</p><p>He took a step forward, closing the gap she\u2019d opened between them. She retreated, bumping against the bed in her haste. He followed, not giving her so much as an inch.</p><p>\u201cI think you want me to be a lot of things,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI think right now you want me to be your lover. I think you want me to show you how different I am from everyone else in your life. You\u2019re afraid that I\u2019m different from everyone else.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in helpless fury, appalled at how well he could see into her soul. She blinked back angry tears just as his hands cupped her face and he lowered his mouth to hers.</p><p>It was like being caught in the middle of a lightning storm. Awareness sparked and sizzled, so hot that she gasped from the sensation.</p><p>He kissed her like he owned her, like she was his, like he was the only person to have ever kissed her. His tongue explored her mouth, leaving no part untouched.</p><p>Her body was not her own. Her breasts throbbed, and deep down at her very core, an ache began and spread through her groin until her clit pulsed and her pussy tightened with anticipation.</p><p>All from a kiss. Just the touch of his mouth, and desire swept over her like a tidal wave.</p><p>She loved his hands. How they touched her and held her. How possessive they felt on her skin. He wasn\u2019t tentative and she really loved that. This was a man confident in his ability to make love to a woman.</p><p>She closed her eyes and trembled violently against him. She was in turns terrified of her reaction to him and more turned on than she\u2019d ever been in her life.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you, Lyric,\u201d he murmured against her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be afraid. I want you to know what it feels like to have someone love you.\u201d</p><p>She tensed and backed away enough that she could put a finger to his lips. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say that word. Please, just don\u2019t. Don\u2019t ruin everything.\u201d</p><p>His eyes clouded with confusion. \u201cWhat word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove. Don\u2019t ever use that word.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a searching look and then reached up to brush the hair from her face. \u201cI won\u2019t use any words you don\u2019t want. I\u2019ll simply show you.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him and knew he was waiting. Waiting for her to agree. Waiting for her acceptance. It would be so easy to push him away. Far easier than voicing the words that ached to break free.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, Lyric. Give me the words.\u201d</p><p>Her breath escaped in a nearly violent shudder. \u201cI don\u2019t want . . . I don\u2019t want to be alone tonight.\u201d</p><p>He came to her again, his mouth brushing over hers in the most tender of kisses. \u201cThat\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he slid his hands up to where her fingers clutched the towel. He paused for a moment and then carefully uncurled her fingers before lowering her hands to her sides.</p><p>She shook. Her knees quaked and her breath sped up so fast that she became precariously light-headed. Then he lowered his head and pressed a single kiss to her chest, just above where the towel covered her breasts.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>Just the way he said her name with such aching tenderness undid her. On his lips, her name was something different. It wasn\u2019t just her name. It was an endearment\u2014something very precious.</p><p>He raised his head and met her gaze and she saw herself reflected in his eyes. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>Mutely she shook her head, her reaction as automatic as breathing.</p><p>He smiled when she thought she might have angered him.</p><p>\u201cI think you do,\u201d he murmured. \u201cEven if you won\u2019t admit it to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel safe with you,\u201d she offered. And it was true. Was that the same as trust? Trust was such a big word.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a good place to start.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the end of the towel that was tucked around her breasts. She stiffened and very nearly raised her hands to stop him, but at the last moment, she lowered them slowly back to her sides.</p><p>He didn\u2019t simply tear the towel away. Watching her all the while, he carefully unwound it until it was loose and barely covering her flesh. Then with a gentle tug, it drifted to the floor and she stood naked and painfully vulnerable to his gaze.</p><p>She lowered her gaze and closed her eyes, unsure of what to do next. Never had sex come with such unsettling emotions. She was in control. She drove the action. She played, she taunted. Everything was by her rules.</p><p>But now she found herself at a complete and utter disadvantage, and panic welled from deep within, threatening to overwhelm her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I see?\u201d he asked in a husky, deep voice that slid over her skin like soul-deep comfort.</p><p>He nudged her chin up until she was forced to look back at him. Such honesty was reflected in his gaze. Frank appraisal like he\u2019d judged her and deemed her worthy. What did it matter what he thought? Why was she so torn up over the idea that somehow he\u2019d find her undesirable or lacking and back away? Backing away was what she did.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked in barely a whisper, drawn to the earnest blaze in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI see a beautiful woman who\u2019s soft in all the right places. Who would be beautiful now or six sizes larger. I see a woman who tries very hard to hide from the world and perhaps herself. But you can\u2019t hide from me, Lyric. I\u2019m learning you. I want to learn more.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply. His words hit her in the gut, driving the air from her lungs. She stared at him, baffled by his assessment. Baffled by the warmth in his eyes and how his gaze stroked over her body as though she were the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>It was a silly thought. There were certainly women more beautiful, but in this moment, standing in front of him, she felt like she somehow stood above all the rest.</p><p>No one talked to her when they had sex with her. It was just . . . sex. Hot, sweaty and fast. Get it over with; move on; don\u2019t dwell on emotion.</p><p>But with this man, she had the feeling that it would never be just sex, and that idea unsettled her. It frightened her. Making love was for people who were in love, who used sex as an intimate expression of that love. It wasn\u2019t for people like her, to whom love was an ugly, gray thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing to say to that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you without anything to say. I like it.\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, he pressed in close, cupped her shoulders in his strong hands and bent to kiss her.</p> <p>She loved his kisses. They unraveled her.</p><p>Her breasts pushed again his chest. His body cupped around hers, flush, so warm and solid. A restless, itchy sensation prickled over her skin. She wanted to feel his flesh against hers. She wanted no barrier between their bodies.</p><p>Before she realized she had, she raised her hands and pushed underneath his T-shirt until her hands slid over his taut belly.</p><p>He immediately froze. His tongue stilled over hers and she could feel the huff of his breath over her face.</p><p>Thinking she\u2019d jumped the gun, she immediately withdrew and clenched her fists at her sides. She wasn\u2019t used to withstanding seduction. She was usually the aggressor. Playing by someone else\u2019s rules was alien.</p> <p>Connor eased back just a step and then he reached for the hem of his shirt. Giving it an impatient yank, he hauled it over his head and dropped it to the floor.</p><p>Then he stepped back to her and circled her wrists with his fingers. He raised her hands and placed them against his chest, holding them there against the solid wall of his muscle.</p><p>\u201cI love you touching me.\u201d</p><p>He brought one hand to his mouth and kissed each fingertip before finally sucking her pinkie into his mouth. Hot and moist. It sent a thrill down her spine.</p><p>\u201cTake my pants off, Lyric. I want you to touch me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get enough.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips as he lowered her hands to his waist. She shook so bad that she fumbled clumsily with the button of his fly. The sound of the zipper was loud. It broke through the heavy silence and made her flinch as she eased it all the way down.</p> <p>Slowly she peeled the denim over his hips and down his legs until it gathered around his ankles. He stepped free and stood before her, the burning question at last answered.</p><p>She laughed softly and raised her gaze to Connor, a smile twisting her lips.</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny? I have to tell you, laughing when you\u2019ve got a guy down to his underwear is never a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was right,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a boxer brief guy.\u201d</p><p>He grinned smugly and mischief lit his eyes. \u201cSo you have been thinking about me.\u201d</p><p>Damn. \u201cI may have wondered. But that was it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh. Admit it, Lyric. You\u2019ve been thinking about me every bit as much as I\u2019ve been thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>She hooked her fingers in the elastic waistband of his briefs and pulled him closer to her. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a hard-on for you the very first time we met. You and that sassy mouth of yours had me so hard, and I was desperate for you not to know.\u201d</p><p>One corner of her mouth went up and she reached gently to caress the very noticeable bulge between his legs. His cock strained against the cotton material, a hard ridge trapped against his body.</p><p>What would he expect? Would he want her to take the lead now? He\u2019d seemed to cede control when he\u2019d asked her to undress him. Then she frowned. Or maybe he expected to direct her through it all. Was he in control or was she?</p><p>He tipped a finger underneath her chin and nudged it upward until once again his heated gaze bored into her. \u201cWhy the frown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in control?\u201d she blurted. \u201cI\u2019m not sure . . . I\u2019m not sure what you want me to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d he asked lazily. \u201cWhy do either of us have to control everything? Why can\u2019t we just enjoy each other for a while? You tell me what you like, what feels good to you. I\u2019ll tell you what I like.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and sent her hand seeking into his underwear until her fingers wrapped around his rigid erection. His breath caught and he went completely still.</p><p>\u201cDoes that feel good?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll feel a hell of a lot better when you get your mouth wrapped around it,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>When she would have gone to her knees, he caught her by the elbows and hauled her up against him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to service me before I\u2019ve made you feel good, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Then his mouth closed over hers, so hot and wicked. She melted, let herself go limp against him as he picked her up and walked her to the edge of the bed.</p><p>She wrapped her legs around his waist and pulled him down with her when he would have laid her on the mattress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a feast and I have no idea where to start,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cSo much to savor. I don\u2019t want to miss a single taste of your sweetness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lethal,\u201d she said helplessly. \u201cHow can I possibly resist you when you say such pretty words?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI think the point is that you\u2019re not supposed to resist me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth brushed across her shoulder and he stopped to nibble a path to the column of her neck. Then he retraced back to her shoulder and he sank his teeth into her flesh.</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d he husked against her skin.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmmm.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and then licked the spot where he\u2019d bitten her. As he wandered down her body with his oh-so-delectable mouth, she wondered if she\u2019d have a mark where he\u2019d bitten her. The completely irrational part of her hoped so. She wanted a tangible reminder of his possession.</p><p>He dragged his open mouth down her midline, kissing and licking at intervals until he left a wet trail between her breasts to her navel.</p><p>Despite his assurances that she was beautiful no matter her size, she tensed when his tongue laved over the soft skin of her belly. She wasn\u2019t fat but neither did she have his taut, lean belly that you could bounce a quarter off. Plus she\u2019d gained and lost weight so many times that she sagged in certain areas.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he murmured as his tongue dipped into her belly button.</p><p>Then he kissed every inch of her abdomen and then lowered his mouth to her pelvis. After pressing a gentle kiss to the flesh just above the juncture of her legs, he raised his head and eased a finger over her bare folds.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She didn\u2019t raise her head because, really, she\u2019d never had a man do an analysis of her pussy while she was lying beneath him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d</p><p>He stroked the lips of her vagina and then ran his finger over the small triangle of hair just over the hood that shielded her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cYour wax job. I hear women talk about them, but I\u2019ve never seen one exactly. You know, in person.\u201d</p><p>At that she did raise her head and she arched an eyebrow in his direction. \u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThe women I\u2019ve been with aren\u2019t groomed down there.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou make me sound like a poodle.\u201d</p><p>His fingers returned to her folds. He seemed to be fascinated with the smoothness because he kept stroking her over and over until she was ready to twitch right off the bed. Didn\u2019t he realize he was making her crazy?</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. It makes me feel . . . sexy.\u201d</p><p>At that he grinned and stared up at her with approval in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m glad, then. You need to be as convinced as I am of just how beautiful you are.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head and nuzzled softly through her folds. The tip of his tongue brushed ever so lightly over her clit and she shuddered uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cYou taste as sweet as you feel,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou know just how to get to me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWords are my life. How they flow. Their meaning. Twisting and turning them and making them more beautiful. Whenever you talk to me like this, I hear it like it\u2019s a song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to sing,\u201d he said in amusement.</p><p>She nudged him upward with her knees and then reached for him, wanting him over her body. She wanted him to cover her like a blanket so there wasn\u2019t an inch of her skin untouched.</p><p>He rose over her and she clutched at his shoulders, reveling in his hard strength.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sing. I hear it in your words. No one has ever said such beautiful things to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re hanging out with the wrong people.\u201d</p><p>And then he started again. Scorching a path over her body, only this time he stopped at her breasts, lavishing attention on each of them. He coaxed her nipples to rigid peaks and then he sucked them between his teeth, one at a time, alternating until she was making incomprehensible sounds of pleasure.</p><p>His movements were like the most beautiful notes. Perfect pitch. So in tune with her body\u2014and her soul. He stroked her like a pianist might stroke the keys of a song he\u2019d composed just for her.</p><p>She heard the notes, the raw, exquisite beauty, as they reverberated over her skin.</p><p>She no longer even knew what she needed. She needed him. Just him. It was a stupid thought but it was all that echoed in her mind.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Connor. I need you.\u201d</p><p>As if realizing just what the admission cost her, he looked down at her tenderly as his hand went to part her thighs. He settled one knee between them and then he reached over her body to pick up a condom she hadn\u2019t realized was resting beside her pillow.</p><p>He gave a slight groan as he rolled the latex over his cock. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so close to coming and I haven\u2019t even gotten inside you.\u201d</p><p>She shifted restlessly, hoping he got the message that she didn\u2019t want to wait any longer. Her skin felt too tight. Pressure swelled in her core until she fidgeted. She burned.</p><p>He eased his fingers farther into her heat and she moaned. His thumb gently circled her clit just as he fitted another finger and delved into her tight passage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not ready yet, baby,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her eyes flew open. \u201cPlease, Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She sighed but closed her eyes when he lowered his mouth to her breast while his fingers continued their slow exploration of her most intimate recesses.</p><p>He stroked in and out in a perfect demonstration of how his cock would stroke through her insides to the very heart of her. She arched into his touch like a cat seeking petting. A low sound of contentment poured out of her throat and she reached blindly for him as he continued his erotic assault on her senses.</p><p>Her fingers curled into his hair, running through the crisp, short hairs as she held him to her breast. She idly stroked down to his nape and followed the thickly corded muscles of his neck and shoulders.</p><p>He was a perfect specimen of a man. Long, lean and tight. Clean-cut. Mr. All-American. Which begged the question of why in the hell he was attracted to her\u2014she was decidedly not a fresh-faced girl next door in middle-class America. That was the woman she could see Connor with. Mr. Always Do Right with Miss Sweet Apple Pie.</p><p>\u201cYou left me,\u201d Connor murmured.</p><p>She blinked and he came sharply into focus. He was staring down at her, his gaze seeking.</p><p>\u201cAm I doing something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She softened at his tone. His desire to please her couldn\u2019t be more prevalent. Fuck Miss Apple Pie. Lyric hated apple pie anyway. This man was hers at least for the next half hour, and quite frankly, she\u2019d kick some Miss America ass if she came within spitting distance of Connor.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him down for a long, breathless kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing everything perfect.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Connor rotated over Lyric until he came to rest between her thighs, his body held up off her by his hands on either side of her head.</p><p>She was ready for him. Satiny smooth and slick with her own arousal. And in her eyes glowed a sweetness that belied her hard edge.</p><p>There was something to be said for a soft, willing woman underneath you\u2014who looked at you like you held the answer to all the problems in the world.</p><p>Lyric without the bite was sweet indeed. It made him wonder if anyone else ever saw the woman underneath the layers she\u2019d carefully constructed. Did anyone even care?</p><p>Wanting to taste her again, he fit his mouth to hers and licked over the seam of her lips just as he positioned himself at her entrance.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re ready now, Lyric,\u201d he strained out. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>His body screamed at him to take her. To mark her and possess her in every primitive way there was for a man to possess a woman.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The fact that her words so perfectly echoed his thoughts made his chest tighten. Desire raged through his veins and he stilled for a moment before the urge to thrust as deeply into her as possible took over.</p><p>He eased forward, bathing the head of his cock in her silken flesh. Sweat broke out on his forehead as he fought for control.</p><p>\u201cConnor.\u201d</p><p>His name escaped as a whispered plea and her eyes were glazed with passion. She stared at him through half lids, her vibrant blue eyes looking drugged and unfocused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He inched forward, pushing farther inside her. God, she was tight.</p><p>Her nails raked over his back and came to rest on his ass. She arched and pulled at the same time, trying to force him deeper. With a groan he relented and thrust hard.</p><p>It was all he could do to hang on as her sweet heat enveloped his aching erection. He was balls deep and straining to get deeper.</p><p>Her shocked gasp startled him from his single-minded goal to bury himself deeper than he\u2019d ever buried himself in a woman.</p> <p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d he asked urgently even as he began to withdraw.</p><p>\u201cNo. No!\u201d She pulled at him, almost fighting to get him back, arching her hips to hold on to him.</p><p>He smiled and leaned down to fuse his lips with hers. \u201cWell okay, then.\u201d He surged back into her and closed his eyes as intense, mindbending pleasure shattered through his groin.</p><p>His balls tightened even as they pounded against her ass. His body wasn\u2019t his own. He had no control. And she urged him on. Taking everything he had to give. Demanding more.</p><p>Fire coiled low in his balls, clutching the base of his cock with a death grip. It built rapidly, rising like an inevitable tide.</p> <p>He looked down, wanting her with him. He wouldn\u2019t go until she\u2019d found her satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you need,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She feathered a hand over his cheek, a simple touch he felt all the way to his soul.</p><p>\u201cJust you. Just you.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t as far as he was and he knew it. He paused though it damn near killed him. He had to grit his teeth and breathe harshly through his nose to prevent his orgasm.</p><p>He reached for her hand and gently guided it downward. \u201cTouch yourself. Show me how you like it.\u201d</p> <p>He shifted his body the slightest bit so she could fit her hand between them. At first she hesitated, her expression a little uncertain\u2014and shy\u2014but then she slid her fingers through the damp folds, her knuckles grazing through the hair at his groin.</p><p>She gave a restless moan that prompted him to pull out of her and then stroke back, long and liquid. To his surprise her fingers wandered lower and wrapped around the inch of his cock that still remained outside her body.</p><p>She caressed his length as he eased out of her. Her fingers danced across the latex, and he cursed the condom that lay between her touch and his flesh. He\u2019d never gone bareback with a woman\u2014not even one he was in a relationship with, because caution was too firmly ingrained. But right now he\u2019d sell his soul to be able to get inside her skin to skin.</p><p>Finally he had to pull at her wrist and return her fingers to her own pleasure because he was a nanosecond from exploding all over her hand. At this point he\u2019d likely blow the condom completely off.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d he rasped. \u201cI want to watch you come apart around me. I want to feel it.\u201d</p><p>His statement seemed to excite her because she fluttered around him. Her flesh rippled across his cock and was so snug that he never wanted to leave its stranglehold.</p><p>Seemingly emboldened by his words, she began stroking herself in tight little circles, the backs of her fingers brushing over his sensitive skin.</p><p>Wanting her closer, wanting deeper, he reached down to cup her buttocks and marveled at how she filled his hands with such delectable, plump flesh. He squeezed and molded her in his palms and then plunged harder, reveling in the sounds that whispered past her lips.</p> <p>Her fingers moved faster and her legs circled his waist. They strained and undulated. They gasped. His heart raced. Faster and faster and lightning sparked. His release was like a fast-burning fuse, sizzling through his balls and up his cock.</p><p>He cursed under his breath because God, he couldn\u2019t last.</p><p>She went rigid underneath him and bowed until her back came off the bed. He stroked harder, determined to make it so good for her. The best she\u2019d ever had.</p><p>His mouth found her neck, and he sucked at the sensitive spot beneath her ear as her cry split the air. He was instantly bathed in liquid fire. Surrounding him, encasing his cock in the sweetest honey.</p><p>He raised his head and stared straight into her eyes. Straight into the heart of her. His hips jerked forward as if he had no control over the beast that arose within him. It was startling. So primitive that he understood why some men were considered little better than cavemen because at the moment, his only consideration was dragging Lyric off to his cave by the hair and keeping her underneath him for as long as he had strength to make love to her.</p><p>She withdrew her hand, her body still shivering in the aftermath of her orgasm. When she cupped his face, he turned so he could suck her fingers into his mouth to taste that sweet honey.</p><p>\u201cNow you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her words had the same effect his had on her. A violent shiver overtook him and his balls drew up and his release rushed down his cock and exploded with a force that had him gasping. Pain. Pleasure. It all blended together in a myriad of wicked sensation that he never wanted to end.</p><p>His hips were still jerking spasmodically forward when he finally lowered his body to completely blanket hers. He closed his eyes and rested his forehead on hers for a long moment as his cock twitched and shuddered deep inside her. He knew he couldn\u2019t stay there long and expect the condom to work, but he was loath to retreat from her snug warmth.</p><p>Their breaths worked hot and hard, colliding with each other as they both gasped to catch up. When he finally felt his head stop spinning, he kissed her and, with a reluctant groan, pulled himself away and rolled to the side to dispose of the condom.</p><p>When he came back to her, her eyes were glazed\u2014with shock? She seemed at a loss and a little baffled. Vulnerability shone like a beacon, and it riled every one of his protective instincts. She\u2019d hate it if she knew how much he could see right now. The barriers would slam down and the hard edge would return.</p><p>He climbed into the bed and pulled her into his arms, but she was already stiff and tension radiated from her in waves. In an effort to ease some of her discomfort, he pressed a gentle kiss to her shoulder but he didn\u2019t say a word, knowing that if he did, it would completely shatter what calm remained.</p><p>Instead he lay there and turned over the matter in his head. He knew it was stupid to have slept with her but at the time he accepted the inevitability of it. She was like a slow-moving drug that had taken hold of his system, insidious and unrelenting.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have the strength\u2014or the desire\u2014to deny the intense chemistry between them. Even when he\u2019d thought the worst of her, his body had been achingly aware of every part of her.</p><p>But now he had to admit that what he\u2019d done could and probably would cause problems. He\u2019d been contemptuous of her bodyguards for not doing their job because they couldn\u2019t take their hands off her, and now he was no better. He was here to protect her\u2014in essence to be that same bodyguard\u2014and he could no more keep his hands off her than give up breathing.</p><p>It posed a serious problem\u2014one that he was at a loss as to how to solve.</p><p>Lyric hadn\u2019t relaxed and now she stirred and rolled away from him. He felt her retreat long before she\u2019d actually done so physically. It pissed him off but there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it.</p><p>Still, his perverse side roared to the surface and he caught at her arm. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathroom,\u201d she murmured as she pulled away.</p><p>She got up from the bed and hurried across the room, her arms shielding her nakedness from him. He wanted to growl at her that there wasn\u2019t a damn thing she could hide. He\u2019d seen and tasted every inch of her. He\u2019d touched and caressed until she\u2019d responded wildly.</p><p>He sighed as she disappeared, and he wasn\u2019t at all surprised when she didn\u2019t return. He stared up at the ceiling and wondered how much more she\u2019d cut herself off from him now that he\u2019d breached her defenses.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>It was a sure sign of just how desperate she was not to be A) alone or B) one-on-one with Connor that she found herself downstairs watching television with men she didn\u2019t even like.</p><p>Okay, that wasn\u2019t entirely accurate or fair. She didn\u2019t like Kane, the smug, way-too-sure-of-himself \u201cleader\u201d of her security detail. The other guys were probably just fine, but she found them guilty by association, so the result was that the entire lot of them were assholes.</p><p>And yet here she was watching late-night television, trying to work up the courage to go back upstairs and face her empty room and the silence that yawned like a chasm.</p><p>She could feel the gazes of her security guys resting on her. One had uttered a greeting when she\u2019d come down an hour earlier, but when she hadn\u2019t responded, they took the hint and hadn\u2019t spoken since.</p><p>To her annoyance, Kane entered the living room and didn\u2019t seem inclined to ignore her presence like his men had done. He stood a few feet away openly staring at her.</p><p>\u201cIs there something we can do, Ms. Jones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you care,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cSulking doesn\u2019t become you.\u201d</p><p>She curled her lip into a snarl. \u201cI\u2019m not sulking. I want to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cAnd yet here you are in the room with my men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a problem with that?\u201d she asked belligerently.</p><p>He studied her for a moment. \u201cIf I\u2019m to believe Connor when he says you only get more belligerent when you\u2019re threatened or unsure, then I\u2019d say you\u2019re feeling pretty insecure right now.\u201d</p><p>She bared her teeth. \u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>There was a glimmer of a smile. She could swear his lips twitched, but when she looked harder, she saw only his cool blue eyes staring back at her like she was boring him.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing you require, we\u2019re going to turn in. Time for the next watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be coming inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? What\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is, in thirty seconds you\u2019ll be alone down here.\u201d</p><p>She flushed and curled her fingers into fists so he wouldn\u2019t see her hands shake. How did he know? How could he possibly know?</p><p>Without a word, she pushed herself from the couch and bolted toward the stairs. Darkness awaited and she made damn sure she turned on every light between the top of the stairs and her bedroom.</p><p>She was simultaneously relieved and disappointed that Connor had evidently gone to his room. The door between her bedroom and his was closed. And silent. No light crept underneath his door.</p><p>What was worse? Being one-on-one and vulnerable with him or being alone?</p><p>It took everything she had not to get on the phone and call in the troops. Right now she wasn\u2019t picky. She could fill her room\u2014hell, she could fill every room in this damn house\u2014with people who\u2019d be only too happy to keep her company and prattle on about everything and nothing.</p><p>Connor would have a kitten. Kane would be beyond pissed. And it wouldn\u2019t make her feel a damn bit better.</p><p>Some memories just haunted you no matter how far or how fast you ran.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in denial of her circumstances. She knew how fucked-up she was and made no apologies to herself. Self-preservation was a powerful thing, and she knew that what she did kept what little of her sanity she still possessed.</p><p>Being alone freaked her out. She couldn\u2019t even think about it without feeling the suffocating darkness close in around her. It brought back the feeling of utter helplessness. Guilt. Despair.</p><p>The fact that she\u2019d stood by and watched her mother die and never uttered a word. Too scared to cry out. To say stop. To run for help. To scream for help. She\u2019d known that any movement, any sound, would thrust her back into a madman\u2019s attention. And she\u2019d suffered his attentions for far too long.</p><p>She closed her eyes and felt the familiar sting of tears. Her head ached from holding so much back, from the constant fight to keep her carefully constructed walls from crumbling.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mama, I\u2019m such a mess,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t spoken to her mother in a long time. There were days she still battled her rage and, with it, the terrible guilt for feeling so angry with a mother she\u2019d adored.</p><p>She stood in the middle of her room, surrounded by . . . nothing. Silence. Stillness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired of this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Panic clawed at her throat at the idea of being here alone. The house. The room. It was all unfamiliar to her. These weren\u2019t her things. No matter how much of a badass Kane professed to be, he couldn\u2019t keep her safe from her dreams. He couldn\u2019t keep her safe from her memories.</p><p>Connor.</p><p>She stared at their adjoining door and was suddenly filled with such powerful longing that her throat ached and swelled. For several long, wonderful moments she\u2019d found exquisite peace in his arms. He\u2019d made her forget about every bad thing that had ever happened to her.</p><p>And she\u2019d taken off like a scared rabbit. He must think she was either crazy as a loon or a first-class bitch. Maybe both.</p><p>She took a hesitant step toward his door and then another until she was mere inches away. She laid her palm over the wood and held her breath, listening for any sound from the other side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took several minutes to work up the courage to turn the knob. She was half-afraid it would be locked. Part of her hoped that it would be.</p><p>The knob turned and she pushed the door open wide enough that she could slide in. Light poured from her room into his and she could see him lying on the bed, the sheet in a tangle around his hips.</p><p>For a moment she simply stared, drawn to his chiseled features. His body was beautiful. Lean and muscled. His brow was creased as if he was thinking over an important matter in his sleep. At his side, his fingers were curled into a tight fist.</p><p>Now that she was here, she had no idea what to do. She felt like a complete idiot, but the idea of turning around and going back to her empty room filled her with panic.</p> <p>She closed the door behind her, careful not to make a sound. She waited until her vision adjusted to the darkness of the room and then she tiptoed over to the love seat by the window.</p><p>She rarely slept for long periods of time. She could catch a few hours on the couch and be up and out of here before Connor ever woke up. He didn\u2019t even have to know she was ever here.</p><p>Feeling marginally better about her panic episode, she eased onto the couch and positioned a cushion under her cheek. A blanket would be nice, but she wasn\u2019t going to tempt fate by going back for one.</p><p>She stared over at Connor as she settled and held back a snort. Some security guy he made. She stifled a yawn and closed her eyes. He hadn\u2019t even realized someone had come into his room.</p><p>Connor smiled in the darkness as he watched moonlight spill over Lyric\u2019s face. She moved once after she closed her eyes and then went still as she slid into sleep.</p> <p>She\u2019d bolted but now she was back, and from all appearances she had no desire for him to know it.</p><p>Patiently he waited, watching as she slept. When he was satisfied that she was down for the count, he slipped from the bed and pulled the comforter with him.</p><p>He draped the blanket over her and gently tucked the ends around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Lyric,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Then he smiled and crawled back into bed.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p> <p>Lyric\u2019s cell phone had rung nonstop since seven that morning. Connor didn\u2019t know how the hell it hadn\u2019t woken her up yet. Even from the next room, the peal was loud and obnoxious. But she was still curled up on his love seat, covers pulled up to her nose. She hadn\u2019t so much as stirred since Connor had risen to shower. For the longest time he\u2019d simply lain in bed watching the soft rise and fall of her chest.</p><p>Knowing how little she\u2019d slept in the past days, he was careful not to awaken her. He moved silently around his room, and once he was dressed, he slipped out of the bedroom.</p><p>He picked up the annoying cell phone from the nightstand beside her bed\u2014the bed where he\u2019d made love to her just hours before\u2014and pocketed it after seeing there were fourteen missed calls and half as many voice mails.</p><p>He\u2019d let her sleep as long as she would. She\u2019d mentioned that she had a lot to do today but he figured she\u2019d manage better with several hours of sleep in her system.</p><p>He was halfway down the stairs when his cell phone went off. He sighed when he saw it was Phillip Armstrong.</p><p>\u201cConnor Malone,\u201d he said when he put the phone to his ear. He continued toward the kitchen, where already he could smell food cooking.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is Lyric?\u201d Phillip demanded. \u201cIs everything okay there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, fine. She\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p> <p>There was a brief hesitation and Connor thought he heard Phillip sigh in relief. \u201cGood. She needs to rest. She\u2019s way too high-strung and she goes without sleep for too long at a time. Just make sure she makes her two o\u2019clock at Reliant Stadium. She has to meet with the stage crew and sign off on the details for her performance. I don\u2019t like that she\u2019s not using her band, but she was determined to give them a break. Hell, I think she\u2019s on some weird mission to prove something by taking on so much herself for these two weeks. But who she\u2019s trying to prove something to\u2014her or everyone else\u2014I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time for her to make her two o\u2019clock meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe expecting a call from Paul. I gave him your number because he was having a kitten over Lyric not answering her phone.\u201d</p><p>Connor bit back a curse. Just what he needed. Her asshole manager screaming in his ear. But better his than Lyric\u2019s. It pissed him off the way her manager treated her, and Connor had only met the man once.</p><p>On cue, the line beeped and Connor pulled the phone away to see unknown caller flash across his screen. \u201cThat\u2019s probably him now,\u201d he said as he put the phone back to his ear. \u201cI\u2019ll have Lyric where she needs to be. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>He punched the button to switch calls. \u201cConnor Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Malone, this is Paul Woodrow. I\u2019ll be flying into Houston at noon, and I\u2019ll expect to be picked up at the airport so I can meet Lyric at Reliant Stadium at two.\u201d</p><p>His snappish tone flew all over Connor. It briefly occurred to him that he should probably be conciliatory. Briefly. But he remembered Phillip\u2019s advisory that Connor worked for him, not Paul. It was enough for Connor to speak his mind.</p><p>\u201cWant in one hand and shit in the other. See which gets fuller faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell does that mean? Where is Lyric? Why isn\u2019t she answering her phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s indisposed and unable to take your call. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll have her return your call later. If I remember.\u201d</p><p>Paul gave a very unmanly shriek of outrage that made Connor cringe. If he wasn\u2019t enjoying himself so much, he\u2019d hang up the phone in mid-scream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have your balls,\u201d Paul screeched. \u201cYou do the job you were hired to do, and you better get Lyric on the damn phone. I\u2019m tired of her flighty, scatterbrained bullshit. She\u2019d better show up on time or it\u2019s going to be your ass in the fire. And there had better be a car to pick me up at the airport!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you arrange it, I highly doubt there\u2019ll be one,\u201d Connor said with barely controlled amusement. \u201cNice talking to you. Have a good day, now.\u201d</p><p>Connor blew out his breath as he shoved the phone back into his pocket. This was the most half-assed \u201cbusiness\u201d he\u2019d ever witnessed. The guy in charge of Lyric\u2019s career was a moron and he didn\u2019t give a shit about her. Or what was best for her.</p><p>The kitchen was alive with activity. Kane and his men were seated at the table eating a buffet of eggs, bacon, biscuits and bagels. The chef and his two assistants were busy opening and shutting oven doors as the chef barked orders to the woman manning the stove.</p><p>\u201cMr. Malone, what arrangements would you like for Ms. Jones\u2019s breakfast?\u201d the chef asked when he caught sight of Connor.</p><p>Connor shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s still sleeping.\u201d</p><p>The chef frowned. \u201cWill she be taking breakfast in bed or should I keep her food on the warmer for when she comes down?\u201d</p><p>How the hell would he know? He\u2019d never been around such a hyper operation. He was reminded of a bunch of chickens running around with their heads cut off. If this was the way Lyric lived, rushing from one poorly planned event to the next, it was little wonder she looked like she was on the verge of breaking. Hell, he\u2019d already be a permanent resident of the funny farm.</p><p>\u201cFix her a tray. I\u2019ll bring it up to her.\u201d</p><p>The chef nodded and then turned to bark another series of orders. Seriously, did this guy not realize he was just cooking for one woman? You\u2019d think he was making meals for the president and his entire Cabinet.</p><p>A few minutes later, Connor was presented a tray that looked like something off of one of those home and garden television shows Faith was forever watching. It was hard to tell what was actual food and what was simply presentation.</p><p>He snagged a cupcake and stuck it under one of the silver covers on the tray and headed for the stairs. Lyric had plenty of time to make her appointment and he was determined not to rush her. When did the woman ever get a moment to just be? If he were hounded as mercilessly as she was, he\u2019d be in a permanent bad mood. More and more he was beginning to understand what made her tick, and he\u2019d already come to the conclusion that everything around her sucked balls.</p><p>He nudged his door open with his foot to see her still asleep on the couch. Quietly he set the tray down on the coffee table and pulled it over to the sofa.</p><p>\u201cLyric,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cWake up. I brought you breakfast.\u201d</p><p>She stirred and her eyelids fluttered open. Sleepy blue eyes clouded with faint confusion stared back at him. Then she glanced down and around at her surroundings. Consternation creased her brow and her lips pinched together in a bow.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>He checked his watch. \u201cAlmost ten.\u201d</p><p>She sat straight up, her eyes wide. \u201cOh shit. Shit!\u201d She started to toss aside the covers and bolt from the couch but he put a gentle hand on her shoulder and pushed her back down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got plenty of time. Eat first.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the tray, then back up at him. \u201cI have so much stuff to do today. My manager is flying in. I should probably be there to meet him. Then we have to go over to the stadium and meet with their sound crew.\u201d</p><p>Connor shook his head. \u201cNo way you\u2019re going into a crowded airport. He\u2019s a big boy. He can get a car and take himself over to the stadium. You don\u2019t have to be there until two, which means we won\u2019t need to leave until one fifteen. Which gives you three hours to relax, eat and get your bearings.\u201d</p><p>She looked momentarily struck dumb, as if it honestly hadn\u2019t occurred to her that she didn\u2019t have to be running around freaking out every single minute. Then she smiled. Her eyes twinkled and lit up and it struck him how truly beautiful she was.</p><p>Behind the fa\u00e7ade. Behind all the posing, the bitchy exterior, the hard-ass act. She was a beautiful, sensitive woman and he was in some deep shit.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? You\u2019re right. I pay people to handle details. Let them do their job. My job is to show up at two, right?\u201d</p><p>He took off the remaining covers and she sighed in appreciation at the pancakes, bacon, eggs and grits. There was also fruit, toast and milk and juice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to eat all this,\u201d she said, though she eyed it like she\u2019d love to try. \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>She sat up and pulled her feet from the end of the couch. Then she patted the space beside her. \u201cCome eat, then. There\u2019s enough to feed the entire security team.\u201d</p><p>He sat next to her but was careful to keep a little distance between them. Despite her seeming ease, he could sense her uncertainty. She kept glancing over at him. Just little nervous peeks as if expecting him to bring up the fact she\u2019d slept the entire night in his room after she\u2019d bolted out of bed.</p><p>He was content to pretend it hadn\u2019t happened. For now.</p><p>The problem was, she looked so damn cute and snuggly that what he really wanted to do was pull her down to the couch and make love to her all over again.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t stop there. It really made him uncomfortable that beyond making love to her, he had a primitive, chest-thumping, mouthsnarling urge to tie her to his bed and not let her out of his sight for the next year or so.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d keep that little tidbit to himself. Nothing like making her stalker the more desirable option here.</p><p>He was losing his mind\u2014had already lost his mind.</p><p>Lyric was wrong for him on every conceivable level, but she just did it for him. Now he couldn\u2019t even give Nathan shit about how head over ass he\u2019d fallen for his wife. The man was done from the moment he\u2019d laid eyes on Julie.</p><p>In less than two weeks, Lyric Jones would move on, go back on tour, be the fantasy of every boy and man, and Connor would go back to his job and spend his nights reliving the time he\u2019d held her in his arms as she came apart.</p><p>Yep, his fascination with her didn\u2019t make a whole lot of goddamn sense in that light.</p><p>\u201cThis is really good,\u201d Lyric said around a mouthful. \u201cYou should eat.\u201d</p><p>Connor stared down at the plate she\u2019d fixed for him and realized he\u2019d yet to take a bite. He wasn\u2019t hungry for food. He was hungry for the petite blue-haired vixen sitting next to him.</p><p>To cover the awkwardness between them, he picked up his fork and plate and began eating, though he\u2019d be hard-pressed to tell what exactly he ate. For the first time in his life, the thought of food didn\u2019t appeal. And if that wasn\u2019t a huge sign that he was fucked, he didn\u2019t know what was.</p><p>After a while, Lyric laid her fork down and leaned back into the couch. She hugged the blanket to her chest and sighed as her head plopped against the cushion.</p><p>\u201cFull?\u201d he asked as he set aside his own plate.</p><p>\u201cMmmm. Yummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not too full,\u201d he said.</p><p>She turned, her stare questioning.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI have a surprise. I think you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the saucer and lifted the cover off to reveal the perfectly iced cupcake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes lit up and a broad smile curved her lips.</p><p>He dipped his finger along the outside edge to capture some of the icing, and then he held it out to Lyric. He smeared just a bit on her soft lips and her tongue immediately came out to lick the sweetness away.</p><p>He returned to the cupcake, dipped more of the icing and then smudged a little on her cheek. Her eyes widened in surprise but then half closed to a sleepy, drugged state of awareness when he leaned in to nibble at her frosting-covered skin.</p><p>He swept his tongue over the spot and then kissed her cheekbone until all the frosting was gone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweeter than the icing,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She reached over without breaking their gazes, dipped her finger through the cupcake and then spread the sweetness over his lips. A moment later, she swooped forward and captured his mouth against hers.</p><p>The warmth of her tongue rasped over his lips, tasting, licking away the sugary treat. He could taste the frosting on her lips as she nibbled at his.</p><p>To his surprise, she rose over him and leaned her weight into his body so that he was forced back against the couch. She straddled his lap and dug her knees into the cushions on either side of him.</p><p>\u201cSince you pointed out that there\u2019s no reason for me to be in a hurry this morning, I now have plenty of time for dessert,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She fit his hands like her ass was fashioned just for him. He cupped and squeezed through the thin material of her pajama bottoms. Then he pulled her forward just enough that the bulge in the crotch of his jeans was straining up against her pussy.</p><p>\u201cTake your shirt off,\u201d he rasped out. \u201cAnd give me that damn cupcake.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and turned, pulling at her shirt with one hand, reaching back for the cupcake with the other.</p><p>He ended up helping her, or maybe he was just too impatient. The top came over her head and he tossed it across the room. She held the cupcake up, a mischievous glint in her eyes as she watched him.</p><p>He swiped at the frosting, careful to leave plenty still on the cupcake, because damn, his mind was alive with the possibilities. He decorated one puckered nipple with the sweet buttercream icing until the tip was white. His mouth watered but he forced himself to lavish the same attention on her other breast.</p><p>She fidgeted and sighed, strained up, but he pulled her back down onto his lap. Her breasts bobbed in front of him like two delectable treats, and he never, ever turned down sugar.</p><p>He licked delicately up the curve of her breast, anticipating the point where he reached her straining nipple. She tensed all over and braced her hands on his shoulders. Her fingers dug into his skin as he flicked his tongue over the tip.</p><p>His tongue barely brushed across the sensitive peak, and each time he got only a hint of the sweet.</p><p>\u201cConnor!\u201d she gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me here.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth lifted. \u201cI think that\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>She slid one hand up the column of his neck, around to his nape and then into his hair. Her fingers twisted and she pulled impatiently at his head, guiding him back to her breast.</p><p>He lapped one more time and then pulled the nipple hard between his teeth, sucking avidly at the frosting. He held her nipple captive and flicked his tongue repeatedly over the point until she twisted and squirmed damn near off his lap.</p><p>He loved how demanding she was. Her fingers dug into his head. She wasn\u2019t afraid to show him what she wanted or needed.</p><p>He pulled away and her nipple gleamed wet and clean of the frosting. It was rigid, so hard and pointed that he couldn\u2019t resist swiping his tongue over it again.</p> <p>She sighed and flexed her fingers over his scalp. His erection pushed upward, cradled by the juncture of her legs. It frustrated him that there were so many barriers between them.</p><p>As if sensing his irritation, she rose up on her knees and began sliding her bottoms down. She backed off the couch and stood before him as she let the material fall down her legs.</p><p>He smiled at the fact that one nipple was still covered with frosting. He licked his lips and she smiled back just before she palmed her breast, cupping it and pushing it upward. Then she leaned down until her nipple was a breath away from his mouth.</p><p>She held it just so, offering it to his mouth. He fastened his lips greedily around it, sucking and nibbling as if he were starved. Her breathing ratcheted up and she trembled from head to toe as he pulled strongly with his mouth.</p><p>She pulled abruptly away, her cheeks flushed, her chest rising and falling rapidly. Then she let her gaze drift down his body to the bulge between his legs.</p><p>A gleam entered her eyes. One that made him twitchy with anticipation. It was the look of a woman with a plan. A very evil, delicious plan.</p><p>He held his breath as she got down on her knees and settled herself between his legs. Then she reached for his fly and pulled at the snaps. The zipper rasped downward and her soft hand gently delved within, finding his cock.</p><p>When she reached for the cupcake, he damn near lost his mind. With exacting precision she trailed a finger through the sticky confection and then proceeded to smooth it over his straining erection.</p><p>His breaths came out in tortured huffs. He was sure he was going to hyperventilate.</p><p>She took her time, smearing the frosting up and down his length until he was completely coated. Then she wrested his jeans down around his hips and there he sat, his cock jutting upward like a frosted Popsicle.</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t dying of anticipation, he\u2019d have to laugh at the fact he had a frosted dick.</p><p>And then she leaned over and touched the tip of her tongue to the swollen head. His cock twitched in reaction and swung away from her. It was all he could do not to grab it and guide it back because, Lord have mercy, he wanted her mouth around him.</p><p>She took care of the matter for him. She followed with her mouth and sucked the head between her lips. She teased him with her tongue, circling and lapping at the tip.</p><p>Like she had done, he slid his hand around to the back of her head and his fingers tangled in her hair. Carefully she lowered her mouth, taking more of him as she licked every bit of the frosting from his skin.</p><p>She exerted pressure and hollowed her cheeks as she slid up his cock. The head fell free of her lips with a pop and she turned her gaze up to him, her eyes sparkling with amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou know, more women wouldn\u2019t mind giving blow jobs if we could all have buttercream-flavored dicks.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. What else could he do? She was so damn irreverent.</p><p>\u201cHoney, if you\u2019ll keep your mouth wrapped around my cock, I\u2019ll buy you an entire tub of frosting.\u201d</p><p>She leaned down and dragged her tongue up the back of his erection, taking more frosting with her. Then she swallowed him up and took him deep until he butted against the back of her throat. She swallowed again, and the softness of her mouth convulsed around his dick. He shuddered uncontrollably and felt semen leak from the tip.</p><p>She slowly backed away but held him in her hand, caressing up and down as she licked her lips. \u201cMmmm, now, there\u2019s an interesting flavor,\u201d she purred. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, the taste of cum has never impressed me. But now? Yum.\u201d</p><p>His entire body tightened. Her crudeness only turned him on all the more. He reached for the back of her neck again and forced himself back into her mouth. He arched his hips and closed his eyes as her heat surrounded him.</p><p>It registered in the back of his mind that he was probably being an ass. He was pretty much assuming that she\u2019d allow him to come in her mouth. Hell, her mouth? He wanted to come down her throat. He wanted to thrust as deep as she\u2019d allow and come like he\u2019d never come.</p><p>She never registered a complaint. She allowed him to hold her head, though he was careful to make sure she wouldn\u2019t wear his fingerprints afterward. With every thrust, she seemed to open wider and allow him to go as deep as he could.</p><p>\u201cOh Christ, Lyric,\u201d he strained out. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t what you want, tell me now. I\u2019m so damn close.\u201d</p><p>There. He\u2019d managed to have some semblance of consideration, though he was praying hard she stayed right where she was.</p><p>She paused, and for one awful moment he thought she was going to stop. He went completely still as he waited. She merely glided over his hardness, trailing her tongue along the underside of his cock where he was most sensitive.</p><p>When the head of his dick rested on her bottom lip, she licked lightly at the seam and glanced up at him with smoky, sultry eyes. She sent him a lazy smile and then she took him hard and deep.</p><p>He nearly bolted off the couch. She sucked back and forth, her hand working the base of his cock in perfect rhythm with her mouth.</p><p>Lightning gathered in his balls and streaked upward with such force that his vision blurred. His release tore through him, painful and relentless in intensity.</p><p>Semen shot from his cock and filled her mouth, bathing him in its sticky warmth. Still, she didn\u2019t waver. She sucked and swallowed and all the while kept that silky, sweet mouth closed around his pulsing erection.</p><p>On and on, in a seemingly unending orgasm. He was still jerking spasmodically when the last of his release spurted into her mouth.</p><p>She released his cock and climbed back on top of him, her body quivering and shaking as she straddled him. His cock butted into her soft belly. She gripped his head and bent to nip at his neck. She was everywhere, twisting restlessly as she sucked and bit at the column of his neck.</p><p>She was close to her own orgasm and all from sucking him off. It stunned him and inflated his male ego about ten more pounds. Not willing to let her remain unfulfilled, he slid his fingers between them, down into the softness of her folds.</p><p>She was hot and damp, slick with her arousal. As soon as he touched her clit, she arched forward, her back bowing so that her breasts were shoved into his face.</p><p>Damn if that didn\u2019t make him one happy man.</p><p>He latched on to her nipple and suckled as he stroked her. Her heat bathed his fingers. He pressed in with his thumb and rotated in a tight circle as his middle finger slid inside her.</p><p>She encased him in liquid velvet. She was so satiny soft and smooth. He added another finger, stretching her as his thumb continued its relentless seduction.</p><p>A whimper tore from her throat and she tightened in his arms. So sweet and soft. Curvy and warm. He sighed his own contentment as he moved to her other breast and inhaled her scent.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his shoulders. Her cry came out as an ache in the stillness of the room. She trembled so violently as her orgasm crashed around her that she pitched forward against him.</p><p>He caught her with his free arm and held her close as he continued to caress her swollen, damp flesh. Her chest pushed against his as she struggled for breath. He buried his face in her neck and kissed softly over her pulse point.</p><p>\u201cYou undo me,\u201d he admitted softly.</p><p>She laughed but it came out quivery soft and delicate. \u201cThat\u2019s my line.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her neck again and pressed kisses below her ear. Gradually he eased his hand from between her legs and pulled her even closer to him so that she straddled him again and her body was pressed as close to him as he could get her.</p><p>\u201cDo you doubt how beautiful you are to me?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>She pushed away just enough that she could stare into his eyes. What he saw in hers knotted his chest and made his throat ache. There was wonder. Amazement and a little confusion. As if she truly couldn\u2019t comprehend why he thought her so damn beautiful.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it, but when I look at you, I see it. I don\u2019t know what to do about it, but you\u2019ve made me believe it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled then and trailed a finger down a strand of her hair to her cheek. Then he pushed it up and over her ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything. I just want you to see you the way I see you.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and pressed her forehead to his. Her hands slid up his neck and her thumbs brushed over his jawline. He shivered at that tiny gesture. It was baffling what something so simple as her touch did to him.</p><p>\u201cI wish everyone could see me the way you see me.\u201d</p><p>There was pain and regret in her statement. It said so much more than just the simple words. There was a wealth of meaning, and, not for the first time, he realized that there was so much more to the woman than what the public saw.</p><p>Was it their fault entirely for swallowing what they were spoon-fed by the media and by Lyric herself? No, but right now he could see the vulnerability she tried so hard to hide from the world. She wore indifference like a shield. She needed that protection. She was a complicated, complex woman who had so many pieces that it was nearly impossible to put them all together.</p><p>He kissed her, just a simple touch of his lips, more a comforting gesture than one designed to inspire lust. And he simply held her while she regained her bearings and enjoyed the feel of her in his arms.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Lyric took longer than necessary in the shower and lingered in the bathroom long after she\u2019d dried her hair and done her makeup. The truth was, she was nervous. She wasn\u2019t sure how to act around Connor now. The last twenty-four hours had seen a 180 in their relationship.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t used to this uncertainty. She called the shots in all her sexual relationships. Nothing touched her. Nothing got to her. It was all casual and meaningless. Everything was on her terms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With Connor she felt like she was spinning out of control. It was a helpless, panicky feeling.</p><p>A knock sounded at her door. \u201cLyric, we need to be going.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and then opened the door to see Connor standing there. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane\u2019s waiting downstairs with the car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re riding with me.\u201d</p><p>He touched her arm. \u201cOf course. You don\u2019t go anywhere without me.\u201d</p><p>She breathed a soft sigh of relief.</p><p>He escorted her down the stairs and out front to the circle drive where a limousine was parked. She wrinkled her nose. \u201cSeems a bit conspicuous, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s armored,\u201d Connor said. \u201cBulletproof windows. You\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m in that much danger?\u201d</p><p>Kane, who was standing by the limo, straightened and opened the passenger door for Lyric. \u201cWe always assume the worst. That way we don\u2019t get any nasty surprises.\u201d</p><p>She slid into the roomy interior and scooted around the curved seat to allow Connor to duck in. She held her breath, waiting to see if Kane would slide in as well. To her relief, he shut the door, leaving her and Connor alone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just doing his job,\u201d Connor said with a hint of amusement.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHe makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>Connor raised an eyebrow as the car pulled away from the house. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone made you nervous, Miss Badass.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled a face at him.</p><p>\u201cDid you make all the phone calls you needed to make?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMost. Not all,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t call Paul. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to hear him bitch.\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cYou need to tell him to shut the fuck up. You\u2019re making him a fuckload of money. He can lighten the hell up.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cDepends on who you ask, I guess. According to him, he\u2019s doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>Connor snorted. \u201cIf he ever thought you were walking, he\u2019d bend over backward to kiss your ass. When I first met you I thought that everyone around you kissed your ass too much. Now I think you\u2019re surrounded by a bunch of assholes.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cAnd in the beginning, I thought you were the biggest asshole of them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p> <p>She pretended to consider the matter as she studied him. \u201cNow I think you\u2019re a pretty okay guy.\u201d</p><p>Her phone rang and she checked the display screen. She rolled her eyes and hit the ignore button.</p><p>\u201cDoes your phone always ring twenty-four/seven?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cPretty much. There is no shortage of people always trying to keep me in line. They either want to call me to bitch at me, call me to remind me to be somewhere, or call me to ask me to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo not very much \u2018Hi, how are you?\u2019 then.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and considered for a moment and then laughed. \u201cNo, I suppose not. I can\u2019t remember the last time someone called just to say hi or ask me how I was doing.\u201d</p><p>Connor shook his head.</p><p>Half an hour later, the limo pulled up to the stage entrance of the stadium. Connor got out and scanned the area before reaching back for Lyric\u2019s hand. Kane and his men took position around them just as her manager strode out of the back entrance and made a beeline for Lyric.</p><p>Connor immediately stepped in front of Lyric and wrapped a protective arm around her, shoving her into his back. Kane stepped in front of Connor while his men pushed in around Lyric.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of my way,\u201d Paul barked. \u201cI\u2019m her manager.\u201d</p><p>Connor halted him with an icy glare.</p><p>\u201cGet her inside,\u201d Kane barked. \u201cThe reunion will wait until then.\u201d</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t look happy to be ordered about, but he had little choice as the men closed ranks and ushered Lyric inside the building.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d Paul demanded once they were inside. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting here for two hours. There are things to go over and I couldn\u2019t very well go over the details of your performance without you.\u201d</p><p>Lyric sighed and wished he\u2019d just shut up. She had no desire for one of his tantrums in front of everyone else. Connor\u2019s face had darkened to a storm cloud and his jaw was set in a rigid line as he glared at Paul.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fifteen minutes early, Paul. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>Paul reached for her elbow to pull her down the hallway but Connor cut him off and wrapped a protective arm around Lyric\u2019s shoulders. Paul shot Connor a disdainful look but continued to the meeting room where the rodeo execs were waiting.</p><p>Paul did most of the talking, and by the time it was over, Lyric had a headache. He made silly demands, argued every point, and finally Lyric told him to shut up. She apologized to the assembled people and then listened as they went over the schedule.</p><p>Next they gave her a tour of the rotating stage that was used for all the performers at the rodeo and gave her a preview of the screen graphics for the background. She met with the band since hers wouldn\u2019t be making the show and rehearsed the songs she\u2019d be singing for the show.</p><p>Three hours later, it was done and she left the building, surrounded by Kane and his men. The car was waiting, but before she could slip into it, Paul caught up to her and grabbed her arm.</p><p>She turned in surprise and glanced pointedly at his hand.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk, Lyric. What the hell is going on with you? You look like shit. Have you even tried to stay in shape for your tour dates? You only have a few weeks off and then you go back on the road. You\u2019ve gained at least ten pounds, if not more. You don\u2019t want to look like a slob onstage. This is your career. You could at least act like it\u2019s important to you.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks burned with humiliation. She wanted to crawl into a hole and die. It shocked her that he would confront her in front of Connor and Kane and the others. But then, he wouldn\u2019t consider them important. They were just the hired bodyguards.</p><p>Beside her, Connor hissed in anger and took a step toward Paul. Paul was oblivious to just how pissed Connor was, but Lyric could see the fury in Connor\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cInstead of stuffing your face and lying around, why don\u2019t you make it to the gym or, better yet, have some exercise equipment delivered to the house Phillip rented for you? Your fans don\u2019t pay big bucks to see your fat ass onstage. They pay to see a lean, sleek performer.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get another word out before Connor slammed him into the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Paul spit out. He looked to Kane. \u201cGet him the hell off me. You\u2019re fired. You\u2019re all fired.\u201d</p><p>Kane crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cGet who off you? I don\u2019t see anyone. The only thing I see is a loudmouthed, disrespectful asshole who is about to get his ass beat. Deservedly so.\u201d</p><p>Lyric watched, openmouthed, as Connor gathered Paul\u2019s shirt in his hands and got into his face.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, you piece of shit. You shut the fuck up. If I ever hear you talk to Lyric that way again, I\u2019ll tear your nuts off and cram them down your throat. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes bulged out of his head and he gaped at Connor and then at Lyric. \u201cAre you going to let him get away with talking to me that way?\u201d</p><p>Connor slammed him against the wall again. \u201cThe only words I want to hear out of your mouth are an apology to Lyric. Now.\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s hand tightened and pushed into Paul\u2019s throat, cutting off his air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m s-sorry,\u201d Paul stammered. \u201cYou know I only want the best for you, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>Lyric recovered her wits and walked forward, her mind still whirling from Connor\u2019s reaction. She stopped just a foot away from where Connor\u2019s hand was still wrapped around Paul\u2019s neck. For a long moment she simply stood there and watched him grow more and more uncomfortable. Sweat beaded on his brow and he glanced between her and Connor nervously.</p><p>\u201cPaul?\u201d she finally said. \u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>She spun around and headed toward the car where Kane had already opened the door. A smile hovered over his lips, and as she climbed in, he murmured, \u201cWell done, Ms. Jones.\u201d</p><p>Lyric slid over as far as she could and directed her gaze out the opposite window. For the first time, she wanted to be alone. She didn\u2019t want to face Connor or have him witness her absolute humiliation. Her face burned, and she was so mortified that she literally wanted to close herself off in her room for a week.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t so lucky.</p><p>Connor climbed into the back of the limo and a few moments later the car pulled away.</p><p>She refused to look at him. She didn\u2019t want to see sympathy or pity staring back at her. The silence was suffocating and she could feel him watching her.</p><p>Connor was furious. He couldn\u2019t remember a time he\u2019d been this pissed. He\u2019d wanted to kill that son of a bitch. He still wanted to kill him.</p><p>He\u2019d seen Lyric\u2019s face when Paul had spewed his venom. He\u2019d seen her pale, seen her draw into herself. Everything that Connor had told her had been erased by a stupid bastard who couldn\u2019t see how beautiful Lyric was.</p><p>And now she sat so still and rigid, making herself as small as possible, refusing to look at him. She was embarrassed\u2014who could blame her? And that pissed Connor off even more. She had nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing to be embarrassed over.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold silent any longer.</p><p>\u201cLyric. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. Closed her eyes but held her chin firm, her gaze still fixed out the window.</p><p>\u201cLyric.\u201d</p><p>He waited. He was patient. She had enough assholes in her life only too willing to shit on her. He wasn\u2019t going to be one of them.</p><p>Finally her shoulders sagged and she turned slowly, her eyes dull. He hated that more than anything. He liked her \u201cfuck you\u201d attitude. He liked that she didn\u2019t flinch in a stare-down. That she\u2019d take on anyone and anything. That wasn\u2019t the woman he was seeing now, and it infuriated him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an asshole. You should fire him. You deserve better than that.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s good at what he does. He made me. I owe him.\u201d</p><p>Connor had to call back the snarl. His lips curled and it took a few moments before he could calmly respond.</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>That surprised her. Her eyes narrowed and she cocked her head to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe him shit. Lyric, this is business. You ought to know that. If you weren\u2019t so upset by what that moron said, you\u2019d realize it. You pay him. If I had to guess, he gets paid way too damn much. That\u2019s all you owe him. A paycheck. Until such time as he no longer provides the service you pay him for, and quite frankly, I\u2019d say the only service you need from him is for him to go fuck himself.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth lifted into a half smile.</p><p>\u201cYou made yourself. You worked hard. You\u2019ve got talent. Without those things it wouldn\u2019t matter what the hell he did or didn\u2019t do for you. You made yourself. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled fully now and some of the light came back to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo one has the right to talk to you like that,\u201d he continued. \u201cNot him. Not Phillip. Your biggest power is the willingness to walk away. The moment they realize you\u2019re willing to do that, I think you\u2019ll see a dramatic turnaround in their attitudes. I still think you should fire Paul\u2019s ass, though. You can\u2019t tell me there isn\u2019t another manager who can do his job and keep their goddamn mouth shut while doing it.\u201d</p><p>To his utter shock, she launched herself across the seat and into his arms. She threw her arms around his neck and hugged him so tight that his oxygen was momentarily cut off.</p><p>He was happy to tuck her more firmly in his embrace. He curled his arms around her and held her against him, inhaling the sweet scent of her hair. And because he simply couldn\u2019t resist, he brushed his lips over her head and kissed and nuzzled, offering her comfort.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong, you know.\u201d</p><p>She went still, waiting. He tightened his hold and laid his cheek over the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou look fantastic. There is nothing about you that isn\u2019t drop-dead sexy.\u201d</p><p>He felt her smile against his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou probably think I\u2019m talking shit. I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t need to kiss your ass. There\u2019s no reason for me to lie to you. You can\u2019t fire me. You don\u2019t have anything I want or need. Except you. Just you. And that drop-dead, sexy-as-sin body of yours.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly and her body shook against his. He stroked a hand over her hair, content to let her lie against him, warm, snuggly and relaxed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good for my ego, Connor. You say things in a way that makes me think you mean them. I don\u2019t get that very often. It\u2019s become second nature for me to disregard any compliment because I\u2019m always suspicious of the motive behind it. Isn\u2019t that sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. But hey, at least for now, you have me to keep it real for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pushed away from his chest and smiled down at him, her eyes alight with joy. It made her seem softer. Like a girl instead of a hardened woman. It completely changed her appearance and he was hard-pressed to even put this woman together with the woman he\u2019d first met backstage with the outrageous pink hair and \u201cfuck you\u201d attitude.</p><p>It gave him an indescribable thrill that he was likely one of the few people in the world who got to see the woman behind the layers. He may not have earned her complete trust, but on some level she did trust him. Enough to let down the barriers.</p><p>He gathered her back in his arms and squeezed. \u201cWhat\u2019s next on the agenda?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI have that meet and greet after the show. Nothing until then, though. I need to give Kane my schedule. I promised I would. I feel so disorganized right now. I know it sounds bad, but when I\u2019m on the road, I don\u2019t have to think about where I have to be or go. I have people to push me here or there, and I\u2019ve gotten used to that.\u201d</p> <p>He ran his hands over her soft curves and rubbed her back until she was loose and relaxed against him.</p><p>\u201cNot bad. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s crazy for you. You need people for that, but they need to be people you trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t trust anyone. I don\u2019t expect people to be trustworthy. I never really thought about it before you said something about it, but I suppose it really is a shitty way to live. After a while you just accept that things are the way they are and you just go with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can change that, Lyric. People will only do what you allow them to do. It\u2019s okay to push back. It\u2019s okay to expect more from the people around you. That doesn\u2019t make you unreasonable. It makes you smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever accused me of being smart,\u201d she said dryly.</p> <p>\u201cThen they\u2019re morons.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away again so she could look into his eyes. She raised her hand to cup his jaw and she stroked over his face with featherlight fingers. \u201cI hated you when we first met. I could see the disapproval in your eyes and it pissed me off. It made me mad that it mattered to me what you thought.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced but she shushed him with a finger to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Phillip hired you. I\u2019m woman enough to admit I was wrong about you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she finished softly.</p><p>He kissed her finger, then sucked it into his mouth and nibbled delicately at the tip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m here too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink the chef has any more of those cupcakes?\u201d she asked wistfully.</p><p>He grinned as realization hit her. \u201cTo eat!\u201d she protested. \u201cI want them to eat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody says you can\u2019t eat them,\u201d he said silkily. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but my mama never said anything about not playing with my food.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and the sound was vibrant and alive in his ears. It made him want to do all sorts of mushy stuff that he\u2019d give other men shit over. But with her it just felt right.</p><p>She shifted and he was afraid at first that she was going to move back to her seat. But she settled down against his chest and he wrapped his arms around her again and cradled her.</p><p>She gave a soft little sigh that told him she was as contented as he was. He smiled to himself and nuzzled his face into her hair.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>Lyric was sitting in the kitchen with Connor eating a cupcake when Kane stalked into the kitchen, a grim expression in his face. Her heart sank. What could it be now? She tensed, ready to go on the offensive.</p> <p>Connor simply placed his hand over hers, a gesture that calmed her considerably.</p><p>\u201cYour manager is here and demands to see you,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWant me to get rid of him?\u201d</p><p>He said it in such a way that sent chills down Lyric\u2019s spine. She could envision Kane stuffing him into a trunk and disposing of his body. He looked serious enough to actually be contemplating it.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNo. Let him come up. I need to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>Connor frowned, but this time it was she who put her hand over his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Connor muttered. \u201cThat son of a bitch better be respectful or I\u2019m going to take him apart.\u201d</p><p>Lyric smiled and stood. \u201cI can take care of myself, though I appreciate the sentiment.\u201d</p><p>Still, Connor followed her into the living room, where they waited as Kane disappeared outside the house. A few moments later, Kane returned, walking ahead of two of his men.</p><p>Paul was held between the two bodyguards and he was steaming mad. His face was red and puffed up with visible anger. When the two men flanking him finally let him go, he shook and then lunged away from them, rubbing his arm as he glared at the offenders.</p><p>\u201cLyric, what the hell is going on here?\u201d he demanded. \u201cThis is completely unacceptable! Who are these men to tell me what I can or can\u2019t do? They manhandled me! I\u2019m going to sue!\u201d</p><p>Lyric rolled her eyes, then crossed her arms over her chest and stared at the man who\u2019d controlled the better part of her life for the past several years.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fired, Paul.\u201d</p><p>Her calm words had the effect of a gunshot. Paul recoiled and his mouth fell open. It worked up and down but nothing came out for several long seconds. Then he exploded.</p><p>\u201cFired? Fired? You can\u2019t fire me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell she can\u2019t,\u201d Connor shot back.</p><p>Again she put a hand on Connor\u2019s arm. He quieted and stepped back to allow her to continue.</p><p>Maybe it was the calm in her eyes or her demeanor. Paul went from furious to placating and pleading in a nanosecond.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fire me, Lyric. You owe me. I put you on the map. We\u2019re a team, you and me. Look, I\u2019m sorry for the things I said, but you know I was just looking out for you. I want what\u2019s best for you.\u201d</p><p>Lyric glanced at Connor and smiled. He winked, and she drew strength from that small gesture. Connor was right. He was absolutely right and she\u2019d never seen it until he pushed.</p><p>She turned back to Paul. \u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything. I paid you for services rendered. That\u2019s the only compensation I owed you. From this point forward our relationship is severed. You won\u2019t be allowed access to me in the future. If you have anything at all to say, you can contact Phillip or my lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s shock turned to ugly, black fury. He took a step forward and pointed a finger close to her face. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with this, Lyric. I know too much about you. I\u2019ll bury you.\u201d</p><p>Connor and Kane both stepped in front of Lyric. The two security men took hold of Paul\u2019s arms. Connor waved them off.</p><p>\u201cLet me give you a piece of advice,\u201d Connor bit out. \u201cDon\u2019t threaten Lyric ever. There isn\u2019t a place on this earth you can hide from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr me,\u201d Kane interjected.</p><p>\u201cIf you do anything, if you say anything, with the intent of damaging Lyric\u2019s career, her reputation or her personally, I\u2019ll hunt you down and I\u2019ll take you apart piece by piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re threatening me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right, I am. And if you think I\u2019m just blowing smoke up your ass, I invite you to try me. I\u2019m not much on words but I sure as hell will kick your sorry ass if you utter so much as a peep. You got me?\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s face lost color. His eyes darted back and forth between Kane and Connor and he sagged like a deflated balloon.</p><p>\u201cGet him out of here,\u201d Connor ordered.</p><p>Lyric watched as Paul was hauled out of the living room. She felt an odd sense of elation. As if she\u2019d lost the ten pounds that Paul had complained about. She felt ridiculously light and freaking giddy.</p><p>She smiled broadly as Connor and Kane both turned their attention back to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose either of you know of a good manager, do you?\u201d</p><p>Kane actually cracked a smile. She was surprised his face didn\u2019t crumble with the effort. Connor slipped an arm around her and hugged her to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you for taking a stand, Lyric. The bastard needed his ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you really hunt him down?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>Connor frowned. \u201cHell yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said as her grin got bigger. She turned to include Kane. \u201cThank you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make his life miserable for him if you want,\u201d Kane offered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even joking, are you,\u201d Lyric muttered.</p><p>\u201cNope. I don\u2019t have a sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>At that, Lyric chuckled.</p><p>Her cell phone went off and she sighed. \u201cThe man works fast. He must have speed-dialed Phillip on his way out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t answer,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>Lyric stared down at the phone in her hand. Then she looked back up and grinned. \u201cAnyone up for another cupcake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he make chocolate?\u201d Kane asked in a hopeful voice.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Three cupcakes and four missed calls later, Lyric licked the last of the frosting from her fingers and sighed in satisfaction.</p><p>Her phone went off again and she lifted an eyebrow at it. \u201cHe\u2019s persistent, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Connor grunted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t called you.\u201d</p><p>Connor held up his phone and flashed her the screen that said he had as many missed calls.</p><p>\u201cHa-ha! You turned your ringer off. Smart guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably calling to fire me,\u201d Connor said wryly. \u201cHe probably thinks I\u2019m a bad influence on you. But if I don\u2019t answer the phone, he can\u2019t very well fire me, right?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou, a bad influence on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, right? How ridiculous is that? Everyone knows you\u2019re the miscreant here. Not me.\u201d</p><p>He looked so damn innocent saying it that she had to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI bet you got away with murder as a child.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNope. Pop would have kicked my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mom?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cShe and Pop split up when I was young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I need a minute when you get a chance,\u201d Kane said. \u201cJust got a report we need to run over.\u201d</p><p>Lyric\u2019s brow creased as she looked between the men. \u201cReport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019ve been running background checks, criminal histories, stuff like that on all the people who work with you or have access to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>Kane shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know yet. Just got the e-mail on my BlackBerry. I\u2019ll need to log on to a computer and print it out. Connor and I can split it up and look over it. This will probably take a while so if you need anything, let one of my men know.\u201d</p><p>That was it. He wasn\u2019t sharing anything further. It frustrated her on one hand, but there was a part of her that didn\u2019t want to know if someone close to her was fucking with her. She didn\u2019t trust anyone, but that didn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t be pissed that someone she\u2019d allowed into her circle had betrayed her.</p><p>But shouldn\u2019t she know these things? Shouldn\u2019t she be aware of any potential threat that existed?</p><p>Connor stood and then laid a hand on her shoulder and squeezed. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know as soon as we\u2019ve gone through all the information. I won\u2019t keep anything from you. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go for a swim. Is that allowed?\u201d She looked innocently at Kane as she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe here. My men will be watching. Go take your swim.\u201d</p><p>Making sure she hid the mischief she knew was brewing in her eyes, she sidestepped Connor and headed for the stairs. \u201cY\u2019all have fun going through your reports.\u201d</p><p>As she bopped up the stairs it occurred to her that she actually felt . . . happy. Not in a disgusting \u201cZip a Dee Doo Dah\u201d way. She wouldn\u2019t be busting out the sunshine songs or anything. But she felt relieved, happy and a little excited all at the same time.</p><p>She felt strong. Empowered. A little more in control of her own destiny. It shamed her to realize just how much she\u2019d allowed to go on around her. She literally bounced from person to person, always allowing others to control the puppet strings. She performed. She did what she was told. She ate was she was told to eat. She exercised when she was told to exercise. She smiled when someone said smile. She performed like a windup doll.</p><p>And she\u2019d been perfectly miserable the whole time. Angry and miserable.</p><p>She\u2019d embraced such an existence because she truly felt it was what she deserved. But was it really?</p><p>She shook her head, unwilling to mar what was shaping up to be a perfect day with dark memories. She didn\u2019t want to go there. She didn\u2019t want to think about things she couldn\u2019t change.</p><p>What she wanted to do was enjoy a swim and maybe tweak Connor in the process. He\u2019d probably be pissed, but the impish demon inside her simply couldn\u2019t resist the desire to needle him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yep. A simple little swim would be fun. And she hadn\u2019t had fun in a damn long time. Not until she\u2019d met Connor and his friends and allowed herself to relax and truly enjoy the company of others. She liked it. Liked it a hell of a lot.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother searching her stuff for a suit. She didn\u2019t have one. She stripped down until she was bare-assed naked and then threw on a robe and tied the ends for her trip down the stairs.</p><p>Connor had told her to enjoy herself. She planned to take him up on it.</p><p>\u201cYou realize we\u2019re going to get totally busted for this,\u201d Julie said as Sam rolled to a stop at the gates of the house Lyric was staying in.</p> <p>Serena waved a dismissive hand as Sam rolled down the window to address the guard. \u201cWhat are they going to do, shoot us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Faith murmured as she surveyed the automatic slung over the guard\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe are here to see Ms. Jones,\u201d Sam said in his somber voice.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir. No one gets onto the premises without direct authorization.\u201d</p><p>Angelina\u2019s eyes widened. Direct authorization? she mouthed.</p> <p>\u201cLet me take care of this. Lyric gave me her cell number,\u201d Julie said as she yanked out her cell. She held up a finger through the window to the guard.</p><p>She punched in Lyric\u2019s number and waited as it rang.</p><p>\u201cI could just call Connor,\u201d Faith offered.</p><p>Julie snorted. \u201cAnd let him get all pissy with us for coming without his permission? Oh, hi, Lyric, it\u2019s Julie Tucker.\u201d She held up a finger to silence the other girls. \u201cI\u2019m good. Hey, what are you doing right now? Swimming? Oh that sounds fun. Uh yeah, we\u2019re kind of here at your front gates only the dude with the gun won\u2019t let us in without proper authorization. Think you could help us out with that?\u201d</p><p>Julie\u2019s face split into a grin. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>She closed the phone and leaned over the front seat to look out at the guard. \u201cMs. Jones will be calling you shortly.\u201d</p> <p>On cue, the guard reached for his phone and sent a glare into the car.</p><p>\u201cMs. Jones,\u201d he greeted. \u201cYes, there are four women here to see you.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. Perhaps it would be better if I were to speak to Mr. Malone or Mr. Murphy.\u201d He winced. \u201cYes, of course, I understand Mr. Malone and Mr. Murphy are in an important meeting. No, ma\u2019am, I understand. Yes, of course. I\u2019ll let them in immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our girl,\u201d Serena said with a grin.</p><p>The gate swung open and the guard motioned them in, though he looked less than happy to be doing so. Sam drove the car up the drive and parked in front.</p><p>\u201cLyric said for us to come around to the pool,\u201d Julie said as they all piled out. \u201cYou going to make it, Angelina?\u201d</p><p>Angelina shot her a glare as Sam helped her from the car. \u201cI\u2019m not that huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d Julie said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so going to drown you,\u201d Angelina muttered.</p> <p>\u201cI feel it best if I accompany you ladies,\u201d Sam said stiffly.</p><p>Serena patted his arm. \u201cOf course, Sam. You can keep us safe from all the guys with guns.\u201d</p><p>He pinched his lips together. \u201cI still don\u2019t think this was a good idea. Mr. Roche will be most displeased if I allow any harm to come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Roche does not have to know of all my comings and goings,\u201d Serena said dryly.</p><p>Two guards appeared, both armed, and they glanced warily at the women. Julie couldn\u2019t say she entirely blamed them. Women were probably scarier creatures than a whole horde of men with knives and guns.</p><p>\u201cCan you direct us to the pool?\u201d Julie asked airily.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t really shoot us, will they?\u201d Faith whispered as they started forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m in labor if they do any funny stuff,\u201d Angelina said in a low voice. \u201cPregnant women always scare the shit out of men.\u201d</p><p>Sam hovered protectively over the women as they traipsed around the side of the house. He shot scowls at the men who flanked them. It was pretty funny because Julie\u2019s money was on Sam in a throwdown. He might come across as all starchy and straitlaced, but he was a big son of a bitch and he got growly when it came to \u201chis\u201d women.</p><p>As soon as the gate to the pool was opened, they saw Lyric pressed against the side of the pool, staring expectantly in their direction. She lifted an arm to wave, and it was then Julie realized Lyric didn\u2019t have a stitch of clothing on.</p><p>She started laughing. The others stared at Julie and then back at Lyric, and Faith\u2019s mouth formed an O.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lyric called. \u201cGosh, I\u2019m so glad to see you guys. How on earth did you manage it? I\u2019m practically kept prisoner here, with no visitation, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the lam today,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>Serena burst out laughing. \u201cLam? Faith, you crack me up sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the men don\u2019t know where we are. We\u2019re supposed to be \u2018shopping.\u2019 They\u2019d probably have a kitten if they knew we\u2019d come over here. But honestly, what do they think is going to happen? We have Sam, and Lyric has guys hanging from the tree branches with guns.\u201d</p><p>Lyric chuckled. \u201cI asked Connor if I could have you guys over and he gave me the spiel about how it wasn\u2019t safe, blah blah, and he\u2019s right, but I\u2019m awfully glad to see you, and you\u2019re already here, so there\u2019s no reason for you to leave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we interrupting?\u201d Angelina asked with a pointed glance in Lyric\u2019s direction.</p><p>Lyric glanced down and then back up at the women and grinned. \u201cOh no. Connor and Kane are mulling over background checks, criminal records and all that fun stuff, so I decided to take a swim. I figure Connor will pop a button when he sees I\u2019m skinny-dipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn more ways than one,\u201d Julie muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys come in? The water\u2019s great. I\u2019ll have the chef make us something yummy. I\u2019ll have drinks made. Whatever you guys want.\u201d</p><p>Julie glanced at the other women. \u201cWe didn\u2019t exactly come prepared to swim, and it\u2019s cold out today! Aren\u2019t you freezing?\u201d</p><p>Lyric arched an eyebrow. \u201cSo? The pool is heated and you don\u2019t need a suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA swim would feel really nice,\u201d Angelina said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWe can fire up the hot tub later if you find the water too cold,\u201d Lyric offered.</p><p>Faith frowned. \u201cBut not too hot. It isn\u2019t good for Angelina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo strip and get in,\u201d Lyric said.</p><p>Sam cleared his throat. \u201cPerhaps I should relay your wishes to the chef and make myself available inside.\u201d</p><p>Serena laughed. \u201cGood idea, Sam.\u201d She turned to the other women. \u201cWell? Are we up to being totally daring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr are you chiiickennn,\u201d Lyric taunted.</p><p>\u201cOh hell no, you did not call me chicken,\u201d Julie muttered.</p><p>Lyric pushed off from the side of the pool and swam backward to the center of the pool. \u201cLast one in doesn\u2019t get the really yummy cupcakes the chef baked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChef? Cupcakes?\u201d Faith shook her head. \u201cI must be doing something wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that cupcake,\u201d Angelina said as she started pulling at her pants.</p><p>Laughter and shrieks hit the air as the women all started shucking out of their clothes. Shirts and pants flew through the air and soon it looked like an orgy had taken place on the patio as clothes hung from every chair, were strewn on the ground, and panties and bras hung from the bushes lining the walkway.</p><p>Soon they were all in the water, and for Lyric, what she\u2019d thought was an absolutely perfect day had just gotten better.</p><p>\u201cDid you swear Sam to secrecy?\u201d Angelina asked Serena. \u201cI really don\u2019t want the guys to come barging in and ruin our girly day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can have one of the guards shoot them,\u201d Lyric said calmly. She swam to the side of the pool and looped her arms along the concrete to hold herself up as she kicked her feet below the surface.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t wonder where we are for a few hours yet,\u201d Serena said confidently. \u201cThey were all so relieved that he was stuck taking us shopping that they won\u2019t even think to look for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept Damon, who loves to shop for you,\u201d Faith said smugly.</p><p>Serena shrugged. \u201cWhat can I say? The man has better taste in clothing than I do.\u201d</p><p>Lyric eyed the intricate gold band on Serena\u2019s upper arm and remembered Damon\u2019s possessive caress and the way he touched her there often.</p><p>\u201cSo how have you been, Lyric?\u201d Angelina asked. \u201cIs Connor still being mean to you?\u201d</p><p>Lyric felt heat rush into her cheeks. The other women obviously noticed it too because their eyes sharpened like vultures going after road kill.</p><p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, spill!\u201d Julie demanded. \u201cOh my God, Serena and I have been dying to know all about Mr. Stick Up His Ass. I\u2019ll admit to him firing more than a few girly fantasies.\u201d</p><p>Faith clamped her hands over her ears and promptly fell underwater. She came up sputtering and holding her hand out. \u201cOh please. No. He\u2019s my brother, for God\u2019s sake. I don\u2019t want to hear this!\u201d</p><p>Angelina rolled her eyes. \u201cYour brother is hot, Faith. Deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t mean,\u201d Lyric defended. \u201cHe\u2019s been very . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Serena said knowingly. \u201cVery good? Very sexy?\u201d</p><p>Lyric laughed. \u201cWell, yes and yes.\u201d</p><p>Julie grinned. \u201cOh this is great. I love it. Connor Malone has met his match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d Lyric said carefully.</p><p>\u201cOh crap, men alert,\u201d Faith said as she ducked farther underneath the water.</p><p>Lyric looked up to see the chef and one of his assistants carry out a platter of hors d\u2019oeuvres.</p><p>\u201cOh stop it, Faith. You\u2019re freaking gorgeous. Let them look and lust over what they\u2019ll never have,\u201d Julie said cheekily.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are so never telling Gray about this,\u201d Faith squeaked. \u201cHe\u2019ll kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>The chef cleared his throat and did his best to avert his gaze, though Lyric could see him totally sneaking glances.</p><p>\u201cI would be happy to provide drinks for you ladies. I have a fully stocked liquor cabinet, and one of my assistants is a trained bartender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh, Lyric. You have all the good stuff,\u201d Julie sighed.</p><p>Lyric grinned. \u201cWell, order up. I\u2019ve never tried drunk swimming before. Maybe we should see if any of the security team is a trained lifeguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bad idea,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cAsk Sam to come out,\u201d Serena said to the chef. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked when the other women looked at her. \u201cHe\u2019s seen me naked before. Hello? Damon keeps me naked pretty much twenty-four/seven when we\u2019re at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I even want to know?\u201d Lyric asked.</p><p>\u201cOh we\u2019ll fill you in on Serena\u2019s lifestyle after a few drinks,\u201d Angelina said.</p><p>Serena turned and lifted an imperious brow in Angelina\u2019s direction. \u201cAnd yours?\u201d</p><p>Angelina flushed but laughed good-naturedly. \u201cOkay, maybe not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere I go, feeling frighteningly boring again,\u201d Lyric said. \u201cYou guys are killing me with all these interesting comments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only normal slash sane one in this group,\u201d Julie said.</p><p>Julie was immediately swamped with waves of water as Faith, Angelina and Serena all drenched her.</p><p>\u201cDrinks, ladies?\u201d the chef reminded.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, forgot,\u201d Lyric said. And now that the chef and his wide-eyed assistant had gotten quite the show . . .</p><p>\u201cHmm, why don\u2019t you surprise us?\u201d Serena suggested. \u201cMake us some yummy, fruity cocktails with the cute little umbrellas. We can stage our own little beach getaway here at the pool.\u201d</p><p>The chef nodded, then turned and had to nudge his assistant to get him to snap his attention away from the women.</p><p>Angelina grabbed on to one of the floaties and rested her chin atop it as she floated lazily in the deep end. \u201cThis is so nice. I feel like a walrus, mind you, but man, this feels wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you all came,\u201d Lyric said. \u201cThis has been such a great day and now it\u2019s only better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Do tell,\u201d Julie prompted.</p><p>Lyric grinned and she reached for one of the floats lying on the side of the pool, then propelled herself along the surface of the water so that she floated close to Angelina.</p><p>\u201cI fired my manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Really?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>Lyric nodded. \u201cYep. Thanks to Connor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, we obviously need deets here,\u201d Julie said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it. Over drinks,\u201d she said smugly.</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>Connor pinched the bridge of his nose and put down the last report in his stack. He checked his watch. He and Kane had been sequestered for the entire afternoon. They\u2019d crawled through the lives of every single person even remotely attached to Lyric or her tour. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The problem was, there were more than a few who\u2019d raised serious flags. How they ever got hired in the first place would remain a mystery to Connor. Which further cemented his opinion that Lyric\u2019s entire operation was half-assed and run by morons.</p><p>He laid aside four profiles that required more than a cursory runthrough. One guy in particular had riled Connor\u2019s what-the-fuck meter. He had priors for assault. There were two restraining orders issued by former girlfriends, and his old man was in jail for domestic violence.</p><p>Still, Connor had his money on the two fuck-buddy bodyguards. Maybe he was prejudiced against them, given that they\u2019d slept with the woman he was currently sleeping with, but the evidence was stacked against them. They had opportunity and access. What Connor wasn\u2019t sure of, however, was motive.</p><p>He picked up the phone to call Gray. He and Nathan could do quite a bit of legwork, which would leave Connor to focus his attention on the most important thing: Keeping Lyric safe.</p> <p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d he said when Gray answered.</p><p>\u201cHey, stranger. You\u2019ve survived Lyric, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he defended, and then winced. He needed to just shut the hell up.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. So what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Connor relayed the information to Gray, who stopped him so he could take notes. \u201cCan you fax me those reports you have?\u201d he asked after a moment.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll e-mail them to you. Kane has them on his computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s heading up the security team Armstrong hired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh okay. He good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Connor said. \u201cSeems on top of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the ever-loving hell?\u201d Kane said from across the room.</p> <p>\u201cHang on a second, Gray.\u201d</p><p>Connor put the phone down to his leg and frowned over at Kane, who was looking out the window. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>Kane turned around, his lips twitching. \u201cDepends on whether you consider a pool full of naked girls a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Connor got up and strode across the room to look down at the pool below. \u201cOh Christ!\u201d</p><p>He yanked the phone back up. \u201cGray, mind telling me what the hell your wife is doing over here? And naked, I might add. For God\u2019s sake, man, she\u2019s my sister! My eyes are burning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? Faith is out shopping with the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no. They\u2019re all in Lyric\u2019s pool. Butt-ass naked, I might add.\u201d</p> <p>There was dead silence on the other end.</p><p>\u201cLook, I got to go. I need to handle this,\u201d Connor said. And before Gray could respond, Connor cut the connection.</p><p>\u201cLooks like a hell of a party,\u201d Kane murmured.</p><p>Connor followed Kane\u2019s gaze to the clothing draped from one end of the pool area to the other. Hell, there were panties dangling from the shrubbery. He closed his eyes. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly I don\u2019t have your issues,\u201d Kane said in amusement. \u201cNone of them are related to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just keep your damn eyes to yourself,\u201d Connor growled. \u201cThey\u2019re all attached. Very attached.\u201d</p><p>Kane raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh? I hadn\u2019t realized Lyric was taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>He turned and started down the stairs, trying not to focus on the fact that five very naked, very beautiful women were swimming in the pool. Or how the hell he was going to fish them all out. Preferably before their very pissed-off husbands showed up.</p><p>He found the kitchen in turmoil. Every single one of the kitchen assistants was busting his nuts to be the one taking trays out to the pool.</p><p>He stopped them with a single glare. They retreated into the kitchen, nearly stumbling in their haste to avoid Connor.</p><p>He stalked toward the door leading to the patio and pool area. As soon as he opened the door, the air was filled with chatter and laughter. Music reverberated through the air, and to his horror, the girls had taken up a game of volleyball, using an imaginary net.</p><p>Nothing, however, was imaginary about the way they came out of the water to hit the ball back and forth.</p><p>He quickly scanned the patio but found only Sam, standing legs apart, arms over chest, his gaze focused on an area much higher than where the girls were swimming.</p><p>\u201cAnyone mind telling me what the hell is going on here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Five women simultaneously slid under the water until only their noses were visible.</p><p>\u201cWell hell, don\u2019t hide now. Not like everyone in the house hasn\u2019t seen you by now.\u201d</p><p>Lyric scowled. \u201cSam alerts us when anyone steps out of the door. Or he did anyway. Somehow you got by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And the security team, which is charged with your safety, mind you, are all getting an eyeful as we speak since they can\u2019t very well not protect you and watch out for you just because you decided to have a party. Which, I might add, was completely unauthorized, and you were specifically told you couldn\u2019t have company. Nor were you to so much as take a piss without mine or Kane\u2019s knowledge.\u201d</p><p>Julie giggled. Then Serena joined in. Angelina snickered and Faith sighed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Faith said in resignation. \u201cSo he totally does have a stick up his ass.\u201d</p><p>The four other women burst into laughter. He glared at every one of them, not that it did a damn bit of good. They laughed and kept laughing until tears ran down their cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you find this so damn amusing,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Lyric swam over to the side of the pool where he stood, and before he could react, she pulled herself out and stood before him, naked as the day she was born, and goddamn if he didn\u2019t react to the sight of her dripping wet, beads of water running over some very strategic areas. Goose bumps immediately dotted her flesh, causing her nipples to tighten as she shivered in front of him.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cWhere are your damn clothes? You\u2019re going to freeze to death.\u201d</p><p>She stuck out her bottom lip in an exaggerated pout. \u201cWe\u2019re having fun, Connor. The guys are looking out for us, right? What could possibly happen? Are you expecting a team of assassins to swoop in and murder us all in the pool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t know they were coming, but I wasn\u2019t going to tell them to go away. I enjoy their company. You and Kane were off doing your thing. I was happy to have them over. I like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe like you too, Lyric,\u201d Faith called.</p><p>She turned and grinned over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have a very nice ass,\u201d Julie said solemnly.</p><p>Connor closed his eyes. \u201cFor the love of God . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was a lesbian, I\u2019d totally do you,\u201d Serena offered.</p><p>Connor sighed. He stared at the women suspiciously. \u201cJust how much have you girls had to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, you\u2019ll have to talk to the chef. Or the bartender. Yeah, the cute young guy. He makes the most yummy drinks,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>Connor rubbed a hand through his hair. He glanced over at Angelina, who was tucked behind a float. \u201cYou okay, sweetie? You haven\u2019t been drinking, have you?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at him. \u201cOh, for Pete\u2019s sake, Connor. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get back in now or are you shutting us down?\u201d Lyric asked.</p><p>\u201cWould you listen if I said no?\u201d he asked dryly.</p><p>She smiled cheekily. To his surprise she leaned up on tiptoe and kissed him full on the mouth. He was so shocked he just stood there with a blank look on his face as she pulled away.</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>With that she turned and hopped back into the pool amidst cheers from her very inebriated accomplices.</p><p>His cell phone rang and with a groan he pulled it out. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>\u201cIs my wife over there? And more important, is she naked?\u201d Nathan demanded.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>\u201cGet her some damn clothes. I don\u2019t want the whole security team looking at what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>Nathan cursed. \u201cWhat the hell are they thinking? Are they crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d Connor asked in exasperation. \u201cThey\u2019re demented. But they\u2019re not my damn responsibility. Only one woman is. You think I like seeing my sister in the buff? I\u2019m going to have nightmares for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that!\u201d Faith yelled. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick his ass for you,\u201d Julie said.</p><p>\u201cYou tell Julie to stay her ass in the pool,\u201d Nathan said, overhearing Julie\u2019s exclamation.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not getting into this,\u201d Connor said wearily. \u201cThey\u2019re having some kind of goddamn party. Sam is here. I assume he\u2019ll make sure they all get home okay. I\u2019ll drive them myself if I have to.\u201d</p><p>Before Nathan could argue further, Connor hung up. He surveyed the girls again, glad that dusk was falling and it was more difficult to make out their nudity in the water. But it was also getting cooler and they were just drunk enough not to figure out they risked hypothermia gallivanting around wet and naked.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. No one knows where you are.\u201d</p><p>Serena snapped her lips shut and slowly shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNice. Throw me under the bus. Now all your husbands will be pissed at me,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get that stick out of your ass,\u201d Faith said darkly.</p><p>He stared at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve defended you long enough. You need to chill the fuck out.\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cUhm, Faith? Just how much have you had to drink tonight? I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea for you to be in the pool. It\u2019s too chilly out here. You\u2019re all going to get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s acting as our lifeguard,\u201d Julie pointed out. \u201cBesides, the pool is heated. It\u2019s only cold when we get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need some help, Connor?\u201d Kane asked lazily.</p><p>Connor turned and fixed Kane with his stare. \u201cI told you to stay inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you looked like you needed backup.\u201d</p><p>Amusement was heavy in Kane\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Lyric muttered. \u201cParty\u2019s over. Mr. Makes Connor Look Relaxed is here.\u201d</p><p>Faith giggled. \u201cIs he that bad? I don\u2019t know, Lyric. He\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>Kane lifted an eyebrow. \u201cCute? Why do I think I\u2019ve just been relegated to puppy-dog status?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mean to me,\u201d Lyric said. \u201cConnor isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Angelina frowned in Kane\u2019s direction. Serena and Julie both crossed their arms over their breasts\u2014thank God\u2014and glared at Kane.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being mean to Lyric?\u201d Serena demanded. \u201cWant us to kick his ass?\u201d she asked Lyric.</p><p>Kane laughed softly. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t fight your way out of a paper bag in your condition, sweetheart. I\u2019m not mean to Ms. Jones. I just expect her to cooperate with my desire to keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Faith said. \u201cWell, that\u2019s different, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, as much as I\u2019d like to let you ladies continue enjoying yourself in your present state, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could stop giving my men a heart attack and maybe put on some robes if we got you some. We\u2019ll be happy to ensure your safety if you\u2019d like to continue eating or drinking. I\u2019d just like you to be dressed and out of the pool when you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s good, Lyric,\u201d Serena murmured. \u201cVery smooth.\u201d</p><p>Kane smiled. \u201cGlad you think so, Mrs. Roche.\u201d</p><p>At that she frowned. \u201cHow do you know who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to know everyone who comes into contact with Ms. Jones.\u201d</p><p>Faith thrust out her chin. \u201cJust don\u2019t be mean to Lyric. We\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Kane chuckled. \u201cI have no doubt you\u2019d try, Mrs. Montgomery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. Get us the robes,\u201d Julie grumbled. \u201cBut I go on record saying you\u2019re even less fun than Connor.\u201d</p><p>Kane raised his hand and, a few seconds later, one of his men came out carrying several fluffy robes. Connor took them and then motioned for both Kane and his man to leave. He\u2019d be damned if they saw any of the women naked.</p><p>He turned back in resignation of the evening ahead. \u201cIf I lay these on the table, can I trust you to get out of the pool and into them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you\u2019d just leave, we could enjoy our nekkid swim party,\u201d Lyric grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m being reasonable by allowing it to continue and not tossing everyone off the grounds.\u201d</p><p>Several sounds of exasperation echoed from the water.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try to toss me anywhere, Connor Malone,\u201d Julie muttered.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou know I love you all dearly, but you\u2019re interfering in my job, not to mention I\u2019ll now have to answer to guys I work with as to why I allowed their women to cavort around in the nude.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, we can handle them,\u201d Faith said with a sniff. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we had an orgy or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough that could be fun,\u201d Lyric added. \u201cI think the only thing I haven\u2019t been accused of is a lesbian orgy. Maybe we should call one of the tabloids.\u201d</p><p>Connor groaned. \u201cFor the love of God. Just get out of the pool and into your robes. I\u2019ll make sure your bartender and the chef supply you with booze and food. If you really want to be good and get dried off and dressed, you can continue this inside where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot chocolate would be nice,\u201d Serena mused. \u201cAnd it is getting cooler. March is such a screwed-up month. Hot, cold, hot, cold.\u201d</p> <p>Connor closed his eyes and sighed. Any other man would be in heaven surrounded by gorgeous, naked women all slicked down with water and all sporting chill bumps from hell. He, on the other hand, was praying for deliverance and for a little cooperation before all hell broke loose.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, he\u2019s getting that look,\u201d Lyric said. \u201cLet\u2019s get out and get dressed. We\u2019ll take over the living room and kick all the guys out. What time are you guys supposed to be home anyway?\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence and then Faith said, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>Connor checked his watch. \u201cSix thirty.\u201d</p><p>Serena giggled. \u201cI think we said we\u2019d be home by five. Oops.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Roche is aware of your delay,\u201d Sam said calmly.</p><p>\u201cIt would appear that Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Tucker are as well,\u201d Faith said on a laugh. \u201cWhich only leaves Micah. Angelina? Are you going to call him?\u201d</p><p>Angelina shook her head. \u201cHuh-uh. I\u2019m still riding the marriage card. He\u2019s so happy I said yes, he can\u2019t possibly get pissed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m starting to feel real sorry for the guys,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>Lyric climbed the steps from the pool and it took all his discipline not to stare. She walked over and snagged one of the robes and wrapped it around her shivering body. Hell, he wanted to wrap himself around her until she was warm and soft against him.</p><p>\u201cTrust the guys to stick together,\u201d she drawled. \u201cCome on, girls. Let\u2019s take this party inside.\u201d</p> <p>Connor whirled around and strode to the door before the other women took their exit from the pool. Their laughter followed him all the way inside.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>Connor and Kane got Julie, Angelina, Serena and Faith into the car while Lyric watched from the front door. As they drove away, Lyric waved.</p><p>Connor and Kane walked back to the door and Connor looked harassed. His cell phone rang and he jammed his hand into his pocket to silence it.</p><p>\u201cGet some damn clothes on,\u201d he said under his breath when he walked by her into the house.</p><p>She tugged the robe tighter around her and grinned. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly covered!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I know your naked underneath that robe and so does everyone else. For God\u2019s sake show a little mercy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll go up.\u201d She hesitated a moment and then looked at both Connor and Kane. \u201cAre you guys going to be around for a bit?\u201d</p> <p>Kane looked curiously at her. \u201cIf you need us to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be but a minute upstairs. I\u2019d like . . . I\u2019d like to talk to you when I get back down if you have the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have time.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Connor and he nodded, his eyes never leaving her face. She smiled. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right back down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant some more hot chocolate?\u201d Connor asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That would be nice. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She skipped up the stairs, bobbled a bit, then clung tightly to the railing. She\u2019d sort of forgotten how much she\u2019d had to drink and, as a former nondrinker, she\u2019d discovered she was a lightweight when it came to alcohol.</p><p>After steadying herself a moment, she continued up the stairs and into the bedroom. Deciding to take a quick shower to take care of the pool hair, she hopped in and out, threw a towel around her head and quickly dressed.</p><p>She combed her hair down and left it wet before heading back down the stairs feeling a good bit more sober than she had fifteen minutes ago.</p><p>She found Kane and Connor in the living room sprawled on the couches. Connor looked tired and she almost giggled when he reached into his pocket to silence yet another call. Between her manager, her label and the girls\u2019 husbands, Connor was getting it from all corners.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d Kane asked when he looked up and saw her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel bad before,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cToday has been . . . liberating. Fun.\u201d</p><p>Connor leaned forward and picked up a steaming mug of hot chocolate. He held it up but didn\u2019t make a move to bring it over. He was enticing her to come to him. Once she caught a whiff of the decadent aroma, he didn\u2019t have to do much to get her to do his bidding.</p><p>She went over, took the cup from him and then sat forward on the couch next to him, cradling the warm mug in her palms. Connor\u2019s hand immediately went to her back, stroking up and down.</p><p>She drew comfort from that gesture. She loved him touching her. She was so contented right now that she could curl into his arms like a satisfied kitten and purr endlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>She pulled the mug away and held it on her lap. She pursed her lips a moment trying to formulate her thoughts. This was new territory for her. For so long she\u2019d relied on others around her, her management team, her record label, her security, her handlers, to make decisions for her. Her motto was show up, do what she needed to do and then move on to the next show and do it all over again.</p><p>Firing Paul had been huge for her. She doubted even Connor knew just what a momentous step it was. It had been a much-needed slap in the face. A wake-up call that her life was out of control because she\u2019d allowed it to be so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to make some changes.\u201d She swallowed. It took all her courage to say the next. \u201cI\u2019m a little afraid. I would like your help.\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s hand stilled on her back, then slid up to her nape and squeezed reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my label to hire a new security firm.\u201d</p><p>Kane frowned. She turned slightly to see the same frown on Connor\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is that I don\u2019t want Phillip to choose. He means well. I have no doubt that he has my best interests and my safety in mind. He\u2019ll hire competent people. But I think I should be the one who decides who holds my safety in their hands.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in another deep breath, gripped the mug a little tighter and then glanced up at Kane. \u201cWould your firm be willing to take over my security while I\u2019m on the road?\u201d</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t respond right away. He glanced at Connor, then back at Lyric.</p><p>\u201cI understand if you\u2019re not set up to travel. It\u2019s just that I . . .\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI trust your team more than some random firm that Phillip hires. I don\u2019t know them. I know you . . . now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure something could be worked out,\u201d Kane said slowly. \u201cBut you need to consider whether this is going to cause you trouble with your label.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell Phillip that from now on I\u2019m going to have a more active part in my career. To be honest, I think he\u2019ll be relieved and more than willing for me to take the reins.\u201d</p><p>Connor\u2019s thumb tightened at her neck. He ran his other hand over her arm and squeezed lightly in approval.</p><p>Kane\u2019s eyes glinted and then he smiled. \u201cI think I may have misjudged you, Ms. Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please, call me Lyric. Ms. Jones sounds so stuffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Lyric. The problem is that I can\u2019t assemble a team as soon as two weeks. Less than two weeks now. I\u2019ll need to handpick men for the detail and I\u2019ll want to oversee the operation for the first little while until I\u2019m satisfied that everything is progressing well. If you want the best, it\u2019ll take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go back on tour right away. I\u2019ll be in the studio recording for a bit. I also have a few appearances but they could be cancelled. My tour picks up in six weeks. Runs for two months and then I have a break at which time I\u2019ll finish recording the next album. Would that give you enough time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need to decide if you can afford me first,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIf I want the best, I have to be prepared to pay for it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the first thing you need to do is ask for a bid. You\u2019ll want to know everything I can do for you and you\u2019ll want to know how much it\u2019ll cost you. I\u2019ll want complete control over picking the men for the detail, and each one will be screened personally by me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHow soon can you get that to me?\u201d</p><p>Kane smiled. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking. You catch on quick.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Connor and slipped her hand into his. \u201cI know I probably shouldn\u2019t ask this. But again, I\u2019m a little nervous. I don\u2019t think it will be a problem. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ask, baby,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI want to fire R.J. and Trent. Buy them out. Whatever. The problems are that I\u2019m not sure what, if any, out I have in the contract, and they\u2019re supposed to come in for the rodeo performance. They aren\u2019t going to take it well. I\u2019ve allowed them far too much latitude in their job. My fault, but there you have it.\u201d</p><p>He put a finger to her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>She breathed out a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cAny other earth-shattering changes you\u2019re contemplating?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together and scrunched her brows. \u201cI want to go whole hog. I\u2019ve surrounded myself with people I don\u2019t trust, who don\u2019t care about me, have no investment in me beyond the paycheck I provide them. I know it sounds hypocritical. They don\u2019t owe me anything other than to do the job they\u2019re paid to do just like I don\u2019t owe them anything beyond that paycheck. But I don\u2019t want it to be that way. I want . . . I need a change. I don\u2019t like my life very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it,\u201d Connor said. \u201cIf anyone can turn things around, it\u2019s you. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person in the world who can run over you unless you let them.\u201d</p><p>A smile twitched at her lips. \u201cYeah, I am a good bitch on wheels when given the right motivation.\u201d</p><p>Kane chuckled and she turned quickly back to glare at him. \u201cYou are not to agree with that statement.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands in surrender. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think you\u2019re doing the right thing. It\u2019s never too late to regain control over your career. And your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what the tabloids do with all of this when it gets out,\u201d she said wryly. \u201cThey\u2019ll have a field day. It\u2019ll likely be reported that I\u2019ve checked into the funny farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck \u2019em,\u201d Connor said. \u201cYou\u2019ll know the truth. The people who care about you will know the truth. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who are the people who care about me?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He looked straight into her eyes. Then he reached out and touched her cheek, just one gentle brush with his fingertip. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>Connor returned from taking the cups to the kitchen and saw that Lyric had fallen asleep on the couch. Not that it surprised him. She\u2019d been bobbing and weaving for over an hour as she sat and talked to him and Kane. It was obvious she had no desire to go up to her room. Alone. She\u2019d clung to their company until fatigue had overcome her.</p><p>\u201cWant me to get her a blanket?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>Connor shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll take her up. She\u2019ll be more comfortable in her bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to turn in then. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Kane walked quietly out of the living room and Connor stared down at Lyric, who was curled against the end of the couch, her head on the arm rest. He reached down and touched a strand of her hair that had fallen over her eyes and gently pushed it back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met anyone like you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cJust when I think I\u2019ve got you all figured out, you manage to surprise me all over again. I wonder sometimes if you even know who you are.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and slid his arms underneath her curled-up body and hoisted her up. She stirred and made a murmur of protest and then promptly cuddled into his chest.</p><p>He liked the way she felt in his arms. All soft and snuggly, her head tucked underneath his chin like she was made to go there.</p><p>Slowly he navigated the stairs and headed into her bedroom, where he deposited her onto the bed. She yawned and then her eyelids fluttered open and she blinked up at him.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her on the forehead. \u201cYou going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>As he drew away, uncertainty, and a little fear, flashed in her eyes. She was clearly torn between wanting him to go and not wanting to be alone. He wasn\u2019t going to push her. She had to make the choice herself, even if he had no desire to go anywhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was something infinitely fragile about Lyric. Behind the badass persona was a fascinating mix of fear and insecurity that he still hadn\u2019t been able to discern the reason for.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d she said. Her gaze traveled over his face and he saw a hint of uncertainty. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d like you to stay. If you want . . .\u201d</p><p>He bent down and shushed her with a kiss. He was purposely tender, allowing his mouth to melt over hers. \u201cI want. I want very much. How about we get more comfortable and get into bed.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been his plan to make love to her, but he\u2019d gone instantly hard the moment she\u2019d given him that sleepy, seductive look.</p><p>She rolled to the side of the bed and rose. He watched in the low light as she began undressing. She pulled her shirt over her head and then peeled down her jeans until she was clad in only her bra and panties.</p><p>It was a sight to make a red-blooded man get a raging case of lust. Jet-black and lacy. Ultrafeminine but it also screamed \u201cBad girl gonna rock your world.\u201d</p><p>When she turned, he could see the mounds of her breasts pushed up to their best advantage, and the slightest hint of a peach-colored nipple peeked from above the cup.</p><p>As if he weren\u2019t even there, she stretched lazily and then pushed the frothy lace from her body. As soon as she was naked, she crawled onto the bed and stretched out on her side, her vivid blue eyes trained on him as if telling him it was his turn.</p><p>He wondered if she knew what a provocative image she posed. Probably. She was likely grinning like a maniac on the inside because he was standing here with a bulge at his crotch that would make taking his jeans off painful and damn difficult.</p><p>When she shifted restlessly and slipped her fingers between her legs to delve into those soft folds, he lost what little patience he thought he was holding.</p><p>He yanked his shirt off and then fumbled with his pants. The condoms were where he\u2019d left them\u2014thank God\u2014and he reached for one of the packets on the nightstand while he unzipped his jeans with the other.</p><p>She continued to stroke herself and made soft little sounds of pleasure that drove him insane. He itched from the inside out, like he\u2019d been invaded by a thousand bugs.</p><p>He finally managed to get his pants and underwear off and he had to work at getting the condom on. He was so hard, the latex stretched tight over his aching erection until he worried he\u2019d split the damn thing.</p><p>He strode to the bed and she gave him an innocent little smile that told him she knew precisely how naughty she was being. He reached for her ankles, yanked her around and then pulled her to the end of the bed. He spread her thighs, held them wide apart and then stroked inside her with one forceful thrust.</p><p>Her pussy rippled over his flesh, hugging, fighting, sucking him deeper. His entire body went so taut he was going to get a frigging cramp. But damn, she felt good. So good.</p><p>He closed his eyes and clenched his jaw, determined not to come. He was close. After one thrust he was fighting off his release with everything he had.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed the valley between her breasts as he pulsed inside her, dying to move, dying to thrust hard and long until she begged him to stop.</p><p>Drawn to the plump swells of her breasts, he slid his tongue over the underside and then up over her nipple. A spasm rolled through her body and her pussy contracted around him in little, fluttery pulses that damn near made his eyes roll back in his head.</p><p>He nipped at the taut peak and then sucked it strongly between his teeth. She flinched and moved restlessly beneath him and then finally dug her fingers into his shoulders and lifted her hips.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Connor,\u201d she gasped. \u201cMove. Fuck me. Do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m going to come, baby. Give me just a minute to calm down. I want to make this good for you, not get inside you and be done within two minutes.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly and stroked her hands over his back, up the column of his neck and then into his hair. She was everywhere, touching, caressing. She curled her legs around his waist and arched into him, trying to get him deeper. As if that were possible. He was already balls deep, pressed so tight against her ass that it would take a crowbar to separate them.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll make it good for you. Let me love you. Let me show you how good it can be with someone who cares for you.\u201d</p> <p>She went so still that he worried he\u2019d crossed some invisible line. She looked\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014lost.</p><p>Worried he\u2019d lose her, he kissed a line to her jaw and then nibbled over to her lips before sealing his mouth over hers. He was consumed by her. He had to be careful or he\u2019d devour her. He had to pace himself and measure his kisses. She just tasted so good that he lacked control.</p><p>Raising his hands to frame her face, he pulled back just an inch or so and then thrust again as he claimed her mouth once more.</p><p>Their tongues slipped over each other, exploring and tasting. He began moving, withdrawing and thrusting, slowly at first and then harder and faster as he finally managed to leash the raging caveman inside who just wanted to claim his woman, mark her and slake his lust endlessly.</p><p>Oh yeah, he could do this all night.</p><p>Touching her. Tasting her. Getting so deep inside her that she couldn\u2019t shake him. He wanted her to believe in him. He wanted her to trust him. He wanted a lot of damn things.</p><p>He wanted to wrap himself around her so tight that nothing or no one could ever get to her or hurt her. He wanted to be her refuge.</p><p>His mouth slipped from hers and glanced over her cheek to her ear and then down her neck, kissing and sucking. He hadn\u2019t given her any sort of foreplay but he couldn\u2019t even muster the regret he should. She\u2019d been sleek and ready for him. Hot and damp. So fucking tight that he thought he\u2019d die getting inside her.</p><p>\u201cConnor,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m close. I can\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. Damn, but he didn\u2019t deserve this. He hadn\u2019t done anything to ensure her pleasure. He\u2019d gone after her like a rutting pig. Pinned her to the mattress and held her down while he got inside her.</p><p>It took everything he had, but he pulled out of her. His cock screamed hell no. She let out a whimper of protest. He kissed her belly and then dropped to his knees between her thighs. He was determined to make her feel every bit as good as he did.</p><p>Her pussy was swollen from his invasion. The soft pink lips were spread and her opening was red and distended from his size. Damn, but she was sexy.</p><p>He pressed his mouth to the opening. She flinched and let out a sharp cry of pleasure. Then he swept his tongue over and then pushed in until he tasted the very heart of her.</p><p>She went satiny sweet in his mouth. Like liquid silk.</p><p>Her legs came up and looped over his shoulders, squeezing his head and holding it in place. She pulsed against his mouth. Shudder after shudder rolled through her body. She lifted her hips but he grasped them and held them in place for his seeking mouth.</p><p>He tongued her clit, rolling the tip in a tight circle and then sucking softly at the quivering peak. She was as tight as a bow at full draw, her thighs rigid on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cConnor,\u201d she said softly. So sweetly it was like music over his ears. \u201cConnor,\u201d she said again on a sigh.</p><p>He rose and stared down at her half-lidded eyes, glazed with passion and yearning. She was sprawled out like a feast before him and he ate her with his eyes.</p><p>Then he reached and flipped her over until she was facedown on the mattress. She turned her head so that her cheek rested against the mattress and she closed her eyes as if anticipating where he\u2019d take her next.</p><p>He cupped her plump behind and kneaded the soft flesh, pushing and spreading so that her pussy was bared. He pulled until she was bent over the edge and then he pushed into her from behind, his abdomen pressing into her as he stroked deep.</p><p>Man, he loved her like this. His hands left her ass and smoothed up her delicate spine to her shoulders, and then he gripped her neck and thrust again, pulling her to meet his forceful thrusts.</p><p>He leaned down until his body was completely covering hers. Protecting. Sheltering. Completely blanketing her. Then he began fucking in and out, the sounds of his hips slapping against her ass rising in the silent room.</p><p>She moaned and stretched her arms out above her head as if surrendering completely to his dominance. He nipped at her shoulder, lightly at first and then harder.</p><p>He wanted to own her. He wanted to put his mark on her, to let her know she belonged to him. No one else. No other man would touch her. No other man would possess what he considered his.</p><p>She may not know it yet, but he was it for her. It was going to require patience. He was a patient guy when the reward was high.</p><p>She was going to be the biggest challenge of his life, but he was up to it. He wasn\u2019t going to fail.</p><p>She was his.</p><p>He lowered his body until his chest was flush with her back. She was cupped perfectly to him and he moved both their bodies as he stroked in and out in long, lazy thrusts.</p><p>Over and over he made his point, driving her so close to orgasm and then stilling as she moved restlessly beneath him, trying to make him take her over the edge. He waited and then began all over again, pushing into her, feeling the exquisite sensation of her pussy clutching at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Lyric,\u201d he whispered next to her ear. And then he thrust hard and deep and began pumping against her with renewed urgency.</p><p>He planted his palms on either side of her and levered himself up so that he could power more forcefully into her.</p><p>She cried out and went slick around him so that he glided with ease so deep, into the very heart of her. Faster. Harder.</p><p>Mindlessly he kept thrusting, even when her entire body went rigid and his name spilled from her lips over and over.</p><p>He chased one orgasm from her and went after another. Relentless. Wanting her to know who she belonged to. Who commanded her body and her pleasure.</p><p>She begged and pleaded. More. Stop. Don\u2019t stop. Oh God. Again.</p><p>\u201cConnor!\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled into fists above her, and she raised her head and pushed back against him as another orgasm raced through her body, igniting fire within him.</p><p>\u201cOh God, I\u2019m coming. Baby. You feel so good. Come with me, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>He swelled within her, so tight he could barely move even after she\u2019d come twice and her moisture bathed him. He withdrew and rolled her over roughly, spreading her legs and mounting her again, this time face-to-face. He wanted to see her. He wanted to drown in her eyes while he finally came.</p><p>He plunged deep. Withdrew and then plunged one last time. She wrapped herself around him. Arms, legs. She raised her head and buried it in his neck.</p><p>He came apart. It was the most gut-wrenching orgasm of his life. He couldn\u2019t be still. He kept thrusting and thrusting, like he was about to come out of his skin. He came and came, and he worried about the condom but he couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>She held him, stroking her hands over his back, clutching at him with her legs, pulling him deeper until there was no separation between them.</p><p>He slumped down over her, embedded deeply in her pussy as the last of his release tore from his body. He sucked in deep breaths. His entire body shook. He couldn\u2019t catch up. Couldn\u2019t process the magnitude of what he\u2019d just felt. It was earth-shattering. Weren\u2019t women supposed to be the ones who came undone during sex? He\u2019d never felt so damn vulnerable in his life.</p><p>Knowing he couldn\u2019t stay inside her after coming so violently, he groaned and rolled to the side, still holding her tightly against him.</p><p>He eased out of her, hoping like hell the condom wasn\u2019t already leaking. Then he reached down and pulled it off. He leaned back and aimed for the garbage can but he didn\u2019t give a shit if it made it or not. He\u2019d clean it up later. Right now he didn\u2019t want to separate himself from Lyric even for the two seconds it would take to dispose of the rubber.</p><p>She trembled against him and was so quiet, it worried him. What was he supposed to say after something like this? What was there to say?</p><p>He\u2019d scare the shit out of her if he spouted what he was thinking or feeling. Hell, any woman would waste no time getting the hell away if he told her that he wanted to tie her to him for the next year and never let her out of bed.</p><p>Sex made a man crazy. There was no other explanation for it.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t sex. And maybe that was the problem. He knew it went far deeper than that. It hadn\u2019t been sex even that first time. He knew it. He accepted it. He just didn\u2019t know what the hell he was supposed to do about it.</p><p>Worse, he had no idea how to handle Lyric. He couldn\u2019t afford to fuck this up. One wrong word and the walls would go up and he\u2019d be frozen out.</p><p>How the hell was a man ever supposed to know the right thing to say or do at precisely the right time? It was a wonder relationships ever worked.</p><p>Relationship. Hell. He was getting way too far ahead of himself. He was thinking too much. You weren\u2019t supposed to think after mind-blowing sex. That was his problem. He was getting all analytical\u2014and, God help him, all touchy-feely\u2014when he needed to just enjoy the moment and take things as they came. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Weren\u2019t women supposed to be the emotional creatures who couldn\u2019t separate sex from love?</p><p>He was fucked. So fucked.</p><p>He glanced down to see her eyes closed and her chest rising and falling as she cuddled against him. With a resigned sigh, he made the mental effort to shut his brain off. One should never make life-altering decisions when holding a naked woman in his arms.</p><p>For a long moment they lay there, silent and unmoving. He was about to drift into sleep himself, content that she hadn\u2019t hauled ass, when she stirred against him and started to push away.</p> <p>The alarm went off in his brain as she started to roll. He reached for her but she slipped from his grasp.</p><p>\u201cI need to go to the bathroom,\u201d she whispered, just as she\u2019d done the first night they\u2019d made love.</p><p>And he knew, just as he\u2019d known then, that she wouldn\u2019t be back.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>It was somehow fitting that during the night a cold front moved through and brought with it raw, rainy temperatures. In a lot of ways, it suited Lyric\u2019s mood.</p> <p>Fear was cold. Fear had icy fingers that gripped your heart and spread its chill through your soul.</p><p>Connor scared her. Not him, but what he represented. No matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t rid herself of the panicky, tight feeling in her chest.</p><p>How could she face him after what she\u2019d done? He\u2019d been . . . perfect. Just perfect. More than perfect. She didn\u2019t even have words to describe it simply because she\u2019d never had a man look at her, touch her . . . love her as Connor had done.</p><p>And her response? Run like hell.</p><p>She rubbed tiredly at her forehead as she stood shivering in the rain. She hadn\u2019t slept. She\u2019d spent the entire night secluded in the small library off the living room. Now she stood staring over the front lawn, taking in nothing and everything all at once as the rain fell softly around her.</p><p>A warm hand slid over her bare shoulder and squeezed. She knew instantly it was Connor, and she went still, dreading what he\u2019d say or do. He surprised her.</p> <p>\u201cCome inside, Lyric,\u201d he said gently. \u201cIt\u2019s cold and you have a performance tonight. Have you slept at all?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head mutely as he pulled her into his side and shielded her from the rain with his big body.</p><p>She wanted to say she was sorry but the words hung painfully in her throat. She wanted to tell him that she\u2019d never felt this way about another man and that she was scared shitless. She wanted to turn into him and hold on for dear life. Take what he offered and never let go.</p><p>But the fear wouldn\u2019t thaw. She was cold and frozen. Unable to move. Unable to reach out. And so she went quietly back inside and stood in front of the fireplace while he rubbed a towel through her hair.</p><p>Would he say something now? Would he ask her for explanations she couldn\u2019t provide? Ask her to reveal things long hidden?</p><p>But all he did was wrap a robe around her and pull the ends snug so she\u2019d be warm. He rubbed his hands up and down her shoulders several times and then said, \u201cYou have a few hours yet. You should try to sleep. I\u2019ll wake you in time to get to the arena.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stood there a moment longer. She couldn\u2019t meet his gaze because she knew he\u2019d see too much. Then he leaned down and pressed his lips to her forehead. She closed her eyes and tilted into his embrace, but he didn\u2019t touch her. Didn\u2019t hold her. Just one simple kiss and then he was gone.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to go back up to her bedroom. The fire crackled and sparked behind her and she turned to warm her hands. Warmth seeped into her bones and made her heavy with lethargy. She glanced over her shoulder to the couch. It was as good a place as any and she knew the security guys would be in and out, as would Connor and Kane, so she wouldn\u2019t be alone.</p> <p>With a sigh she stepped over and then crawled onto the couch. She turned to face the back and pulled her knees to her chest until she felt safe, warm and secure.</p><p>On the ride to Reliant Stadium, Lyric was tense and jittery. Connor rode in the back of the car while Kane remained up front. A car carrying the rest of her detail followed and another team had already gone ahead to set up for the show.</p><p>\u201cCan you make sure that the girls got the tickets I arranged for them?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>Connor slid a hand over hers. \u201cThey got them. Don\u2019t worry. They\u2019re going to have a blast.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent again and watched out the window as they approached the stadium. She wasn\u2019t sure why she was so nervous. It was like any other show. She\u2019d done it a million times. She wasn\u2019t the type to suffer stage fright. Singing was what she loved. It brought her peace. It was the one thing she did for herself. That others liked it and paid for the privilege of hearing it was just added bonus.</p><p>The car rolled to a stop outside the entrance to the myriad of rooms on the lower level of the stadium. The area was roped off and security was heavy, but there was still a crowd of fans who screamed the moment Lyric stepped from the vehicle.</p><p>Despite Connor urging her forward, she paused and turned to wave. She smiled broadly, blew kisses and then allowed Connor to pull her inside the building.</p><p>Almost immediately her shoulders relaxed as she stepped back into her world. The hustle and bustle backstage was something she was familiar with and embraced. She was back in her element.</p><p>Connor stopped at her dressing room. Kane and four of his men stood to the side. She started to open her door but Connor put his hand on her wrist.</p><p>\u201cStay here while I check it out.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back and Connor opened the door. To her surprise, R.J. and Trent were both sprawled on couches in the room. They both bolted up when Connor stepped into the room, but when she tried to follow, Kane stepped in front of her and blocked her entrance.</p><p>\u201cYou asked him for help,\u201d Kane said in a low voice. \u201cHe\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p><p>The sounds of R.J. and Trent arguing had her taking a step back. Kane moved with her, shielding her, careful to keep his body between her and the men at all times. Two of his men flanked her. One of them pulled out a handgun and stood alert while two others went into the room to give Connor help.</p><p>\u201cSend her a bill,\u201d she heard Connor say. \u201cOr don\u2019t. Either way your employment has been terminated. You\u2019ll be escorted from the premises, and if you step foot on or around her tour again, I\u2019ll have you arrested.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened when a thump sounded. And then a crash. Then she heard what sounded like something or someone hitting the wall.</p><p>She took a step forward but Kane pressed in close and maneuvered her farther away until she was against the far wall in the hall. She was surrounded by male bodies, and it drove her crazy that she couldn\u2019t see what was going on.</p><p>A few moments later, Kane stepped back just in time for her to see R.J. and Trent being manhandled down the hall by Kane\u2019s men. Blood smeared Trent\u2019s nose and R.J. was sporting a swollen eye.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Connor!\u201d she exclaimed as she rushed into the room.</p><p>He turned and she saw he was fine. In fact, he looked cool and calm, like he hadn\u2019t just taken on men larger than himself. Her only sign that he had in fact mixed it up with them was the curling and uncurling of his hand. The knuckles looked bruised and there was a smear of blood over the top of his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked anxiously as she reached for his hand.</p><p>He cracked a smile. \u201cI think your boyfriends fared the worst.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cThey aren\u2019t my boyfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about them anymore. I told them if they had anything to say to you at all, to contact your label and they\u2019d provide the name of your new manager whenever you get around to hiring one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI suppose that was cowardly of me but I didn\u2019t want to have a confrontation with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyric?\u201d</p><p>She turned to see Kane holding a piece of paper in his hand. His face was dark with a frown as he concentrated on the note. Then he turned and stared at Connor.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to go after those two and bring them back. This was hanging on her mirror.\u201d</p><p>He held out the note and Connor yanked it from him before Lyric could reach for it.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Connor muttered. \u201cI knew it was them. Those bastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnor, what does it say?\u201d</p><p>He held it out to her. She took it and glanced down at the colored cutout letters in varying fonts and sizes.</p><p>You won\u2019t be safe.</p><p>Her brows came together and unease skittered down her spine.</p><p>\u201cRun them down,\u201d Connor ordered Kane. \u201cDetain them and I\u2019ll call the cops. We\u2019ll turn the matter over to them. Our priority is Lyric\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><p>Kane nodded, then motioned to his men. They disappeared from the room a few moments later, leaving Connor and Lyric alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to dress. Your people should be here any moment now to help you get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d she said, reaching for his arm. \u201cI mean, it\u2019ll be boring. They\u2019ll do my hair and makeup and arrange my clothing, but it won\u2019t take long. There aren\u2019t any wardrobe changes for tonight\u2019s show. It\u2019s really like a miniconcert. Just eight songs total.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded at the door, interrupting them. \u201cI\u2019ll get that,\u201d he said as he turned to open it.</p><p>Moments later, the room was filled with people. Chatter rose. Lyric was poked, prodded and made up until she barely recognized the woman staring back at her. For several days she\u2019d lived a normal existence. No makeup. No outrageous clothes. Would Connor be repelled by the role Lyric played?</p><p>She glanced into the mirror to see him leaning against the back of the couch, hands shoved into his pockets as he watched her stylist put the finishing touches on her makeup.</p><p>Lyric couldn\u2019t make out the expression on his face. She had no idea what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou look great, Lyric,\u201d the stylist said with a bright smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Stacy. You did a great job.\u201d</p><p>Another knock sounded and Kane stuck his head in. \u201cFive minutes, Lyric. They need you outside.\u201d</p><p>Lyric rose, smoothed her tight jeans down her body and checked her appearance. It was a good costume choice for the rodeo. Though she didn\u2019t sing country music, her outfit would appeal to the more conservative types, and what was the saying? When in Rome?</p><p>She pulled on her boots, slapped the sassy straw cowboy hat over her hair and grinned at Connor. \u201cShowtime.\u201d</p><p>Connor saw the light reenter Lyric\u2019s eyes. Her confidence was back in spades and he was so relieved he nearly keeled over. She strutted into the hallway where he and Kane\u2019s men surrounded her. Kane led the way and they stopped at a black Ford jacked-up pickup that bore the performers to the stage in the middle of the dirt-packed rodeo arena.</p><p>The lights were dimmed and the crowd buzzed with excitement.</p><p>Connor helped Lyric inside, then crawled in behind her. Kane\u2019s men started ahead of the truck, even though the arena had security positioned at intervals around the stage.</p><p>Kane\u2019s men positioned themselves between the area where the fans who had chute seats were allowed from the stands close to the stage and the stage itself.</p><p>It seemed the entire stadium was electrically charged and waiting for Lyric to arrive.</p><p>With a roar, the truck lurched forward and drove toward the stage just as it lit up and the stadium came alive with laser lights. The huge LCD screen that wrapped the back of the stage flashed Lyric\u2019s sassy face and smile. The crowd went wild as she stepped from the truck and ran up the ramp to the stage.</p><p>Lyric yelled a greeting to the Houston fans and immediately launched into one of her upbeat songs.</p><p>The stands thumped and rocked along with her. Cameras flashed a repeating staccato of light, peppered throughout the thousands of people gathered for the rodeo.</p><p>Connor gained a new appreciation of what it took to get out and perform the way she did. She threw herself into it. She held nothing back. It was loud. It was raucous, and the fans loved every second of it.</p><p>She was sassy, cute, seductive and endearing. Her fans loved her and she clearly loved them.</p><p>At one point during the show, a mechanical bull rose from underneath the stage through an opening in the floor and Lyric climbed on and proceeded to ride like a champ. She waved and rotated and threw her hat into the crowd of fans assembled near the stage.</p><p>The bull sped up and she was tossed several feet into the air. His heart pumped into his throat and he was about to leap onto the stage to see about her when she popped up, laughing uproariously.</p><p>Then she slowed things down and sang the ballad that Connor had liked so much. \u201cGoing Home.\u201d The crowd sang and swayed with her, and when she finished, the lights dimmed for a moment and then blazed back on as she led into her last song choice of the evening.</p><p>The show had lasted only a little more than an hour, but sweat gleamed on her face. Her hair was damp and her shirt clung to her like a second skin.</p><p>But she wore a smile and waved enthusiastically as she headed down the ramp toward the truck. Connor and Kane met her at the bottom, ushered her into the back, and she stood, holding on to the roll bars as they drove across the dirt. They circled once while she waved to the cheering crowd and then they disappeared behind the gate to the backstage area once more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as they stopped, Connor hopped off and then reached up to lift Lyric down. She was buzzing with energy. Her muscles jumped and jittered and she beamed from ear to ear.</p><p>He took her hand in his and led her back to her dressing room. He was gratified to see that food and drink were waiting for her. A few people with security passes milled about. Lyric ignored them, latched on to a bottle of water and chugged it down without taking a breath. She tossed the plastic and then reached for another as she slumped onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cI have it on good authority you\u2019re going to be having company in a very few minutes,\u201d Connor said dryly. \u201cYou want to shower and change and I\u2019ll hold them off for you?\u201d</p><p>She sent him a puzzled look.</p> <p>\u201cThe girls. They have passes with their tickets. I thought you knew.\u201d</p><p>Lyric\u2019s face lit up. \u201cOh that\u2019s great. I asked Phillip to make sure they were taken care of but I wasn\u2019t sure what arrangements he\u2019d made for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blue-haired brigade will descend.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cYou make us sound like a horde of little old ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t my idea to dye your hair blue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, let me shower and get into some nonsweaty clothes. You can let them in. They can wait in here so they won\u2019t be pushed and shoved around by the crew outside.\u201d</p><p>Connor nodded and checked his watch. He needed to call and get a report from the police on whether charges would be pressed against Frick and Frack.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>As soon as the hot water hit Lyric, she wilted like a flower in a hundred-degree weather. All the adrenaline left her and she sagged against the wall as water beat down over her. All those sleepless nights were catching up and all she really wanted to do was go to sleep for about a week.</p><p>It took considerable effort but she washed her hair and rinsed off and then stepped out to dry. She combed through her hair but left it wet and then pulled on jeans and a T-shirt. It was nice not have to be meeting with regular fans. She could relax, kick back with the girls and not have to worry about a fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>And Lord, but she was starving.</p> <p>She trudged back into the dressing room to see Faith, Serena, Julie and Angelina sprawled on the couches while their guys stood to the side talking to Connor.</p><p>It was evident Connor had been watching for her, though, and it sent a giddy little thrill coursing through her veins. He looked up, and when he saw her, he broke from the group of men and came directly to her.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYeah. It was a good show.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in to kiss her, shocking her into silence. Everyone was watching them but he didn\u2019t seem to give a shit.</p><p>\u201cYou were fantastic. Now come sit down and rest. I\u2019ll get you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>A warm buzz, not unlike an alcohol-induced haze settled over her as she went over to the couch. She was smiling. Not just smiling but smiling ridiculously, and it had nothing to do with the show.</p><p>\u201cYou were awesome, Lyric!\u201d Faith exclaimed when Lyric plopped onto the couch next to her.</p> <p>\u201cTerrific show,\u201d Serena said in agreement. \u201cYou looked kick-ass out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, guys. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Angelina shifted position and Micah came to stand behind her. He slid his hand over her shoulder and offered a gentle squeeze. He leaned down and whispered something in her ear, and Angelina smiled and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cVery well done, Lyric,\u201d Damon Roche said as the guys gathered around the girls. \u201cI think Serena mentioned that we\u2019d caught one of your shows in Vegas. We enjoyed it and tonight very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chute seats were awesome,\u201d Julie said with a grin. \u201cAll those cowboys so close I could almost touch them.\u201d</p><p>Nathan scowled. \u201cI swear I can\u2019t take you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you all so much,\u201d Lyric said sincerely. \u201cIt was a fun show. I admit I had reservations about bringing my act here. Wasn\u2019t sure it would be appreciated given the venue.\u201d</p><p>Gray settled on the other side of Faith and shot Lyric a sly grin. \u201cI think you may have converted Mr. Tight Ass, who only listens to country music.\u201d</p><p>Lyric\u2019s eyes widened innocently. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Connor snorted as he set a plate of food on the coffee table in front of Lyric. \u201cI admit to a few musical prejudices.\u201d He glanced up at Lyric. \u201cEat,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need any encouragement. She sat forward and began to eat the yummy assortment of sandwiches and finger foods.</p><p>\u201cWe all need a picture together,\u201d Julie said. \u201cThe Smurfettes and all, you know.\u201d</p><p>The men groaned.</p><p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s just the tips,\u201d Damon said with a grin. \u201cThey can be trimmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not touching my hair!\u201d Serena gasped. \u201cI think we look awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no denying you ladies look fantastic,\u201d Micah said with an easy smile. \u201cI was worried we\u2019d need some of Lyric\u2019s security detail just to escort you girls back here. There were a lot of good ole boys sizing up our muscle.\u201d</p><p>Angelina laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit, but we love you for it.\u201d</p><p>Lyric leaned back with her plate and sighed. A few weeks ago, she would have never guessed that she\u2019d meet such great people or make actual friends. Real friends. People who didn\u2019t want anything from her. Who liked the real Lyric.</p><p>Now that her show was over, she had a few days to do nothing and then she\u2019d have to move on. Things to do. Albums to record. More concerts. For the first time she felt regret over her nomadic existence and the fact she didn\u2019t have a home base.</p><p>How great it would be to get to come home after days on the road and have friends like this group where she could relax and not worry about what face she was presenting to the world.</p><p>The yearning was so keen that it made her chest ache.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break this up, but Lyric\u2019s tired and I really need to get her home so she can rest,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>She blinked in surprise and realized she\u2019d zoned out on the couch while conversation went on around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look exhausted,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cOf course you need to go rest,\u201d Serena said as she stood gracefully from the couch. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how you\u2019re holding your head up after such an energetic show. We\u2019ll see you again before you leave Houston.\u201d</p><p>Lyric managed to get up and hug all the girls. \u201cThank you all so much for coming. It really meant a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the great seats!\u201d Faith exclaimed. \u201cEven the guys had fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like we didn\u2019t trust you out on your own again,\u201d Gray muttered.</p><p>The women rolled their eyes.</p><p>Angelina smirked. \u201cThink of how boring your lives would be without us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God, did you say a mouthful,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI can safely say that\u2019s one word that will never apply to our lives ever again.\u201d</p><p>Julie wrapped her arms around the big guy and grinned cheekily up at him. \u201cAdmit it. You led pitiful existences before we swooped in and saved you.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his mouth to kiss her, smiling all the while. \u201cI don\u2019t dispute that either, honey.\u201d</p><p>Lyric walked them all to the door as the men herded the women, and then she was left alone with Connor and Kane and her security detail.</p><p>She closed the door and turned. \u201cAny word on R.J. and Trent?\u201d</p><p>Connor shook his head. \u201cI have a call into the lieutenant handling their questioning. He\u2019s supposed to call me when he knows something.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cCall me na\u00efve but I just can\u2019t imagine them doing this. What could they possibly have to gain? It doesn\u2019t even make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m inclined to agree with you,\u201d Kane said. \u201cBut the evidence does support their involvement. We\u2019ll let the police do their job and see what they come up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe important part is that you don\u2019t have to worry about them anymore,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t miss his face darkening at the mention of them. He looked . . . jealous. Her lips twitched but she didn\u2019t smile. Maybe later she\u2019d tell him that she hadn\u2019t slept with either man for the last several shows. For now, she liked the idea that he was possessive of her.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Connor asked. \u201cYou really do need to get some rest. You\u2019re going to fall over soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go. I could use a cupcake and maybe a cup of hot chocolate. An evening in front of the fire sounds really nice right now.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his side and they walked out to the waiting car.</p><p>Lyric lay against Connor on the couch, her feet stretched to the end, watching the flickering flames from the hearth while Connor absently ran his fingers through her hair.</p><p>An empty cupcake wrapper lay on the coffee table beside the half-finished cup of hot chocolate. She was warm, sated and drifting closer and closer to the veil of sleep.</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d she murmured sleepily.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer but pressed a kiss to her hair in response.</p><p>\u201cIf I fall asleep, will you carry me up to bed again?\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she awaited his response.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be asleep for me to carry you up to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She snuggled deeper into his chest and rubbed her cheek against the solid wall of muscle. \u201cI kind of like you carrying me around. Makes me feel small and dainty.\u201d</p><p>Connor snorted. \u201cYou are small and dainty. You don\u2019t even come to my chin. I could probably stick you in my pocket and carry you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>He tipped her chin up so she looked at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI mean now that the show is over. There never was a real threat to me. Whatever reason R.J. and Trent had for leaving those notes, I don\u2019t believe for a minute they were going to hurt me. So that\u2019s resolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I remember correctly, the point of this whole venture was for you to do your show, take some down time and lay low. So I guess the answer to your question is, you can do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cLyric, if there\u2019s something you want to say, say it. I\u2019m not a mind reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wondered if you\u2019d want to do stuff with me. I mean just us. Not job related.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed in the low light. His thumb ran over her jaw and then to her lips, rubbing softly over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like nothing more than to spend some time with you.\u201d</p><p>He followed his hand with his mouth, turning her face up to meet his lips. Warm and melting, his heat invaded her, moving sluggishly through her veins like a narcotic.</p><p>He was dangerous to her. He did things to her heart and mind she couldn\u2019t explain. He made her want things she\u2019d always been afraid of. But now she wanted to try. She wanted a normal relationship, but how was such a thing ever possible for her?</p><p>\u201cIn fact, what I\u2019d really like to do right now is take you upstairs and make love to you and for you to sleep in my arms afterward.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. She\u2019d try. God, for him she\u2019d try.</p><p>He pushed himself from the couch and then reached down to curl her into his arms. He lifted her effortlessly from the couch and carried her up the stairs to her bedroom.</p><p>She curled her arms around his neck and tucked her head under his chin. If she could stop time, she\u2019d live in this moment forever. The entire past week had been nothing short of . . . life changing. It sounded corny and melodramatic, but it was absolutely true.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d finally found purpose. Or maybe she was finally growing and stretching beyond the past. She\u2019d simply existed for so long but now she wanted to live. She wanted to grab on and enjoy every moment and take nothing for granted.</p><p>He laid her gently on the bed and tonight she didn\u2019t play coy. She wanted him. Wanted him skin to skin, his body on hers. She got up on her knees and circled his neck, pulling him into her kiss.</p><p>He tasted like chocolate and he smelled of wood and smoke from the fire. It was a heady, intoxicating blend that she savored.</p><p>Her hands drifted over his shoulders and then to his chest, rubbing and caressing his tight body. Lean and hard and so damn delicious.</p><p>\u201cTake your shirt off,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cTake it all off. Right there while I\u2019m watching, and then come back to me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze never leaving hers, he shucked his shirt and pants, and his underwear quickly followed. She sucked in all her breath as he stood naked, a thing of beauty, all hers to do with what she wanted. Oh damn. It would take a week to do everything she wanted with him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop looking at me like that, it\u2019s going to be all over before it begins,\u201d he growled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat am I looking at you like?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m dessert and you\u2019re about to eat me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, but that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d she purred.</p><p>She leaned over and pressed her lips to his shoulder and then bared her teeth and nipped. He flinched and let out a low groan. She let her tongue slide sensuously up to the column of his neck and then she took another nip, right below his ear.</p> <p>His big body shuddered and his hands curled into tight fists at his side.</p><p>She leaned back and placed her palms to his chest and ran her fingers through the light smattering of hair at the hollow, then followed the line down to his belly and lower to the crisp, light brown hairs at his groin.</p><p>His cock stiffened and jutted upward, directly into her hands. She wrapped her fingers around his length and traced his erection downward until she cupped his sac in one hand and fondled while she stroked up and down with her other hand.</p><p>\u201cMay I say you have very impressive equipment, Connor Malone.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound of frustration and leaned closer to her.</p> <p>\u201cMore impressive that you know precisely what to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>She blinked up at him with pretended dismay. \u201cI find I have no idea what to do with such a wealth of manhood. Do you have any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet down on your knees and wrap that pretty mouth around it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm, kneeling has such a submissive overtone, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, there is nothing submissive about you. Hell, I don\u2019t care if you stand on your head. I just want to get inside that sweet, lush mouth and drown.\u201d</p> <p>She grinned. \u201cWell, since you asked so prettily.\u201d</p><p>She quickly undressed and then lay down on the bed, positioning herself so that her head hung over the edge, directly in line with his cock.</p><p>She stared up at him and then reached to caress his length. \u201cFuck me, Connor. Just like that. Fuck me hard.\u201d</p><p>His hands trembled on her face. His fingers stroked over her mouth and her cheekbones and then one hand left her to grasp his cock and guide it toward her waiting mouth.</p><p>\u201cOpen up, baby. Take me. Take all of me.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips and then parted them just as the broad head of his penis bumped against her mouth. Her tongue flicked over the crown and he flinched and then pushed in, sliding over her tongue.</p><p>His taste burst through her senses. Musky and exotic. Warm and spicy with a hint of soap. He slid deeper, checking himself at intervals, but when she offered no protest he sank to the back of her throat.</p><p>His balls brushed across her nose and then pressed inward as he strained forward. His hands tightened on the sides of her head and then he began thrusting back and forth.</p> <p>He delved his fingers into her hair, separating and brushing through the strands. His movements were slow and measured. He never overwhelmed her. He seemed to know just how far to push and when to pull back.</p><p>She wanted to give him something back. She wanted to give him all the pleasure he\u2019d given to her.</p><p>She reached behind and slid her hands over his hips to his taut buttocks. They flexed and rippled with each thrust, hard beneath her touch. She dug her fingers into his flesh and pulled him to her even as she swallowed him deeper.</p><p>Connor moved his hands from her face and then leaned over her to kiss her belly. She shivered and danced beneath his mouth and then his hands glided down her hips to part her legs.</p><p>He pulled them back until they were double and her pussy was exposed to his touch. His hips continued to pump against her mouth as his fingers dipped between her folds to the damp, sensitive flesh underneath.</p><p>She moaned around his cock and twisted restlessly as his fingers slipped inside her, stroking gently as his thumb toyed with her clit.</p><p>Then he withdrew and pulled back and knelt behind her. Gently he stroked his hands through her hair and closed his mouth over hers, smooching softly, her mouth, her cheeks, her eyes and then her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI want inside you, Lyric,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love your mouth, but I want you in my arms, your body wrapped around mine while I dive so deep that we lose ourselves in each other.\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked her lids and they burned as she blinked to keep the moisture at bay. Didn\u2019t he know she got lost in him every time he touched her?</p><p>He kissed her again, so exquisitely loving and gentle that she let out a sigh. He stroked her cheekbones and ran his fingers through her hair, and then he carefully raised her up so she was sitting on the bed.</p><p>She turned and got on her knees and wrapped her arms around his neck so she could kiss him. Everything she had, everything she was, she put into her kiss. She let go of all the things she\u2019d been holding back and so dear.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get enough of him. She ran her hands up and down his back, up to his hair and then down again, hugging him to her, pressing her body into his as she devoured his mouth.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and hauled her up, holding her so tight she could barely breathe. He maneuvered them around and then fell forward onto the bed, his body over hers, her back pressed to the mattress.</p><p>\u201cIf I live to be a hundred years old, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever get enough of you,\u201d he said between kisses. \u201cYou\u2019re an addiction I can\u2019t wait to feed. When you aren\u2019t with me, I can\u2019t wait to see you again. When you walk into the room, something inside me lights up. No one makes me feel like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Connor,\u201d she breathed. Whatever else she wanted to say got trapped behind the knot in her throat. Her nose swelled and stung as emotion clouded in and overwhelmed her.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease. I need you.\u201d</p><p>He went still above her and stared down as if he couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d said the words. There was triumph\u2014and relief\u2014blazing in his eyes. He looked gobsmacked. Joy exploded onto his face and the lines around his forehead eased. It was as if she\u2019d handed him the world, but in fact it was he who gave her so much. Every time. Himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give you the world if you asked,\u201d he said as he nudged her thighs apart.</p><p>He reached for a condom and rolled it on, his gaze never leaving her.</p><p>His cock slid between her legs and he rubbed his length along her folds, teasing her with his rigid heat. She opened for him, wet and wanting.</p><p>He paused at her entrance, the head tucked barely inside. He nudged, opening her a little more, and then he stopped.</p><p>Again he kissed her, his tongue tangling hotly with hers. Then he propped himself on his forearms and flexed his hips forward, sliding smoothly, rippling through her pussy like a dive through deep water.</p><p>He was bowed over her, his much larger body covering hers protectively. But he moved like a dream, with grace that belied his size. There wasn\u2019t a clumsy bone in his body. He made love like some people danced.</p><p>He nuzzled her neck and she turned, arching so that he had easier access. He tongued her ear and danced a circle around the shell until a thousand chill bumps skittered across her flesh.</p><p>Her heart was beating so hard that she could barely catch her breath. Her pulse raced and her body was alive as though a thousand ants crawled under skin. Every touch of his mouth, every thrust into her body, brought a shattering wave of pleasure so keen that it was nearly painful.</p><p>He withdrew until the head of his cock barely rimmed her entrance, and then he shoved back in, rippling through her slick flesh, sending aftershock upon aftershock coursing through her abdomen.</p><p>Her nipples tightened and dug into his chest like diamond points. Each movement abraded the ultrasensitive peaks until she was sure she was going to come apart.</p><p>\u201cI want you there,\u201d he murmured next to her ear. \u201cYou with me, Lyric. I won\u2019t come until you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she panted. \u201cI\u2019m almost there, Connor. I can\u2019t take it anymore. I feel like I\u2019m going to break into a million pieces. Please. Don\u2019t hold back. Harder.\u201d</p><p>Her words seemed to unleash the beast he held in tight rein. A sound of near pain, harsh in the silence, ripped from his throat. He gathered her tightly to him, wrapping his arms around her, pulling up as he plunged deep and hard.</p><p>His thighs slapped against hers and their bodies made wet sucking sounds as he pounded into her over and over.</p><p>The world went blurry around her. She closed her eyes, dizzy as she splintered and seemed to sail in a dozen different directions.</p><p>Her body was so tight, painfully so, that she cried out, begging for release.</p><p>And then she was catapulted up and over, free-falling at a hundred miles an hour. Her orgasm went on and on, never ending, wave upon wave crashing through her body.</p><p>He was coming too, his body commanding hers, owning her, possessing her. His.</p><p>She went limp beneath him, no longer able to even keep her legs or arms around him. He was in the last throes of his orgasm as he twitched and continued to thrust, easier and slower now as he slid in and out of her.</p><p>\u201cLyric,\u201d he whispered and gathered her close to him, holding her as he breathed harshly in her ear.</p><p>He turned, rolling them to their sides, and pressed her face into his neck as he stroked her hair, her back, over her buttocks and back up again.</p><p>\u201cI love you. God, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stuttered, took a painful leap in her chest that stole her breath. She went still as his words drifted over her ears, quiet and sincere.</p><p>Her throat tightened, so tight it sent a wave of panic through her body.</p><p>Afraid that she\u2019d completely lose her composure, she tried to push away from him and roll from the bed. But he caught her and held her, refusing to let her up.</p><p>It set off another wave of panic and she twisted and tried to sit up.</p><p>Connor rolled until she was underneath him once more. His body covered hers and he stared down at her with glittering eyes. She expected anger, but what she saw was grim determination.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Lyric, I just told you I loved you and you act like you can\u2019t get away fast enough.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and shook her head helplessly as tears filled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been patient. I\u2019ve let you run. But I\u2019m not letting you run any longer. I want to know what the hell is going on and why you bolt every time we have sex.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>Connor stared down at the panic in her eyes. Her entire body was tense and there was a wildness that reminded him of a spooked animal about to take flight.</p><p>He knew he was taking a huge risk by forcing the issue. He could lose her. She could shut down and freeze him out, but he had to try. Damn it, he had to try. He couldn\u2019t just give up and let her walk away. Not when this was the most important moment of his entire life.</p><p>\u201cStay with me, Lyric,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cStay with me and explain why me telling you I love you has you in such a panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s not real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean anything? Do you think I said that to get into your pants? Do you think I go around telling every woman I\u2019ve slept with that I love her? I\u2019ve got news for you, baby. I\u2019ve already been in as deep inside you as a man can get. I didn\u2019t need the words to make love to you. I didn\u2019t have to say them now. But goddamn it, I love you. That\u2019s real. It doesn\u2019t get any more real.\u201d</p><p>An endless stream of tears leaked from her eyes and rolled down her cheeks. His chest ached so bad he wanted to cry with her. Whatever had hurt her, whatever had destroyed her faith in love, was killing him as well.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cI\u2019m begging you not to walk away from this. I think you feel something for me too. Am I wrong? Did I get you all wrong?\u201d</p><p>Slowly she shook her head as more silver trails slid from her eyes.</p><p>A tiny twinge of relief loosened the knot in his throat. It was an admission. A reluctant admission, but at least she hadn\u2019t denied feeling something for him. He could work with that.</p><p>He shifted his weight to the side so he could discard the condom, and he hoped she wouldn\u2019t use the opportunity to bolt. But she lay there on her back, staring up at the ceiling as tears etched a crooked path on her face.</p><p>She looked tired. Fragile. And scared.</p><p>He reached a tentative hand to brush away the moisture on her cheek. \u201cWill you talk to me? Do you trust me enough to tell me what\u2019s hurt you so badly?\u201d</p><p>For a long moment she lay there, unmoving, quiet, as if gathering herself. To run? Or to confide in him? He couldn\u2019t say with any authority which of the two she was leaning toward. Maybe she didn\u2019t know herself.</p><p>When she finally did stir, he tensed, and then she rolled slightly until she faced him with haunted eyes. He wanted to do a fist pump. She\u2019d made her decision and she was still with him. Still next to him. But he remained still, waiting for the revelation that was buried deep.</p><p>\u201cMy real name is Carly Winters. And you were right. I was born and raised in the South. Covington County, Mississippi.\u201d</p><p>She waited a moment as if grappling with whether to go on. He willed himself not to stir, not to react. He didn\u2019t want to do anything to change her mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy father\u2014my real father\u2014left my mother when I was a baby. For a long time it was just me and her. We were dirt-poor but I was happy. She loved me and did her best. I adored her. She encouraged me to sing. In the evenings, I\u2019d sing to her while she did dishes. She said she never got tired of hearing her baby\u2019s voice. She always swore I\u2019d be a star.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201cWhen I was nine, she met Danny Higgins. At first it was nice. She was so happy. So alive. I hadn\u2019t realized how hard it had been on her until then. Suddenly she had help. She wasn\u2019t alone. We moved in with him after they got married. He insisted my mother didn\u2019t work. She\u2019d worked two jobs until then. She worked in a local factory during the week and she waitressed in a caf\u00e9 on the weekends.</p><p>\u201cI can remember thinking that it was the start of a great new life for us. Suddenly we didn\u2019t have to worry about where our next meal would come from. She no longer had to bring home leftovers from the caf\u00e9, and for the first time ever, she bought me new clothes from the rack in a store instead of getting them from Goodwill or neighbors who gave us their kids\u2019 castoffs.</p><p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t last,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cDanny had a quick temper. It got even nastier when he\u2019d drink. It was the whole clich\u00e9, stereotypical abusive husband. He\u2019d drink. Hit my mom. Get sober. Apologize. I still think to this day she only stayed because I had a better life. Or at least she thought I did.\u201d</p> <p>Dread curled in Connor\u2019s stomach. He had a very good idea of where this was headed and it made him ill.</p><p>\u201cDanny lost his well-paying job and he yelled at my mom that it was time for her to start carrying her weight. She went back to work at the factory. Waitressed on weekends. It seemed all she did was work. She\u2019d come home tired and have to contend with Danny\u2019s nasty moods. I did everything I could to make things easier for her. I cooked. I cleaned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Connor muttered. \u201cYou were only a baby yourself.\u201d</p><p>Lyric went on as if he hadn\u2019t spoken. Her eyes were glassy and had a distant look, as if she were unaware that he was even here anymore. She was lost in her past. Reliving each and every moment.</p><p>\u201cDanny started paying a lot more attention to me. Got all lovey and affectionate. Wanted me to sit on his lap. Freaked me out but I was afraid of him. I\u2019m sure you know where this is going. The whole thing could come straight out of some made-for-TV movie. Evil stepfather. Messing around with the stepdaughter.\u201d</p> <p>Connor had to bite his lip to call back the savage curse that threatened to boil out. She was so casual. So flip. As if because it happened to so many, it didn\u2019t matter that it had happened to her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d come into my bedroom at night while my mom was working, and he\u2019d rape me. And the entire time he\u2019d whisper how much he loved me and how beautiful I was and what a good girl I was.\u201d</p><p>Connor closed his eyes against the sting of tears. God. No wonder she hated to hear those words. Especially during sex.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re wondering why I didn\u2019t tell my mom, I did. It took me a while to work up the courage. I waited until he had gone out and then I told her and I begged her for us to leave before he got back. She was devastated. I\u2019d never seen her cry. Not through us being poor and hungry. Not when he hit her. She never cried until I told her what he\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>Unable to keep from touching her and offering comfort, Connor stroked his hand over her cheek, smoothing away the tears that still crept over her cheekbone. He let his fingers trail into her hair and then he rubbed up and down her arm.</p><p>To his surprise, she scooted closer, as if seeking the comfort of his body. She curled into his arm and laid her head against his shoulder. Maybe she could no longer face him and it was easier to let loose the poison of her past when they weren\u2019t staring eye to eye.</p> <p>He wrapped his arms around her and entwined their legs, wanting no separation between them. Never once would he want her to feel like she was somehow less for what was done to her. He\u2019d hold her forever if that was what it took.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d just go. But I underestimated my mom\u2019s anger. She confronted Danny when he got home. For the first time, she stood up to him. She told him she was going to have him arrested and that she hoped he rotted in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Lyric shook her head. \u201cNo. It was the wrong thing to do. We should have just gone. Left and never looked back. She wanted justice. I just wanted us safe. He flew into a rage. I think he forgot I was even there. I hid in the cabinet under the sink while he beat her to death.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound like a wounded animal. The moan tore from her throat and her fingers dug into his skin. \u201cThere was blood. So much blood. I remember peering through the crack in the cabinet door, so terrified I could do nothing. I did nothing. I hid like a coward while my mother died. I let him kill her because I was afraid he\u2019d turn on me. Or worse, he\u2019d keep me and abuse me. So I sat there and listened to her screams.\u201d</p><p>Connor pressed his mouth to her hair as nausea rolled through his stomach. He trembled against her even as he held her so close it was a wonder she could breathe.</p><p>\u201cWorse than the screams and the sounds of him hitting my mother was the silence afterward. So silent you could have heard a whisper. I stayed under the sink for three days. When they finally found me, my mom had been dead for over seventy-two hours, and I hid there and never did anything to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet mother of God,\u201d Connor swore. \u201cLyric, you were just a child. A terrified little girl who\u2019d already been horribly abused by the son of a bitch. Do you think your mother would have wanted you to die with her? Do you think she wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to hide?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just know that I did nothing and I traded my life for hers. I could have run. I could have gone to a neighbor\u2019s. I could have done something,\u201d she finished with a sob. \u201cThose three days were the worst of my life. I was alone in that house while she lay dead just feet away. Even after I knew he was gone, I couldn\u2019t make myself leave my hiding place. I\u2019ve never liked being alone since. It terrifies me.\u201d</p><p>Connor gathered her close and turned her face up so he could kiss her forehead. He smoothed his hand over her hair and simply stroked as he willed some of the burning rage he felt on her behalf to calm.</p><p>\u201cMy testimony put him in prison for life. Because I was a minor and was so traumatized by the event, they sealed the records and I was born again, so to speak. New name. New life. No one knew of my past. Not even my string of foster parents. They only knew I had been sexually abused and my mother had died. I chose Lyric to honor my mother\u2019s vision of my future. I was determined to become a singer for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou became the best.\u201d</p><p>She let out a pitiful laugh that sounded more like a sob. \u201cNo, not the best. I\u2019ve lived my life afraid that someone would find out about my past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you have nothing to be ashamed of. You were a victim.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head adamantly. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to know. I\u2019ve never told anyone. Except you . . . I couldn\u2019t bear it to be splashed across all the papers and magazines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you give them so much else to talk about?\u201d</p><p>For a long moment she remained silent. \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know. That sounds like an excuse. I don\u2019t always like the things I do, and yet I still make stupid choices. It\u2019s sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy, I guess. I\u2019ve tried so hard to project this give-a-shit attitude. Maybe I\u2019m preparing for the day when someone does find out about my past. I don\u2019t want anyone to ever see me that vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>Did she have any idea how very vulnerable she sounded right now? Something inside him came loose and the ache in his chest intensified. He hurt for the child who\u2019d suffered so much. He hurt for the young woman who still hurt, for whom those horrible days were relived on a daily basis.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to judge me. If I thought so badly of myself, how much worse would others feel about what I\u2019d done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou survived a horrible experience. How is that bad?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, he once again tilted up her chin so she could see his eyes. \u201cLyric, I\u2019m not judging you. I don\u2019t think badly of you. I hurt for you. I\u2019m angry as hell at the son of a bitch who terrorized you and took your mother from you. But I love you. Your past doesn\u2019t change that. Love doesn\u2019t come with conditions. It just . . . is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one but my mother has ever loved me,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to react, Connor. I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll piss you off. Or maybe you\u2019ll get tired of my stupidity. I\u2019m worried I can\u2019t give you what you need. What you deserve.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and rubbed his cheek over her forehead. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me worry about what I can handle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you love me? You didn\u2019t even like me at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me to explain how or why people fall in love, you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree. I watched all my friends fall hard for the women in their lives. I secretly thought they were all morons. They completely lost their shit. I never understood it. Until now. Now I can see exactly what they were thinking and feeling. Because I\u2019ve completely lost my shit over you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly and buried her face in his neck. He could still feel the dampness on her cheeks and he cupped the back of her head, stroking and soothing away her grief.</p><p>\u201cI want to be right for you, Connor. I want it so bad I ache.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, compelled to keep touching her, to keep the link between them. \u201cYou are right for me, Lyric. Just as you are.\u201d</p><p>She shifted a bit and snuggled deeper into his body as if seeking refuge. He wanted to be that refuge. Her safe place where she was protected from the world.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019d like?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like for you to sleep with me. Just like this. You in my arms where I can hold you all night. And I\u2019d like to wake up in the morning and have you be the first thing I see.\u201d</p><p>She nodded sleepily. \u201cI think I\u2019d like that too.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and reached behind him to turn off the lamp. Then he turned back to her and settled her against him once more. When he was satisfied that she was snuggled as tight as possible into his arms, he laid his cheek on the top of her head and processed everything she\u2019d told him.</p><p>Lyric slipped into an exhausted sleep within moments of him turning off the light. But Connor stayed awake long into the night.</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>Connor awoke to the sound of his cell vibrating on the nightstand. He blew a strand of Lyric\u2019s hair from his mouth and smiled at the fact she was draped across him like a blanket.</p><p>Her body was soft and warm and her cheek was pressed to his chest. Her upper body was covering him entirely and one leg was slung over his.</p><p>He could wake this way every morning and die a happy man in sixty years or so.</p><p>The phone quieted and then immediately started again. Connor cursed under his breath and eased his arm over so he could reach the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cConnor Malone? This is Lieutenant Donnelly. We spoke yesterday regarding R. J. Miller and Trent Carnes.\u201d</p><p>Connor grimaced. It was awfully damn early in the morning to be calling with case updates. \u201cGive me a second,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He disentangled himself from Lyric, who woke and stared up at him with sleep-clouded eyes. He leaned down to kiss her. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Go back to sleep. I\u2019ll be right back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>He moved from the bed and walked across the room toward the bathroom so he wouldn\u2019t disturb her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have for me?\u201d he asked the lieutenant.</p><p>\u201cYour guys confessed. It was pretty pathetic really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were they trying to do?\u201d Connor demanded.</p><p>\u201cThey saw the writing on the wall. They weren\u2019t happy that Ms. Jones had started pulling away from them. Their words, not mine. They hatched this ridiculous plan to make it appear that there was a threat against her. Their hope was that they\u2019d provide support and protection, thus making themselves invaluable to Ms. Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a bunch of dipshits,\u201d Connor muttered. \u201cWhat will happen to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t hold them on much. The best option will be for Ms. Jones to take out a restraining order on them. We can arrest them for harassment, but they\u2019ll likely be out on bail in less than a day, and no way is the DA going to pursue this beyond probation and maybe a little community service. They\u2019ll plead out and be on their way before the ink is dry on the paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures. Thanks, Lieutenant. I appreciate your taking care of the matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot a problem. Let me know if there\u2019s anything else I can do to help.\u201d</p><p>Connor hung up and then noticed he had a missed call from his dad. He winced. It had been several days since he\u2019d talked to Pop, a fact that wouldn\u2019t make the old man very happy.</p><p>\u201cI hear there\u2019s some serious bodyguarding going on over there and that you\u2019ve taken a personal interest in a certain pop star\u2019s body,\u201d Pop rumbled as soon as he picked up the phone.</p><p>Connor shook his head. Trust gossip to have already reached his ears. \u201cShe\u2019s the one, Pop.\u201d</p> <p>He could practically hear his dad grinning through the phone.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned. That\u2019s great, son. You two got things worked out?\u201d</p><p>Connor frowned and looked back toward the bed where Lyric was curled into a ball, her arm thrown over his pillow. \u201cNot yet, but we\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood things shouldn\u2019t be easy. You\u2019ll work hard at it, and it\u2019ll be all the sweeter for it.\u201d</p><p>Connor shook his head. Pop was so full of shit. Good as gold, but he had something to say for every occasion.</p> <p>\u201cBring her home for Sunday dinner. She should see what she\u2019s getting into.\u201d</p><p>Connor laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to that eventually. Right now we have more important fish to fry.\u201d</p><p>Pop made a disgruntled sound. \u201cWhat\u2019s more important than my Sunday lasagna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith and Gray have spoiled you by catering to your neuroses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least they eat with me every weekend. Well, when they can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, sure you do. But you\u2019re single, and no single guy turns down free food. The test is when you have a beautiful woman at home as to whether you\u2019ll give your old man the time of day anymore.\u201d</p><p>Connor rolled his eyes. \u201cLike I\u2019ll ever get rid of you, old fart.\u201d</p><p>Pop\u2019s raspy chuckle filled Connor\u2019s ear. \u201cDamn straight. I plan for you and Faith to visit me in the old folks\u2019 home when I\u2019m old and toothless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already are old and toothless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make come over there and kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Connor laughed. \u201cOkay, Pop. Let me go. Take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Give my love to Lyric and tell her welcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>With a smile, Connor disconnected the call. He\u2019d love nothing more than to welcome Lyric to his family, but he wasn\u2019t going to get ahead of himself. Right now he was just happy Lyric hadn\u2019t run the other direction when he\u2019d expressed a desire for them to be together.</p> <p>With a look at the bed where Lyric was sleeping, he pulled on a robe and crept out of the bedroom and down to fill Kane in on the latest developments. Kane promised to do some investigating on his own. Connor intended to devote his time and energy solely to Lyric.</p><p>When he returned a few minutes later, he shed the robe and crawled back into bed with Lyric. She stirred and snuggled up close to him, breathing a soft sigh of contentment.</p><p>\u201cSleep well?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe best night\u2019s sleep I\u2019ve had in longer than I can remember,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cGood. You needed to catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was on the phone? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the lieutenant who handled R.J. and Trent\u2019s arrests. They confessed to leaving the notes.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted into a perplexed frown. \u201cBut why? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Connor related what the lieutenant had told him and she shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty pathetic, but what\u2019s even more pathetic is that I was involved with those clowns. That I trusted them.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her forehead. \u201cQuit beating yourself up. It\u2019s all in the past. You won\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d she said with a grin. Then she reached up to touch his face. \u201cWhat should we do today? We have hours yet until I have to be at the music store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you like or nothing at all. It\u2019s solely up to you,\u201d he said in a solemn voice. \u201cYou tell me what your pleasure is, and I\u2019ll make sure you get it.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his chest and pleasure melted through his body at the affectionate gesture.</p><p>\u201cIf I weren\u2019t here and your job wasn\u2019t to keep me safe, what would you be doing today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. I\u2019d probably eat at Cattleman\u2019s. Hang out with Micah, Nathan, and Gray. Nothing earth-shattering. Throw back a few beers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to do something ordinary.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cDefine ordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething everyday. Average. What someone who leads a perfectly normal life would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou up for a jog?\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself up and looked at him in horror. \u201cYou mean like exercising. Running?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYeah. I like to keep in shape. I usually run in the mornings but I\u2019ve missed a few days lately. We could go for a run. Take a shower together. Go eat breakfast at a little caf\u00e9 I know of. Dad wants us to come for dinner tonight. He cooks lasagna every Sunday. It\u2019s a family tradition. Maybe we can swing by after your signing.\u201d</p><p>Shadows lurked in her eyes. Her gaze filled with uncertainty and she bit at her bottom lip. \u201cDo they know? I mean, I guess they know, but do they know\u2014know about us?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at the way she sputtered around the subject. \u201cYeah. They know. Or at least Pop does. And now that he knows for sure, he\u2019ll waste no time telling Faith, who\u2019ll waste no time telling the other girls, who will waste no time telling their husbands. I should start receiving phone calls giving me shit within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lightened and she smiled back at him. \u201cSounds like a veritable gossip train.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re close. I guess that\u2019s what friends do. Hard to keep anything from anyone in that group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said wistfully. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, they love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like them a lot too. I\u2019m so glad I met them. And you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d he said huskily as he leaned in to kiss her. \u201cNow, how \u2019bout that run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m dying,\u201d Lyric wheezed when they walked\u2014or, rather, she dragged\u2014back up the drive to the house.</p><p>\u201cYou did great,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cLet\u2019s hit the shower. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou\u2019ll eat like a pig and not gain an ounce. I\u2019ll look at a cupcake and swell up like a blowfish.\u201d</p><p>He jogged in place and then swatted her on the ass. She shot him a glare but followed him into the house and up the stairs.</p><p>They played in the shower and Lyric couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d laughed so much. She soaped him. He soaped her. They got fresh and frisky and groped each other shamelessly, and by the time they stumbled out to get towels, they were both breathing heavily.</p><p>He advanced on her menacingly, his cock rigid and standing straight up. She held up her hands to halt his advance. \u201cHey, none of that. You\u2019re starving, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019m starving. But not for food.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWhen are you ever not hungry for food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She clutched the ends of the towel around her but he pried her fingers away, letting the towel fall to the floor, leaving her naked and still damp in front of him.</p><p>Her nipples beaded and her belly clenched in anticipation as he reached for her.</p><p>\u201cThere better be a goddamn condom in here.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath, knowing that if they were going to actually be in a serious relationship, they\u2019d need to discuss things like sexual history, condoms, all the icky stuff that she was used to shoving under the table.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use one,\u201d she said in a quiet voice. \u201cI mean, if you didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her curiously for a moment and then picked her up so she sat on the edge of the counter, her legs wrapped around his waist. He kissed the corner of her mouth and then nibbled a path to her neck that had her arching and sighing in contentment.</p><p>\u201cHow about I go find that condom, and we\u2019ll have this discussion after I\u2019ve fucked you six ways to Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Arousal rose sharp, like a bite. She shivered under the intensity of his gaze. In response, she looped her arms around his neck and he hoisted her up until she straddled his midsection. Then he turned and carried her into the bedroom.</p><p>When he got to the bed, he tumbled forward on the mattress, taking her down underneath him. With one hand, he groped toward the nightstand and snagged one of the packets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d apologize about how quick this is going to be, but I wouldn\u2019t be sincere,\u201d he said as he rolled the condom on. \u201cI\u2019ve got to have you or I\u2019m going to explode.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed her hands over his muscled shoulders and then down his sides to grasp his hips. \u201cSometimes foreplay is overrated.\u201d</p><p>With a groan, he spread her thighs and then slid his thumb over her clit and below to her opening. Then he eased his fingers inside her and she smiled. Despite his urgency, he was still making sure she was ready for him.</p><p>She arched into his touch and sighed as fluttery sensations danced through her groin as he stroked through her dampness.</p><p>He pushed so her legs were splayed open and then he guided his cock to her entrance. But still he didn\u2019t thrust. He rubbed the head up and down, bathing it in her wetness, and then finally he plunged deep. In one long stroke he was all the way in, and the shock of his entry made her gasp. So hard and full. She was stretched tight around him, and already the buzz of an orgasm had begun.</p><p>What followed could hardly be called making love. There was no sense of sweet and gentle wooing. It was an animalistic fucking that had her begging and pleading. It was like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>Hard and furious, he stroked rapidly, his hips pumping against hers and the slap of his flesh against hers rising sharp in the air.</p><p>His entire body moved over hers, and his muscles strained tight underneath her fingertips. Suddenly he rolled, holding her tight against him, so that she was sprawled on top, her legs straddling him.</p><p>For a moment she lay there, her breaths coming harsh as she sought the strength to do what he wanted.</p><p>But all he did was reach down and hold her hips while he did the work, arching into her, thrusting upward, his hands holding her pinned tight against him.</p><p>Finally she managed to push herself up, her palms braced against his chest. The movement sent him deeper, and they both groaned as she repositioned herself, his cock tucked so deep and snug within her that she could barely breathe.</p><p>His hands left her hips and slid up her body to cup both breasts. He gently squeezed and ran his thumbs over the puckered crests. Each brush sent an electric bolt straight to her pussy that had her squirming.</p><p>\u201cRide me, Lyric,\u201d he said. \u201cRide me as hard as I rode you. Let me watch you come all undone. I want to watch your face when you come.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and threw back her head and began sliding up and down his cock. Her knees pressed into the mattress on either side of his hips as she undulated her body in a comfortable rhythm.</p><p>She felt like a wild thing. Free and beautiful. She glanced down at Connor through half-lidded eyes and saw that his gaze was fastened on her, his eyes burning with approval. Desire. Love.</p><p>It was completely her undoing. Her orgasm flashed like a streak of lightning in the summer air. Beautiful and electric. Her entire body trembled with the shock.</p><p>His hands closed around her waist, holding her, supporting her. He closed his eyes and his face creased as though he were experiencing agony. His entire body went rigid and she continued to move through her own orgasm, determined to bring him the ultimate pleasure.</p><p>She was still moving when he leaned up and gathered her in his arms. \u201cCome here, baby,\u201d he said softly as he pulled her back down to sprawl over him.</p><p>They lay there breathing hard, their chests colliding as they sought to pump more air into oxygen-starved lungs. He kissed the top of her head and smoothed a hand over her hair as she wilted like a wet noodle atop him.</p><p>Her breasts were smushed flat by his chest and her flesh was stuck to him like a second skin, but she lacked the strength or the desire to move. She fit him. He fit her.</p><p>He was sturdy and rock hard. Her refuge. Her oasis from everything in the real world.</p><p>She loved him too.</p><p>She closed her eyes, wondering why she couldn\u2019t simply give him the words he\u2019d given to her. Why were they so hard to say?</p><p>He continued to play with her hair, separating the strands and pulling his fingers through them as they lay there in the quiet. He seemed as content as she was for her to blanket him.</p><p>\u201cNow, was there something you wanted to talk about regarding condoms, past lovers or anything similar?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She raised her head. \u201cYou really think now is a good time to discuss it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s the best time. I didn\u2019t want to get into who you\u2019ve slept with before we had sex. Definite mood killer. But now I couldn\u2019t get it up again to save my life, so I\u2019d say the timing\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and slid to his side. He wrapped an arm around her and hugged her close until her head rested atop his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI was just going to say that we could not use condoms if you preferred not to. I know some guys don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>He danced his fingertips over her arms as he considered what she\u2019d said.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose there are guys who don\u2019t use them. I\u2019ve never been one of them. Sex is great but it doesn\u2019t seem worth the risk, especially in the beginning of a relationship, where you may not know a lot about your partner\u2019s past.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed as she measured how to bring up her past. \u201cI\u2019m no saint. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gathered that much. I was determined that Danny wouldn\u2019t control my sexuality for the rest of my life, but maybe I\u2019ve been fooling myself. It seems everything I do is a direct result of his impact, so in fact, maybe he still has far more control than I\u2019d ever admit to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t slept with anyone in a while,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI did sleep with R.J. and Trent. At the same time. I\u2019ve slept with others. Being alone\u2014truly intimate\u2014with a man always freaked me out. But I could do meaningless sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to justify yourself or explain yourself to me, Lyric,\u201d Connor said gently. \u201cI\u2019ve slept with my share of women. Not at the same time, mind you. I leave that sort of thing to my friends. What\u2019s past is past. It\u2019s the future I\u2019m more concerned about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. But I wanted you to know that I\u2019m on birth control and that I\u2019m safe. I mean, I always insisted on condoms. That doesn\u2019t make me miraculously safe, but I\u2019ve always been careful and I have regular checkups and tests. I even made R.J. and Trent both have thorough checkups before I\u2019d allow them in my bed.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her to him. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I\u2019ll be even happier if I\u2019m the only man in your bed from now on.\u201d</p><p>She stopped breathing for a moment as his words settled over her. He couldn\u2019t mean what she thought he meant. Or did he? It sounded so . . . permanent. Permanent was for women like Faith. Wholesome. Girl next door. Women like her screamed commitment and happily ever after. She was the kind of woman a man brought home to his family.</p><p>Oh God, Connor was bringing her home to his family today.</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Connor said casually. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go have checkups together? We\u2019ll get everything out in the open so there aren\u2019t any surprises. We\u2019ll find out together that we\u2019re perfectly healthy and able to start something new and lasting. Then we\u2019ll burn the box of condoms and have hot, sweaty sex and I\u2019ll get you all sticky and then you\u2019ll complain about the fact we aren\u2019t using condoms anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her body shook with laughter and she swatted playfully at his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re a nut. But yeah. That sounds great. Let\u2019s make an appointment.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his head and she turned to meet his kiss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be one of the many things I plan for us to be doing together from now on,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>\u201cHoly hell in a bucket,\u201d Connor muttered when they turned down the street where the music store was located. \u201cIs this normal?\u201d</p><p>Lyric surveyed the cordoned-off street, the throng of people outside the store, at least three police cars and a slew of people carrying cameras. With a puzzled look she shook her head. \u201cNo. I mean, I draw a crowd, but it\u2019s never like this. Are you sure nothing else is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re it, babe. I\u2019m damn glad Kane went ahead of us to set up his team. This is going to be a fucking nightmare.\u201d</p><p>She clasped her hands nervously in her lap as they glided to a stop. They were immediately besieged by people shoving their way to the car, cameras flashing, microphones shoved forward. She blinked in bewilderment and Connor swore.</p><p>\u201cDrive,\u201d he barked at the driver. \u201cMake the block, circle. Do something. We\u2019ll have to come in a different way. No way I\u2019m letting her out in this.\u201d</p> <p>Connor snatched up his cell phone as the driver pulled away. \u201cKane, what the hell is going on out there? Where are you? I can\u2019t let Lyric out in that.\u201d</p><p>Lyric only half paid attention as she stared back at the mass of people.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll wait fifteen minutes, then circle around to the back. Be waiting and make damn sure the scene is secure. I don\u2019t like this, Kane. I don\u2019t like it at all.\u201d</p><p>Connor hung up and reached for Lyric\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby, okay? I\u2019ll cancel the damn thing before I let you go into an unsafe situation.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Connor. It\u2019s a part of the job.\u201d</p><p>He scowled but didn\u2019t comment further.</p><p>Several long minutes later, they traveled down the alley. Two police cars had blocked off the street and had secured an entryway for Lyric into the store.</p><p>\u201cWhen we stop I want you out and into the store, no delays. Don\u2019t stop for anything, okay?\u201d Connor said. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you the whole way.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as the car pulled to a stop. As he\u2019d directed, she bolted from the car, he right behind her. Kane was at the door holding it open for her as he spoke into a receiver close to his mouth.</p><p>Once inside the store, she breathed a sigh of relief until she remembered the horde of people out front waiting to come in. She hoped to hell the store was prepared for the onslaught. A tall, blond woman strode briskly toward Lyric, her hand outstretched. Lyric recognized her. Sort of. She just couldn\u2019t remember where she\u2019d seen her before.</p><p>\u201cMs. Jones. Leslie Burke from Cosmic Records. I\u2019ll be here to make sure things go smoothly for you today. I\u2019ve already spoken with the store management and everything looks great. You\u2019ve got quite a crowd out front but we have plenty of security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working in cooperation with the police officers here,\u201d Kane interjected. \u201cWe\u2019re only allowing so many in the store at one time and the press won\u2019t be allowed in at any time. It\u2019s solely your choice whether you want to go out and address them or answer questions, but only fans will be allowed inside for the meet and greet.\u201d</p><p>Lyric pondered for a moment and then glanced at Leslie whose expression said she was willing to let Lyric make the call. \u201cThat sounds reasonable. Maybe it will keep the reporters from doing anything stupid if you tell them I\u2019ll make a brief appearance after I\u2019ve met with fans.\u201d</p><p>Kane nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll let them know.\u201d</p><p>Connor brushed a kiss across her temple. \u201cI\u2019ll be standing right beside you. If at any time you need me or you want to stop, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. He really was too sweet. She was touched by his caring and concern. It sent a pang of longing through her. How wonderful it would be to have him with her all the time.</p><p>Kane held up a hand from the door to signal five minutes. Since many of the fans would want photos, a tall signing table had been arranged that allowed Lyric to stand so she wouldn\u2019t have to continually sit and get up.</p><p>Leslie did a quick check of the promotional material, spoke quickly to two of the store employees and then moved to stand a few feet away from Lyric while they waited for the signing to start.</p><p>A few minutes later, the doors opened and people began to surge inside. Here at least, Lyric was in her element. She fielded questions. Took photos. Signed shirts, CDs, iPods, pants and even a few body parts. Although you could have broken a stone on Connor\u2019s face when one particularly beefed-up guy stripped off his shirt and asked Lyric to sign low\u2014very low\u2014on his abdomen.</p><p>She complied laughingly and grinned when Connor glared holes in his back.</p><p>After an hour, Connor forced water into her hand and waited as she drained it. For a second she leaned against his side, grateful to have a moment\u2019s rest.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She greeted the next fan in line and began all over again. After three hours, she was dead exhausted as the last of the line filtered through.</p><p>Kane walked over and stood until the last person finished with Lyric, and then he leaned over. \u201cWe\u2019re shutting down the line. The signing is officially done. Police are herding people away. The reporters are still out front. Want to just slip out the back?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, they kept their part of the bargain. I need to keep mine or next time they might not be willing to wait. I can\u2019t imagine what I\u2019ve done lately to merit such attention from the press, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s juicy whatever it is. Maybe they\u2019re still buzzing over my supposed arrest.\u201d</p><p>Connor scowled. \u201cThey can kiss my ass.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and slipped her hand through his. \u201cOkay, give me fifteen and I\u2019ll be done.\u201d</p><p>Leslie caught Lyric\u2019s eye and then nodded toward the entrance. She walked ahead of Lyric so that she could make a brief statement before Lyric spoke.</p><p>Kane and Connor flanked her protectively as she stepped to the door. Kane paused when he saw the police barricade and the fact that there were several police officers doing a good job of keeping the crowd under control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back and get the car,\u201d Kane said as he turned to Lyric. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in back. I want to make sure you have a clear avenue to the vehicle from the back entrance.\u201d</p><p>She touched his arm. \u201cThanks, Kane. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI know you do. Good luck. Fifteen minutes. Don\u2019t go over.\u201d</p><p>She turned back, took a deep breath and braced for the onslaught.</p><p>As soon as she stepped from the building, the frenzy began. Even Leslie looked bewildered. She tried valiantly to direct the media attention back to herself, but once they saw Lyric, they were having none of that. She was pushed aside as the reporters surged past the barricades and surrounded Lyric.</p><p>At first she had no idea what was being shouted at her. She flinched at the immediate barrage of shouted questions, and as she tentatively moved forward, her hand up to try to calm the volley, some of the questions sank in.</p><p>\u201cLyric, is it true your real name is Carly Winters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Jones! Tell us about your mother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyric, over here! Can you tell us about your stepfather, Danny Higgins?\u201d</p><p>She swayed and her knees buckled. Shock rolled through her body, leaving her so shaken she thought she\u2019d faint. Connor swore violently and grabbed at her arm.</p><p>\u201cLyric, can you confirm your stepfather is in prison for your mother\u2019s murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give us a statement? Is it true you had a sexual relationship with your stepfather and that your mother tried to kill you?\u201d</p><p>Lyric gasped and felt the world tilt around her. She stared at Connor in utter disbelief. She stared at the man she\u2019d trusted with everything she was, her past, her present, things she\u2019d never shared with another person. Hurt tore through her with crippling intensity. As the reporters hurled all the details of her past, like little poison darts, she stood, her gaze locked onto Connor as her world crumbled around her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, goddamn it!\u201d Connor bit out. He grasped her arm to pull her back into the building.</p><p>She yanked her arm from Connor\u2019s grasp and turned on him as the world went to hell around them. They were jostled and pushed. She nearly went down under the onslaught. One of the police officers shoved her toward the building.</p><p>Pain splintered through her head. She realized one of the cameras hit her in the cheek. An elbow caught her temple and then something hard hit her nose.</p><p>She tasted the bitter metallic of blood, but she was numb. From head to toe. She stumbled forward as two officers and Connor lifted and carried her into the music store.</p><p>As soon as she broke the entrance, she yanked away from all of them. Connor stood, his eyes glittering, and she flew at him, her fists clenched. She hit him but he didn\u2019t so much as flinch.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d she cried hoarsely. She tried to scream it but she honestly couldn\u2019t speak past the knot in her throat. \u201cMy God, did you roll immediately out of bed with me after I bared my soul? Was that the phone call this morning? Did you waste any time at all before selling me out?\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down her cheeks. Each word was agony. Oh God, her chest was going to explode.</p><p>Nothing, nothing in her life had ever hurt as much as his betrayal. Not Danny Higgins. Not the death of her mother. Never before had she trusted a living soul with any part of herself. Not until now. Not until Connor.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Lyric!\u201d he exploded. \u201cYou can\u2019t think I did this. What the fuck?\u201d</p><p>He advanced toward her and she stumbled back so fast to get away from him that she tripped over a chair and went down hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet him away from me!\u201d she spit out. \u201cOh God, get him away.\u201d</p><p>The last ended in a moan and she huddled into a ball, so devastated, so numb from shock, that she wanted to die. The entire world knew. They knew everything. No more secrets. No more lies. Her shame, her pain, was laid bare for the world to see.</p><p>There was a scuffle. Connor\u2019s curses split the air. She scrambled to her feet and then lunged for the back entrance. Connor shouted at her but she ran as hard and as fast as she could. Away from him. Away from her past. Away from the awful reality that awaited her.</p><p>She ran straight into Kane. He caught her and she swung violently, connecting with his jaw.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he demanded. \u201cLyric, what the hell?\u201d</p><p>She twisted away, intent only on running as far and as fast as she could. Kane hit her with a flying tackle and rolled them to the ground. He wrapped both arms around her and held her immobile as she kicked and raged against him.</p><p>When she realized her efforts were futile, she collapsed against him, sobbing great, gasping sobs.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he said. \u201cLyric, what the hell is going on? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me out of here,\u201d she choked out. \u201cPlease, Kane. Just take me away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere the hell is Connor?\u201d</p><p>She went rigid. \u201cHe sold me out. Please, please, Kane.\u201d</p><p>The last of her fight left her and she simply shattered. Her chest hurt so badly she wondered if something wasn\u2019t broken. She felt broken. So damaged that she\u2019d never recover.</p><p>She leaned her head on Kane\u2019s shoulder as sob after sob welled from her throat.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Kane murmured. He got to his feet and hauled her up into his arms, then made a run for the car. He shoved her inside, climbed in behind her and then ordered the driver to take off.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going, Lyric?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAway,\u201d she said brokenly. \u201cJust away from here. Somewhere safe.\u201d</p><p>He put a tentative hand on her arm as she lay huddled on the seat. \u201cWhat the hell happened back there, Lyric?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and closed her eyes as more tears slipped down her cheeks. How could she explain to him that she\u2019d just been destroyed by the only man she\u2019d ever trusted? The only person she\u2019d ever trusted?</p><p>She felt like the worst sort of fool. Why had he done it? Did he hate her so much? None of it made sense. Surely he didn\u2019t need the money. Phillip was likely paying him a fortune for his babysitting job. Had his supposed infatuation with her been some sort of twisted game?</p><p>Her throat was raw but she couldn\u2019t stop the sobs. Grief welled out of her heart. Grief for her mom. Grief for herself. Grief for everything she\u2019d believed of Connor and the dead hope for someone who loved and cherished her.</p><p>She was dimly aware of the car stopping and then the door opening.</p><p>\u201cLyric,\u201d Kane said softly. \u201cCan you make it out? We\u2019re at the house.\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment for his words to sink in. She stirred slowly and looked at him through dull eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone here,\u201d she said in a voice that cracked and was painful from the crying. \u201cDo you understand? No one.\u201d</p><p>Kane nodded shortly. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>She tried to sit up but found she lacked the strength. She felt dead on the inside. She was in complete and utter shutdown. Was this what it felt like when you finally broke from reality? Maybe it had been a long time coming for her. There was only so long you could live in denial.</p><p>Kane gently helped her from the car and wrapped an arm around her as he walked her toward the house. She trudged like an old woman, stumbling once when her feet dragged like lead.</p><p>Wordlessly, Kane led her up the stairs and into her bedroom. She halted as soon as they got through the doorway, and she went rigid.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d she burst out. \u201cI won\u2019t stay in here.\u201d She stared at the bed she and Connor had made love in. The same bed where she\u2019d told him all her secrets. Had shared the pain of her past. The bed where she\u2019d trusted him implicitly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Kane said softly. \u201cThere are other rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care where. Just not here.\u201d</p><p>He guided her toward one of the other bedrooms and she crawled onto the bed, curling into a ball and shutting herself off from him.</p><p>She felt him sit on the bed, but she kept her eyes squeezed shut as she turned further into herself where it didn\u2019t hurt quite so bad. The next thing she knew, a cool cloth was dabbed carefully at her face. The cut at her lips stung. The spot under her eye ached.</p><p>\u201cYou going to tell me what the hell happened back there?\u201d Kane asked in a quiet voice as he touched the cloth to her mouth again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know soon enough,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all over the news and the tabloids. You can thank Connor. He\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve ever told.\u201d</p><p>Kane swore. \u201cLyric, I don\u2019t think . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to defend him, get out. Just leave me alone. Please.\u201d</p><p>She hated the pleading tone of her voice, but she was begging. She just wanted to be alone.</p><p>Kane sighed and she felt him leave the bed. \u201cIf you need anything, let me know. I\u2019ll check in on you later.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. She listened to his retreating footsteps and then shoved her fist into her mouth as more tears began to fall.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>\u201cYou going to tell me how you wound up in jail?\u201d Micah asked as he and Connor walked from the police station.</p><p>\u201cThey tried to keep me from Lyric. I resisted,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cThanks for coming so quickly. Pop didn\u2019t answer the phone, but to tell the truth, I\u2019d rather not get into it with him right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Micah said with a shrug. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>Connor ignored Micah as they climbed into his truck and opened his cell phone. It had been three goddamn hours since things had gone to hell at the music store. He had no idea where Lyric was, if she was safe, or just how upset she was.</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t true. It was pretty damn obvious she was destroyed by what she thought was his betrayal of her. It pissed him the fuck off. How could she think he\u2019d ever do that to her?</p><p>There was only one missed call and it sure as hell wasn\u2019t from Lyric. It was from Kane.</p><p>He hit the button for his voice mail and listened to the short message.</p><p>\u201cConnor, I have no idea what the hell happened back there. Lyric\u2019s a mess. She\u2019s here at the house and she doesn\u2019t want anyone allowed on the premises. You included. Give me a call when you get this so you can fill me in. I\u2019m working without a net here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Connor swore.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Micah asked quietly.</p><p>Connor pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers and closed his eyes. \u201cThis is a goddamn mess, Micah. I don\u2019t know what the hell to do. I\u2019m going to lose her and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a damn thing I can do about it.\u201d</p><p>Micah winced in sympathy. \u201cBeen there, done that. Don\u2019t ever have the desire to do it again. Tell me what happened. Maybe an objective opinion will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Connor said helplessly. \u201cShe already thinks I betrayed her trust. The shit\u2019s going to hit the fan any minute now. Maybe it already has. She thinks I sold her out to the media. She trusted me. Only me. It looks bad, but goddamn, I told her I loved her. How can she believe I\u2019d do that to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019ve both had a shitty day,\u201d Micah murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Connor said bleakly. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where am I taking you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>Micah lifted a brow as he stared over at Connor. \u201cGiving up that easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to give her some time. She\u2019s devastated. She\u2019s told her security not to allow anyone on the premises. I can\u2019t pile on her right now. It\u2019s going to goddamn kill me, but I\u2019ve got to give her time to cool off and get over the initial shock.\u201d</p><p>Connor curled his fingers into tight balls. He wanted to put his fist through the window. He should be with her right now. He should be holding her. He should be her shield against the world. But she was desperately alone and she was hurting and he couldn\u2019t get within ten feet of her.</p><p>\u201cLook, why don\u2019t you come home with me and have a few beers? It beats going home and driving yourself insane.\u201d</p><p>Connor sighed. \u201cThanks, man. You know I\u2019d love to see Angelina, but the truth is I\u2019m really shitty company right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Offer stands, though.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Micah pulled into the apartment complex he shared with Connor. Connor got out, waved his thanks to Micah again, then headed for his apartment while Micah walked back to his.</p><p>He unlocked his door and went inside, home for the first time since the day he\u2019d gone to Lyric\u2019s hotel room after their meeting at the office.</p><p>Boy, had his life changed dramatically since then. That day had started something he\u2019d never dreamed would happen. It seemed a lifetime ago.</p><p>His apartment had always been comfortable. Lived in. Slightly cluttered. His comfort place. A place he always enjoyed coming back to.</p><p>Tonight it was barren and sterile. The silence was suffocating and the walls seemed to close in on him from every direction.</p><p>He flopped onto the couch and reached for his phone to call Kane. He hadn\u2019t wanted to go into the details in front of Micah. No matter that she already thought he\u2019d betrayed her. He\u2019d never tell anyone the things she\u2019d shared with him.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Connor demanded when Kane answered the phone.</p><p>Kane sighed. \u201cNot good. What the fuck happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a clusterfuck, Kane. I can\u2019t get into the details. They\u2019ll be public soon enough. She thinks I sold her out. It\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sit on her, Kane. Keep her safe. Don\u2019t let her do anything stupid. I\u2019m going to give her until tomorrow and then I\u2019m coming over and I don\u2019t give a fuck how many guys you throw at me. All I\u2019ll say is that you better be up on your workman\u2019s comp, because if anyone tries to stop me, they\u2019ll wind up in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Her head ached. Her jaw ached. Her heart ached. Her eyes were swollen and her nose felt like it had run off her face. She looked and sounded horrible. She had no voice, which was pretty stupid considering it was how she made her living.</p><p>Her throat was so swollen it was hard to swallow but no matter how much she tried to turn it off, tears still leaked endlessly down her cheeks.</p><p>She\u2019d lain in bed for hours. Kane had come and gone with an ice pack for her face. He\u2019d hesitated and she could tell he had no liking for leaving her, but she shut him out and curled in on herself even more until he\u2019d left with a sigh.</p><p>Grief was a living, breathing entity inside her. It swelled so much that she feared she would break. Maybe she was already broken. Maybe she\u2019d always been broken and had slapped enough Band-Aids on to muddle through.</p><p>She tried hard to conjure her mother\u2019s face, to remember her smile, but every time she thought of her she saw only blood, heard the sounds of her being beaten and heard her cries of pain.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even attended her mother\u2019s funeral. Had there even been a service? Lyric doubted it. There had been no money and no one to care. Lyric had been hospitalized for days and afterward she\u2019d been released into the care of the state.</p><p>They\u2019d tried their best. Lyric had lived in a poor county without many resources. No one had been willing to foster the silent, grieving child. She\u2019d been too steeped in violence. Many were afraid that Danny Higgins would come after her. After the trial she\u2019d been shipped off to Jackson and shuffled around there.</p><p>She\u2019d been awarded a new life. New name. New birth certificate. The kind judge had told her that this was her opportunity to rise above her circumstances. It was the only thing that had managed to break through the thick wall of defense she\u2019d erected.</p><p>She\u2019d taken him at his word. She\u2019s chosen her name to honor her mother\u2019s love for her singing. And she\u2019d made a vow that one day she\u2019d get the hell out of Mississippi and she\u2019d never look back.</p><p>She\u2019d spent every day after that running. Always running from her past. Burying everything under a don\u2019t-give-a-shit, abrasive exterior so that no one ever dug deep. Until Connor.</p><p>A fresh surge of pain nearly paralyzed her. She\u2019d believed him. Or maybe she\u2019d been so desperate for someone to love her that she\u2019d been blinded. But she had believed in him and his love for her. She\u2019d wanted it so bad even when it baffled her.</p><p>She sat up in bed and wrapped her cold arms around herself and hugged as she rocked back and forth. A glance at the clock told her it was nearly two a.m. She laid her cheek on her knees and stared sightlessly toward the window. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t even know where her mother was buried.</p><p>The thought hit her like a thunderclap and she flinched from the realization. She\u2019d been so focused on her own survival that she\u2019d never gone back to see her mother\u2019s grave. Didn\u2019t even know if her life had been marked by a cold slab of concrete.</p><p>Had she been forgotten? Brushed aside as a county expense? Had anyone ever brought flowers to acknowledge the life, however short it had been?</p><p>Lyric struggled out of bed. Her clothes were wrinkled. She hadn\u2019t changed. Blood stained her shirt. Her pants sported a new tear. She thrust her feet into a pair of flip-flops by the bed and went in search of Kane.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t asleep. It shouldn\u2019t have surprised her. The man was more machine than human. He was awake in the living room, a book propped on his knee.</p><p>He looked up when she entered and got to his feet with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the personal assessment. It was very unlike Kane to offer more than a professional opinion. But it was clear that concern burned in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need to go to Mississippi,\u201d she said in a stark voice.</p> <p>Kane\u2019s brows drew together in a frown. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go. Now. I\u2019d like you to go. I may be crazy but I\u2019m not completely without a sense of self-preservation. I\u2019ll pay you. Of course. Your travel expenses. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Kane rubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cLook, Lyric, you\u2019re clearly distraught. No decision should ever be made under this kind of emotional duress. Get some sleep. If you still feel like you need to go tomorrow, I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>She turned, her back ramrod stiff. \u201cI\u2019ll go alone, then.\u201d</p><p>A curse exploded from Kane and he crossed the room to grasp her arm. \u201cWhat the hell is in Mississippi?\u201d</p><p>She glanced dully up at him. \u201cMy mother.\u201d</p> <p>Connor\u2019s phone rang at six a.m. He hadn\u2019t slept a wink the entire night. He\u2019d been too pissed and too worried. He reached for the phone he\u2019d tossed on the couch and put it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cMalone,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming over,\u201d Gray said in his ear.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead and Connor slouched back on the couch. He rubbed his forehead tiredly. He should have slept. He had to be at his best to confront Lyric. She was going to listen to him, damn it.</p><p>He checked his watch. Two more hours. He\u2019d give her two hours and then he was going to take no prisoners.</p><p>His doorbell rang and he cursed. Damn interfering friends. He dragged himself to his feet and went to open the door.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so happy to see us,\u201d Micah said dryly as he shoved his way in.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do y\u2019all want?\u201d he asked irritably.</p><p>\u201cOur women heard of the hoopla. They\u2019re all pretty pissed,\u201d Gray said as he and Nathan came in behind Micah. \u201cThat was quite a scene yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Connor sighed in resignation and slammed the door before turning to follow the guys into his living room.</p><p>\u201cIs everything out?\u201d Connor asked wearily.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d say so. Or at least all the sordid details of her past. Julie\u2019s ready to go kick some serious ass even though she has no idea whose ass she wants to kick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyric thinks I sold her out,\u201d Connor said bleakly. \u201cShe confided in me the night before. And then at the music store, it all came out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rough,\u201d Micah said. \u201cThat had to be a huge shock for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I loved her,\u201d Connor bit out. \u201cI laid it all out. How could she think I\u2019d betray her like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand why you\u2019re pissed,\u201d Gray said carefully. \u201cBut Lyric doesn\u2019t strike me as someone who has a lot of trust. In anyone. Can\u2019t say I blame her if all that shit is true. You have to admit, the timing of it would cause a knee-jerk reaction.\u201d</p><p>Connor dropped into a chair and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cYeah, I get it. I do. I can see how it looks. It looks pretty damn bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question is, who spilled her story to the media?\u201d Nathan asked.</p><p>Connor scowled. \u201cMy money is on her fuck-head of an ex-manager. When she fired him, he threatened her. Told her he could bury her and that he knew things. If not him, then her ex-bodyguards are likely suspects, provided they knew of her past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant us to find out?\u201d Micah asked a little too eagerly.</p><p>Connor surveyed the anger in his friends\u2019 eyes and was grateful to have their support. \u201cYeah. Whatever you can do would be great. I\u2019m going to be a little busy.\u201d</p><p>Gray lifted an eyebrow and a smile glimmered on his lips.</p><p>Connor stared over at his friends, his expression resolute. \u201cI\u2019m going to make Lyric listen to me. I get why she thought what she did. I don\u2019t even blame her. It pissed me off, but she was totally unprepared for that to come at her and she reacted. But I\u2019m not letting her go.\u201d</p><p>His friends\u2019 faces broadened into grins. Gray chuckled. \u201cI always knew that, of any of us, when you fell, you\u2019d fall the hardest.\u201d</p><p>Connor held up his middle finger and they burst into laughter.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>Lyric stood over the small, plain grave marker that was smudged with dirt and mildew. Weeds had grown over the plot so much that she\u2019d had to shove them aside to even read the inscription.</p><p>It was short and to the point. No inspirational quote or little tag like loving mother, beloved sister or friend. Just her mother\u2019s name and the dates of her life. Like she hadn\u2019t mattered or she wasn\u2019t important enough to rate something nicer.</p><p>The flowers shook in her hands. So much so that a few of the petals floated to the ground, marking a stark contrast between the dead, brown grass and the vibrant purple of the violets.</p><p>They were her mom\u2019s favorite. She\u2019d loved anything purple, but violets were her favorite and they\u2019d grown wild in their yard. Lyric remembered picking them in the spring and her mother\u2019s bright smile when she\u2019d taken the limp flowers from Lyric\u2019s two-fisted grip.</p><p>Lyric knelt and carefully arranged the violets in a decorative pattern. In the distance she could hear the sounds of cameras and shouted questions. Kane had done a wonderful job positioning his men to keep back the small crowd of reporters who\u2019d flocked to the small town of Collins, Mississippi, the instant the details of her past had been made public.</p><p>Kane stood a short distance away, keeping to the side to afford her as much privacy as possible. Three of his men formed a wide perimeter around the grave and kept diligent watch on the crowd that the rest of the security team controlled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making you a promise, Mama. As soon as I settle somewhere and have a home, I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re moved. There\u2019s nothing for you and me here. You should be somewhere happier. I\u2019ll make sure you have a respectable headstone that celebrates the mother you were and that you died trying to protect me from a monster.\u201d</p><p>Tears slid down her cheeks and made a pattern in the dust surrounding the grave. Her sobs caught painfully in her chest and her throat swelled with unbearable grief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you flowers. Violets and maybe some purple irises. I know it\u2019s been a long time since we spoke. I spent so many years angry at you for leaving me. I was wrong. So terribly wrong. I wanted you to know that I did it. I became a singer. Just like you always wanted. I got to choose my new name when everything changed after the trial. I chose Lyric for you. As a promise that I\u2019d fulfill your dream for me. I hope you\u2019re proud of me. I haven\u2019t done a lot to make you proud but I\u2019m going to change that. You deserve more from the daughter you died protecting.\u201d</p><p>She wiped at her face with the back of her hand and rose to her feet. Kane was there to steady her and he tucked her against him as they walked slowly back to the convoy of SUVs they\u2019d driven from Texas.</p><p>She\u2019d given Kane the address of her old house. She didn\u2019t even know if it would still be there. She was torn on whether or not she even wanted to face the place where her mother had died, but some force inside her propelled her. Maybe it was her need for closure, or maybe it was finally time to face her demons.</p><p>She knew only that she couldn\u2019t move forward until she\u2019d come to grips with the terrible hurt inside her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d Kane asked as they pulled away from the cemetery.</p><p>She nodded, not trusting her voice not to crack if she spoke.</p><p>The scenery was a blur as they rolled out of town and turned down a series of dirt roads that led farther into the country.</p><p>When they came to a stop, she sat still in her seat, looking out the window at the run-down, overgrown wooden house where her life had irrevocably changed.</p><p>It seemed smaller now. Not nearly as menacing as it had when she was a child. She would have sworn it was huge, so large that it swallowed her whole. In reality it was barely larger than a shack. Windows were broken out. Shutters were either missing or barely still hanging. Most of the white paint had long since peeled and chipped away. Boards were missing from the front porch and the lawn obviously hadn\u2019t been maintained since her mother had been murdered.</p><p>It was a sad, frail house where ghosts of the past still lingered. Carefully she opened her car door and slipped out into the sun. She shivered slightly as the breeze nipped at her skin. It wasn\u2019t a cold day. In fact, it was a glorious day. South on the cusp of spring. The violets she\u2019d remembered growing wild were scattered among the growth of weeds, little bursts of color against the grass still dead from winter.</p><p>But she felt as though she were encased in ice, as though the spring sun hadn\u2019t quite reached her soul.</p><p>She stood staring at the shell of a place she\u2019d once lived. Where her most painful memories sprang to life. And she knew she couldn\u2019t go in. That there was no purpose in going in. It was just a house. Just a bunch of wood and nails barely held together. It didn\u2019t have any power over her.</p><p>The sound of another engine registered in her consciousness. She dragged her gaze from the house, expecting to have Kane shove her back into the car. It was probably more reporters. They\u2019d been pursued ever since they\u2019d arrived in town.</p><p>To her shock, Connor got out of his truck and strode in her direction, his expression one of great fatigue, hurt and concern.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Lyric?\u201d he demanded as he drew closer. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go in there alone. You shouldn\u2019t go in there at all.\u201d</p><p>She stared numbly at him, alternately so glad to see him and so furious that he was here. She was too tired to summon any sort of reaction and so she just stood there, trying to gather the strength to tell him to go.</p><p>\u201cMy God, you look like I feel,\u201d he muttered just as he yanked her into his arms.</p><p>It didn\u2019t occur to her to push him away. His heat surrounded her, bathing her in a blanket of comfort so sweet that she melted against his chest. She closed her eyes and inhaled his scent and savored the feeling of warmth she\u2019d been denied for so long.</p><p>He held her so tight it was hard to drag breaths into her lungs. He trembled against her. Shook so hard that she shook too.</p><p>Finally he pulled her gently away and he stared down at her with haunted eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she managed to croak out. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove all day to get to you. I went to the house but you had already gone. I\u2019m probably wanted in two states for breaking so many speed laws. I couldn\u2019t stop until I was here with you. I didn\u2019t want you to have to do this alone.\u201d</p><p>Tears glittered in her vision, blurring him and the world around her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He swore softly and touched her cheek. \u201cLyric, I didn\u2019t betray you. I know how it looks. I understand why you were so upset. But it wasn\u2019t me. I love you. I\u2019d never do anything to intentionally hurt you.\u201d</p><p>His explanation muddled her brain. Could she have been so wrong? Who else could possibly have known? She took a tentative step back, a protective measure because, when he touched her, she forgot how to be angry. \u201cWho, then?\u201d</p><p>Connor glanced around and then rubbed his hands up and down her arms. He leaned back against the SUV she\u2019d gotten out of and pulled her with him so that he looked down at her.</p><p>\u201cPaul sold you out. He was pissed that you fired him. His threats weren\u2019t empty. He went to the media and spilled his guts.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock\u2014and hurt. \u201cBut how . . . ? Why? How did he know? How do you know? I don\u2019t understand any of this.\u201d</p><p>His chest ached at the pain in her gaze. \u201cGray, Nathan and Micah paid Paul a little visit. I\u2019m sure they scared the shit out of him. The thing is, he\u2019s known for a long time about your past. Back when you signed with him, he launched an extensive investigation into your background. According to him, it took a year, but he was able to uncover the truth. He kept it to himself\u2014as insurance\u2014and when you fired him, he sold his story for a hell of a lot of money </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She frowned and sighed. \u201cI guess I\u2019m wrong about everybody. Clearly I have poor judgment when it comes to people.\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek. A light caress as his fingers stroked over her face. \u201cYou weren\u2019t wrong to trust me, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes clouded and she blinked furiously, determined not to shed more tears. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t trust you. How can you even stand to look at me after the awful things I said to you?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cTrust is something you have to work at, baby. We\u2019ll get there. I plan on being around to make it happen. You suffered a horrible shock, and in your mind the only person it could have been was me. That hurt you and I\u2019m so damn sorry. I would have done anything in the world to keep you from being hurt.\u201d</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around his waist and held on for dear life. She trembled against him and he held her close, his hands rubbing up and down her back.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lyric. I love you so damn much my teeth ache. I want us to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He went still against her. His heart thudded wildly against her cheek. He gently pulled her away, cupped her chin and tilted her head until their gazes met. \u201cSay that again,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I love you so much it scares me.\u201d</p> <p>He lowered his head and kissed her, his lips melting so sweet over hers. Just a warm brush, so gentle and loving that it made her ache.</p><p>When he drew away, his eyes were aglow with warmth and contentment, as if she\u2019d given him what he most wanted in the world. It unsettled her that she had.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to work on, baby. You\u2019ve got a lot to deal with. I\u2019m going to be with you all the way but you need to get help to deal with everything that\u2019s happened to you. I want you to be healthy and happy for you first.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. He smiled and touched her nose.</p><p>\u201cI want you to marry me eventually. I want it all, Lyric. You, me, together. But I\u2019m willing to wait as long as it takes for you to come to me happy and whole. Healed. That won\u2019t happen overnight, but I\u2019ll be here when it does.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse sped up. Adrenaline hummed through her veins, leaving her unsettled and excited. She wrinkled her nose and stared up at him. \u201cI suppose this is where we talk about me quitting my job, marrying, settling down, popping out babies, getting a house with the picket fence and the whole shebang.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI love my career. I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it. I haven\u2019t always had my head screwed on straight. I\u2019m my own worst enemy. But I love singing. I don\u2019t want to stop it.\u201d</p> <p>He gathered her close and stared down at her, his eyes so earnest, so focused on her.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is where we talk about the fact that I\u2019m going to quit my job and follow you around on tour making sure you\u2019re safe and that you take care of yourself the way you should. Babies and the picket fence are purely optional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she breathed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t real. You can\u2019t be real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m real. I\u2019m the man who loves you more than anyone else will ever love you. I\u2019m the man who wants to be with you and will do everything I can to keep you from ever being hurt again.\u201d</p><p>A tear trickled down her cheek and she sniffled. \u201cDamn it. You\u2019re going to make me cry again.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hands and she slid her palms over his, lacing their fingers together.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we get out of here,\u201d he suggested. \u201cLet\u2019s go on down the road. Find a hotel where we can sleep for about twenty-four hours. Right after I make love you to for about six.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hands and leaned up on tiptoes to kiss him. \u201cI love you, Connor Malone. I never thought I\u2019d love someone the way I love you. I never dreamed someone would love me the way you do.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled and pressed his forehead to hers. \u201cThe funny thing about dreams is that every now and then they come true.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see everyone,\u201d Lyric said as Connor bundled her into the waiting limo.</p><p>Connor smiled as he slid in beside her. He reached over, wrapped his arm around her shoulders and squeezed. \u201cHave I told you how gorgeous you look?\u201d</p><p>She flushed and ducked her head. No matter how often he told her how beautiful she was, she never got used to hearing it spoken with such conviction. He truly meant it.</p><p>The thing was, she was still a size twelve. Closer to a fourteen now. And Connor didn\u2019t give a shit. He couldn\u2019t keep his eyes or hands off her, a fact she delighted in.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Nia since she was born. I bet she\u2019s half-grown by now,\u201d Lyric said with an unhappy frown. \u201cI miss everyone. We need to get home to see them more often.\u201d</p><p>Connor chuckled. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t wildly successful and so in demand that tour dates keep being added, you\u2019d have more time to go home.\u201d</p><p>She burrowed into his chest and sighed her contentment as the limo left the Houston airport. Home. It was kind of weird to consider a place home, but Houston had become that for her.</p><p>It was where Connor\u2019s family and friends lived. Family and friends that had become hers. Connor didn\u2019t know it yet, but she planned to surprise him with the house she\u2019d bought not far from where his dad and sister and brother-in-law lived.</p><p>Though they weren\u2019t married yet, she and Connor were inseparable. At first she\u2019d worried that he\u2019d been so willing to quit his job and travel with her\u2014working with Kane and his team for her. What if he got bored, tired or regretted his decision to leave his life and career? For her.</p><p>It was humbling and awe inspiring. Never before had anyone been willing to sacrifice so much for her.</p><p>She loved him like she\u2019d never imagined being able to love another person.</p><p>Her cell rang, and she reached into her purse, grinning when she saw that it was Faith.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Faith asked when Lyric said hello.</p><p>She smiled over at Connor. \u201cWe\u2019re in the car now. Should be there in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Faith\u2019s squeal of delight made Lyric warm all over. In excited tones, Faith relayed the news to the other girls and a chorus of cheers greeted Lyric through the phone.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d Faith said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you when you get here.\u201d</p><p>Lyric slowly closed her phone and battled the knot of emotion in her throat.</p><p>\u201cThey love you,\u201d Connor said. \u201cJust like I do.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and leaned up to kiss him. \u201cI\u2019m just so . . . happy. Ridiculously happy. Like so happy I get paranoid that the world\u2019s going to go to shit tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and squeezed her again. \u201cSo tell me. How drunk are you girls planning to get?\u201d</p><p>Lyric grinned. \u201cWho knows with those four. They\u2019re bad influences. I never touched alcohol before them.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, they pulled into the parking lot of Cattleman\u2019s. The parking lot was empty. Tonight was a private function. The entire restaurant had been shut down so the girls could get together. Of course the guys would inevitably show up, but no one minded.</p><p>Life was pretty damn good.</p><p>Good family. Good friends. A man she loved with everything she had.</p><p>As soon as the limo came to a stop, the entrance of Cattleman\u2019s flew open and Faith, Julie, Serena and Angelina\u2014a very slim, gorgeous Angelina\u2014flew out to the car.</p><p>Connor, laughing, opened the door and climbed out, holding his hands up. \u201cSince I know y\u2019all aren\u2019t that excited to see me, let me get Lyric out so y\u2019all can attack her.\u201d</p><p>Julie rolled her eyes. \u201cPouty, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Faith hugged Connor as Lyric got out and then Angelina gave him an affectionate squeeze and a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve taken very good care of her, Connor,\u201d Serena said in a pleased voice. \u201cYou both look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing how love does that,\u201d Faith said smugly.</p><p>The girls gathered around Lyric, all hugging her and smothering her as they laughed and babbled all at once.</p><p>Connor stood indulgently to the side until they quieted enough for him to get a word in edgewise. Lyric smiled up at him, so happy she could burst.</p><p>\u201cOkay, time for you to shoo, Connor. The guys aren\u2019t supposed to show up for two hours yet,\u201d Julie said.</p><p>Connor raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat? We\u2019re being allowed entrance into the goddess domain? I thought we were forbidden to be seen on girls\u2019 night out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making an exception this time,\u201d Lyric said with a grin. \u201cWe get a two-hour head start and then you guys can come join the fun. By then we\u2019ll be too shit-faced to care.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and then climbed back into the car. \u201cI\u2019m going over to Gray\u2019s. I\u2019ll send the car back in case you all need it. No taking a cab,\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re staying put,\u201d Serena said airily. \u201cWe have our gorgeous bartender who spoils us rotten and I have it on good authority that Carl had some yummy food made for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Lyric said mournfully. \u201cFood on the plane sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell of course it did,\u201d Faith said as she tucked her arm through Lyric\u2019s. \u201cBye, Connor! We\u2019ll see you in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Connor laughed. \u201cI know when I\u2019ve been dismissed.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed Lyric before pulling away. \u201cHave a good time, baby.\u201d</p><p>Lyric waved as he got into the car and then allowed Faith to drag her into the restaurant.</p><p>As they headed into the quiet and empty place, Lyric grinned in sudden remembrance.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the shit-eating grin for?\u201d Julie asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cDo you guys know that this is where Connor and I first kissed? Well, I can\u2019t really say he kissed me. I kissed him. Right there at the bar.\u201d</p><p>The girls laughed and Lyric turned her attention to Angelina, who\u2019d been mostly quiet to now.</p><p>\u201cYou look fantastic, Angelina. I\u2019m so jealous. You lost all the baby weight.\u201d</p><p>Angelina grimaced. \u201cNot all. But I\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Nia?\u201d</p><p>At the mention of her daughter, Angelina positively lit up. \u201cOh she\u2019s gorgeous. Such a wonderful baby. And Micah is so in love with her. It\u2019s really disgusting how she has him so wrapped around her finger already.\u201d</p><p>Julie rolled her eyes. \u201cLike mother, like daughter.\u201d</p><p>Serena and Faith laughed at Angelina\u2019s startled expression.</p><p>\u201cWell they do have you there,\u201d Lyric pointed out. \u201cThat man is an idiot over you.\u201d</p><p>Angelina\u2019s soft smile glowed.</p><p>\u201cHey, ladies. I am here to serve. Just tell me what your pleasure is.\u201d</p><p>Lyric turned to see a young\u2014and hot\u2014bartender grinning at them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Drew,\u201d Serena murmured. \u201cIsn\u2019t he yummy? He\u2019s seen us drunk before so you don\u2019t have to worry that he\u2019s going to take photos and sell them to tabloids. Damon has already threatened him with bodily injury if he so much as breathes a word about us being here.\u201d</p><p>Lyric laughed. \u201cI do love your husband, Serena. He looks and acts so civilized, but underneath he\u2019s a complete barbarian.\u201d</p><p>Serena beamed. \u201cI know. Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s quit talking and start drinking,\u201d Julie said. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do!\u201d</p><p>For the next two hours, the drinks flowed freely, as did the laughter and the conversation. Though Lyric had never enjoyed being alone and surrounded herself with people, she\u2019d never surrounded herself with really great people. People she could trust. People who loved her and she loved in return.</p><p>Being with those people? She didn\u2019t even have the words to describe the feeling.</p><p>Drew was the dream that the girls had reported him to be. He kept their glasses full, cleaned up their spills and never blinked an eye when their conversations detoured into the way-too-much-information department.</p><p>\u201cSoooo, Lyric,\u201d Faith began. \u201cTell us when you\u2019re going to put Connor out of his misery and make an honest man out of him.\u201d</p><p>Julie, Serena and Angelina all eagerly sat forward, their attention focused solidly on Lyric now. Lyric blushed, but she couldn\u2019t help the wide smile that attacked her face.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d she said serenely. \u201cI want it to be perfect. Connor\u2019s been . . . He\u2019s been so patient and understanding. He\u2019s been just perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he has. He\u2019s in love,\u201d Julie said. \u201cMen are pretty stupid when they\u2019re in love.\u201d</p><p>Angelina snorted. \u201cYou love that Nathan is stupid over you.\u201d</p><p>Julie grinned. \u201cYes. I have to admit. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how soon?\u201d Serena asked Lyric.</p><p>\u201cI have another month of touring and then I have a surprise for him. You guys can\u2019t breathe a word!\u201d</p><p>They all solemnly crossed their hearts and swore never to tell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve bought a house here in Houston.\u201d</p><p>The squeals were deafening. It took several minutes to get everyone quiet again and Lyric beamed at them all, thrilled with their excitement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to surprise him with the house and then I\u2019m going to ask him to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh, I like it,\u201d Serena said.</p> <p>\u201cYou would,\u201d Faith said with a laugh. \u201cShe popped the question to Damon after she finally decided to marry him,\u201d she explained to Lyric.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so excited for you, Lyric,\u201d Angelina said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re happy and ready to make the commitment. Connor loves you so much. I want you both to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe makes me happy,\u201d Lyric said with a catch in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI have something I want to tell you guys,\u201d Serena said when things got quiet again. \u201cI wanted to wait until we were all together.\u201d</p><p>Lyric and the others exchanged worried glances, but the look on Serena\u2019s face was one of utter contentment. She all but glowed.</p> <p>\u201cDamon and I are going to start trying for a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Faith shrieked.</p><p>Julie and Lyric looked at each other with something akin to horror and Angelina promptly laughed when she caught the exchange.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Serena?\u201d Julie asked. \u201cI mean have you worked things out to the point you feel comfortable bringing a baby into the picture?\u201d</p><p>Serena smiled. \u201cIt means that some things will change for us, but not for a while. We\u2019re comfortable with the change. We want . . . we want to start a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome,\u201d Lyric said softly. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you. You look . . . delirious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am. This time last year I wouldn\u2019t have been able to imagine having a baby. I wasn\u2019t ready. But now? It\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not ready,\u201d Faith muttered. \u201cThat pregnancy scare I had awhile back was enough to convince me I won\u2019t be ready for a bit yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Julie seconded.</p><p>Lyric nodded her fervent agreement. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave the procreating to the earth mothers over here,\u201d she said, jabbing her thumb in Angelina and Serena\u2019s direction.</p><p>Angelina snorted. \u201cEarth mother. Yeah. That\u2019s me all right. It\u2019s a wonder I didn\u2019t kill my poor child her first week home. I couldn\u2019t even figure out how to change a diaper. Micah had to help me. Isn\u2019t that pathetic? I swear he has more maternal instinct than I do.\u201d</p><p>Faith giggled and then the rest joined. It was hard to imagine a dominant badass like Micah being all maternal.</p><p>\u201cAre you all still conscious?\u201d Nathan called from across the room.</p><p>The women whipped around on their barstools to see the men trailing into the bar. Lord but they looked good. Although as soon as Connor appeared, Lyric lost all interest in everyone else.</p> <p>Then Micah appeared and Lyric\u2019s eyes narrowed. She cocked her head to the side before she realized what it was she saw attached to Micah.</p><p>The room went dead silent as all the girls focused their attention on Micah. And then Julie shrieked with laughter. She damn near fell off her barstool as she pointed at Micah and laughed her ass off.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Julie wheezed. \u201cI win. I win!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you win?\u201d Faith asked with a frown.</p><p>Tears streamed down Julie\u2019s face as Micah fixed her with a ferocious scowl.</p><p>\u201cHe once bet me that I\u2019d be tamed before he ever would be. We made a bet. Oh my God, I totally win. Look at him. He\u2019s wearing the baby!\u201d</p><p>There Micah stood, a rueful, somewhat abashed look on his face, Nia securely attached to his chest in a Snuggie.</p><p>The women died laughing and then the rest of the men joined in. Micah rolled his eyes heavenward and then slung an arm around Angelina.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all just jealous they don\u2019t have my fashion sense,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNia would make any man look good.\u201d</p><p>Damon shot Serena a queasy look. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to make me wear our baby, are you?\u201d</p><p>Serena grinned mischievously while the rest of the room roared with laughter. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Damon. You might look cute with a baby strapped to your chest.\u201d</p><p>Connor came to stand beside Lyric and wrapped his arm loosely around her shoulders as they laughed with the rest of the group. He stared down into her eyes and what she saw reflected in his warmed her to the bone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re home,\u201d she whispered close to his ear so he could hear over the din.</p><p>He kissed her lingeringly, ignoring the rest of the group. \u201cDon\u2019t you know, Lyric? I\u2019m home whenever I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>Love and so much joy flooded her soul. Tears glistened in her eyes as she stared around at the friends\u2014family\u2014who meant so much to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare cry,\u201d Julie threatened. \u201cIf you make me cry in front of everyone, I\u2019ll kick your ass, Lyric.\u201d</p><p>Lyric sniffed. \u201cI love you guys.\u201d</p><p>And then the girls all crowded around her, shoving Connor out of the way as they wrapped their arms tightly around Lyric.</p><p>\u201cWe love you too,\u201d Faith said in her sweet voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, Serena. So who gets to be the baby\u2019s godmother?\u201d Julie asked innocently.</p><p>Serena rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll wimp out like Angelina and have to name you all. Poor kid. He or she won\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><p>Lyric gathered them to her again, or as well as she could. Her eyes were all goopy and she probably had mascara everywhere, but she didn\u2019t give a damn. She was with . . . family. </p> </body></html>"]
