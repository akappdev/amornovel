Traces of fog, designed for effect in the museum, lingered and created an atmosphere that was ghostly and suspenseful.</p><p>\u201cBlood and gory guts! Murder, most foul!\u201d</p> <p>The teasing cry came from a man in the group of fifteen. He was dressed as a tourist, in shorts, T-shirt and baseball cap. His nose still bore traces of white zinc and, as typical of most tourists, he was sporting a sunburn that would soon hurt.</p><p>\u201cNo, death most absurd,\u201d David Beckett corrected. He had to admit-he loved filling in as a tour guide, and had been glad to give Danny Zigler, the weekend tour host, time off.</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d murmured one of the teenaged girls.</p><p>David heard a small, aborted laugh. It came from Pete Dryer, Key West policeman, who happened to be on the tour with his sister, brother-in-law, niece and nephew, family down from Fort Lauderdale for a few weeks during summer break.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be dramatic, folks,\u201d Pete teased.</p> <p>\u201cOur next exhibit is definitely one of our most bizarre stories-even in a place where the bizarre is quite customary,\u201d David said.</p><p>They had been moving at a steady but relaxed pace through the exhibits. The museum was a family business, and covered all of the colorful history of Florida\u2019s Key West. Each major event was shown in an incredibly detailed and authentic tableau. The tableaux were not wax. Once upon a time, the place had been a small wax museum, but David\u2019s grandfather, something of a mechanical and electrical genius, had avoided the constant loss of wax figurines when the heat soared in Key West, when storms came through, when air-conditioning ceased to work. The figures in the exhibit were brilliant mechanical masterpieces.</p><p>The group was heading to David\u2019s favorite historical exhibit. He grinned and said as an introduction, \u201cA story of true love to some-true evil and wickedness to others.\u201d</p><p>A few of the young women in the crowd of tourists smiled, as well. David played the part of host well, he thought, and had the right appearance for it. He was tall, dark-haired and in damned decent shape at the moment, thanks to the navy. He wore a top hat and Victorian cape, though why that was the uniform, he wasn\u2019t sure. Many of the women and girls in the crowd were nervous-museums with tableaux often made people nervous, and many of the figures here were so realistic that it did seem they might come to life. David was enjoying himself. It was good to be home, and good to be dealing with the family business for a stint, giving employees time off here and there, even if he wouldn\u2019t be staying for long right now. Finished with the military, he was headed to the University of Florida-a bit old for a freshman, but he\u2019d be going on the \u201cuncle\u201d he\u2019d so recently served, Uncle Sam.</p><p>The blonde in the Hog\u2019s Breath Saloon T-shirt and short-shorts was really cute, he thought.</p><p>He felt a moment\u2019s guilt; he wasn\u2019t accustomed to feeling free to flirt when he met a lovely young woman. He\u2019d been engaged. He\u2019d had a fianc\u00e9e he loved, that is until he\u2019d returned home to find out that Tanya had decided that she was moving north with a football player who\u2019d come down to Key West from Ohio State.</p> <p>It hurt. It still hurt. But his time in the military had driven them apart. They had dated all through high school. It had seemed like real love. But it hadn\u2019t been. Not on Tanya\u2019s part, at least.</p><p>But he had been gone often, and for long periods, and maybe it was just natural that she had moved on. Now, he needed to do the same.</p><p>He stopped just before his favorite tableau and said, \u201cCarl Tanzler was born in Dresden, Germany, and came to the United States via a circuitous route that took him to Cuba, Zephyrhills, Florida, and finally down to Key West. Here he worked as an X-ray technician at the U.S. Marine Hospital, while, for some reason, his wife remained in Zephyrhills with his family. Now, when he was young, so the story goes, he had visions, and his grandmother encouraged those visions. One was a beautiful dark-haired woman who would prove to be his true love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical-his true love wasn\u2019t his wife,\u201d the blonde woman said. David thought one of the college girls with her group had called her Genevieve. She looked like a Genevieve. Really pretty face, beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his wife?\u201d Pete\u2019s sister, Sally, said. \u201cHis true love wasn\u2019t his wife?\u201d</p><p>Her husband, Gerry, laughed and gave her a hug.</p><p>\u201cNope, not his wife,\u201d David agreed. \u201cOne day, into the hospital walked a stunning young Cuban woman named Elena de Hoyos. Sadly, the young woman suffered from tuberculosis. Carl-who called himself Count von Cosel-fell instantly in love with her. Problems abounded. He had his wife, and Elena was married, as well. Ah, but that particular problem was quickly solved, because her husband left her as soon as the diagnosis was made. Carl swore to her and her family that he could cure her. At the time, though, there was nothing at all that he could do, even though he ingratiated himself to the family and was a constant guest in their home with his cures. When Elena died on October twenty-fifth in nineteen thirty-one, he offered to build her a beautiful mausoleum, which he did, and he visited it night after night, playing music for her, speaking to her in her grave, giving her gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sad and tragic,\u201d an older woman offered. She had zinc on her nose, too. She seemed to be the wife of the fellow with the sunburn. Her shade almost matched his.</p> <p>\u201cYes, well, one day, he quit visiting. Now, folks, this is Key West, Florida. For the next several years, Carl Tanzler, Count von Cosel, spent his days buying perfume, mortician\u2019s wax, wire and women\u2019s lingerie and clothing, and no one really seemed to notice. Then one day, Nana, Elena\u2019s sister, heard rumors that Tanzler was sleeping with her sister\u2019s corpse. She accosted Tanzler, and he was soon arrested. Now, legend has it that Nana let him have three days with the body before the police came in to take him, but I\u2019m not sure I believe that bend in the story. Tanzler was taken into custody. He was examined by psychiatrists. Just to prove the rest of the country can be as crazy as folks in Key West, the story became romanticized in papers across America. Eventually, Tanzler was released-the statute of limitations for disturbing a grave had run out. An autopsy suggested that the man had been practicing necrophilia for years. Tanzler\u2019s own memoirs speak of his love for Elena and his belief that they would fly to the stars together as man and wife, since he had married her in a secret and private ceremony. Elena was given a second viewing at the Dean-Lopez Funeral Home. Maybe five or six hundred people attended her first, thousands attended her second. Our next display is one that recalls the famous story of true love-Carl Tanzler stands by the bedside of his bride.\u201d</p><p>With those words, David strode into the next room, his arm sweeping out dramatically.</p><p>He frowned, startled by the sudden silence.</p><p>Then the blonde screamed. It was a tragic and horrible scream, and he was destined to hear that sound over and over again in the years to come.</p><p>David turned.</p><p>The robotic recreation of Carl Tanzler stood just as usual, a small, thin-faced man with a balding head at the rear of the bed, bending over Elena Milagro de Hoyos.</p><p>But the body on the bed was not Elena\u2019s.</p><p>He didn\u2019t scream. He felt as if ice washed over him and permeated him, blood and bone.</p><p>A woman lay on the bed.</p><p>But it was not the model of Elena!</p><p>She wasn\u2019t dark; she was blonde. Her hair, long and lustrous, fell over the pillow and curled down the side of the bed. Her eyes, blue and open, stared at the ceiling in frozen horror. She was wearing a sundress, and while stretched out in a natural pose, she might have been getting her beauty sleep had it not been for her eyes, staring sightlessly in terror.</p><p>David felt his knees buckle. Only the ice in his veins kept him standing.</p><p>Blood and guts! Murder most foul!</p><p>There was no blood. But it was murder. Despite the pristine beauty of her body as she lay, dark gray bruises were apparent around her neck.</p><p>It was murder. The murder of a beautiful young woman.</p><p>Not a stranger. Not just any woman.</p><p>It was Tanya, his ex-fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>1</p><p>Now</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I think you\u2019ve taken on way too much,\u201d Clarinda said, voicing her opinion in a loud whisper next to Katie\u2019s ear. She had to come down to Katie\u2019s ear to be heard so close to the sound system. A drunken frat boy from Omaha was in the midst of a soulful Alice Cooper song, the bar was full and the noise level was high.</p><p>Katie shrugged and grinned, looking up at her friend. Maybe she was taking on too much, but an opportunity had come up, and she hadn\u2019t been able to resist.</p><p>\u201cIt will be wonderful, it will work out-and it will be good for Key West,\u201d Katie said in return.</p><p>Clarinda arched a doubtful brow, set down a glass of water with lime on the small table at Katie\u2019s side and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll help you, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, you know, Danny Zigler will be delighted to come and work for you. He was heartbroken when the place shut down years ago. People say that it\u2019s haunted, of course. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, can we get another round over here?\u201d a man shouted above the din.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t call me sweetie,\u201d Clarinda said, exhaling a sigh of exasperation. \u201cWhat is this tonight? We usually get the locals who actually know how to hold their liquor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee. We\u2019re in Key West and we\u2019ve been discovered by tourists. Go figure,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I wish I were the karaoke hostess and not the waitress,\u201d Clarinda said.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve told you that you can work for me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when the place is slow and the hostess is supposed to sing, I assure you that I\u2019ll clean out not just the bar, but the entire street. No-eventually, I\u2019ll make my fortune doing caricatures on Mallory Square, but until that day, I\u2019ll be your support by helping drunks get drunker and therefore hand out big tips. Okay, that helps both of us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSweetie!\u201d the man called again. \u201cAnother round!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to get the round on top of his head,\u201d Clarinda promised and strode toward the bar.</p><p>The Alice Cooper tune was winding down. Next up was a fellow who wanted to do Sinatra. Katie applauded both the man returning to his seat and the one walking up to the microphone.</p> <p>Stumbling up to the microphone. What was it with tonight? It was true-the strange and totally inebriated seemed to be coming out of the woodwork. Well, it was Key West. Home to some, but mainly a tourist town where the primary activity was drinking too much.</p><p>Key West has much more to offer, she thought, defending her native territory. The fishing was excellent, diving was spectacular and many visitors came for the water sports. But it was true as well that young and old flocked from far and wide to Jimmy Buffett\u2019s Margaritaville for the sheer pleasure of a bachelor party, or just wild nights along Duval. Duval was the hub of nightlife, and it was the main place for cheap hotel rooms.</p><p>Her place-or her uncle Jamie\u2019s place, O\u2019Hara\u2019s, where she ran Katie-oke-was off the southern end of Duval while most of the more popular watering holes were at the northern end. She did tend to draw a lot of the locals. Many of the entertainers who worked at the festivals-Fantasy Fest, Pirates in Paradise, art fests, music fests, Hemingway Days and more-came in to practice their newest songs with Katie. She operated Katie-oke four nights a week. She also worked at O\u2019Hara\u2019s when she wasn\u2019t doing karaoke, helping set the sound and stage for performers working on their own music, or doing easy acoustic and vocal numbers on Monday and Tuesday nights.</p><p>She had received a degree from Juilliard and taken work with a prestigious theater company in New England, and she had loved New England, but it hadn\u2019t been home. She\u2019d eventually discovered that she couldn\u2019t take snow and sleet, and wanted to make her living in Key West.</p><p>She realized that she was good at the heat, good at sweating. She just never learned to layer properly.</p> <p>And the water! How she missed the water when she was away. Her own home, a small Victorian-one of more than three thousand houses in the area on the state\u2019s historic roster-wasn\u2019t on the water, but on Elizabeth Street. She was in Old Town, and surrounded by tourism. She got her fill of water, however, because one of her best friends, an old high-school mate, Jonas Weston, now dating Clarinda, owned and operated the Salvage Inn, a place on the Gulf side with its own little stretch of man-made beach. She was welcome there, whenever she wanted to go.</p><p>\u201cThose fellows are being quite obnoxious. Want me to take one of them out?\u201d</p><p>Katie heard the question, but she didn\u2019t even look over at the speaker. Bartholomew knew that he irritated her when he decided to converse in the company of others.</p><p>Unaware of Bartholomew casually and handsomely draped upon a bar stool near Katie, Marty Jenkins, local pirate entertainer, came to her side. \u201cWill you play a sea-shanty disc for me, Katie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Marty,\u201d she said.</p><p>He handed her his disc and she slid it into her system. \u201cNo words can come up on the screen, Marty. But you don\u2019t need them, right?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cGearing up for the next pirate show, my sweet. No words needed. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone will love it, Marty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I heard you bought the old wax museum, Katie,\u201d Marty said.</p><p>\u201cMarty, it\u2019s not a wax museum. It\u2019s full of robotics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that supposed to mean that they all move?\u201d Marty asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe that they all can move. They\u2019re just not operating right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, none of them work, from what I understand.\u201d Marty wagged a finger at her. \u201cThat place has been closed down for five years now. Craig Beckett tried to keep it going after that girl\u2019s body was found, but he threw in the towel. If you can get your money back, young lady, you ought to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to open it, Marty. I loved the place when I was a little kid,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cThey say it\u2019s haunted, and not haunted by good. You know what happened there. Murder!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very sad, and a long time ago, Marty. What happened was tragic-some idiot making use of someone else\u2019s dream for a dramatic effect, but it\u2019s all in the past now. I\u2019ll be all right, Marty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never caught the killer, missy,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m thinking that the killer moved on, Marty. Nothing like it has happened again.\u201d</p><p>Still shaking his head, Marty left her.</p><p>\u201cI think he must be right. It doesn\u2019t sound like a good place to be,\u201d Bartholomew informed her, leaning near and whispering, though why he whispered, she didn\u2019t know. \u201cHey! That man is still behaving in a rude and disrespectful way toward Clarinda. Should I do something about it?\u201d</p><p>Katie grated her teeth and looked toward the bar and the revenant of the man who stood next to her. She was sure that to the rest of the people present, there was nothing to be seen.</p><p>Or heard.</p><p>She lowered her head and spoke in an intense whisper. \u201cBartholomew, if you wish to maintain a mortal friend, I entreat you to cease and desist-shut up! You make me appear unbalanced, talking to myself all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat chap is an utter ass,\u201d Bartholomew protested. \u201cOh, and there she goes again, out on the street.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked up. She couldn\u2019t help herself.</p><p>It was true. A woman in white was walking along the sidewalk, staring straight ahead. She was in a Victorian white dress, and she knotted a handkerchief in her hands. She looked so sad that Katie felt a pang in her heart, and she bit her lower lip to remind herself that it was a curse seeing ghosts, that she couldn\u2019t become involved with all of them-there were simply too many in Key West-and that the woman was long dead and needed only to discover some kind of inner peace to move on.</p><p>\u201cShe haunts me so,\u201d Bartholomew said. He grimaced. \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked around as Bartholomew chuckled. His long-dead state did not seem to dampen his good spirits. He\u2019d been an adventurer in life-and a privateer, not a pirate!-and his sense of curiosity and longing for new experiences had not deserted him in death. He stared at Katie. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know who she is? And she won\u2019t talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never has,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Bartholomew warned.</p><p>She realized Clarinda was staring at her with concern in her eyes.</p><p>Katie knew that thus far in her life, only she seemed to be blessed by Bartholomew\u2019s presence.</p><p>He was quite the dandy. His shoes were buckled and bore heels, his hose didn\u2019t display a single knot and his breeches were impeccable. He wore a ruffled shirt, red vest and black jacket. His hair was jet-black and neatly queued beneath his tricornered hat. She knew he was especially fond of the Pirates in Paradise festival himself, and he insisted that they spend their time watching the musicians and joining in with the festivities because he loved to comment on the modern-day pirates roaming Key West.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Clarinda asked, coming back up to Katie\u2019s equipment stand and sidling around to stand next to her chair. \u201cYou\u2019re talking to yourself again,\u201d she warned. \u201cOne of the fellows over there wanted to buy you a drink. He thought you were already well on the way.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked over to the group where her would-be admirer was sitting. She frowned, recognizing the man, but not knowing why. \u201cI don\u2019t want a drink-thank him for me. I was singing under my breath to the song, that\u2019s all. Clarinda, who is that guy?\u201d</p><p>Clarinda turned and waved a hand. The fellow shrugged. He had tawny-blond hair, a neatly trimmed beard and mustache, and appeared to be in his midthirties. He was so familiar, and not anyone she saw on a daily basis.</p><p>\u201cHe does look-like we should know him, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a local,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s on the news-or a fishing show, or something like that,\u201d Clarinda suggested.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s not make enemies. Tell him thanks for me but no thanks, and that I don\u2019t drink when I work. I was just humming and halfway singing along with the music,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. And don\u2019t worry. I already told him that you didn\u2019t drink while you were working. He said all karaoke hosts drank. I said you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Just be pleasant to him. I can always take care of myself, honestly,\u201d Katie assured her.</p><p>\u201cIndeed! Because I\u2019m at your side,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cAnd I can take my cutlass to any rat bastard\u2019s throat.\u201d</p><p>Katie glared at him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, so I can\u2019t master a sword anymore. I can trip the bastard,\u201d Bartholomew assured her. \u201cI\u2019m quite an accomplished trip artist for a ghost, if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s lovely?\u201d Clarinda asked.</p><p>\u201cThat it\u2019s finally near closing time. Marty is about to come up. Oh, and it\u2019s thinning out, so...ah! I know what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, I do not sing-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be fine,\u201d Katie assured her. As she walked back to check on the state of her customers, Katie turned to Bartholomew. \u201cHush until I\u2019m done here tonight, do you hear me? What fun will you have if they lock me up for insanity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? In modern-day Key West? Oh, posh. I\u2019ve yet to see an even semisane person living in or visiting the place,\u201d Bartholomew protested.</p><p>\u201cShut up now, and I mean it!\u201d Katie warned.</p><p>Of course, what she could possibly do to him-how to really threaten a ghost-she didn\u2019t know herself. She\u2019d been plagued for years and years by...whatever it was that allowed her to see those who had \u201ccrossed the veil into the light,\u201d as many seemed to term it.</p><p>Bartholomew sniffed indignantly and went to lean against the bar, his sense of humor returning as he crossed his arms over his chest and indulged in eavesdropping on everyone around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soon after, Marty went up to do his new song, the crowd, a mix of locals and tourists, went wild and he invited everyone down for Fantasy Fest. Someone asked him about Fantasy Fest and Marty explained that it was kind of like Mardi Gras-a king and queen were elected-and kind of like Halloween, and kind of like the biggest, wildest party anyone could think of. Costumes, parties and special events all around the city. There was a parade with dressed up pets-and undressed people in body paint. It was fabulous, a feast and pure fantasy for the heart and the imagination.</p><p>He was proud of himself for his explanation. The next person asked about Pirates in Paradise, and Marty looked troubled. After thinking he said that it was kind of like Fantasy Fest but not-there were pirate parties, pirate encampments, historical demonstrations-and heck, a lot of swaggering and grog drinking, but people were welcome to wear costumes. They could see a mock trial of Anne Bonny, they could learn so much-and run around, saying arrgh, avast and ahoy all day if they liked.</p><p>When the crowd finally began to thin around 3:00 a.m., Katie and Clarinda did a song together from Jekyll and Hyde, despite Clarinda\u2019s objections. Her friend had a lovely, strong voice but didn\u2019t believe it; she would only go up late at night and when it was fairly quiet, and only with Katie.</p> <p>The bar didn\u2019t close up until 4:00 a.m., but Katie ended her karaoke at three, giving folks time to finish up and pay their bar tabs. After she had secured her equipment for the night-she only had to see that the karaoke computer and all her amps were covered and that her good microphones were locked away-she was ready to head home and to sleep. Clarinda stopped her at the door. \u201cHey, Jonas is coming by for me in an hour or so. We\u2019ll walk you home. Hang around.\u201d</p><p>Katie shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine, honestly. I grew up here, remember? I know how to avoid drunks and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe actually get gangs down here now, you know,\u201d Clarinda said firmly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going straight home. I\u2019ll take Simonton, I won\u2019t walk on Duval. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Clarinda remained unhappy, but Katie had no intention of being swayed. Her uncle was up in St. Augustine, and Jon Merrillo was managing the bar, so she intended to slip out without being stopped by anyone. On Saturday, she would officially take ownership of the Beckett family\u2019s myth-and-legends museum, and she was tense and wanted to be anywhere but at work. \u201cYou watch yourself with those drunks!\u201d she warned.</p> <p>\u201cOh, honey, if there\u2019s one thing I learned while you were away at school, it\u2019s how to handle drunks. Oh, wait! We both knew how to manage that before you left. Go. I\u2019ll be fine. And Jonas will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>Waving and clutching her carryall, Katie left the bar.</p><p>At 3:00 a.m., Duval Street was far from closed down. She wondered with a quirk of humor what DuVal-the first governor of territorial Florida-would have thought of the street named in his honor.</p><p>Certainly, it kept the name from being forgotten.</p><p>Key West was filled with history that shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. The name itself was a bastardization of Cayo Hueso, Island of Bones, and came from the fact that hueso had sounded like west to the English-speaking British who had claimed the state from the Spaniards. The name fit because it was the most western of the Islands of the Martyrs, which was what the chain of Florida \u201ckeys\u201d had been known as to the Spanish. Actually, the Islands of the Dry Tortugas were farther west, but the name had been given, and it had stuck. Street names came from the early Americans-Simonton and his friends, colleagues and their families. Simonton had purchased Key West from a Spaniard named Salas when Florida had become an American territory. Salas had received the island as a gift-or back payment for a debt-from the Spanish governor who had ruled before the American governor. The island had seen British rule as well, and often, no matter who ruled, it wasn\u2019t ruled much at all.</p><p>The place was colorful, throughout history, and now.</p> <p>\u201cYou do love this place,\u201d Bartholomew noted as he walked alongside her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s home. If you\u2019re used to the beautiful fall colors in Massachusetts, that\u2019s home. Down here, it\u2019s the water, and the craziness. Yes, I do love it.\u201d</p><p>She stopped walking and stared across Simonton, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bartholomew asked her. \u201cI see nothing. Not even the beauty in white who frets so night after night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLights? They\u2019re everywhere, and trust me, I can remember when they weren\u2019t,\u201d Bartholomew told her.</p><p>\u201cNo! There are lights on in the entry at the old Beckett museum. My museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t officially own it until Saturday, or so you said.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight, I have a meeting at the bank on Saturday- Liam is going to come and help me-and I sign the final papers, but...\u201d</p><p>There shouldn\u2019t have been anyone in the museum. Craig Beckett had passed away at eighty-eight almost a year ago, a dear man, one who might have lived forever. His health had been excellent. But his life had existed around a true love affair. When Leandra, his wife of sixty-plus years had passed away, he had never quite recovered. He hadn\u2019t taken a pistol to his head or an overdose of prescription medication, he had simply lost his love for life. Liam Beckett, a friend of Katie\u2019s since she had come back-they hadn\u2019t been friends before, since Liam had graduated high school before she had started-had been the assumed executor of the estate, and he\u2019d planned to tear the museum down rather than invest in repairing it. The place hadn\u2019t been open in years; Katie had loved it as a child, and she had long dreamed of reopening it. She had talked Liam into agreeing. David Beckett, Liam\u2019s cousin and coexecutor of the estate, hadn\u2019t actually corresponded about the matter yet. He\u2019d been working in Africa, Asia, Australia or somewhere far away for the past few years, and Liam was convinced that David wouldn\u2019t care one way or another what happened to the place. It was unlikely he would remain in the Keys if he actually returned at all. Since David had left, almost ten years ago, he had never wanted to come home.</p><p>His former fianc\u00e9e, the great love of his life at the time, even though she had left him, had been murdered. Strangled. She was left there, in the family museum, posed in position as the legendary Elena Milagro de Hoyos.</p><p>He\u2019d been under suspicion. He\u2019d had an alibi-his grandparents. That alibi had made some people suspicious. After all, what would his grandparents say? But he hadn\u2019t run; he had waited through the beginning of the investigation, he had stayed in town until the case had gone cold and then he had left, never to return.</p><p>Katie knew that some people thought that he should have been further investigated. She remembered him, but just vaguely. He\u2019d been a big high-school sports star down here. Sean, her brother, had also loved sports. He was older and knew David Beckett better.</p><p>Curious, Katie crossed the street. It was quiet; street-lamps illuminated the road itself, but here on Simonton the revelry taking place still on Duval was muted and seemed far away. She stared up at the building that housed the Beckett family museum.</p><p>Originally, she knew, it hadn\u2019t been chosen for any historical reason. The house was built in the late eighteen-fifties by Perry Shane. Shane had deserted it to fight for the Federals back in his native New Jersey. For years afterward, the house had just been one of many old places that needed work. The Beckett family had purchased it in the twenties because it had been cheap, a seventy-year-old fixer-upper. Now it was one of the grand dames of the street, mid-Victorian, boasting wraparound porches on both the first and second floors, and around the attic garret, a widow\u2019s walk. Kate didn\u2019t think anyone had ever really been able to see the water and incoming ships from the walk, but it had been a fashionable addition to the house at the time it had been built.</p><p>Once, it had offered six bedrooms on the second floor and two in the attic. Downstairs had been the parlor, library, dining room, office and pantry. The kitchen had been out back about twenty feet away. There was also a carriage house. Now, when you entered through the front door, the gate and turnstiles were positioned there. The tour began on the second floor and wound around through the rooms, brought visitors down the servants\u2019 stairway to the first floor and then around once again, back to the front.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bartholomew demanded, following her.</p><p>\u201cI want to know why there\u2019s a light on,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cBecause someone is in there. And you don\u2019t own it yet. It could be someone dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be frat boys on a lark, and I\u2019m getting them out of there before they do damage to the place. Craig Beckett might have closed it down a few years ago, but it still has all of the exhibits in place,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not a frat boy?\u201d Bartholomew protested. \u201cKatie, don\u2019t go in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with me. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie! Awake and see the sunrise, lass! Me-ghost. I love to remember the days when I was strong and tough and could defend a girl with certainty and vigor. If you get into real trouble because the place is being pilfered or plundered by a criminal-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBartholomew, what thief turns on the lights?\u201d Katie demanded.</p><p>Bartholomew groaned. \u201cA drunk one? Katie-!\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew groaned. Katie had jumped the low white-picket gate that surrounded the place.</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder, murder most foul!\u201d Bartholomew cried.</p><p>He\u2019d always been fond of quoting and paraphrasing Shakespeare.</p><p>\u201cMurderers do not turn the lights on!\u201d she tossed over her shoulder in return.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he demanded</p><p>She ignored him and walked up the limestone path that led to broad steps to the porch and the door.</p><p>She felt him close behind her.</p><p>Was she crazy? No! This was about to be her place, and she could speed-dial the police in two seconds. She wasn\u2019t going in with lights blazing; she would see what was going on by lurking in the darkness. She knew the place.</p><p>At the door she paused. She reached for the knob and as she did so, the door opened, creaking a bit, as if it had been pushed by a sudden wind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did not do that!\u201d Bartholomew whispered.</p><p>She shook her head impatiently and stepped in.</p><p>The once beautiful hardwood floors did need work, she noticed. Workmen had been in and out through the years, and their boots had done some damage. The gate area still boasted an old-fashioned cash register, but the mahogany desk, where an attendant sold tickets, was beautiful. It had been bought from an auctioneer and had once been the captain\u2019s desk in an old sailing ship. The swivel chair behind it was equally old, handsome and still comfortable. Katie was familiar with everything; she had walked through with Liam Beckett just a few days earlier.</p> <p>The light that she had seen from the street had come from the entry. It was the muted light of the foyer\u2019s chandelier, and it cast a gentle glow over the place.</p><p>Katie opened her mouth, about to call out, but she didn\u2019t. She chose not to twist the turnstile-the noise here would be like an explosion. She sat atop the old mahogany desk and swung her legs around, then stepped to the other side.</p><p>Looking up was eerie. Figures of Papa Hemingway and his second wife, Pauline, were posed coming down the stairway. They had always been a big hit at the museum, with eighty percent of those going through the place having their pictures taken with the pair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare go up those stairs,\u201d Bartholomew commanded sternly.</p><p>Katie almost smiled, grinning at him. \u201cBartholomew, you\u2019re scared. A ghost can\u2019t be scared. My God, Bartholomew. You were a pirate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrivateer. My boat was authorized by the government,\u201d Bartholomew corrected irritably. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be ridiculous, I\u2019m not frightened. Yes, wait, I am frightened for you, foolish girl. What is the matter with you? I know your family taught you better. Innocent young ladies do not wander into dark alleys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a dark alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s worse. You can get trapped in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going upstairs,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>She walked to the side, realizing that she was going in the wrong historical order. She wasn\u2019t going up the stairs; she just wanted to see what was going on.</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d Bartholomew warned, following her.</p> <p>She turned and stared at him. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m going to be scared silly? I\u2019m going to see ghosts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts will seldom hurt you. Living people, bad people, criminals, rapists, murderers and thieves-they will hurt you,\u201d Bartholomew said sternly.</p><p>\u201cJust one more minute... We\u2019ll check out the downstairs, and I\u2019ll call the cops. Or Liam. Liam is a cop. All right? I just don\u2019t want to cry wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to create an alarm when there\u2019s no need. Maybe Liam was here earlier and left the light on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the door open?\u201d Bartholomew said doubtfully.</p><p>Katie shrugged.</p><p>She walked to the left, where the tour began once visitors reached the first floor. The first room offered one of Key West\u2019s most dramatic tales-the doll story. As a little boy, Robert Eugene Otto had been given a very creepy doll, supposedly cursed by an angry family servant who knew something about voodoo. Robert Eugene Otto became obsessed with the doll, even naming it Robert, after himself. Robert the Doll moved about the house and played pranks. In later years he drove the real Robert\u2019s wife quite crazy.</p> <p>From the somewhat psychotic, the history in the museum became sad and grimly real with a memorial to the sailors who had died aboard the battleship Maine when it had exploded in Havana Harbor in 1898. The museum\u2019s exhibit showed sailors working on the ship. From there, curtains segued into an area where dancers moved about at the Silver Slipper. World War I came and went. Prohibition arrived, and bootleg alcohol made its way in an easy flow from Havana to Key West.</p><p>A pathway through the pantry in back led around to the other side of the house. It was dark, with little light from the glow in the foyer seeping through. Papa Hemingway made another appearance as 1931 rolled in and Pauline\u2019s uncle bought them the house on Whitehead Street as a wedding present.</p><p>Katie knew what she was coming up to-the exhibit on Count von Cosel and Elena de Hoyos. Just a small piece of the museum, really, in a curtained sector through an archway. It had always been a popular exhibit. Until, of course, the re-created figure of poor Elena had been replaced by the strangled body of a young Conch woman. The beginning of the end.</p><p>People liked the bizarre, the romance and even the tragedy of history, but with this event fear had suddenly come too close. It was one thing to be eccentric in the Keys.</p><p>Real violence was not welcome.</p><p>There was more, she thought, so much more, to the museum. It was sad, really, that the story got so much attention.</p><p>There was fun history. Sloppy Joe moving his entire bar across the street in the middle of the night, angry over a hike in his rent. Tennessee Williams, working away at La Concha Hotel, penning the words of his play A Streetcar Named Desire. Another war, soldiers and sailors, the roadblocks that caused Key West to secede and become, if only for hours, the Conch Republic.</p><p>The rest of history paled beside the story of von Cosel and Elena. So it had always been.</p><p>Morbid curiosity. Had he really slept with the corpse? Ooh, Lord, disgusting! How?</p><p>Katie knew the story, of course. She\u2019d heard it all her life. She\u2019d retold it at college a dozen times, with friends denying the truth of it until they looked it up on the Internet. It was tragic, it was sad, it was sick, but it always drew people.</p><p>As it had tonight. She put her hand out to draw back the curtain leading to the exhibit.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Katie, don\u2019t!\u201d Bartholomew whispered.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment.</p><p>She was suddenly terrified that she would draw back the curtain-and stumble upon a corpse herself.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>She had to draw back the curtain.</p><p>She did so, and screamed.</p><p>2</p><p>David nearly jumped, he was so startled by the sudden scream.</p><p>That irritated him. Greatly. He was thirty-two, a veteran of foreign action and a professional who trekked through the wilds and jungles of the world.</p><p>He was not supposed to jump at the sound of a silly girl\u2019s scream.</p><p>Of course, it had been stupid to come here. He had thought that he\u2019d come back just to sign whatever papers he needed to settle his grandfather\u2019s estate. But he had come home. And no way out of it-the past had called to him. No matter how far he had gone, he had been haunted by that night. He\u2019d had to come here.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d expected to find.</p><p>There were no fresh corpses in the old museum.</p><p>Elena Milagro de Hoyos rested in robotic finery-as sadly as she had, years ago, at the real funeral parlor.</p><p>But he could remember the night they had found Tanya. He could remember it as if it had been yesterday.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been killed here, she had been brought here. She had been positioned for the shock value. It was something certain killers did. This fellow wanted to enjoy his sadistic exploits and wanted his handiwork to be discovered.</p><p>The killer had never been caught. No clues, no profile had ever led anyone anywhere, even when the local police had pulled in the FBI. There hadn\u2019t been a fiber, a speck of DNA, not a single skin cell to be analyzed. That meant that the killer had been organized. The Keys had even braced for a wave of such murders, because such killers usually kept killing. But it seemed that Tanya\u2019s murder had been a lone incident. Despite the fact that he had been cleared, he had been the only person ever actually under suspicion, no matter how they worded it.</p><p>The Keys hadn\u2019t been crime-free by any means. Accidents occurred far too frequently because people overimbibed and still thought they\u2019d be fine on the highway-often two-lane only-that led back to the mainland. Crosses along the way warned travelers of places where others had died, and the police could be fierce on speeders, but deaths still happened. Gangs were coming in, just as elsewhere, but they were seldom seen in the usual tourist mainstream on Duval Street. Domestic violence was always a problem, and now and then, as Liam seemed to believe, \u201coutsiders\u201d came into the state to commit their crimes.</p><p>But there was nothing like the strangulation death and bizarre display of Tanya Barnard. Not in the decade since David had been gone.</p><p>When it had happened, Craig Beckett had tried to hold his head high. He knew, of course, that his grandson was innocent because they had been together during the time it had happened-only a small window of opportunity. The museum had closed late on Friday night because there had been a festival in the city-and Craig Beckett had agreed with his fellows in the business association that his museum should remain open until midnight. David had come in with the first tour just after nine the next morning.</p><p>And Tanya\u2019s body had been discovered.</p><p>David understood that, to many, he might well appear guilty as all hell.</p><p>But he had an alibi.</p><p>He\u2019d been at the museum the night before, filling in for Danny Zigler then, too. But it was a small museum. It was only open for tours. There had been times between tours, people reckoned, when he might have slipped out. Or, according to others, the coroner might have been wrong. He might have left the museum and gone to quickly kill Tanya before returning home.</p><p>Think about it. Just how long did it take for a tall, muscular man to strangle the life out of a small, trusting woman?</p><p>Luckily, the coroner wouldn\u2019t be called wrong. He insisted on the time of Tanya\u2019s death.</p><p>And there were enough tourists to swear that David couldn\u2019t have gone far in between the tours.</p><p>And after? David and his grandfather had stayed up until nearly four, engaged in a chess match. Then they\u2019d even fallen asleep watching a movie in the den; his grandmother had come in to throw blankets over the two of them. By seven in the morning, the family had been engaged in breakfast. David knew many people believed that his grandparents had just been covering for him, but the one thing that gave David strength was the fact that he had been with his grandparents, and they did know that he was innocent.</p><p>Craig had tried to maintain the museum. But when everyone coming in had wanted to know about Tanya and little else about the history of the island, he had given it up at last. He had cared for the place, but he had closed its doors to the public. He had dreamed of the right time to reopen it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now his grandfather was gone. They would never reopen the museum. Tomorrow, he\u2019d talk to Liam about selling off the characters. He knew many were made with fine craftsmanship and were valuable. Then work could be done to restore the house, and it would definitely be a valuable commodity.</p><p>So what the hell was he doing here himself?</p><p>He\u2019d had to come. And he\u2019d found himself staring at the exhibit, wishing he remembered more about Tanya and yet aware that the sight of her on Elena\u2019s bed was permanently embedded in his memory. Nothing of the girl herself. Everything about the horror of her death.</p> <p>And now, this girl, standing there staring at him, her scream just an echo in their minds.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you and what in hell are you doing here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>The girl flushed. She was an exceptionally attractive young woman, early to midtwenties, with deep auburn hair, long and loose down her back, and, even in the muted light, eyes so startlingly hazel they seemed to be gold. Her features were cleanly cut and beautiful, and her body, clad in jeans and a T-shirt that advertised a local bar, was lean and well formed. There was something familiar about her, but he wasn\u2019t sure what or why.</p><p>She stared at him, obviously recovering herself. Her cheeks were red at first, but then she appeared to be angry, as well.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, and what the hell are you doing here?\u201d she demanded in return.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me-I asked who you are, and what in hell you\u2019re doing here,\u201d she said, an edge of real anger in her voice.</p><p>He stared at her incredulously.</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo! Are you?\u201d</p><p>He walked around from the rear of the exhibit to accost her. She stepped back warily, as if ready to run out of the room.</p> <p>Good. He was tempted to come closer and shout, \u201cBoo!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because I own the place,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re trespassing. You have about two seconds to get out of here, and then I\u2019m going to call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are absolutely full of it,\u201d she told him. \u201cI own this place.\u201d</p><p>Again, he was startled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said harshly, \u201cand I\u2019m tired of the joke. This place is owned by the Beckett family, and it\u2019s not for sale-yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeckett!\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cBeckett, yes. The name that you see on the marquis outside. B-E-C-K-E-T-T. This museum has been the property of my family for decades. I\u2019m David Beckett. It is four in the morning and I\u2019m wondering what you are doing here at this time. I actually belong here-at any hour. Now, if you please, get out.\u201d He spoke evenly, almost pleasantly. But he meant the get out.</p> <p>It seemed now, after hearing his name, as if the young woman facing him had changed her attitude suddenly. She seemed to back away. I\u2019m a Beckett. Oh, yeah, David Beckett. Person of interest! he almost shouted.</p><p>It had been ten years since he had left, determined that he wouldn\u2019t let the past follow him, not when he was innocent, not when someone else had taken his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s life, long after she had taken leave of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry; I should have known,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, we\u2019ve met. It was years ago, but I should have known, you do look a lot like Liam. I\u2019m Katie-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are,\u201d he said, startled by his abrupt rudeness. He shook his head. \u201cJust get out. It\u2019s private property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I believe that I do own this place. I just have a few last papers to sign on Saturday. Tomorrow. Liam is, after all, Craig\u2019s executor-okay, you both are, if I understand it right, and you\u2019d told him to go ahead and act in his absence. Liam was ready to sell.\u201d</p><p>David frowned.</p><p>Sell? Never. Not the museum. The museum needed to be dismantled, taken apart. He wasn\u2019t superstitious, he didn\u2019t believe in curses. But this place held a miasma. There was something that appeared to be evil in the robotics. The faces were too lifelike. The ones that moved didn\u2019t jerk about-they looked like the real thing from a distance.</p><p>They invited idiots and drunks and psychotics to behave insanely. Commit murder, and leave the corpses behind, far more fragile than the imitations that might survive many decades.</p><p>David shook his head, feeling a twinge less hostile. He still couldn\u2019t really figure out who in hell the girl was, but, at least she wasn\u2019t a drunken tourist who had stumbled in. A Northerner, probably. Someone who had come to Key West convinced it was not only a sunny Eden, but a place to make a good few bucks off the spending habits of vacationers. But she\u2019d said that they\u2019d met?</p><p>\u201cWhatever you might have thought, whatever you might have come to believe, the museum is not and will never be for sale. If it\u2019s the house you\u2019re interested in, it may come up on the market in a year or so,\u201d David said flatly.</p><p>She stared at him steadily. Now it seemed that she was the hostile one. \u201cSo, you\u2019re David Beckett, suddenly home and taking interest in the family-and the family property. How nice. Perhaps you should speak with the lawyers. I believe that the sale has gone through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Miss-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine O\u2019Hara, and don\u2019t be superior with me, because my family has been down here as long as yours-or longer. I hope that you\u2019re wrong, and that this sale can go through. I love what your family created. This is a beautiful place, and your grandfather and great-grandfather did such a fabulous job showing history, the simple, true and the bizarre. I don\u2019t understand...\u201d</p><p>Her voice had trailed as she stared at him. She looked nervous suddenly.</p><p>Was she thinking that no matter what the newspapers or police had said, he might be a murderer? A very sick one at that, setting a corpse into an historical tableau?</p><p>After all, she had said that her family had been here forever, and yes, he did know of O\u2019Haras who were longtime residents, but...</p><p>\u201cKatie O\u2019Hara?\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>\u201cYes, I just introduced myself,\u201d she said with aggravation.</p><p>\u201cSean\u2019s little sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean\u2019s sister, yes,\u201d she said. She left out the \u201clittle,\u201d her aggravation apparently growing.</p><p>\u201cSean doesn\u2019t have any part of this, does he?\u201d His tone was sharper than he had intended.</p><p>\u201cMy brother is working in the South China Sea right now, filming a documentary, and no, he has nothing to do with this. But I don\u2019t see what-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Look, nothing has anything to do with anything. This place will never be a museum again, and I\u2019m pretty damned sure you just looked at me and remembered why I feel that way.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled, as if steeling herself to speak patiently. \u201cSomething terrible happened. You were cleared. Your grandfather closed the place, but he always wanted to reopen it. We will never rid the world of psychos. I intend to have security, and locks and make sure that nothing so terrible could ever happen again,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He leaned back against the wall, arms crossed over his chest, and stared at her incredulously. \u201cAnd a bunch of frat-boy idiots wouldn\u2019t try to put a blonde mannequin in here, ever, or suggest that you do a mock-up tableau of Elena with Tanya\u2019s body? Haven\u2019t you ever watched those horror movies with parts one, two, three, four, five and so on, where the same stupid people keep going to the same stupid, dark woods to wind up dead? What if the psycho who did it is still hanging in the Keys? What do you think of that kind of temptation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let it happen. All people are not horrible, and it\u2019s a wonderful museum. I\u2019ve worked really long and hard-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You must be all of what now, twenty-two, twenty-three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four, and that\u2019s hardly relevant. I already have my own business-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie? Katie O\u2019Hara?\u201d He laughed suddenly. \u201cKatie-oke! That\u2019s your business?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened and her face became an ice mask. \u201cFor your information, Mr. Beckett, karaoke is big business these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your uncle\u2019s bar, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really have matured into a rather insufferable ass, Mr. Beckett,\u201d she said, her tone pleasant. \u201cI will leave. I\u2019ll see you with my attorneys tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you choose. Good night, Miss O\u2019Hara. And forgive me. I didn\u2019t mean to laugh at Sean\u2019s little sister.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cI really don\u2019t care, Mr. Beckett. And neither would Sean. We\u2019ve both worked hard and been responsible, and we make our way quite fine, thank you. And by the way, I never knew you were friends with my brother. Is he aware of the fact?\u201d</p><p>He laughed then. He had been an insufferable ass. It was this place. It was the possibility that it might be opened again.</p><p>It was him.</p><p>He had left here. He never hid his past. People knew about Tanya, about what had happened. But outside of this place, no one assumed that he had done it, that despite his honest and upright alibi, his entire family had lied to save him.</p><p>Being back here...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to be offensive. To you, Miss O\u2019Hara, and not to anyone\u2019s sister, younger or otherwise. However, the place is seriously not for sale. And my reasons are valid. I don\u2019t want to see history repeating itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see tomorrow,\u201d she said.</p><p>She moved away, but then turned back to him. \u201cI should have known you. Recognized you, I mean. Your grandfather talked about you all the time. Craig Beckett was a wonderful man.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised at how her remark seemed to sting. He had loved his grandfather-he didn\u2019t know anyone who hadn\u2019t liked and respected his grandfather. And he had seen him often over the years.</p><p>Just not in Key West.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, lowering his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve managed to make it back now, since you couldn\u2019t be here for the funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew my grandfather, Miss O\u2019Hara, you know that he didn\u2019t believe much in funerals-or in massive monuments to the dead, caskets worth thousands and thousands of dollars or any other such thing. Memories exist in the mind, he always told me. And love was something distance could never quell. So I am fine with my memories, and in my conscience.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you. Personally, I find a funeral a special time to remember and honor a loved one, but to each his own, of course. I\u2019ll get out of here, Mr. Beckett. I will see you tomorrow at the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>She was near the door. \u201cI take it you\u2019re not planning on staying in town long?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated again. \u201cThen what do you care?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI would keep it alive with the dignity it deserves,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for being so rude. You seriously startled me, being here. I really do apologize for any offense given.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded and turned to leave.</p><p>He watched her go. Sean\u2019s little sister. He and Sean had played high-school football together. She didn\u2019t remember, but he had been in her home. She\u2019d sported a head of almost orange-red hair back then, a lot of skinned and bruised knees and freckles that seemed to have faded now. She was definitely a striking young woman. She had unnerved him. He wasn\u2019t customarily such an ass, and didn\u2019t make light of the endeavors of others.</p><p>And yet, seriously...Katie-oke?</p><p>He started. It was suddenly cold-ice-cold-where he stood in the museum. He thought about the many sayings people had, such as, \u201cIt was as if a ghost walked right through me.\u201d It was as if he had been...shoved by something very cold. Well, ghosts didn\u2019t go around shoving people. Oh, and he didn\u2019t believe in ghosts.</p><p>He went about turning off the lights and, when he left, he locked the place securely.</p><p>\u201cI gave him a good comeuppance,\u201d Bartholomew announced. \u201cA strong right hook, right on the fellow\u2019s jaw. And I could swear he felt it. All right, all right, so he didn\u2019t crash down on the floor in a knockout, but I\u2019d swear he knew he\u2019d been given a licking of one kind or another.\u201d</p> <p>Katie waved a hand in the air, distracted. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. No one thought that he\u2019d even come home. He was supposed to stay off in Africa, Asia or Australia, or wherever it was that he was working. Why? Why? He\u2019s got to be wrong on this. Liam was certain that he could go through with the sale, that David despised the place and never intended to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Yes, I would defend you to the death against such an oaf. Oh, wait. I am dead. And still, my dear, I did my best.\u201d</p><p>Katie had offended Bartholomew, she realized. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry, Bartholomew. I\u2019m sure you sprang instantly to my defense, and I deeply appreciate your efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will keep trying. As long as that man is in the city, I swear, I will keep trying,\u201d Bartholomew promised.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. He doesn\u2019t want to be here. He plans on living elsewhere forever and ever,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>She realized that he was silent then.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been here in ten years, Bartholomew. He doesn\u2019t care about the place, and I don\u2019t care what he said, he showed no respect, not making it home for his grandfather\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they couldn\u2019t locate him-since he was off somewhere,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing up for him?\u201d she asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cNo, no...his behavior to a lady was reprehensible, abominable!\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cCompletely unacceptable. Except...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept what?\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew looked at her, appeared to take a deep breath and said, \u201cI think, in a way, I understand his feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never let anything horrible like that happen again,\u201d Katie protested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they expected it to happen the first time,\u201d Bartholomew told her.</p><p>\u201cBut they weren\u2019t aware of what might happen. I\u2019d be way ahead. And please, we don\u2019t have murderers crawling through the city, visiting the museums on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the least, though, you should understand his feelings. If I know the story right, he was engaged to the girl. And she was found dead, right where you came upon him tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they were engaged anymore,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd there the point. Motive for murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think that he did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I don\u2019t think so. But a ruined romance? That\u2019s a motive for murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re watching too much TV,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cHmm. TV. Such an amazing and wonderful invention. So vastly entertaining!\u201d Bartholomew agreed. \u201cBut it\u2019s true. He was a spurned lover. That\u2019s a motive. She was leaving him. For a brute of a game-playing fellow. That is, by any reckoning, definitely a motive for murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was cleared,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t arrested or prosecuted. He had an alibi. His alibi, however, was his family.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him sharply. \u201cI thought you just said that you didn\u2019t think that he murdered her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. No. No, I don\u2019t think he killed her. He was rude, but I know many a fine fellow who can actually be rude. But murder, especially such a crime of passion-he doesn\u2019t look the type. He seems to be the type who easily attracts women, and therefore, he might have been heartbroken, but he would have moved on. I mean, that\u2019s the way I see it. The man is-appears to be, at least-a man\u2019s man. He could completely lose his temper and engage in a rowdy bar fight, maybe, but murder... Ah! But then again, what does the type look like? Now, in my day, many a man looked the part of a cutthroat and a thief-because he was one. But these days...ah, well. We did come upon him at the scene of the crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t actually the scene of the crime. She was strangled, but the police believe she was killed elsewhere and brought to the museum. I was a child when it all happened. Well, a teenager, at any rate, and it was a scandal, and I know it disturbed Sean... I vaguely remember that he and David Beckett were...friends. They both loved sports, football, swim team, diving, fishing...all that. But then David left. And never came back. And the talk died down. Mainly, I believe, because everyone loved Craig Beckett. But if David Beckett is innocent, I really don\u2019t understand his position-or yours. And he\u2019s deserted Key West. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to admit, I rather admire the fact that he\u2019s so determined, especially because he doesn\u2019t want to stay here. He doesn\u2019t want to see anything like it happen again, whether it affects him or not. I\u2019ll still do my best to take him down for you, though!\u201d he vowed.</p><p>The streets here were quiet, with only the sound of distant, muted laughter coming to them now and again. Even that was infrequent now. The hour was growing late-or early.</p><p>They came to Katie\u2019s house. She\u2019d left lights on in the kitchen, parlor area and porch. The two-seater swing on the porch rocked gently in the breeze. She had a small-very small-patch of ground before the steps to the porch, but her hibiscus bushes were in bloom and they made the entry pretty.</p><p>Set in stained glass from the Tiffany era on the double doors, a Victorian lady and her gentleman friend sat properly, immortalized in timeless ovals.</p><p>Katie unlocked the door and stepped in. Her world was familiar. Her parents were now boating around the world, her brother would always be off filming another documentary and the house was hers. Certainly, her folks had given her a bargain price. But she had purchased it through a bank, she had come up with the down payment and she had never missed a mortgage payment.</p><p>She loved the house. She was delighted that she owned it, that she had kept it in the family.</p><p>And yet, as she stood there, she wondered about the years David Beckett had spent away. He had gone to exotic places. He had discovered the entire globe.</p><p>She\u2019d gone away, too, she reminded herself.</p><p>Right...all the way up the eastern seaboard!</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>She looked at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just realized that I\u2019ve made an island my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is it a good thing? Anyway, don\u2019t answer. I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to be at the bank bright and early.\u201d</p><p>She blew him a kiss. \u201cDon\u2019t go watching more television, Bartholomew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will stunt my growth? Make me die young?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She groaned and walked up the stairs.</p><p>He had been restless that night, all through the night.</p><p>That was the only reason he had been out walking.</p><p>And when he had been walking, he had seen the lights on at the museum.</p><p>And so, he had looked up at the old mansion, and he had stared.</p><p>There could only be one person who would be there tonight, only one person who would have gone in, turned on the lights. Someone with a right to be there.</p><p>Someone who knew it well. Beckett.</p><p>Silently, he cursed Beckett. The man shouldn\u2019t have come back. The past was the past; settled, over, accepted. Some believed it had been David Beckett, but that he was long gone and despicably above the law. Others believed that a psycho had come and was also long gone. It was over. It was part of the myth and legend of Key West.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have come back.</p><p>But he had.</p><p>He had seen Katie O\u2019Hara, seen her go in. He\u2019d heard the squeak of her scream, but he hadn\u2019t been alarmed. He\u2019d held his ground. Watched. Waited.</p><p>Then, he\u2019d seen her come out, and he\u2019d stepped quickly back into the shadows. He hadn\u2019t intended to be seen that night.</p><p>Katie had left in what appeared to be a fury.</p><p>She\u2019d thought she owned the place. But Beckett was back.</p><p>A few minutes later, Beckett had come out, and he\u2019d headed in the same direction but then turned down the street to the Beckett estate.</p><p>When Beckett was gone, he\u2019d followed Katie. He knew where she lived. He\u2019d walked, and stood in the shadows, and he\u2019d looked at her house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stayed, feeling time go by. No need to be here, staring up at the house in the darkness.</p><p>But he stayed, watching.</p><p>His fingers itched.</p> <p>He felt a bizarre fury growing inside of him.</p><p>And then he understood.</p><p>He felt the sudden temptation to let history repeat itself.</p><p>3</p><p>There was no meeting at the bank.</p> <p>Liam called her before eight.</p><p>Katie had set her alarm, but it wasn\u2019t set to go off for another thirty minutes. She was only a few blocks away from the bank, and she was capable of showering and dressing in less than fifteen minutes-a nice survival technique if you worked nights and wanted to maintain any kind of a daytime existence.</p><p>She groaned while she fumbled for her phone. She only kept a cell, but it was sitting on the bedside table and, naturally, she knocked it off as she went to answer it. She had to feel around on the floor to find it and answer it.</p><p>It was Liam.</p><p>\u201cLiam! I saw your cousin last night. He was in the house. And he said that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, I am so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-but-I thought you were the executor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoexecutor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was having you make decisions!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was acting solely while we all made an attempt to reach David. He was deep in the jungle. When he wrote, he told me to move along as I saw fit. But as you\u2019ve seen, he\u2019s back. Katie, this is all my fault. I thought that David would certainly be pleased to sell. I didn\u2019t know how he felt about the museum. I made a dozen decisions and he didn\u2019t have a problem with a thing, but...Katie...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all we needed to do today was sign the last papers,\u201d she said with dismay.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry, so very sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, Liam, I know it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not my fault David won\u2019t agree to sell, but I led you on. Katie, it\u2019s...go ahead. Please. Get mad at me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m mad at you. But your cousin is a jerk and an ass.\u201d</p><p>Liam was silent. She had forgotten that it was a close-knit family, and she understood because she would defend her brother until the stars ceased to shine.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m sorry, Liam,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Katie, no, it\u2019s all right. I know how disappointed you are. And I feel just terrible. Honestly. I can still try to persuade him, but I think I\u2019m going to lay off for a while now. Give him some time to realize that you are never going to make a mockery of anything that happened, sensationalize or make profit off the murder...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he believes?\u201d she asked, astonished.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s what he was afraid of at first. I know that he met you last night; he explained it this morning when he said we needed to stop the sale before we wasted everyone\u2019s time. Katie, I think he has a phobia that it could happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he said,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut-every museum down here has an exhibit that\u2019s dedicated to Elena and Count von Cosel. It could happen anywhere. How do we make him see that, and make him understand that...that what happened... Oh, I don\u2019t know. Ten years have gone by. The killer is dead, or living in another state, or in prison for another offense. I loved your grandfather, you know that. He fueled the dream in me, Liam. How do we make your cousin see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But for now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, it\u2019s off,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cYes. Forgive me, please. I am unworthy, but forgive me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, running her fingers through the tangle of her hair. She knew that Liam was really sorry, that he had wanted to see the museum opened. \u201cI forgive you. On one condition. As long as he\u2019s here, you help me. Quietly. Maybe he\u2019ll see that I\u2019m for real, and that... Oh, please! Why would the same thing happen again? Tanya was probably a random victim, and if someone had a grudge against the Becketts, well, David doesn\u2019t have an ex-fianc\u00e9e here anymore. You have to help me. We wait. But you are on my side, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I love the old museum. I just don\u2019t want to work it, manage it or maintain it. I thought you were perfect as a buyer. So we\u2019ll see, huh?\u201d</p><p>He said goodbye and hung up.</p><p>David Beckett walked into the police station and was surprised to be hailed by a number of his old classmates and not just his cousin, Liam. They seemed honestly glad to see him, though he would surely be a topic of conversation at their evening meals. He was back.</p><p>He greeted old friends warmly, and thanked those who commented on his camerawork for wildlife publications in the past few years. He was surprised that they knew what he did-still photographers rarely received much of the applause. He told friends who asked that there were safe places to photograph wild animals. You just had to develop a skill for knowing those places. \u201cJust like anything,\u201d he said, heading off to find not Liam, but Pete Dryer, the man who had been a fledgling patrolman when he had taken the fateful tour all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d Pete was behind a desk now. A lieutenant in the criminal investigation unit, he delved into the streets when serious crime had been committed. Key West had a low murder rate, statistically two persons a year. But Key West was vulnerable to drug runners, and in the past few years, the department had made firm headway against the narcotics invasion. Most of what was really bad in the Keys was related to drugs; big money was at stake, and many of the deaths that had been reported were associated with gangs or drugs.</p><p>David had been away, but he\u2019d kept up. Unconsciously, he\u2019d waited to hear about another bizarre murder-or that someone had finally solved what happened to Tanya.</p><p>Pete had gained weight. He was stout now, and his blond hair was turning white. He had a smile for David, and a warm embrace, indicating the chair in front of his desk.</p><p>David took it.</p><p>\u201cWow. You\u2019re really back here,\u201d Pete said. \u201cAny chance you\u2019re here to stay?\u201d</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not. But I haven\u2019t accepted any projects for the immediate future, so I\u2019ll be around for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. We\u2019re damned glad to have you here, for whatever time you stay. This is your home, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s my home. I haven\u2019t settled anywhere yet. Pete, I don\u2019t think I can settle anywhere. You know, my grandfather\u2019s death got me thinking about Tanya.\u201d</p><p>Pete shook his head sadly and looked down. \u201cDavid, I wish to God I could give you some kind of closure. We pursued everything we could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. The police pursued me,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cNot fair, David. Your alibi stood up. Craig Beckett was never any kind of a liar, so we all know you were with him-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the museum closed,\u201d David said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI believe the coroner-and the dozens of people who said you would not have possibly had the time to leave the museum between your tours. We know Tanya wasn\u2019t killed at the museum, and we all know too that you just weren\u2019t capable of doing that to anyone. Thing is, we just had nowhere to go. I wasn\u2019t in charge, but I remember. We went house-to-house. No one saw anyone go in. There wasn\u2019t a break-in. There was no clue as to where he strangled that girl. Now, if there had been blood, we might have been able to trace something somewhere-\u201d He paused, staring at David. \u201cWell, hell, now I didn\u2019t mean that I wanted that poor girl cut up or tortured, but...strangulation. He left no clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete, I want you to help me. I want to go back over everything.\u201d</p><p>Pete stared at him. He groaned. \u201cIt was all ten years ago, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Liam is a cop, a detective now-with the criminal investigation unit. Let him have the paperwork. Assign him to the murder as a cold-case file. Pete, give me something,\u201d David said. \u201cHell, I\u2019ve made a name for myself in the world. I\u2019m moving on fine. But this haunts me still, every damned day of my life, Pete.\u201d</p><p>David heard a noise behind him. He turned and Liam was there. His cousin was two years his junior, his hair was a lighter shade of brown but his eyes were the same color and he knew that most people realized quickly that they were related. David had never known his parents; they\u2019d died together in an automobile accident when he was a year old. He\u2019d lived with his grandparents, but Liam\u2019s mother and father had treated him like their own.</p><p>\u201cI can handle it,\u201d Liam said. \u201cCome on, Pete. You know I can take time to reopen the investigation. I can handle my cases, and I can handle an added-on cold case, as well. I\u2019ll keep it low profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t... Ah, it\u2019s a waste of manpower!\u201d Pete said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t fail in any way on anything else, and if I do, you pull it back. Pete, what the hell can it hurt?\u201d Liam demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou may be causing a truckload of trouble down here, you know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d David asked flatly. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for truth. Why would the truth disturb anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThing is, this fellow is probably long gone,\u201d Pete said. \u201cDavid, nothing else has happened. Nothing remotely similar has happened since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can it hurt? Look, let Liam reopen it as a cold case, and he\u2019ll only use his spare time. We\u2019ll keep it quiet. No other officers need to be involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell, fellows, as long as it\u2019s your time you intend to waste.\u201d Pete wagged a finger at Liam. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare neglect a thing, you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoud and clear,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you-don\u2019t you go doing anything illegal!\u201d Pete charged David.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d David said, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see about the files,\u201d Liam said, and left.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Pete,\u201d David told him.</p><p>He rose and left the office. He\u2019d intended on getting to the truth, one way or the other. But it was better having the blessing of the local cops. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heading out, he ran into Liam. His cousin started to speak, but David shook his head slightly and indicated the door.</p><p>Outside the station, Liam frowned handing David the files. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care to talk in front of anyone else,\u201d David told him.</p> <p>\u201cWhy? If you\u2019re on a hunt to solve a murder from the past, you\u2019re going to need lots of help, and we\u2019ll be questioning lots of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, you\u2019re the cop, yeah, and I\u2019m grateful. I want to keep it low profile. No big announcements that we\u2019re opening up the case again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...but actually reopening the case. Hell, you didn\u2019t even tell me that you were thinking of doing this-didn\u2019t warn me. I would have helped you talk to Pete. You\u2019re a civilian. You know he couldn\u2019t have given you any files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, which makes it good that you\u2019re a cop-in the right division.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded and looked away. \u201cI know you. You want to investigate on your own. It\u2019s a wild-goose chase, and you\u2019re worried about bringing in our cops. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause someone from this city killed Tanya, I\u2019m sure of it. Cops down here, they all think that they know everyone, and they\u2019ll be blinded to what they should be seeing. And I\u2019m not sure that any of the members of the old-boy network will be happy to discover that I\u2019m coming after one of their own.\u201d</p><p>Katie walked down the stairs, trying to swallow down her disappointment.</p><p>She\u2019d dreamed about owning the place for years. She\u2019d been sad for a while after talking to Liam but now she was ready to go to battle again.</p><p>As she came down the stairs, she was surprised to smell coffee. The timer hadn\u2019t been set to go off for another few minutes.</p><p>Bartholomew met her at the foot of the stairs. He looked grave, but as if he was trying not to smile, as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Katie. I heard you talking. And the bank is off-really, we both knew that it would be-and I\u2019m sorry. But...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it!\u201d he told her proudly. \u201cI did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you smell it? Coffee! I-I-managed to push the button on the coffeemaker. Katie, I moved something. Something tangible.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to be happy for him.</p><p>It was the start button on a coffeemaker!</p><p>But it was a start.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. Truly wonderful. And thank you. Coffee is excellent right now, and-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think a good grog would have suited me better, but for you-yes, coffee. And it\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>She continued to congratulate him as she walked to the large kitchen in back. Once it had been a bedroom and the kitchen had been the apartment in back. But now, it was all a kitchen, and a very nice one, state-of-the-art. Her mother had loved to cook.</p><p>She caught her reflection in the back of one of the pans hanging from an old ship\u2019s rack above the counter.</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>She was wearing an old Disney nightshirt tee and her abundant hair was in tangles all about her. Thank God Bartholomew never commented on her morning appearance.</p><p>\u201cNext, we need to work on me stepping out for the newspaper,\u201d he said somberly. \u201cGive the neighbors a terrible fright!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! And I was just thinking how kind you were, and how much of a gentleman you were proving to be-for a pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivateer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Katie said sweetly.</p><p>She opened the front door, coffee cup in hand, and stepped outside. She saw the paper on the little patch of ground to her right and headed to it.</p><p>But as she stooped down to retrieve it, she saw a hand ahead of hers.</p><p>\u201cAllow me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and stood quickly, staring at the man in her yard. The sudden bane of her existence.</p><p>David Beckett.</p><p>She stared at him, not sure if she was feeling ill, angry or simply surprised. He\u2019d just ruined her life. Well, that was an exaggeration, but he had destroyed her future plans and the dream she\u2019d harbored for years. And he was in her yard.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she said at last.</p><p>\u201cYour paper,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I was just walking. I got in last night, and I\u2019m seeing what hasn\u2019t changed and what has. Your house is the same, exactly the same, as I remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to give you something familiar, and happy to make you feel right at home,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>He grinned. By day, she was surprised to realize what a fine face he had. He had a look that was intense, as if the world around him was solemn. But when he smiled his grin broke the chiseled structure, and lightened his eyes. Without a smile, he was compelling-tall, well built, lithe, an outdoorsman with bronzed skin, honed muscles and the rugged appeal that went with it all. When he did pause to smile or laugh, there was an added dimension to him that was even more appealing; the man was sensual.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t admiring him, she decided. He\u2019d ruined her life, and he remembered her as a little kid. Sean\u2019s much younger sister.</p><p>\u201cI really wish you understood what I feel about the museum,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not out to destroy anyone\u2019s dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you managed anyway,\u201d she said. She remembered her apparel-and the fact that she looked like Simba on a very bad mane day.</p><p>They were both holding the newspaper. She tugged at it. \u201cThanks for my paper,\u201d she said. He released it immediately.</p><p>Behind her, she felt Bartholomew. \u201cHey, he\u2019s trying to be nice,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>She forced a rigid smile.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can talk him into seeing it all your way, remember?\u201d Bartholomew asked. \u201cInvite him in. I just made coffee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she snapped, not thinking.</p><p>David Beckett\u2019s dark brown brows arched high. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured. She cleared her throat and looked around. It was going to be a beautiful day. Hot, but with a really nice breeze coming through. \u201cI\u2019ve just brewed a pot of coffee, if you\u2019d like to come in.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you\u2019re welcome to come in,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind helping yourself for a moment and letting me run up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to try to convince me to sell the museum,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t be able to if you\u2019re really determined, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was actually headed to the Starbucks at La Concha. Sure, I\u2019d love a cup of coffee,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThen, please...\u201d She indicated the steps.</p><p>She came in behind him but headed straight for the stairs. \u201cGo ahead, help yourself. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>She showered, dressed and brushed her hair with the speed of light and came hurrying back down the stairs. Heading toward the kitchen, she stopped. David Beckett was sitting at the table in the breakfast nook, perusing the paper and sipping coffee.</p><p>Bartholomew was sitting across from him, one leg tossed casually over the other, his fingers laced around his knees as he observed David attentively.</p><p>David Beckett, of course, was oblivious to him.</p><p>\u201cThus far, he has perpetrated no evil deeds,\u201d Bartholomew said, immediately aware of Katie\u2019s presence and looking up at her.</p><p>She ignored him. She had gotten very good-most of the time-at ignoring his comments.</p><p>She poured herself a cup of coffee and came striding toward the table. Bartholomew instantly moved over to make room for her. She wasn\u2019t sure what ghosts felt when the living-or inanimate objects-went through them, but Bartholomew wasn\u2019t fond of being sat upon, she knew. A husky fellow at karaoke had sunk down upon his lap once, and Bartholomew\u2019s face had screwed into such an expression of distaste that Katie had quickly lowered her head to hide a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d She held her cup in both hands and sipped from it. \u201cLovely day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind I remember,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing while you\u2019re here?\u201d she asked him. \u201cYou did say you weren\u2019t staying.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t like to think of anything as permanent,\u201d he told her. \u201cI don\u2019t have fixed plans at the moment. I\u2019ll spend some time with Liam, and with my great-aunts. Alice and Esther. I believe you know them-everyone always seemed to, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Katie nodded. \u201cOf course. They don\u2019t spend much time in town, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, at the age of eighty, they still compete over their flowers. Oh, and they both enjoy volunteering at a few of the museums. But will you see them swigging down a pint or two at Sloppy Joe\u2019s? Probably not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man does seem to have a dry, pleasant and even self-deprecating sense of humor,\u201d Bartholomew commented.</p><p>Katie refused to glance his way.</p><p>\u201cSo, family time, eh?\u201d she queried.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd dismantling the museum?\u201d</p><p>He set his cup down. \u201cActually, I will get to that. In a month or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, immediately on your agenda? Are you planning on swilling down a few pints at Sloppy Joe\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI may. But that\u2019s not my main intent or purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to find out who did kill Tanya,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She frowned, so surprised that she just stared at him for long seconds. \u201cI...I don\u2019t see what you can discover now. It happened a decade ago. The police tried-very hard, I\u2019m certain-to find her killer. It\u2019s now ten years after the fact. How could you possibly find out something now that they couldn\u2019t discover then. And why would the killer have hung around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA random killer wasn\u2019t going to bring Tanya\u2019s corpse and leave it in our family museum,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it had nothing to do with it being your family\u2019s museum. Maybe he had just seen the Elena/Carl Tanzler tableau and decided it was the right place to leave a corpse. God knows, maybe he even thought that the body wouldn\u2019t be discovered.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have the files. Liam is a detective now. He\u2019s been given leave to reopen the case. It\u2019s time that it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never even had another suspect,\u201d Katie said. She bit her lip. She saw the slight tensing of his features. \u201cI mean, they never had a suspect at all-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were never really a suspect, were you?\u201d She flushed slightly, looking away. Of course he\u2019d been a suspect!</p><p>\u201cJust a \u2018person of interest,\u2019\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right-there was never another suspect. And there had to be a reason for that. Either the police continued to believe that I had done it, or they were protecting someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I intend to find out. Tanya deserves justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer family is long gone, you know,\u201d Katie told him.</p> <p>He nodded, looking away. \u201cI know. Her mother never recovered from what happened, but she came to see me, telling me that she knew I could have never done such a thing. I never saw her father, except at the funeral, and he took Tanya\u2019s mother away the next day. They moved up to St. Augustine, and he had a heart attack a month later and died. Her mother went into psychiatric care, and she died about five years later. Tanya had an older brother-Sam-and to the best of my knowledge, he\u2019s still doing charters out of Key Largo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Katie said, surprised. \u201cI thought he had left the state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Key West.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, they were both silent. To her surprise, it wasn\u2019t an awkward silence, just a sad one. And she did understand why he hated to see the museum reopened.</p><p>She reached a hand out to touch his across the table. Sparks seemed to jump into her, and she realized that he was far more tense and vital than she had imagined. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, really sorry,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, you see, their lives were destroyed. Our family was torn apart-I couldn\u2019t stay here. I really couldn\u2019t stay here. I might have been running away, but I honestly don\u2019t think so. I just couldn\u2019t stay. The destruction of lives and families was just too much. But now, I know that I will never really be fine with myself if I don\u2019t discover the truth, no matter what it takes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s ominous,\u201d Katie told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t intend to hold people up at gunpoint or anything of the like. But I\u2019m going to delve until I find something. A young woman was murdered. She had to have fought-Tanya was fond of living, believe me.\u201d</p><p>Katie frowned. The case had been years ago. Of course, everyone had been talking about it at the time. It was a small community, especially as far as true conchs-those who were born and bred in Key West-went. Even fresh-water conchs-those who had been in Key West at least seven years-were often rare. Naturally, a scandal, a murder that involved one of the city\u2019s oldest families, was a cause for endless horror and gossip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t remember much about the case. I mean, to be honest, we all whispered about it, but our parents would always hush us up. And my brother was upset, of course, and we went to the funeral-everyone in town went to the funeral. But I don\u2019t know a lot about what was discovered. The body was found in a fairly pristine condition. She hadn\u2019t decomposed much... They should have been able to discover some facts regarding the case,\u201d Katie said. She flushed, realizing the things she was saying had to be painful, since he had known Tanya so well. Loved her, at least at some point in his life.</p><p>He stared at her a moment. She realized she was holding her breath. But he let out a soft sigh and she was grateful that he didn\u2019t seem angry, or that he hadn\u2019t taken her words as callous.</p><p>\u201cOur relationship was over,\u201d David said. \u201cI was sad, maybe enjoying being a bit heartbroken. I wasn\u2019t angry. I\u2019d been gone a long time-military service had seemed like the right course. I know at the time my grandfather had been worried about finances and he was determined that we get to college, so...I figured that would make it easier on him. I had a partial scholarship and the government to back me up. But I was gone way too long for a young woman with little to do down here but bask in the sun. I wasn\u2019t that surprised that she left me. Tanya was a party girl. We\u2019d parted ways-she had written me before I returned home to tell me that time and distance were too much, she felt that we should break off the engagement. We never even fought. I hadn\u2019t seen her since I\u2019d come home-I\u2019d been avoiding her-though I heard she intended to talk to me that evening, to meet me face-to-face to apologize for what she had done. She didn\u2019t mention the other guy in the letter. I\u2019d heard about that through others, but I was hardly surprised. She was supposed to leave in the next few days to live in Ohio but I\u2019d heard from others that she may have decided to stay. Supposedly, she\u2019d had a change of heart. That night. Or maybe it had been brewing. She was trying to get her courage up to come see me. Whether that\u2019s true or not, I don\u2019t know. I thought that we were over. I\u2019d helped out at the museum while waiting to head up to school. I loved working in the museum. I\u2019d always loved the Carl Tanzler story-I mean, it\u2019s just too bizarre, even for Key West! I was telling it with relish, I believe. And then, there she was. Tanya-where Elena de Hoyos should have rested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat-what about the fellow from Ohio she fell in love with?\u201d Katie asked. \u201cDid they ever question him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike Sanderson. He was in Ohio, or on the road to Ohio,\u201d David said. \u201cHe\u2019d left several days earlier. Tanya had actually stayed behind to get herself organized. She also told people that she\u2019d wanted to see me again-without Mike around. She was a party girl, but a very decent human being. As far as I remember. And that\u2019s painful. I remember her dead far better than I remember her alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, the new guy was out of state...\u201d Katie murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see why I appeared to be the perfect suspect,\u201d David said. \u201cEspecially because, at times, I was alone in the museum that night. Between tours. We didn\u2019t find her until the following morning, and I thank God for the coroner. He insisted that she had been killed before nine the night before, and there were a number of people who swore that I couldn\u2019t possibly have left the museum with enough time to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she wasn\u2019t killed at the museum?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe had been killed and lain somewhere long enough for lividity to set in-and the way her blood had settled, she\u2019d been on her side for a while after she was killed.\u201d He winced. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking that I shouldn\u2019t be able to talk about her this way?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cNo! Actually, I wasn\u2019t thinking that at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just wondering how on earth you could begin to go back to find out what did happen.\u201d</p><p>He stood. \u201cWell, it\u2019s quite a challenge. I may fail. I have to try.\u201d</p><p>She stood, as well. It was obvious that he was leaving.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you find out the truth?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you manage to lay all your ghosts to rest. Will you leave again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, if all was solved, you just might feel differently about the museum.\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have spoken; she saw a spark of anger in his eyes. \u201cI see where your sympathy for my plight lies, Miss O\u2019Hara,\u201d he said, his words pleasant enough.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually, yes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s how you wish to feel, fine. There\u2019s little I can do,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>He started toward the door but stopped and turned back. \u201cThank you for the coffee.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cDo you manage to suck everyone in like this-then irritate them beyond measure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I, no! I wasn\u2019t sucking you in. I was listening. And I would dearly love to see the murder solved. It was an injustice all the way around. A killer got away with murder. Lives were ruined. I-and surely everyone else-would like to see that rectified. In fact, and seriously, with no side benefit, I\u2019m more than willing to help you in any way. I just can\u2019t begin to see how.\u201d</p><p>He walked back to her. He loomed tall, and she felt a slight tremor touch her, but it wasn\u2019t fear. He was simply a charismatic man, whether talking thoughtfully, or staring at her the way he was now.</p><p>Even wagging a finger at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! No, I mean, don\u2019t! Don\u2019t help me, don\u2019t look into this, don\u2019t be involved in any way. Please, and I mean it. Do you understand me-don\u2019t help, don\u2019t ask questions-just don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! All right!\u201d Katie flared. \u201cWhat-do you have this problem with everyone who attempts to be nice to you?\u201d</p><p>He let out a breath. His eyes were an intense blue as he stared at her, and yet they seemed to spark with a different emotion, as well.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just don\u2019t want anyone involved in any way, all right?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands. \u201cHey, you\u2019re on your own. I won\u2019t darken your door, I won\u2019t even speak on your behalf!\u201d</p><p>He nodded, turned and headed to the door. Once more, he turned back. \u201cSeriously, thanks for the coffee.\u201d He lingered for a moment. She was surprised to see something of a nostalgic smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Remembering times...before, I guess.\u201d He looked at her a long moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember. I came here one day to see your brother and you were mad at him. You opened the door for me, and then slammed it in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cHey, he was quite a bit older, and very superior at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I knocked again, and Sean came down. He threatened to lock you in your dollhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had a dollhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he must not have been all that mad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stepped outside, the door closed and he was gone.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Bartholomew exclaimed. \u201cWell, well-well. How touching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be-a jerk,\u201d Katie said.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Bartholomew said indignantly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t being a jerk. I meant it. How touching. I think I do like this fellow after all.\u201d</p><p>Katie was thoughtful. \u201cIf he is able to find out the truth...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear him? He doesn\u2019t want you involved. And, hey-it\u2019s never been proved that he was guilty, but it\u2019s never been proved that he was innocent.\u201d</p> <p>Katie looked solidly at Bartholomew. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to do anything, seriously. I\u2019m going to hope for the best for him. But if he does find out the truth, he may change his mind, and I may get the museum.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew appeared to shudder. \u201cKatie, if he\u2019s right, the situation is dangerous. Oh, yes, there\u2019s so much more that can be discovered these days than when I was walking the shoreline. DNA, RNA, whichever is which and what. Skin cells, even fingerprints, footprints...genetic markers. Whatever. The thing is, the killer was never caught. David Beckett thinks that it wasn\u2019t a random act or the act of a psycho who moved on. If he\u2019s trying to discover the truth and it was someone from around here who still lives here, that person isn\u2019t going to want anyone knowing the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we want isn\u2019t always what we get-it\u2019s time for a murderer to come to justice,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cRight. Great sentiment,\u201d Bartholomew agreed. \u201cBut this person killed once, very cleverly, so it seems. If he\u2019s threatened, he\u2019ll certainly kill again. Katie, look at me-this guy will kill again. Like Beckett said, young woman, you stay the hell out of it. You wouldn\u2019t want to wind up being a tableau in the museum yourself now, would you, Miss Katherine O\u2019Hara?\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>Danny Zigler seemed the right place to start. He knew Key West like the back of his hand. He had been here then-and he\u2019d remained to sometimes tell stories about the night, along with other bits and pieces of Key West myth and legend. He had been something of a friend. He was a legend in his own peculiar way.</p> <p>At the moment, Danny worked part-time for one of the ghost-tour companies and part-time for an ice-cream parlor on Duval. He had always been a nice guy with an easygoing personality-and not a bit of ambition. Maybe that wasn\u2019t a bad thing, David didn\u2019t know. Sometimes Danny was unemployed, and that would be fine with Danny until he was dead broke, then he\u2019d make the effort to become employed again. He was a fixture in Key West.</p><p>It was still early, and not much on or just off Duval Street opened early, except for the chain drugstore, coffee shops and an Internet caf\u00e9. But David knew that the ice-cream shop would be getting ready to open, and it might be the best time to talk to Danny.</p><p>When he reached the shop, David could see Danny inside, wiping down one of the milk-shake machines. He rapped on the glass. Danny looked up and over at him, and a broad smile lit up his face. He hurried to the door. David heard the locks being sprung, and then the door opened.</p><p>\u201cDavid Beckett! I heard you were headed back into town. Man, how are you! It\u2019s so damned cool to see you!\u201d Danny declared. His enthusiasm seemed real, and he gave David a hug and stepped back. \u201cDamn, man, and you are looking good!\u201d</p><p>Danny was eternally thin. His brown hair, long and worn in a queue at his nape, was now beginning to show threads of gray. His face was pockmarked from a now preventable childhood illness and his features were lean. His eyes, however, were a warm brown, and he did well with people. He excelled at telling stories, and he\u2019d been a wonderful guide years ago, when he had worked at the museum. David wondered if Danny\u2019s life hadn\u2019t been altered by the events at the museum, as well.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Danny,\u201d David said. \u201cSo how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Danny shrugged, wiping his hands on the white apron he wore over his jeans and a Metallica tee. \u201cI can\u2019t complain, can\u2019t complain. They\u2019re getting more and more letters on what a great \u2018ghost host\u2019 I am for the weekend tours and, hey-I can have all the free ice cream I want. I have a sunset every night, and saltwater and sand between my toes.\u201d He frowned. \u201cHey, there\u2019s a rumor that you\u2019re refusing to sell the museum to Katie O\u2019Hara. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Danny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour museum, your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not actually my museum. I do have the major interest, but my grandfather left Liam and me in charge of his estate. We have to agree on everything, and I just don\u2019t agree with reopening that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Danny. You were the best guide known to man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo skin off my nose, David. Seriously. I just live, and I get by, and that\u2019s what makes me happy,\u201d Danny assured him. \u201cKatie would have done a good job, though. She\u2019s a great little go-getter, good businesswoman. But you know her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a kid when I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we were all kids when you left. So, where have you been? They said you became some kind of a big-shot photographer. A photojournalist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m a big shot. I make a decent living,\u201d David told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you missed Craig\u2019s funeral,\u201d Danny said.</p><p>\u201cI saw him when he was alive. He was always the mainstay of my life,\u201d David told him.</p><p>\u201cYou been to the grave site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Danny obviously disapproved of that fact, but he didn\u2019t say so. He asked, \u201cSo how long do you plan on staying around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. I haven\u2019t made any commitments for the near future. We\u2019ll see. Tell me how you\u2019ve been, Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t need a lot. Just enough to survive and enjoy myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill never married? Is there a special girl?\u201d</p><p>Danny laughed. \u201cWell, I know several girls who are special. Girls I like, and girls I see. But they\u2019re not the kind you bring home to Mom, you know what I mean? But, hey, I know the scoop around here. I\u2019m just looking for fun, and they\u2019re just looking for a few bucks. It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s the way I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo commitments, and that\u2019s the way I like it. Don\u2019t be feeling sorry for me, I\u2019m a happy man. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Danny looked at him thoughtfully. \u201cSo, what are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettling affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Hey, I have one of the ghost tours Saturday night. You should come. I\u2019m in rare form, and I really do a good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p><p>Danny hesitated again. He winced. \u201cYou know, they usually do mention Tanya now in the tours. They say that she\u2019s a ghost, and that she haunts the museum house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you tell the story, too, right?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Danny said.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re doing a ghost tour, I\u2019m assuming it makes a good story, and it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d David assured him.</p><p>Danny looked around awkwardly for a moment. \u201cHey, you want some ice cream?\u201d</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cNo, thanks, Danny. You know, you said that you retell the story on your tours. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>Danny looked pale suddenly. \u201cI-I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that I was under suspicion, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, nothing like that.\u201d He was lying; he was lying out of kindness, so it seemed.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what really happened?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what really happened? I wasn\u2019t working either day. You were working for me, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I remember that. But what do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do the night of her murder with your free time?\u201d</p><p>Danny thought a minute. \u201cI had a few drinks at one of the joints on Duval. And I was down at Mallory Square. Then I went home. I woke up the next morning when I heard all the sirens-I was living in an apartment on Elizabeth Street back then. I came outside and saw the cops and the M.E.\u2019s car over at the museum and walked over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see Tanya at all that night?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...yes! Early. Well, it was late afternoon, I guess. Around five. I saw her down in one of the bars. I talked to her, I think. Yes, I did talk to her. I\u2019d heard she was leaving town, and that things had kind of faded apart between you two. She said she had a few people to see that night, and that she\u2019d be taking a rental up to Miami, and flying out from there the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, five o\u2019clock. Where?\u201d</p><p>Danny shook his head. \u201cI think...maybe, yeah! I was toward the south side of Duval. It might even have been Katie\u2019s uncle\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Danny,\u201d David told him. \u201cDid you tell the cops that at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that I did,\u201d Danny told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause her killer has never been caught,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Danny said.</p><p>\u201cWell, good to see you, and thanks again,\u201d David told him.</p><p>\u201cSure thing. Sure. And I really can\u2019t give you an ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but thanks,\u201d David told him.</p><p>He waved to Danny and left.</p><p>Five o\u2019clock. If Danny was right, Tanya had been at O\u2019Hara\u2019s at five o\u2019clock on the Saturday night she had been murdered.</p><p>And Danny hadn\u2019t seen her again.</p><p>Important, if it was the truth. If he wasn\u2019t covering up.</p><p>For himself.</p><p>Or for someone else.</p><p>It was Danny\u2019s story then, and it was Danny\u2019s story now. He had seen Tanya at five. Sometime in the next few hours, she\u2019d been murdered, and sometime after that-certainly after midnight, after the museum had closed-she had been laid out in place of Elena de Hoyos. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>David had returned for the first tour the following morning.</p><p>Had she been laid out just for him to find?</p><p>The answer to that question might be the answer to her murder.</p> <p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t really to be found at the cemetery, you know,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cWell, most people. The thing is, of course, that most of us move on. And we remain behind only in the memories of those who loved us. Or hated us. Well, usually, people move on. Okay, okay, well, sometimes you can find people wandering around a cemetery, but... Well, that\u2019s because they have to remain because... Wait, why am I remaining? Oh, hmm. I think it may be because of you. But I digress. You will not find Craig Beckett in this cemetery. He was a good man, and his conscience was clean. He\u2019s moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that he\u2019s not in the cemetery,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cThen...why are we here?\u201d Bartholomew asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have to be here. But you do not behave with the intelligence you were granted at birth. Therefore, I feel it is my cross to bear in life to follow you around,\u201d Bartholomew told her.</p> <p>\u201cHey! I am not your cross to bear, and I do behave intelligently,\u201d Katie said, shaking her head and praying for patience. \u201cIt\u2019s broad daylight. There are tourists all over the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether the person is here or not-and, of course, I don\u2019t begin to assume that Craig Beckett\u2019s soul would be in his worn and embalmed body in his tomb-I just like to come. It\u2019s beautiful, and it\u2019s a place where I can think. When other people, alive or dead, are not driving me right up the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you need to think about?\u201d Bartholomew demanded.</p><p>\u201cCraig. I just want to remember him. Could I have a bit of respectful silence?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The Key West cemetery was on a high point in the center of the island. In 1846, a massive hurricane had washed up a number of earlier graves and sent bodies down Duval Street in a flood. After that, high ground was chosen. Now, many of the graves were in the ground, but many more were above-ground graves. Tombs, shelves and strange grave sites dotted the cemetery, along with more typical mausoleum-type graves.</p> <p>It was estimated that there were one-hundred-thousand people interred at the Key West cemetery, in one way or another, triple the actual full-time population of the island.</p><p>Katie did love the cemetery. It was just like the island itself, historic and eccentric, full of the old and the new. There were Civil War soldiers buried here, there was a monument to those lost aboard the Maine and there were many graves with curious sentiments, her favorite being, \u201cI told you I was sick!\u201d</p><p>Craig Beckett was in a family mausoleum that had been there since the majority of the island\u2019s dead had been moved here. One of the most beautiful angel sculptures in the cemetery stood high atop the roof of the mausoleum, and tourists were frequently near, taking pictures of the sculpture. When the Beckett family had originally purchased their final resting place, the cost had been minimal. Now such a structure, along with the small spit of ground it stood upon, would cost in the mid-to-high hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p>\u201cThere she is!\u201d Bartholomew said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWho? Where?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe woman in white,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cThere, where the oldest graves are.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew was right. She was standing above one of the graves. Her head was lowered, and her hands were folded before her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to her,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she wants to talk,\u201d Katie said. \u201cBartholomew, you should wait.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to wait. He left Katie and went striding quickly toward the beautiful ghost figure in long, flowing white. As he neared her, she turned. She saw him.</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>Katie shook her head. Sadly, the world of relationships was always hard. Even for ghosts. Maybe more so for ghosts.</p><p>She heard laughter and turned. A group of tourists was coming along; they had just been visiting the area of the monument to the survivors of the Maine; a wrought-iron fence encircled a single bronze sailor who looked out over the markers of his companions.</p><p>They were now coming to take pictures of the Beckett tomb with its beautiful, high-rising angel. Katie decided to slip away.</p><p>She walked around to an area where graves were stacked mausoleum-style in several rows, and stood where she wouldn\u2019t be seen. The group was a happy one, and she knew that visiting the historic and unusual cemetery was something that people did. Since life was basically a circle and all men died, it seemed a good thing that people enjoyed a walk in the cemetery. But today, for some reason, the laughter irritated her.</p><p>Bartholomew remained around the oldest graves. He had gone down on one knee, and she assumed he was trying to read the etching on some of the gravestones.</p><p>As she waited and watched, she was surprised to see the woman in white appear again. She was behind Bartholomew. Bartholomew didn\u2019t see her. As Katie watched, the woman started to place a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Again, the group of tourists seemed to issue, in unison, a loud stream of laughter. The woman turned to fog, and she was gone.</p><p>But there was someone else there. A girl. She was also in white, but she was wearing a more modern gown, one similar to the famous halter dress in which Marilyn Monroe had been immortalized in dozens of pictures.</p><p>She, too, watched Bartholomew.</p><p>She looked around, though, and saw Katie. She seemed to panic.</p><p>Then she, too, was gone.</p><p>Katie frowned; there had been something about that particular ghost-something that seemed to stir inside her. Katie should have recognized her.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. Irritated, Katie dismissed the idea.</p><p>Ghosts everywhere! she thought.</p><p>Well, she was in a cemetery. But, as Bartholomew had said, ghosts didn\u2019t really linger that often in cemeteries. They haunted the areas where they had been happy, where they had faced trauma or where they searched for something they hadn\u2019t found in life.</p><p>\u201cHiding?\u201d</p><p>The very real, solid and almost tangible sound of a deep male voice made her jump. Katie swung around.</p><p>David Beckett had come to the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cHiding? No. Just-waiting,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing that a cemetery, even an active cemetery, draws the laughter of the living,\u201d David said. He watched as the loud group moved on.</p><p>\u201cYou came to see your grandfather?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather isn\u2019t here,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo. When did you see him last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight before I headed out to Kenya,\u201d he said, looking toward the mausoleum.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>He looked at her with a tight smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t desert my grandfather, Miss O\u2019Hara, though that seems to be the consensus here. I didn\u2019t like my home anymore, and I can\u2019t help it. I like living a life where you don\u2019t stare into faces every day that are speculative-are you or are you not a murderer? I met Craig in Miami often enough, even Key Largo and sometimes Orlando. Imagine. Craig loved theme parks. Here\u2019s the thing of which I am certain-if there is a heaven, Craig is there, and he\u2019s with my grandmother. They had a beautiful love that was quite complete. They will not be misty ghouls running around a graveyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you sound defensive,\u201d Katie observed.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYep. I have a big chip on my shoulder.\u201d He lifted his hands and she saw that he carried a beautiful bouquet of lilacs. \u201cGram\u2019s favorites,\u201d he said.</p><p>The tourists were gone. Katie followed him back to the Beckett mausoleum. He set the bouquet right before the wrought-iron doors.</p><p>\u201cVery nice-pretty flowers,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cThey seem forlorn,\u201d David said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s forlorn,\u201d she told him, pointing to a family graveyard that was surrounded by an iron fence. Cemetery maintenance was kept up, but no one had been to see the graves in decades. The stones were broken, a stray weed was growing through here and there and all within the site were long forgotten, not even their names remaining legibly upon the stones.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s life,\u201d David said flatly. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you to whatever you were doing,\u201d he told her. But as he turned, he stopped suddenly.</p><p>Katie saw that he was looking at a man across from them, in another section of the cemetery, one that was bordered by Olivia Street.</p><p>She knew that Tanya Barnard was buried in that section; most people knew that she was buried there, even though her marker wasn\u2019t on her grave. Because of the Carl Tanzler/Elena de Hoyos story, the powers-that-be at the time of her death, along with the family, had determined that no one but Tanya\u2019s parents would know exactly where she had been buried; there would be no grave robbing. In death, Tanya had become a celebrity.</p><p>Katie had never seen Tanya\u2019s astral self, soul or haunt.</p><p>She had seen Elena de Hoyos frequently. Then again, if anyone had the right to haunt a place, it was poor Elena. Ripped from her grave, her body adored and yet desecrated, she had missed out on the beauty of youth and the sweetness of aging in the midst of normal love.</p><p>She didn\u2019t weep when she walked. She did so with her head high. And sometimes, she danced, as if she could return to the dance halls of her day, as if she imagined herself young again, falling in love with her handsome husband-happy days before tuberculosis, desertion and the bizarre adoration of Carl Tanzler.</p><p>Would she know Tanya if she saw her? She had heard the story about the woman, of course. It had been Key West\u2019s scandal and horror. Her picture had certainly been in the newspapers. But Katie had never really seen Tanya.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d David murmured.</p><p>The man across the way seemed to know exactly where he was, and what he was looking for.</p><p>Katie stared, squinting against the sun. He was the man who had been in O\u2019Hara\u2019s last night, the man who had appeared to be familiar, who had tried to buy her a drink. He had flowers; he laid them at the foot of a grave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t glance her way. \u201cSam Barnard. Tanya\u2019s brother,\u201d he said.</p><p>Katie stared, looking at David, and then at the man again. David left her, striding across the cemetery. He passed the brick vaults and kept going, at last calling out. His voice carried on the breeze. She heard him calling out, \u201cSam!\u201d</p> <p>Sam turned slowly. He was clean shaven now, in Dockers and a polo shirt, and she wondered if he had been as drunk as she had thought last night, or if he had been playing the drunk, watching folks at the bar. He had to have been familiar with O\u2019Hara\u2019s-her uncle\u2019s bar had been there for twenty-five years. But her uncle, Jamie O\u2019Hara, had not been there. Jon Merrillo had been on as the manager, and Jon had only been in Key West for five years.</p><p>Katie felt her heart thundering. For a moment she thought that she should turn away, that none of this was any of her business. But then she felt a trigger of unease. No, fear. What if the two men were about to go after one another? Maybe Sam Barnard had vengeance on his mind. David Beckett had just returned, and suddenly Sam Barnard was back in the city, as well.</p><p>She dug into her handbag for her phone, ready to dial 911.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>The two men embraced like old friends. They began speaking to one another, and walked toward the grave together.</p> <p>She felt a strange sensation-not cold, not heat, just a movement in the air. She turned her head slightly. Bartholomew had an arm draped around her. \u201cThat\u2019s touching,\u201d he said. \u201cSeriously, you know, I like that fellow. He reminds me of someone I knew years and years ago...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cHey, it might have been one of his ancestors, come to think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he was a jerk and you were going to protect me from him,\u201d Katie said dryly.</p><p>Bartholomew shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s redeeming himself. That\u2019s what life is all about, eh? We make mistakes, we earn redemption. So, you want to join up with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I want to slip away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait-for what?\u201d Katie asked.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe Tanya Barnard is hanging around the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see anyone? I don\u2019t,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bartholomew admitted. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s gone on all the way. But she was murdered, and her murder was never solved. You\u2019d think, with her brother and ex-fianc\u00e9 together, she would make an appearance.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked around the cemetery. No ghosts were stirring. None at all.</p><p>They were probably unhappy with the laughing tourists.</p><p>Every man and woman born came to the end of their lives. Death was the only certainty in life.</p><p>But ghosts could be touchy.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. I have to go to work tonight and I want to do some searching online,\u201d Katie said.</p> <p>\u201cYou go on. I\u2019m going to hang around a bit longer,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cSnooping-or looking for your lady in white?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cA bit of both. I\u2019m looking for my beauty...or waiting for you, my love. But you\u2019re awfully young, so I\u2019d have a long wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for that vote of encouragement,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>She walked quickly, exiting the cemetery from the main gate. Neither of the men, now involved in a deep conversation together, noticed that she left.</p><p>Sam Barnard was David\u2019s senior by four years. He\u2019d been in college when David had been in the military, so they hadn\u2019t hung out, but they\u2019d shared many a holiday dinner with one or the other\u2019s family.</p><p>\u201cI heard about Craig\u2019s death, and I\u2019d heard they were trying to reach you,\u201d Sam Barnard told David. \u201cTo be honest, though, I didn\u2019t come down to pay my respects to anyone. I\u2019d heard a local was trying to buy the museum. It brought everything back. Not just the fact that my kid sister was murdered, but the way she was left...and the fact that her killer was never found. Hell, I didn\u2019t come down to start trouble. I\u2019ve spent the past years not even a hundred miles away, and I haven\u2019t made the trip down here since my folks left. But now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting anyone reopen the museum,\u201d David told him.</p><p>They sat at a sidewalk bar on Front Street. Sam lifted his beer to David. \u201cGlad to hear it. And I\u2019m not here to hound or harass you, either. I know you didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d David asked.</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cI guess a lot of folks think I\u2019ve followed you down here to pick a fight, beat you to a pulp, something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy folks knew you didn\u2019t do it. I knew you didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I knew what was going on. She was my sister, but I never put her on a pedestal. I really loved her, but she was human, you know. Real. From the time she was a little kid, she wanted to live every second of the day. When you left for the military, I had a bad feeling. Tanya was never the kind to wait around. She was never going to find true love with that football jock-he had a roving eye. I told her so. She\u2019d made all her arrangements for college in the north. But she wasn\u2019t leaving until she had talked to you. I\u2019m pretty sure she was going to make a stab at getting back with you. That\u2019s why she was drinking. She needed courage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never needed courage to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know-you really didn\u2019t know that she wanted to make up, did you?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. And no matter what, we would have stayed friends,\u201d David said. \u201cI didn\u2019t hate her. Maybe I understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a cold, closed case now,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cI hope not. I hope there\u2019s still a way to find the truth,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cHow, after all this time?\u201d Sam demanded. \u201cHey, you didn\u2019t secretly go off and become some kind of investigator, or medium, eh? What the hell could anyone possibly find now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, cold cases do get solved. Not all of them, no. And no-I can\u2019t conjure up Tanya to find out what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are a photographer?\u201d Sam said, frowning. \u201cAnd you film stuff, too, for nature films? Underwater-like Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Oddly enough, yes, Sean and I wound up doing close to the same thing. I do more straight photography than Sean, though.\u201d He waited a minute, but Sam remained silent. \u201cAnd you-you\u2019re still running charter fishing boats, right?\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded, rubbing his thumb down his beer glass. \u201cYep, I do fishing charters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a Mrs. Sam yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And you-you never married either, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all over the globe,\u201d David said.</p><p>Sam leaned toward him, his grin lopsided and rueful. \u201cNeither one of us has married because we\u2019re both fucked up. The murderer might as well have strangled my folks right alongside my sister. And let\u2019s see-the girl you thought you were going to marry winds up dead and replacing an automaton, and everyone thinks you did it. Hell, yeah, I can see where you\u2019re pretty screwed up in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, I\u2019ve been fairly functional,\u201d David told him. \u201cBut I guess maybe I thought that my grandfather would live forever. And I sure as hell never thought anyone would want to open the place again. Hell, I had told Liam to do whatever he wanted with whatever. I got back here just in time to stop him from selling the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, are you just going to let it decay, crumble into itself like the House of Usher?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, my plan with the place is to clear it all out, whitewash it and put it on the market. Liam\u2019s parents are living on their private island now so he\u2019s got a house-his mom and dad sold it to him for a dollar since he was their only child. I have my grandfather\u2019s house, so I don\u2019t need another one. And I\u2019m not staying forever.\u201d</p><p>Sam laughed. \u201cAnd you think folks will just forget about what happened here? The ghost tours will go by there, night after night. Tanya was killed and discovered in the museum, and the story will never die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor will the suggestion that I managed to kill her and carry her into the tableau,\u201d David said. \u201cUnless-\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you discover who really did it,\u201d Sam interrupted. \u201cYeah, well, I can see that. And I\u2019m here, if you need me. I\u2019ve rented a house up at the end of Duval. And here\u2019s my cell.\u201d He scratched out a number on a cocktail napkin. \u201cCall me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I will. Actually, I do have some questions for you,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cLike, where was I the night of the twelfth?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. That would be good to know. Did you see your sister that night? I\u2019m trying to trace her footsteps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace them until they walk you right up to a killer?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>David nodded. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where were you that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat night? You found her in the morning... Oh, right. The police said that she was killed sometime between seven and nine on the twelfth, the night before. The museum was open until midnight, so sometime after midnight, the killer brought her body into the museum for you to find during the first tour the next morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone thought she had left for Ohio,\u201d David said. \u201cYour parents thought that she had left for Ohio, and I think they were just angry at first that she had gone without her final goodbye. I wasn\u2019t expecting to see her, so I wouldn\u2019t have looked for her. The killer held her-somewhere, and then brought her into the museum after closing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on Duval Street the night she was killed, drinking it up with a bunch of friends. Did I see my sister? Yes. I yelled at her for drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinking on Duval? How bizarre,\u201d David said dryly.</p><p>\u201cHey, those of us who live in paradise know that you can\u2019t drink yourself silly every night. You know what she told me?\u201d Sam asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I was trying to explain to you. She wanted some liquid courage. She wanted to be strong when she saw you. She wasn\u2019t sure anymore. She\u2019d seen you from a distance, and she felt as if the years had all gone away. She needed courage, but not to tell you goodbye. She needed courage because she was afraid she wanted to ask if she could come back, instead of telling you goodbye, and she was afraid of what you would have to say to her.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d heard it before. Somehow, that information, coming from Sam especially, still hurt.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t know if it was true or not.</p><p>He just knew that it hurt.</p><p>5</p><p>Dying Love, Dead Loss was the name of the most popular book that had been written on the subject of Tanya Barnard\u2019s murder. Naturally, there had been dozens of newspaper reports and the sensationalism of the way she had been left had drawn coverage from across the country.</p><p>Katie had never purchased the book. She didn\u2019t feel that anyone should make a profit off such a contemporary tragedy.</p> <p>That day, however, on her way back from the cemetery, she stopped by a store to purchase the book. She bought it in one of the tourist shops on Duval that sold sandals, clothing, souvenirs and about ten titles that were pertinent to the Keys. Two of the books held maps and histories, two were on water sports on the island, another was on housing styles. There was a book on Carl Tanzler, one on Key West ghost stories and one on the murder of Tanya Barnard. The shop was owned and operated by Eastern Europeans new to the area, but it was still a small world. It wouldn\u2019t be any secret that she had bought the book.</p><p>She picked up a tuna croissant sandwich from one of her favorite restaurants and headed home with her book. She had several hours before she had to return to work.</p><p>Saturday night.</p><p>It was going to be busy.</p><p>Friday nights started the craziness of weekend revelers, bachelor parties, bachelorette parties and general let\u2019s-drive-down-to-Key-West-and-get-plastered celebrations. Also, Fantasy Fest would be starting the next week, so many people who intended to enjoy that week of bacchanalia would start filtering in.</p><p>As she walked to her house, lunch and reading material in hand, she suddenly felt an odd sense of apprehension.</p> <p>It was broad daylight. Tourists were everywhere, walking, on bikes, in rental minicars. Music was blaring from a dozen clubs. She wondered at first if she was being followed by a ghost who had suddenly discovered the need to talk.</p><p>Tanya. Maybe Tanya Barnard was walking around Key West, and she had seen her brother and her onetime fianc\u00e9 again, and discovered the need to try to help them find the truth.</p><p>But looking around, she saw no one, not even the usual crowd she sometimes saw, all from their different eras, sometimes seeing one another and sometimes not. There were a few Spanish conquistadors who hung out near the wharf fairly frequently, and many of the seafarers seemed to see one another and gather near the docks, almost as if they could taste the beer and grog being served by the waterside restaurants now. An early-nineteenth-century pirate seemed to look around Captain Tony\u2019s now and then, and rumor had it that he\u2019d been seen by a number of people.</p><p>But the dead were quiet this afternoon. She had no idea why she\u2019d felt the chilling sensation, as if she had been watched.</p><p>She felt it again when she reached her house and turned the key in the lock, so much so that she turned around to assure herself that she hadn\u2019t been followed. \u201cBartholomew?\u201d she muttered, turning one last time before releasing the knob. Her ethereal houseguest might be feeling that she needed to be more careful than she was. But, apparently, Bartholomew was still hanging around the cemetery. Every now and then, he got a kick out of trying to breathe down someone\u2019s neck and give them a chill or a scare. He could also make leaves rustle, and sometimes, tap on glass or some other hard surface. He loved seeing pretty young women squeal with fear.</p><p>Sometimes, he followed the ghost tours around. He\u2019d stand next to the guides, and blow out their lanterns now and then. She didn\u2019t really blame him. Surely, after nearly two hundred years of hanging around, he needed a form of entertainment. But Bartholomew didn\u2019t seem to be playing jokes-not on her-at the moment.</p><p>She stepped inside and quickly closed the door behind her, locking it. Once inside, she felt somewhat silly, but she still checked the locks anyway. With her sandwich, a cold glass of tea and the book, she curled up on the sofa in the parlor and started to read.</p><p>The author first painted a picture of Key West at the time of the murder; then she told the Carl Tanzler story, and gave a history of the Beckett family. Their history was similar to that of her own family. David Beckett-the original David Beckett-had been a pirate who had claimed that he had actually been a privateer, attacking only Spanish ships in the name of Great Britain. The Becketts purchased lands, probably with ill-gotten gains, became wreckers and salvage divers, supported sponging and, by the eighteen hundreds, had become rich. They were able to shift with the winds of time, owning tourist businesses as the days of wrecking became bygone, investing in a number of different ventures. Into the mid-nineteen hundreds, the family was still hanging on, but with their worth more in property than bank accounts. Few families were more respected. Her own family was named along with the Barnards. They weren\u2019t the earliest, like the Whiteheads and Simontons, but they had family members who had remained through the decades.</p> <p>Then-the murder.</p><p>Everyone involved with the museum had been questioned. Pete Dryer, a uniformed cop at the time, had been at the museum during the discovery, and he had perfectly preserved the crime scene-except that the murder hadn\u2019t taken place in the museum, according to the medical examiner\u2019s report. Where she met her fate, no one knew. No one had broken into the museum, and there were no security cameras at the time. Crime-scene units had not been able to find hairs, fibers or any other microcosm of evidence. David Beckett had naturally fallen under suspicion; Key West was a small place. Though extremely improbable, it was possible that he had slipped out-and come upon Tanya.</p><p>Katie scrambled over to the kitchen counter for a notepad. The police were convinced that the murderer was someone who had lived on the island and knew their way around. They also thought that the murderer was probably a very strong man. She listed the people who had been on the tour: four female college students; Molly and Turk Kenward from Portland, Oregon; Pete Dryer; his sister, Sally; her husband, Gerry Matthews; and the Matthewses\u2019 children, Suzie and Whelan.</p><p>She scratched out the names of the female college students, then the two Matthews children. She was about to scratch out the names of Pete Dryer and his sister and brother-in-law, but she didn\u2019t. Nor did she scratch out David Beckett\u2019s name. She did scratch out Molly and Turk. Not only were they not local, but they were also listed as \u201csenior citizens.\u201d It was possible, of course, that they had been a pair of homicidal octogenarians. It simply wasn\u2019t probable.</p><p>She leafed through more pages, searching for the names of locals who had been questioned. Lily and Gunn Barnard, Tanya\u2019s parents, were dead; Sam Barnard, Tanya\u2019s brother, was alive and well and in Key West now. Danny Zigler had been questioned, and all the Becketts living in the Keys had been questioned, including Liam, who now worked investigation in Key West. Her own brother, Sean, had been questioned, along with many of those who had gone to high school with Tanya.</p><p>Katie frowned, seeing Sean\u2019s name. She had never realized that the police had questioned him.</p><p>Bartenders up and down Duval had been questioned. Once again, Katie was surprised when she saw where Tanya Barnard had last been seen.</p><p>O\u2019Hara\u2019s Pub.</p><p>Her uncle Jamie had been questioned! Jamie, and Sean. She hesitated and wrote down their names.</p><p>She was still so stunned by what she read that she jumped a mile when her cell phone started to ring. She frowned, looking at all the numbers on the caller ID.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she said, feeling a strange sense of trepidation.</p><p>\u201cKatie, it\u2019s Sean,\u201d her brother\u2019s voice said.</p><p>\u201cI was home because it was summer,\u201d Sam Barnard said to David as they sat in the sidewalk bar. \u201cI\u2019d gone to college for a straight business degree, then decided I wanted a minor in marine sciences. It was going to take me five years to get my degree. I never went back for the last year. Doesn\u2019t matter-I never wanted to breed trout anyway. I have a good business-I learned enough to keep up five charter boats and a Gulf-side house right on the water up in Key Largo. I was fishing with my dad during the day, and I saw Tanya around four when we came in. I think I told her she was a jerk. Because of the Ohio State guy. I was on your side, though, of course, now I know that none of us can ever tell anyone else what to do. But like I said, she didn\u2019t tell me to fly a kite, kiss my ass or any other such thing. She said she knew she had messed up, but that if you didn\u2019t want her, she was leaving. She asked me if I thought she was a bad person, not knowing until you were back-all in one piece-before thinking that she\u2019d made a mistake. I told her, yeah, she\u2019d kind of been a selfish bitch. She\u2019d wanted everything-the parties, the good times and then the guy she\u2019d cheated on. She didn\u2019t even get mad. I was a jerk, and it was the last time I ever saw my sister alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she left the house after four that afternoon?\u201d David said after a moment.</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>\u201cDanny Zigler saw her at five at O\u2019Hara\u2019s Pub. In the police reports, Jamie O\u2019Hara said that he served her a pint of Guinness, and that she was nervous. She smiled at him, and told him to wish her luck, stayed until around seven-and then she left, and no one saw her alive again,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the police reports?\u201d Sam asked, curious and surprised.</p><p>\u201cMy cousin is working it as a cold case,\u201d David said.</p><p>Sam pointed a finger at him. \u201cI remember something. Your cousin, Liam, was one of the people who saw her at O\u2019Hara\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least ten people saw her at O\u2019Hara\u2019s that night,\u201d David pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, which of those ten people weren\u2019t seen in the bar after? Or, oh, hell, that would be the point here, huh? No one knows who saw her once she left that pub. Somewhere, in the next hour, someone found her and killed her. That\u2019s nothing new, not really. I\u2019m sure the police must have narrowed down the timeline when it happened. And, of course, the problem around here isn\u2019t that there was no one on the streets. There were hundreds of people on the streets. And it was a long, long time ago now,\u201d Sam said. He hesitated. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t raped. So it\u2019s not as if they can suddenly find a miraculous match with honed DNA science.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d David agreed.</p><p>This time, Sam let out a long sigh. \u201cThey figured it was some kind of psycho who lived here and then moved on. Hell, he could have driven north that night, or taken a puddle jumper up the state. But you don\u2019t think that a whacko killed my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything. I just don\u2019t think it was a psycho. I think it was someone who knew the area and had an agenda.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I need to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand. I mean, obviously, I really wish we knew what happened-who killed my baby sister. But, what\u2019s different now? The cops swore they chased down every lead, no matter how small. What\u2019s different now? How do you think you can solve anything?\u201d</p><p>David stared at him and smiled tightly. \u201cI\u2019m different now. I\u2019m not a kid. And I don\u2019t intend to stop, or be stopped by anyone. I know that I had nothing to do with her death, and I know that someone did. Someone got away with murder, and I believe that we do know the person who killed her. The truth exists. And I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Where are you?\u201d Katie asked her brother. \u201cFar away still, I take it. It\u2019s great to hear from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe talked a week ago on Skype,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cSkype is great-when you have a sibling halfway across the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Hawaii now. I\u2019m coming home for a while, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! It will be like old-home week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDavid Beckett left me a message about going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left you a message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cE-mail,\u201d Sean explained.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have access for a few days, but the filming project finished up. I\u2019m in Hawaii, and I head back to California the day after tomorrow. Then Miami the following morning-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m going to rent a car. I\u2019ll be there sometime on Tuesday or Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Sean! Oh, watch the traffic. The first events for Fantasy Fest are starting soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know the traffic. It will just be aggravating. I could hop a puddle jumper in Miami, but I kind of want to drive down. Even with the tourists clogging the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s super, Sean!\u201d</p><p>He was quiet. She thought that she had lost the connection. \u201cKatie?\u201d he said then.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go telling anyone that...that you see things.\u201d</p><p>It was her turn to be quiet. Sean had been amused the first time she had seen a ghost. She had been six, in first grade, and they\u2019d been playing at the church. The ghost she had seen had been a nun. Sean had taken it all as a joke. Her feelings had been terribly hurt, but she had quickly realized that he had been trying to defend her. The other kids meant to torment her and laugh at her-which they did, until Sean turned it all around, laughing at them for falling for the joke.</p><p>Later, Katie had been alone at the playground. The nun had come to her, and spoken gently, assuring her that she had a gift, and that she must guard it carefully.</p><p>But when her grandfather had died, her mother\u2019s tears had shaken her. She had seen her grandfather, trying to comfort her mother. She told her mother. Her mother believed she was just trying to comfort her-until she told her mother where Grandpa had left his old gold pocket watch, and that he wanted Katie\u2019s father to have it.</p><p>Her mother had been looking everywhere for the pocket watch.</p><p>Katie was careful then. She didn\u2019t tell anybody about the sailors, servicemen and pirates who roamed the docks.</p><p>She avoided eye contact with the ghosts. It hadn\u2019t worked with Bartholomew.</p><p>She had thought that her brother had forgotten about her ghosts, because she never mentioned a ghost again. Sometimes, though, she had information or could tell him things because a ghost had pointed something out. She would remain stubbornly silent when he asked her how she knew something.</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go saying anything, anything at all-especially not to David. I know why he\u2019s in town. If God himself comes down to speak to you, don\u2019t say anything-do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think God is busy, Sean. The world is a mess, if you haven\u2019t noticed. I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s coming down to talk to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cKatie, please. I know you...think you see things,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019m just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, you think that whoever killed Tanya Barnard is still around? It\u2019s been ten years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid has come home to find the killer, Katie. I\u2019m willing to bet that he\u2019s making that pretty clear. And if he\u2019s right, the killer is going to be afraid. Please, Katie...listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you to death, big brother,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m listening. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t see things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I need to hear, kid,\u201d Sean said. He was quiet for a minute. \u201cAnd be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>He was silent, but it was as if she could hear a single name in the silence between them.</p><p>David.</p><p>\u201cBig brother, you either believe he\u2019s guilty, or you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s-sad, sometimes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe in a person or you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s say I believe in him. Belief isn\u2019t all black-and-white. And not only that, but what if someone had been after him? What if that person is still around? Just watch out for yourself. Careful on getting too friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled I\u2019m going to get to see you,\u201d she said, ignoring the warning.</p><p>\u201cYeah. See you soon! And behave until then, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a regular angel, Sean.\u201d</p><p>His snort was loud and clear. \u201cLove you, Katie. And behave, I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! We\u2019re going in circles here, dear boy! I thought David was your friend, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was. He is, I assume,\u201d Sean said. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! You are such a liar. You suspected him, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I never did. All right, that\u2019s a lie. I don\u2019t want to believe that David could have been guilty. I mean, I don\u2019t think he could have been guilty. But the thing is, no matter how mature a man he might have been trying to be, Tanya did hurt him. I understand that people think that she might have found him that night, that he might have been angry. I don\u2019t believe it, it\u2019s just...she is dead. David was a big strong kid from the time he was ten. But he was always-sane. Craig taught him to be respectful at all times. He didn\u2019t have a maniacal or crazy temper. So, I really believe he was innocent. Except, inside me somewhere, I suppose, I couldn\u2019t help but let some of the theories and rumors get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now-you don\u2019t believe it was David? Or you don\u2019t want to believe it was David?\u201d</p><p>Sean was quiet a moment. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo which?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m saying that it wasn\u2019t David. Then who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police questioned you. I read it in a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey questioned everyone. I had been hanging at Uncle Jamie\u2019s place that night-O\u2019Hara\u2019s. I saw Tanya there. I told them the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember who left the bar?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I do, kid, I\u2019m not telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of it, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, big bro. Losing the connection,\u201d Katie said. \u201cSee you when you get here.\u201d</p><p>She cut off the conversation before her brother could give her more instructions.</p><p>She looked back to her paper. Her brother\u2019s name was the last thing she had written down. She scratched through his name. Sean certainly never hurt anyone. And neither did her uncle. She scratched through his name, as well. She looked at the list, shaking her head. It couldn\u2019t have been Liam, or Pete Dryer, or...</p><p>Lord! No wonder the police had never discovered the truth. No matter what they thought, the murderer had to have been a passerby in the Keys. Had to have been!</p><p>She heard a soft sound at the door and looked up. Bartholomew was back; he hadn\u2019t opened and closed the door, but he did make a strange noise as he came through it.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cEavesdropping,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOn who?\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his pocket watch, which couldn\u2019t possibly work, but it seemed to, at least for Bartholomew. \u201cYou\u2019d better get going. You\u2019re going to be late for work. Not to mention that your uncle owns the place and you should be keeping an eye on it.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and jumped up, realizing the time. She swore softly, gathered her purse and her keys and headed out. She closed the door; Bartholomew stepped through.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you eavesdropping?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe police station,\u201d Bartholomew informed her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d Bartholomew said slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou wretched pirate-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivateer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call for an exorcist and send you downward with your scalawag friends!\u201d she threatened.</p><p>He laughed, but then saw her eyes. \u201cAll right, all right. I was at the police station, and the officers have been warned to keep an eye on David Beckett,\u201d he told her. \u201cSee, I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. They weren\u2019t sure what had happened because there was no evidence. There\u2019s some discussion about the fact that David is still obsessed with Tanya and her murder. Evidence! Like that mattered in my day. They just hanged us right and left, right and left!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She paused, looking at him. \u201cSo you were hanged? You never told me that you were hanged!\u201d</p><p>In his astral form, he puffed up, shoulders back, head high. \u201cI was a victim of false arrest, Miss O\u2019Hara. And my end was untimely and unjust!\u201d He appeared to let out his breath. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t matter now, Katie. What does matter is that you seem to be getting chummy with a murderer.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, thinking she might be crazy. \u201cHe\u2019s not a murderer, Bartholomew. He\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know. I just-know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must keep your distance,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry-my brother\u2019s on his way here. And, supposedly, Liam Beckett has the files now and they\u2019re working the murder as a cold case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, not one bit,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry. And please hush up and mind yourself. My uncle may own O\u2019Hara\u2019s, but I\u2019d just as soon his customers don\u2019t all insist to him that I\u2019m crazy and talk to myself!\u201d</p><p>What seemed to lurk in the human soul was odd, David decided. Being in Key West didn\u2019t bother him. Being in his grandparents\u2019 home didn\u2019t disturb him, either; it was actually good. The old place spoke of conch chowder on nights when the temperature dipped to forty, lemonade and good seafood. Some aspects of the house needed updating, and some remained cozy and warm. His grandmother had knitted throws for the furniture, and they were as neat and tidy as the day she had died. Her tea service remained on a small Duncan Fife table by the kitchen. His room had changed little-his rock band and Sports Illustrated posters were still on the wall. Okay, so that needed updating.</p><p>Being here, however, was not painful.</p><p>The museum was painful.</p><p>And when he walked into O\u2019Hara\u2019s Pub with Liam, it was painful, as well.</p><p>It was the last place anyone admitted to seeing Tanya alive.</p> <p>O\u2019Hara\u2019s hadn\u2019t changed. The bar was well-crafted mahogany, and there were a number of booths with deep cushions and high wooden backs. Wooden double doors opened to the sidewalk. Air-conditioning slipped out, but that happened with most establishments on Duval Street. O\u2019Hara\u2019s served typical Irish fare, fish and chips, shepherd\u2019s pie and a choice of corned beef or Canadian bacon and cabbage. \u201cLeprechauns\u201d were thin-sliced beef rolled in pastry and \u201cbanshees\u201d were drink concoctions that seemed to mix every alcohol known to man.</p><p>The stage offered Irish music during the week, and now, karaoke some nights. It was apparently a popular notion because the place was packed when he entered with Liam. It seemed, however, that unlike many places on Duval, the music was kept at a nondeafening level, and at the back tables, it would actually be possible to carry on a conversation. Closer to the stage, it was louder, but not so painful that your head pounded or you felt the need to escape.</p><p>Katie was at her computer, listening to a group of girls, smiling and suggesting something, as they seemed perplexed over their choices. They all smiled and stepped back. Katie looked up at him suddenly, almost as if someone had tapped her on the shoulder and pointed out that he was there. She didn\u2019t smile, she just stared at him. Then again, he told himself, at least she didn\u2019t appear to be angry.</p><p>He noticed that a lot of locals still came to O\u2019Hara\u2019s. It was a little closer to the southern side of the island than some of the other popular and must-see haunts, such as Sloppy Joe\u2019s or Captain Tony\u2019s. Many of the bars didn\u2019t sell food, either, especially after a certain time. O\u2019Hara\u2019s served until 1:00 a.m., and when Jamie O\u2019Hara was home, it might serve as late as 5:00 a.m., depending on Jamie\u2019s mood and who was in the place. That wasn\u2019t written on any of the brochures given out by the Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p>He turned. Liam was smiling at the waitress, calling her by name. Obviously, he knew her. Clarinda.</p><p>\u201cShepherd\u2019s pie and a Guinness,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>At first, it appeared that the girl was trying not to look at him, then she stared him in the eyes and cleared her throat. \u201cWelcome back, David,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Clarinda. I\u2019m a conch, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Clarinda,\u201d he said.</p><p>She blushed. \u201cYou spoke to my class when I was in grade school. You talked to us about being a soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I said all the right things,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou did. Well, um. Well. Welcome back.\u201d</p><p>She went off to get their order. A group of young people in Florida State T-shirts were singing a Kiss song. They weren\u2019t bad.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t mind being here-but what are we doing here?\u201d Liam asked him.</p><p>\u201cHaving dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are lots of restaurants here,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cRetracing the past,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cThe last place she was seen,\u201d Liam said. \u201cGod, David, you know I want to help you. I just don\u2019t see what being here is going to do for us.\u201d</p><p>David lifted his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but doesn\u2019t it seem odd that the principals are reappearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, you\u2019re the detective,\u201d David said. \u201cAll right-so I can\u2019t help but see things that may not be here on this. But look who just got a job busing the place.\u201d</p><p>Liam turned around as David suggested, and saw that Danny Zigler was cleaning tables in the back.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t working here when I talked to him this morning,\u201d David pointed out. \u201cAnd let\u2019s see if I\u2019m right... Yes, yes, I am. There\u2019s Sam Barnard at the bar.\u201d</p><p>The FSU kids left the stage; a group of balding businessmen went up to butcher Billy Joel, but they seemed to have a good time doing it.</p><p>\u201cSam is here because you\u2019re here,\u201d Liam said flatly. \u201cDavid, I pulled the files, I supported you in there today, I\u2019m on it. I intend to give it my all. But locals have been coming to O\u2019Hara\u2019s forever. It\u2019s a hot spot for those who live on the island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Sam is in town because I\u2019m in town-I spent some time with him today. And I\u2019m sure Sam is in O\u2019Hara\u2019s tonight for the same reason I am-it was the last place Tanya was seen. But what about Danny Zigler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZigler is always looking for work. He lost out when the museum closed,\u201d Liam pointed out.</p><p>Clarinda came with their stouts. \u201cFood will be right up, gentlemen,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Liam told her. \u201cHow\u2019s Jonas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing well, thanks. He\u2019s still doing dive tours. He\u2019ll be by later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, we\u2019ll see him then. Hey, Clarinda, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you. You\u2019re not walking home alone after your shift ends are you?\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cI never do. Yell at Katie, though. She\u2019s terrible. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she said, and hurried over to another table to take an order.</p><p>A man David vaguely remembered as being Marty... Something went up to sing. He was good. He had a deep baritone and did a sea ditty.</p><p>Katie announced that they were gearing up in Key West for Fantasy Fest, and then Pirates in Paradise. Any folks who returned for the party days would see Marty Jenkins performing.</p><p>People started clanging beer mugs on the tables. They were chanting something. Katie stood up and beckoned to Clarinda.</p><p>The girls did a Broadway number. It was actually very funny, and David discovered that it wasn\u2019t exactly Broadway, but rather Off-Broadway. The language was fast and furious, and both girls, though laughing, excelled with it. The audience went wild with clapping, but Katie quickly moved on, announcing an Elvis number by a fellow who would also be performing at Fantasy Fest.</p><p>Elvis announced that during Fantasy Fest, he painted on his show duds. He sang, and again, he was someone who did a really nice rendition of \u201cBlue Suede Shoes.\u201d</p><p>Their meals arrived. David had his fork halfway to his mouth when he noted that Katie was staring out the door. When Elvis finished, the place clapped enthusiastically. Katie didn\u2019t seem to notice. She seemed unaware of anything; she stared at the open doors as if the bright lights of heaven had suddenly exploded there.</p><p>As if she had seen a ghost.</p><p>To his incredulity, she stood, totally heedless of Elvis leaving and her empty stage. She raced to the doors and straight through them.</p><p>He leapt to his feet, and followed.</p><p>6</p><p>H e was stunned to see Katie O\u2019Hara suddenly on the street. She was staring after someone-as if she had just seen a long-dead relative.</p><p>And she was making her way down Duval. The crowd had thinned, but she was oblivious of the people who remained out.</p><p>She was chasing someone.</p><p>David Beckett was on the street, too, searching for Katie, then following her.</p><p>She seemed to be in some kind of a daze, intent on nothing but her purpose.</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d Beckett called, seeing her, racing after her. He reached Katie. Caught her by her shoulders and spun her around with surprise.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have known her, couldn\u2019t have really known her, she\u2019d been a kid back then.</p><p>But he\u2019d known her brother, of course. Sean. Who had gotten out of town when it all broke, as well.</p><p>Beckett shook her gently, saying her name again, and then once again.</p><p>It was bizarre. She snapped out of whatever spell had gripped her. She seemed surprised to be in the street, there, with him. He was touching her. And her eyes met his. There was no hostility in them, just curiosity.</p><p>She shook her head then. Beckett was still concerned. Katie seemed to be determined to assure him that everything was all right. What was she saying to him?</p><p>He could tell...</p><p>There was just something about the two.</p><p>There was tenderness in Beckett\u2019s eyes. It wasn\u2019t the same kind of tenderness a man might show the younger sibling of an old friend.</p><p>And his hands. The way that he touched her... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The way that they stood.

Katie was a good kid. She didn\u2019t sleep around, she didn\u2019t drink herself silly. But it looked as if Katie was going to be the one. Maybe not first...maybe that would be too obvious far too quickly. But Katie would be the one who mattered.</p><p>Katie wasn\u2019t as alarmed by what had happened as she was by the fact that David Beckett had followed her, that he had seen her.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t even try to explain.</p><p>I finally saw a ghost who might be Tanya. No, she probably is Tanya. She was in the cemetery today. I think she\u2019s trying to reach me. I thought there was something familiar about her, and, of course, there was. I\u2019ve seen her picture, I saw it years ago.</p><p>\u201cI could have sworn I saw an old friend,\u201d she lied. \u201cI mean, I could have sworn it, but...I guess I was wrong. I thought it was...Janis Seacloud,\u201d she said. She\u2019d had to search her mind swiftly for the name of anyone she had gone to school with whom she was certain had left town years ago and not returned. He wouldn\u2019t know her friends, of course. Still, a lie had to be as close to the truth as possible.</p> <p>Bartholomew was beside her, as well.</p><p>\u201cOh, good save, young lady,\u201d he told her. \u201cI mean, seriously, what was that? I thought you\u2019d lost your mind. And you say I\u2019m going to make you look crazy!

She liked the feel of them.</p><p>But they were still standing in the street, and she was looking more unbalanced every second.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I ran out in the middle of a song!\u201d she said. She turned, escaping his hold, and hurried back.</p> <p>She paused at the door, looking back at David. \u201cUm, thank you. I\u2019m sorry, didn\u2019t mean to alarm anyone... I\u2019m... Thanks!\u201d</p><p>She hurried back to the microphone at her station, and called up the group of partying girls she\u2019d helped choose a song. It was an old Madonna song, and the group had a lot of fun doing it. She felt unnerved, and prayed for the business of the place and the music to calm her sense of unease.</p><p>For God\u2019s sake, she\u2019d seen ghosts forever. Sometimes they approached her-most often they didn\u2019t. Only Bartholomew had ever decided that he needed a best friend among the living!</p><p>\u201cSteady, kid, steady,\u201d Bartholomew whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cDid you see her?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! And do you know every tourist walking down the street? Tourists are living, you\u2019re living. Does it mean that you know everyone? No! Just hold it together, Katie O\u2019Hara. And stay away from this whole thing. I know you\u2019re thinking that girl was Tanya. Maybe she was, maybe she wasn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t matter-you need to stay out of it and away from David.\u201d</p><p>Katie ignored him. She needed to get through the night.</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>\u201cBartholomew, you need to make up your mind. You said that you liked David, but you keep suggesting that he might be a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still may be a murderer.\u201d</p><p>She groaned and turned her attention to her computer.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Liam asked David as he took his chair next to his cousin.</p><p>\u201cBeats me. I\u2019ve never seen anyone with a look like that... She said she saw an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still bizarre,\u201d Liam noted. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll hang around and walk her home. I\u2019ve never seen Katie behave so oddly. And it looks like she\u2019s talking to herself.\u201d</p><p>Clarinda swept over to the table; she had heard Liam. \u201cAnything else for the moment, fellows? Oh, and she isn\u2019t talking to herself-she sings along with the music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cHow late does she keep the music going?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday night; she\u2019ll go to three,\u201d Clarinda said. \u201cJamie O\u2019Hara says that three is just right. By then, folks are in, and the place stays open, so people will stay. And hard-core karaoke folks can go down the street to Rick\u2019s. Share the wealth, so he says.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, arched a brow, saw they wanted nothing else at the moment and moved on to check on other tables.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about hanging around,\u201d David told Liam. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve known Katie a long time now. And...there\u2019s an interesting, rowdy crew in here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, I don\u2019t work in the morning. You do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. You stay. But don\u2019t decide she\u2019s all right, okay? Make sure you see her all the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d David promised.</p><p>Soon after Liam left, Sam walked over to his table. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlowly.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded and lifted his beer, indicating Danny Zigler, who was busing a table nearby. \u201cThere\u2019s a suspicious character for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDanny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrawny little fellow just making his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Which makes you wonder if such a scrawny little fellow just making his way would have the capability of planning out such a murder,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t count him out,\u201d Sam said morosely.</p><p>Katie announced the last singer of the evening and Marty went up to do a Jimmy Buffett song. When he was done, Katie started closing down the equipment. She announced that if anyone wanted to keep on singing, they could head down Duval to Rick\u2019s.</p><p>A few moments later, Katie joined them at the table. She seemed pleased to meet Sam, told him that it was good to see him. \u201cYou were in the other night, weren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked him. \u201cBut you\u2019ve shaved since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObservant girl!\u201d Sam noted.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was quite a beard!\u201d</p><p>Sam seemed to like Katie, which seemed equally natural. She spoke softly with a sweet voice, her eyes were like crystal and her scent was definitely compelling. She was a beautiful young woman.</p><p>If a little strange! She had almost appeared to be in some kind of a trance when she had walked out so suddenly.</p><p>Katie frowned, listening, and turned toward the doors. David realized there was some kind of disturbance going on in the street.</p><p>David didn\u2019t say anything-he gave her a glance that told her he would check it out. He walked to the door. There was a bar fight going on. Pete Dryer was there, a big man, holding the battling drunks apart from one another. He saw David. \u201cGet the little one, running down the street, David!\u201d</p><p>David went after the man. He looked to be about twenty-one or twenty-two, and it wasn\u2019t any problem getting him-he ducked and shrank, putting his hands up. \u201cHey, you got me, you got me, don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. The cop down the street wants to talk to you, that\u2019s all,\u201d David said. \u201cTurn around, and head on back.\u201d</p><p>The kid did so. He looked younger, and terrified.</p><p>Two bigger fellows had been cowed. They stood on either side of Pete. \u201cAll right, what the hell is going on here?\u201d Pete demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat little shit robbed me!\u201d one fellow said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my brother. He didn\u2019t rob you,\u201d the other big guy said.</p><p>Pete looked at the kid. \u201cDid you rob him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no! That stripper came out and started busing him all up-I didn\u2019t take anything from him. Check my pockets!\u201d the younger kid said.</p><p>Pete arched a brow. The kid pulled out his pockets. He had only his own wallet, which contained his ID. He was Lewis Agaro, age twenty-one, and he had ten bucks, an ATM card and one credit card, in his name.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you three doing together?\u201d Pete asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not together. That thug just suddenly started going after my little brother!\u201d one man said explosively.</p><p>\u201cHey, sorry, man! So, now, come on, let\u2019s go after the stripper!\u201d the other man said.</p><p>\u201cWhat stripper?\u201d Pete asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, what the hell, she\u2019s gone now, what do you think?\u201d the apparent robbery victim asked.</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll take a report from the robbery victim-the two of you need to get to your rooms for tonight, cause no more trouble, or I\u2019ll see that you\u2019re locked up for your vacation, and you\u2019re not going to find any margaritas or hurricanes or any other such concoction when you\u2019re in my custody!\u201d</p><p>Pete looked at David. \u201cHell, I\u2019m not even on duty!\u201d he moaned. \u201cI was going to join you guys for a drink. I got a car coming. I think I know which lovely little stripper is at her pocket-picking again. I\u2019ll have to find her.\u201d</p><p>David grinned. \u201cTomorrow, Pete,\u201d he said. He had come halfway down the street. When he turned around and went back into the bar, Katie was gone.</p><p>He caught Clarinda by the arm, his touch far more forceful than he had intended. \u201cWhere\u2019s Katie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone, she went on home.\u201d</p><p>There must have been a look of alarm on his face.</p><p>\u201cI tell her all the time not to go alone!\u201d Clarinda said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right,\u201d David said. \u201cWhich way does she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown Simonton,\u201d Clarinda said. \u201cMake her call me!\u201d</p><p>David turned and headed out, running around the corner to the back. Almost two blocks ahead, he could see Katie.</p><p>Between them, he could see Sam Barnard. His heart leapt to his throat. Sam had to be watching out for her.</p><p>Why was Sam following her late at night, though? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKatie!\u201d He shouted her name.</p><p>Both Katie and Sam stopped, and turned back. Katie seemed surprised to see him; so did Sam.</p><p>\u201cSam, where are you heading?\u201d he asked, moving up.</p> <p>\u201cMy B and B is down the street,\u201d Sam said. He blushed. \u201cI\u2019m staying at Artist House. We don\u2019t have a place anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, it\u2019s a beautiful place,\u201d David said. They walked together on down to Katie where she waited.</p><p>\u201cA couple of drunks got rowdy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Pete was there.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cPete doesn\u2019t have to deal with the drunks much these days. He must have been ticked that they acted up right in front of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cHey, a cop is a cop,\u201d Sam said. He stood awkwardly for a moment. \u201cWell, good night. See you all. Tomorrow, I imagine. Hey, Katie, you got your act up tomorrow night, too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunday, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cGood night, Sam.\u201d</p><p>Sam walked on. The streets were quiet. Katie waited, looking at David. \u201cI was trying to walk you home,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see you in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They walked in silence for a minute. They reached her house and she opened the door. She seemed to hesitate, as if she was about to ask him in, but wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>He waited.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWell, keep your door locked, all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her smile deepened. In the muted light her eyes were truly a crystal that seemed hypnotic. He reminded himself that she was Sean\u2019s little sister.</p><p>But Sean\u2019s little sister had grown up.</p> <p>\u201cWell, good night,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>She closed the door; he heard her lock it. He turned and walked slowly back to the Beckett house.</p><p>He paused on the street. He loved the house but tonight, it seemed cold, empty and forlorn.</p><p>And down the street, he could see the museum. He wasn\u2019t given to anything illogical, but it seemed that night that the museum had a life of its own. It looked large in the shadows, dark and evil.</p><p>Irritated, he let himself into the house he now owned. He went to bed, and lay awake a long time, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>Katie was exhausted, but the events of the past few days seemed to rush through her mind. She was restless, jumping at sounds. But then she grew angry with herself; she wasn\u2019t easily scared. For God\u2019s sake, it wasn\u2019t as if she thought there was a ghost in her closet.</p><p>There might be a ghost in her closet, but if there was, she wasn\u2019t afraid of it! Ghosts reached out. They needed help. They weren\u2019t evil puffs of air or mist or...whatever. They were lost, and frequently, in pain.</p><p>She wondered then if there were evil ghosts. In her experience, no. For her, they were a part of life-just like allergies were to some people. Sometimes startling and annoying, and sometimes, like Bartholomew, they just seemed to hang around endlessly.</p><p>She was fond of Bartholomew. And he actually made her feel safe. In his odd, ghostly way, he was a very good friend. He was fond of her, as well.</p><p>She thought about David, and what he believed-that surely there was nothing in the world beyond the obvious. David wouldn\u2019t be a big believer in ghosts.</p><p>She tried counting sheep. That was ridiculous. She looked at the clock. It was 4:00 a.m. She prayed for sleep.</p><p>At last, she drifted off, and then fell deeply asleep. She woke slowly in the morning, feeling the coolness of her sheets, hearing the hum of the air conditioner. Her drapes were closed, but the sun was filtering into her room. It was day; she had rested. And she felt good.</p><p>She stretched, and then rolled over, cuddling her pillow, wanting just a few more minutes in bed.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>Despite herself, she screamed.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone in bed. The woman she had seen on Duval was there, lying next to her, staring into her eyes.</p><p>The woman was dead.</p><p>Her eyes were wide open, huge and blue, and staring sightlessly.</p><p>She was a ghost, of course...</p><p>The ghost of Tanya Barnard.</p><p>No matter where he went, no matter the project, David preferred staying close to the sea.</p><p>Actually, one thing that he had missed about home was the guarantee that the water was going to be temperate and beautiful. Sure, in the middle of winter even the Atlantic and the Gulf could be cold. But usually, nine months out of the year at least, the water was beautiful.</p><p>Today he felt the need for the water. He thought best when he was in the water, and he wasn\u2019t feeling close enough to anyone else from his past to ask for company-not true, he\u2019d have asked Katie O\u2019Hara, except that she had kept her distance the night before- and though he knew damned well he shouldn\u2019t plan on going out by himself, he was going to do so. He\u2019d had good friends, expert divers, who had actually died by believing that they were so good they didn\u2019t need company. He preached diving with a buddy.</p><p>But today, he was going to live recklessly. He was going out alone.</p><p>He knew that his grandfather had kept the Lucky Life in good repair at the dock; he knew that Liam took the boat out often enough, as well. He walked the distance to the boat, knowing that Liam kept dive equipment on her. The dive shop right at the docks rented tanks, and he could also buy sandwiches, water and beer.</p><p>Lainie Regent still worked at the dive shop; she greeted him and rented him four tanks with thirty minutes each. These would work as long as he controlled his breathing and kept his dives around sixty feet. He assured her he wasn\u2019t doing any of the deep wrecks, and that he\u2019d be fine.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, David,\u201d Lainie told him. \u201cBe nice if you stuck around a bit. Hey! I saw some of your work in that national earth-thingy magazine. David, what great pictures!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lainie.\u201d He bid her goodbye without making any commitments and headed on down to the Lucky Life. Craig had never really been much of a fisherman; in his younger days, he\u2019d been an avid diver. The boat was designed to that end with eight tank holds, a freshwater hose and bucket, a small cabin with a very small working galley and a head. Since David had been gone, sonar equipment and global positioning had been added.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>He checked his gas, then started to slip the ties that tethered the boat to the dock.</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d</p><p>He looked up, startled by the sense of pleasure that seemed to wash over him.</p><p>Warmly.</p><p>Hotly.</p><p>Katie O\u2019Hara was hurrying down the dock toward him. She was wearing deck shoes, shorts, a bikini top with an open long-sleeved shirt over it and a huge, floppy sun hat. She was all long legs and flowing hair, and she seemed to make his heart beat too hard, his libido to flip about. He kept his features rigid, thinking of the years he had been gone, the women who had come and gone from his life, many nice, kind, cute, beautiful, intelligent-and some not. They had all been friends, but all like ships at sea, passing in high and low waters, in storm and in calm.</p><p>None had made him feel this way, and he had to wonder why.</p><p>He barely knew her.</p><p>And she was Sean\u2019s little sister.</p><p>\u201cHey, Katie,\u201d he said, pausing. He frowned. \u201cHow did you know where I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly have a phone number for you,\u201d she apologized. \u201cI called Liam. Then I did try you, but you\u2019re not answering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, my stuff is thrown in the cabin.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She looked like she had the night before.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you looking for me? Is something wrong, has something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, nothing is wrong and nothing has happened. I guess I wanted to talk to you, mull things over more. Now that I\u2019m here, I think you need company. It\u2019s dangerous to dive alone, you know.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. She sounded like one of the very serious and professional instructors they might have had when they\u2019d been young, just old enough for certification.</p><p>\u201cClimb aboard,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you heading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSand Key-nothing deep. I\u2019m looking for something peaceful, protected...lots of fish, clear water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me. Do I need more tanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make two dives-and I imagine you have to be back for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good. Climb aboard.\u201d</p><p>She hopped on, releasing the last loop as she did so and winding the lines. She knew the boats; she knew diving.</p><p>They were conchs.</p><p>He kept his speed slow while exiting the no-wake zone, then picked up as they headed out in a southwesterly direction. The sound of the motor kept them from talking much, nothing more than, \u201cWant a water?\u201d And, \u201cSure!\u201d And then his thank-you to her as she produced the plastic bottles from the ice chest.</p><p>At last he slowed the boat; there were charters out in the area and a number of smaller craft, as well. He set their dive flag out, and went for his equipment.</p><p>She slipped into a skin, telling him that she hated running into jellyfish, and they helped one another with their tanks, rinsed their masks, held them and back-dove into the water. He had taken one of his underwater digital cameras for the day, not planning to do any professional work, but seldom without a camera.</p><p>It was good to have Katie with him.</p><p>It was good to be down.</p><p>The deepest the area went was seventy-five feet or so, but most of the reefs and the fish were found at depths shallow enough for snorkelers to enjoy the water, too.</p><p>They kept a distance of about five feet apart, and the dive was everything he\u2019d wanted. Crystal clear water, just cool enough to be pleasant, warm enough to be comfortable. Tangs in a variety of colors shot around the reef, anemones flared and larger fish appeared as well, one giant grouper, a curious barracuda that politely kept its distance and, beneath them, a number of little nurse sharks.</p><p>Katie, in her light dive skin, hair flaring out around her, eyes large and beautiful behind her mask, made a perfect subject for quick takes with his camera. She frowned when he first started snapping, but he shrugged, and he saw her smile around her regulator. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s what I do, he reminded her silently.</p><p>Especially where there was such an abundance of colors. And since they weren\u2019t deep, the sunlight penetrated beautifully. He had shot and filmed in so many exotic places. And yet, his own backyard offered some of the most enchanting underwater locations around.</p><p>He saw something in the sand and headed down, touching the granules to find a little ray nestled there, happy to move, even sit in his hand and puff as Katie joined him. He shot the little ray, and Katie\u2019s finger just brushed a wing. But then her attention was diverted.</p> <p>And it was while they were there, kneeling in the sand at about forty feet, that Katie suddenly made one of her startling and frightening changes again.</p><p>She was touching the little ray...</p><p>Then she was frozen.</p><p>Staring wide-eyed.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t breathing. No bubbles were escaping from her regulator.</p> <p>He dropped his camera and the ray and gripped her shoulder. Her eyes met his. He couldn\u2019t begin to understand what he was seeing in them. And those eyes of hers, framed and huge behind the lenses of her mask...</p><p>She didn\u2019t appear to be afraid of him.</p><p>In fact...</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid at all.</p><p>She suddenly looked as if she were about to cry.</p><p>He tapped her chest. She inhaled; her bubbles began again.</p> <p>He signaled that they go topside. She shook her head, but he was firm. She lowered her head, and then she nodded.</p><p>He crawled up the stern ladder first, doffing his flippers and then, once up, his tank. She removed her flippers and threw them over and he reached to help her up with the weight of her tank. She stripped off her dive skin and accepted the bottle of water he gave her. He studied her, and waited for her to speak.</p><p>She sat in the cushioned seat behind the helm and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cKatie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She looked at him and smiled.</p><p>\u201cKatie, what the hell is going on with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She looked out at the water. She started to speak, hesitated, then didn\u2019t. Then she looked at him. \u201cDo you...do you believe in dreams, or hunches, or...I don\u2019t know, the mind trying to tell us things that maybe we just can\u2019t really understand logically?\u201d</p><p>Like seeing an image in the sea of Tanya trying to communicate?</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cKatie...no. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExperts know that our dreams reflect our lives,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost, Katie. What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to be lost. Her hair was tousled and soaked and flying around her head, and she was just curled on the cushion, staring off. She was still beautiful. He wanted to reach out, touch her, tell her that whatever it was, it was okay.</p><p>Her legs were endless, muscled and lean, her breasts were full against the bathing-suit top. She had a belly-button ring, a little dangling silver dolphin, and it made her belly seem like the most desirable stretch of bronzed flesh ever imagined...</p><p>\u201cI just had a dream last night, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood dream, bad dream?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cGood dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me about it?\u201d he asked. It wouldn\u2019t explain what had happened in the water, but it might lead to an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to laugh at me-or hate me,\u201d she turned her gaze from the sea to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I swear, I won\u2019t laugh at you. And,\u201d he added, hearing his own voice grow huskier, \u201cI won\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><p>She spoke quickly, suddenly. \u201cI dreamed about Tanya.\u201d</p><p>He started to move; the words made him want to bolt, no matter what he had said.</p><p>\u201cIt was a good dream,\u201d Katie said. Her hand fell on his knee.</p><p>His knee had never felt so naked. Nor had he had ever known that a kneecap could suddenly be such an erogenous zone.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said. His voice was tight.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know who had killed her in the dream. She did know that you didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. We can put that in the newspaper.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. She looked as if she would have walked away from him-if she could have walked away.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t really believe in that kind of thing. I mean, maybe dreams are a reflection of our lives. You don\u2019t want me to be guilty, and since I swear to God I\u2019m not, I\u2019m grateful that you feel that way. But...\u201d He leaned toward her. A mistake. She still smelled faintly of her intoxicating cologne, even though she was drenched in salt water. She seemed to emit an aura of warmth that lured him closer, or made him want to drown in touching her.</p><p>He eased back. \u201cKatie, last night was scary. And freezing like that when you\u2019re diving, well, that\u2019s damned scary. Why did you freeze in the water?\u201d</p><p>She looked away again and chewed on a thumbnail. She shook her head. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cKatie-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I believe in dreams. And it\u2019s nice. She loved you-in my dream. She knows that you\u2019re innocent-in my dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is. But I dreamed about her.\u201d She inhaled. \u201cAnd then I saw her in the water. Not in a bad way. She\u2019s trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d David said sharply. What was this? Was she taunting him somehow? Torturing him. Foolish, it was long ago. His heart had hardened.</p><p>Not enough, maybe.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t taunting him. Maybe it was worse. Maybe she was just crazy. He didn\u2019t want her to be crazy. He cared about her...far too quickly, and far too deeply. He needed to remain rational.</p><p>\u201cKatie, I am a big believer in the power of suggestion. And with everything going on...\u201d</p><p>He let his voice trail with its own logical suggestion.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it, of course. It\u2019s nice, though, that this kind of power of suggestion is a good one-the images I\u2019m seeing in my crazy little suggestible mind seem fond of you, hurt for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, look, I didn\u2019t mean anything by what I said.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her watch, all business all of a sudden. \u201cOh, Lord, I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s gotten so late. We need to head back-I have to get to work. I ruined your diving day. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d She was sincere and contrite. And she didn\u2019t seem to be really angry with him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. I\u2019m not,\u201d he told her softly. And he did touch her. He touched her cheek, and he met her eyes, and he realized that whatever it was that made a man attracted to one woman and not another, he had just found it in Katie. He wasn\u2019t just attracted. He was entwined.</p><p>He stood. \u201cGrab a few of the sandwiches. We\u2019ll eat while we motor back in.\u201d</p><p>She nodded; he pulled in the flag and the anchor while she went about pulling food from the ice chest. He chewed on a ham-and-cheese-on-wheat while she stood next to him, facing the wind and the spray while they motored back in to the dock. He slowed his speed and followed the markers until they reached the dock. Katie jumped out with the ties.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ll start rinsing equipment,\u201d she called to him.</p><p>\u201cNo, go on. It\u2019s nothing-I\u2019ve got it. Get cleaned up for work,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She stood on the dock, looking down at him. Now, she was just in her bikini. It wasn\u2019t a super-string thing or anything like that, just hip-hugging bottoms and a bra top.</p><p>Lord, but she was beautifully built. Athletic, curved, lean...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Katie. You\u2019re working. I\u2019m not. Get going.\u201d</p><p>She still stared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at O\u2019Hara\u2019s later,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>It seemed a fire started in his chest. Or his loins. He couldn\u2019t really tell. It was just burning everywhere.</p><p>He handed up the rest of her belongings, watched her slide into her oversize shirt and shorts and then turn and start home.</p><p>He plowed into the ice chest for a beer, and sat on the chest then for a moment, puzzled, staring after her.</p><p>It was still fairly early, afternoon. Daylight. Sun was streaming down on the island.</p><p>But he was worried. About Katie.</p><p>He forgot the equipment and the boat. Or, they were there, in the back of his mind. But they would wait.</p><p>He slid into his deck shoes and leapt to the dock and went racing after her.</p><p>The streets were crowded today. Sunday. People were shopping, taking dive-and-snorkel and party boats, Jet Skis and more. They were eating and drinking, and buzzing slowly around on scooters.</p><p>He raced from the wharf to Front Street. He could see Katie turning off, right before Two Friends bar and restaurant. He followed.</p><p>He reached her in time to see her enter her house and close the door behind her.</p><p>He stood still on the street, wondering about her earlier words.</p><p>He could see no one who seemed to be paying the least attention to him.</p><p>He looked up to the windows in the old Victorian and Deco houses around him. No one seemed to be peeking down from behind shutters or curtains.</p><p>And yet, he could swear that he was being watched. He was being watched because...</p><p>Katie had been followed.</p><p>7</p><p>Stella Martin woke in the late afternoon. It was late, and she was startled to have slept so long. She bolted up, looked around and smiled.</p><p>The night hadn\u2019t started out well. She\u2019d not been able to resist the temptation to pick a jerk\u2019s pocket up on Duval. She\u2019d seen the commotion that had followed. She\u2019d felt bad for the kid who was accused-so she\u2019d followed him.</p><p>She\u2019d seen his brother leave him, taking off with a pathetically sluttish rich girl who\u2019d sauntered out of the Irish bar. So much for heading back to their rooms as they\u2019d been told!</p><p>She\u2019d managed to snare the kid-who knew that she\u2019d ripped off the other guy. It was a great joke between them. She laughed with him, got to know him and arranged to meet him back at his hotel room after her shift. The kid had been to the ATM machine and was rich. If not rich, Mommy and Daddy were very well off. The two brothers weren\u2019t even sharing a room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d had a number of drinks. Now he was still sleeping. Snoring. Usually, she hated men who snored. But this kid probably was barely twenty-one. He had long dark hair that fell over his forehead and eyes now as he slept, and he was kind of cute. He\u2019d actually been fun, too. No finesse, but he could fuck like the proverbial bunny. She hadn\u2019t even been tempted to charge him more for going at it again and again. It had been fantastic. Most of the time she was exhausted in an hour, trying to coax a middle-aged drunk asshole into getting it up.</p><p>Ah, the kid was cute. Thanks to him and his room, she\u2019d eluded all the cops.</p><p>A smile curved into her features. A few of them, she was certain, would always let her go on purpose. They really wouldn\u2019t want to have her talking to them down at the station.</p> <p>She slipped out of bed and gathered her clothing quickly-she was just as good at dressing quickly as she was at undressing slowly. His wallet was sitting on the dresser, and she had to pause. She wouldn\u2019t take all his money. Just fifty-the kid would still have over a hundred bucks on him. He probably had no idea of how much money he had left anyway. She also took his credit card. She saw his ID. She smiled. Touching. He was an art major at U of M. Silly kids. They came from other states, and they couldn\u2019t wait to get down to the decadence of Duval Street. It was such a bizarre place. She worked one of the strip clubs. Eighteen-year-olds could walk into any strip club. They couldn\u2019t drink, which meant they couldn\u2019t go into a few of the bars that offered karaoke. Stella found that ironic. Kids could watch strippers, but they couldn\u2019t sing. Well, it worked for her.</p><p>She counted the money she\u2019d stuffed into her pocket from the night before. It had been so easy to lift the wallet off that big bruiser-and funny, too, to see the idiot attack the guys walking behind him. What an oaf.</p><p>But, thanks to the oaf and the kid, she\u2019d had one hell of a good night. She counted her hundreds, smiled and slipped out the door.</p><p>Luckily, he\u2019d been staying at one of the inns right off Duval that had a back entrance. There was a stone wall, but it was low, and she scrambled over it quickly. Coming along the sidewalk, she turned onto Duval Street.</p><p>There were a couple of mounted cops down the street, so she slid into a bar. She ordered a beer quickly, and turned her back to the street.</p> <p>The mounted cops went by.</p><p>Stella finished her beer, paid and tipped-she always tipped well-and started out on Duval again.</p><p>She swore when she walked right into him.</p><p>\u201cStella,\u201d he said.</p><p>He was one of her few johns who wasn\u2019t married. He was a creep. She knew it. Maybe other people didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou smell like stale sex, Stella. Bad booze, bad money and stinky, old sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she said, and pushed by him.</p><p>Her heart thundered for a minute. He could do bad things if he wanted. But it was broad daylight. Hell, it didn\u2019t matter what the light was.</p><p>She quickened her pace, but when she turned around, he wasn\u2019t there. She kept on moving, and passed the church.</p><p>She heard the sound of a siren. Damn, the cops!</p><p>The ice-cream parlor was right ahead.</p><p>She ran inside it, her back to the street.</p><p>She winced. Danny, yeah, Danny was supposed to be here!</p> <p>It didn\u2019t matter; she just needed to stand here for a minute. She set her hands on the counter. It was sticky. She shoved her hands into her pockets, making a face.</p><p>The cop car was passing.</p><p>Then Danny was back. With that way that he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cIce cream? Really, Stella?\u201d</p><p>The way that he looked at her...</p><p>He was sad, he was angry.</p><p>\u201cDanny-\u201d</p><p>The cop car was gone.</p><p>\u201cDanny-oh, whatever!\u201d she said.</p><p>She turned away, and decided that she really had to get off the main streets. She hurried outside and around the church. She could hear a car, and she started running, paranoid now.</p><p>She cut through one of the yards. Damn it-she knew too many men in this town. Knew them too intimately.</p><p>Maybe he was in a car. He might have gotten his car, and he could be following her in it now.</p><p>No. Why on earth would he do that?</p><p>To harass her.</p><p>He was a creep.</p><p>She cut into a yard and crawled through palms and crotons that grew heavily there. She looked at the street. No car.</p><p>She started to turn around, aware of a sound behind her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t able to turn. Something came over her head. A plastic bag. She grabbed at it, incredulous. Hands wound around her neck. The world began to grow black.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be happening...</p><p>She was vaguely aware of sirens. She tried to fight; to live. Help was coming. The sirens came closer, closer...</p><p>And the sound moved away. Help might be coming for someone, but not for her.</p><p>And the blackness swamped over her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re falling apart-you are simply falling apart,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cI\u2019d slap you across the cheek to wake you up and make you see clearly-if I could,\u201d he added sternly.</p><p>They were just inside the house, and he was clearly agitated.</p><p>\u201cAll this time, I keep asking you about the lady in white. She ignores you, you ignore her. Now you have this new ghost appearing and disappearing, and you\u2019ve gone straight to pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not just any ghost,\u201d Katie said. \u201cAnd you saw her last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see her today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t with me down there when I was diving with David. You\u2019re afraid of the water!\u201d Katie accused him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of it. I can swim,\u201d he argued indignantly. \u201cI can\u2019t see why I should go down getting soaked and wet when there\u2019s no reason for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you really get wet?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean, do ghosts get wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the thought and the memory,\u201d he said, and shuddered. \u201cYou swim when your boat sinks, when you\u2019re under attack, when it\u2019s your only recourse. Not for the pleasure of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. How dirty and icky were you?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cI bathed!\u201d he protested. \u201cWhen possible. I wasn\u2019t repulsive in the least. I had amazing hygiene habits for my day and you are getting completely off the subject here. Katie, you must stop being so hypnotized by this ghost!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s a true pity that you don\u2019t go into water for the pleasure of it, and you didn\u2019t follow David and me down on that dive. Then you\u2019d understand. The ghost is Tanya. She\u2019s trying to communicate with me-she just doesn\u2019t know how. It\u2019s very bizarre, really. She\u2019s trying so hard to reach out. But...I understand her a bit because...there\u2019s something in her eyes. She can materialize, but she fades so quickly. I can see her try to whisper, but she\u2019s so hard to hear. Maybe she hasn\u2019t been a ghost long enough-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen years,\u201d Bartholomew noted.</p><p>\u201cAnd the lady in white, the one who fascinates you? She doesn\u2019t know how to communicate and she\u2019s been a ghost for nearly two hundred years, I\u2019d reckon.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew plopped down on the sofa in the parlor. \u201cYou be careful, or they will lock you up. I don\u2019t enjoy jails-modern or otherwise-and I know that I wouldn\u2019t at all enjoy a mental hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s just great-coming from you. Bartholomew, Tanya was in my bed this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery rude,\u201d he said. \u201cI would never dream of disturbing the sanctity of your private quarters!\u201d</p><p>Katie ignored his words. She hurried on. \u201cAnd then in the water. Bartholomew, I told you, you had to have been there. She appeared slowly in the sea dust, as if she gained her image from the particles of plankton and microscopic debris... She formed right behind him, and she looked so, so sad, and she touched his shoulder and his cheek. I could have sworn that there were tears in her eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the water?\u201d Bartholomew mocked.</p><p>\u201cShe looked sad, as if she was crying-yes, in the water! She wants me to know, even if she can\u2019t tell me who did do it, that he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. She was murdered. If she knows who did do it, she needs to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t know. Her attacker might have struck from the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen if she doesn\u2019t know who did do it, how does she know that it wasn\u2019t David Beckett?\u201d Bartholomew demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe might have known where he was at the time of her death-and if he was nowhere near her, it couldn\u2019t have been him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do need to stop running about in a trance. He will think that you\u2019re as daft as a loon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I have it under control. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d he said. He looked at his pocket watch. \u201cTime\u2019s a-wasting, my dear.\u201d</p><p>She spun on him and started up the stairs.</p><p>David washed down his equipment, rinsed himself off and headed back to the house for a real shower. After that, he went out to find Danny Zigler.</p><p>He was serving ice cream. He grinned at David. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll take a shake. Vanilla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>David paid him, adding a handsome tip.</p><p>\u201cHey, thanks, David, you don\u2019t have to go overboard. I\u2019m not a charity case, you know. I keep working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I see that. I was so surprised to see you at O\u2019Hara\u2019s last night. I thought you were doing the ghost tours. And, hell, the crowds on weekends are huge. Didn\u2019t think you could take time off like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I miss doing the weekend tours. Thing is, all the companies out there have hired on too many people. Most can work weekends, around their other jobs, you know? I can work weeknights, and to be honest, I don\u2019t like an overcrowded tour. I like to be able to tell the stories good, you know? And when there are too many people, half of \u2019em don\u2019t hear you, and when you repeat all kinds of stuff, you lose the whole effect,\u201d Danny said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know what you mean. Too many in a group, and you just don\u2019t get the effect,\u201d David agreed. \u201cWell, thanks. See ya, Danny. Oh-you working at O\u2019Hara\u2019s tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI start at ten there. I am taking out an eight-o\u2019clock tour tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p> <p>David waved, and headed down the street. He walked toward La Concha Hotel, and around to the stand where ghost-tour tickets were sold. A young girl was selling tickets. He asked her about Danny Zigler. \u201cOh, yeah, he\u2019s working tonight. Eight o\u2019clock. He\u2019s a good guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It surprises me that you all don\u2019t use him all the time,\u201d David said.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not management. But I think that Danny likes his other jobs, too. Strange fellow, but a good storyteller!\u201d</p><p>David bought a ticket and moved out of the way for the couple who waited behind him. He glanced at his watch, and headed back home. He had left the police files on his grandfather\u2019s desk. He set an alarm to warn him when it would be nearing eight.</p><p>A long, hot shower and shampoo felt wonderful, rinsing away the cakey salt and effects of the sun and the sea. Katie lingered under the flow of water, then emerged regretfully at last, aware that she should be conserving water-and that she was pruning.</p> <p>She slipped into a terry robe and towel-dried her hair, then studied her reflection in the mirror. Wet, she decided, was really not her look. But too bad-she loved the water too much.</p><p>She looked over at the bathroom cabinet, choosing a moisturizer.</p><p>When she looked back at the mirror, there was someone behind her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Tanya. It was a different entity. She had dark hair, too much makeup and her eyes were red and slightly bulging.</p><p>A tear slipped down her astral cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Katie whispered. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p> <p>The girl remained, that tear sliding down her face.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Katie whispered again. \u201cI\u2019m not nine-one-one for ghosts. I don\u2019t know how to help you. I don\u2019t know who you are!\u201d she whispered vehemently.</p><p>She closed her eyes, praying for the image to go away. She opened her eyes. It did.</p><p>Her hands were shaking when she reached for her cosmetic base and looked back to the mirror.</p><p>The image was back.</p><p>The girl was no longer crying. She was just standing there, staring at Katie, as if she were in shock. Her face was starkly white. Her features seemed to have shriveled. Her eyes were clouded with red dots.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could help you!\u201d Katie whispered. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>The image faded.</p> <p>Katie collected her makeup and went running down the stairs.</p><p>Bartholomew was perched at the kitchen counter. He stared at her, frowning. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother ghost,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked annoyed. \u201cWhat is this-spirit central?\u201d he demanded. \u201cThis is my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my house,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cActually, Katie, once upon a time, I lived in the upstairs bedroom. Well, I didn\u2019t live there, I spent a great deal of time there. Eighteen twenty-six, to be exact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this house-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the house has been rebuilt. It was just a tiny wooden structure at the time. The place was a shantytown, really, except for some of the places built by big money. Simontons and Whiteheads... Anyway, I had a girl for a while. She wasn\u2019t the kind you brought home to mother. But she was one hell of a woman. Never mind, that\u2019s not the point. This is my haunt. You\u2019re my mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being selfish,\u201d Katie said, feeling a new strength. \u201cThey need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone needs help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was murdered,\u201d Katie said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cMost ghosts were murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Hemingway killed himself, and he\u2019s haunting this country, Spain and Cuba, so I understand,\u201d Katie argued.</p><p>Bartholomew sighed. \u201cKatie, don\u2019t let them in. I\u2019m afraid for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBartholomew, I\u2019m not saying she was murdered this minute. It might have been years ago. Like...Tanya. Maybe it was the same person.\u201d</p><p>He swung off the bar stool and came before her, planting his hands on his hips. \u201cKatie, I am very afraid for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean will be here in another day or two and then I won\u2019t be living alone. I\u2019ll be fine. And I know the cops- I know everyone on the street. I\u2019m from here, Bartholomew. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s what Tanya Barnard thought!\u201d he said dourly. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t be leaving you alone for a moment,\u201d he assured her. He looked her up and down in her terry robe, her makeup clustered in her hands. \u201cAnd you are afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was startled, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that robe is going to make a lovely outfit when you go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was startled. I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you and guard the hallway, if you\u2019d like to return to your bathroom and further prepare for the evening,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She lowered her head, smiling. He could trip people; he could now press the on button to start the coffee brewing. She still wasn\u2019t sure he could actually guard her. But he was quite the gentleman ghost.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she told him.</p><p>But when she returned upstairs, no matter how many times she looked into the mirror and then away from it, no ghosts appeared.</p><p>The first ghost, she knew, was Tanya.</p><p>But who the hell was the dark-haired woman with the tear glistening on her cheek?</p><p>As David had expected, evenly dividing the crowd that night left about forty people in each tour group. He was tall, and he stayed toward the back.</p><p>Key West was full of ghosts. Naturally. Since it was a walking ghost-tour, it didn\u2019t take in the cemetery, the Hemingway House, or many other spots reputed to be harboring ghosts. That was all right. There were many haunted places to still go to on the tour. Captain Tony\u2019s was haunted by those who had died at the hanging tree-and those sixteen souls whose remains were found when work was done on the place.</p><p>Another favorite stop was an abandoned theater near Duval that was supposedly haunted by the souls of sixteen children who had burned to death there in the midst of a marital scandal-a spurned husband had meant to kill his wife, so people suspected. Instead, he had killed the children. Some of their little bones remained in St. Paul\u2019s Church yard, where the children were still heard to sigh with the breeze on a quiet night. Visitors standing beneath the theater overhang heard the soft cries as well-and the scent of smoke was still on the air, all these long years later.</p><p>Artist House was on every tour. The Victorian mansion was stunning, of course, but the real draw was what happened in that house years ago. The story went that a servant of the owners of the house, the Otto family, had given their young son, Robert, a doll. The servant had come from the islands and practiced some kind of magic or voodoo.</p><p>Of course, since it was a hideous doll, many people had been convinced that the servant really hated the family. Robert stood about three feet tall, stuffed with straw, and wore a white sailor suit and hat. He had beady little eyes, and the kind of fabric face that was just creepy from the get-go. Having grown up with the story, David was truly amazed that someone in young Robert Eugene Otto\u2019s life hadn\u2019t gotten rid of the damned thing. Instead, the doll had stayed, Robert and his wife had been given the house and they had moved in. The doll spent years playing evil pranks.</p><p>But Robert loved the doll throughout his life. When his wife thought that he was preparing a nursery, it was really just a special room for Robert. Robert the Doll tormented Robert\u2019s wife-slowly driving her crazy. Although many believed that it was Robert who abused her and blamed the attacks on Robert the Doll. She outlived her husband and left Artist House, but allowed it to be rented-with the stipulation that Robert the Doll\u2019s room be kept and that he remain closed away in his special place.</p><p>Robert the Doll supposedly moved. He looked down at people on the sidewalk. He went from window to window.</p><p>Eventually, new owners took over-the doll was given to the East Martello Museum, and was still known, according to popular legend, to escape from his chamber. He was supposed to wreck film, or replace rolls of family film with pictures of himself.</p><p>Danny Zigler was an excellent guide and told all of these stories well. David could see the fear and awe he evoked in his listeners.</p><p>They walked toward the Beckett museum.</p><p>David thought that Danny told this particular story with relish, describing the dead Tanya with amazing detail. And though Danny never used his name, he suggested that someone prestigious had gotten away with murder, and that it had been a case of unrequited love.</p><p>Tanya, of course, according to Danny, roamed the now-defunct museum, crying out night after night, shrieking for justice.</p><p>David slipped away from the tour. He realized that his hands were clenched into fists at his side.</p><p>He\u2019d be damned sure to stay away from Danny until he\u2019d cooled down.</p><p>O\u2019Hara\u2019s was quieter than usual that night. Katie did a duet with Marty Jenkins to get it all started-a song from South Pacific, as Marty didn\u2019t seem to care much for any song that didn\u2019t have something to do with ships or the water-and then a soprano down from her job as a character in an Orlando theme-park musical came on and awed them all with a number from Chicago.</p><p>There weren\u2019t nearly as many inebriated people as on a Saturday night, but there was a group of ten students with the soprano who didn\u2019t have classes again until Tuesday, so Katie was kept busy. At eleven she decided that she needed a break, and she set the students up to do a six-minute version of \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d</p><p>David seemed to have chosen his table at O\u2019Hara\u2019s; he was there with Liam, Sam Barnard and Pete Dryer.</p><p>\u201cKatie, girl, lovely night, you keep it moving,\u201d Pete applauded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice crowd,\u201d she said. \u201cSo how about you, Pete? Sunday a better day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunday is usually a better day-except folks are moving in big-time now. Fantasy Fest is in the works,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cIt officially starts next Friday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, right. It will be super-busy,\u201d she said. She noted that David was barely listening to her; he was watching Danny Zigler.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m going to have a busy week no matter what,\u201d Pete said. \u201cI think I have a runaway stripper, and I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s the one who took off with that man\u2019s wallet last night.\u201d</p> <p>Liam laughed. \u201cA runaway stripper? Is there such a thing? I mean, a stripper is free to come and go as she chooses, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless she\u2019s wanted by the law for being a pickpocket,\u201d Pete said grimly.</p><p>\u201cBut did you see her?\u201d Liam asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see her. But lately, we\u2019ve only had one girl in trouble for helping herself to gents\u2019 wallets, instead of waiting for the bills in the garter-or whatever,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know she\u2019s missing?\u201d David asked, suddenly turning his attention to Pete.</p> <p>\u201cShe works at the Top-O-The-Top, and when I went to try to talk to her-warn her that I\u2019m on to her at the least-she hadn\u2019t shown up for work. One of the other girls told me that it was unusual. She likes money,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>\u201cWell, it is a Sunday night,\u201d Sam commented. \u201cWho knows? Maybe she heard about some better pickings up the islands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t find her by tomorrow, I\u2019ll put out an APB,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>\u201cPete, can we prove anything?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the kid\u2019s report-hell, yes, I can put out an APB. Anyway, good night, all. I\u2019m heading out,\u201d Pete told them.</p><p>The college kids were having a good time, and they did so without being smashed or obnoxious. Katie kept the music going longer than she had intended.</p> <p>Even so, David waited for her.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she told him, \u201cI\u2019ve been walking myself home for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look his way, but she added, \u201cPhysically walking my mortal self.\u201d</p><p>David seemed bemused by the comment. \u201cBut it is late and I am here. Do you mind?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m glad.\u201d She waved good-night to Clarinda.</p><p>\u201cZigler is gone,\u201d David noted.</p><p>\u201cI guess he took off early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStarted late, and took off early. Interesting,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been looking at him with daggers in your eyes all night,\u201d Katie commented.</p><p>\u201cI followed his tour around tonight,\u201d David said grimly.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what I heard on his tour, I\u2019d be scared of me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDanny is a good guy, though,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I guess there\u2019s no way to keep the tour guides from telling a story, especially if they can conjure a good ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what he does with all his money,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cWell, he isn\u2019t working jobs that set you in the upper stratosphere of income,\u201d Katie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cStill, he eats where he works, lives frugally... He must have some kind of a pastime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he hides all his money in his mattress. Wasn\u2019t there a crazy person who did that once?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cCrazy. Umm. There have been a lot of crazies down here. It must be the sun,\u201d David said.</p><p>They reached her house. He stood on the porch while she found her keys and fit one into the lock. The key turned and she looked at him. It seemed that she had no voice. She wanted to speak; she wanted to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d she asked. Oh, God, she sounded as if she was applying for a job as phone-sex girl.</p><p>He smiled and leaned against the door frame, not touching her, and yet looking at her in a way that made her feel as if he could send out rays of static heat.</p><p>\u201cIf I come in...well, it might be dangerous, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re dangerous,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant it really might be dangerous. I\u2019m torn- I want to be with you, but I\u2019m not so sure you should be seen with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh,\u201d she murmured and blushed, feeling incredibly awkward. She started to step past him but he blocked the way and she met his eyes again. They were deep royal-blue, a navy color that could be so dark it appeared black in the shadows. \u201cI would love to come in, if the offer still stands.\u201d</p><p>She paused, feeling as if the night could change everything, and then feeling foolish, as well. Sex. So many people fell into it so easily. She\u2019d never been able to play that game, she\u2019d never wanted something that didn\u2019t mean something. This felt like more. It was sex...it was intimate. Natural. Biology, something that happened between people. But she meant something to him; she knew it. She cared about him, equally.</p><p>\u201cI...I want you to come in.\u201d Ah, there she was, sounding like the phone-sex applicant again.</p><p>But he reached out, stroking a finger along her cheek and smoothing her hair back. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to want you, but I do,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI think...well, they do say there\u2019s just something that attracts certain people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink we should make love and experiment?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we are still on the porch.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, suddenly feeling sure of herself, and at ease. \u201cI like the idea best of us both knowing that we wanted...one another from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I really disliked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to think of it, I loathed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get in,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>They stepped inside. Katie closed and locked the door and wound up pinned against it. David leaned into her, and their lips met in their first kiss, something that seemed to ignite into an instant passion. It was a kiss, just a kiss, but hungry, wet, all over, openmouthed and so sensual that Katie heard a sound and realized that it was herself, it was a moan, but it was aggressive, and her hands were cradling his jaw, feeling the structure, holding him to her.</p><p>They broke breathlessly, staring at one another.</p><p>He kissed her again with a whisper, a brush of restraint and tenderness, and his eyes met hers and his lips formed hard and seeking over hers once again and their tongues filled one another\u2019s mouths.</p><p>She heard a groan. It wasn\u2019t him and it wasn\u2019t her.</p><p>\u201cOh, good God, woman, you\u2019ve got a room, go to it!\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>She started and jerked back. Bartholomew was leaning against the counter, appearing irritated and disturbed by the entire scene.</p><p>\u201cRoom!\u201d he said, waving a hand at her. \u201cGo, go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d David said. \u201cYou can pull back at any time, Katie. I swear, I\u2019ll leave at any time. Now, if that\u2019s what you want. You\u2019ve got to be sure.\u201d</p><p>She glared around his head at Bartholomew and pulled David back to her. But she practiced restraint. She kissed him, running her fingers over his shoulders up to his nape, and into his hair. It was so thick and rich. Touching his hair was arousing. She was in sad shape.</p><p>\u201cKatie, go!\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cYou go!\u201d she whispered over his shoulder.</p><p>David backed away. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d She caught his hand and headed up the stairs. She ran, pulling him behind her, then stopped suddenly.</p><p>Ghosts. Ghosts kept interrupting her life. Victims who wanted to speak to her...</p><p>Ghosts who needed her.</p><p>But not tonight!</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d David began.</p><p>She stopped him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m scared. But don\u2019t leave. I want you, I want this. It\u2019s just...the last time was Carl Waverly and I dated him all through college but then he wanted to get married and move to Seattle and I knew that I had to come home and that was...that was it and a long time ago, but don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t make more out of it than it is...oh, God, way more detail than you needed, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and laughed with a husky sound, and his eyes were dark and yet alive with a brilliance that seemed to be warmth or tenderness. \u201cIt was great detail,\u201d he assured her, and he pulled her against him and lifted her from her feet, sweeping her off them. Soft light came in gentle streaks where the drapes weren\u2019t completely closed and dust motes seemed to dance in a fantasy world. He laid her on the bed, and he came down beside her, kissing her as he began with the buttons of her blouse. For a second she was still, then it seemed the whole of her was on fire, and his movements weren\u2019t nearly fast enough. She writhed against him, finding buttons herself. She pressed her lips against his throat and his collarbone, working at his tailored shirt. Hers was slipping away at last, her breasts were free and her flesh was against his. Shadows made it easy, the glow of light made it beautiful. She felt his lips against her breast while his fingers found the belt buckle of her jeans, snap and zipper, and his fingers played erotically over the silk of her underwear while she shimmied from her jeans, tugging at his while she did so. She felt his muscles tense and ripple where she touched him, felt the crush of his mouth against hers, again the thrust and plunge of his tongue, deep and evocative. Somehow their clothing was gone, shed, a part of the tangle of coverlet and sheets on the bed and their hands and lips were everywhere. His mouth slid down the length of her, teased and tasted, while his fingers stroked up her inner thighs. There was a wonderful sense of power and strength about him, he was gentle and vital and vibrant. He seemed to know exactly where to touch and then kiss and caress, a slow burn started that seemed to flare out of control.</p><p>She felt herself explode within, and the feeling was growing again. He was over her, his eyes touching hers, and he moved into her, thrusting in a way that seemed to fill her completely and then stroked, moving with greater power and speed, reaching higher and higher, slowly, beginning again, leading her once again to a point where she exploded cataclysmically, shuddering and shaking in his arms, so sated that she felt she could die. She seemed to fall down in a field of clouds, except the clouds were sweaty and sleek, and it was amazing to be held against him with such a contrast of sensations filling her flesh and mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sex. Just sex. First sex. Awkward when the clothing was strewn and the pinnacle reached...</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. He came up on an elbow, and his smile was deep. His features were really masculine and beautiful, rugged, never pretty, and yet...beautiful.</p><p>\u201cUmm. You were well worth waiting for,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t wait that long,\u201d he said, smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cSeems like forever,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThank you. And...obviously, the point now is not to instantly jump your bones, so I suppose it will be all right if I tell you you are really amazingly beautiful and certainly, anyone could wait a lifetime for you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. It was easy being with him. Naked and panting, it was still easy. \u201cDid you get to Ireland in your travels?\u201d She teased. \u201cKiss the Blarney stone?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair, looked into her eyes. \u201cNever,\u201d he assured her. He held her against him, still studying her face. \u201cSean\u2019s little sister. You did grow up well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really got to quit referring to me as Sean\u2019s little sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, absolutely. I don\u2019t intend to feel guilty a moment when I see Sean. You are, beyond a doubt, very grownup. And out. In all the right places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, again.\u201d She laughed, and then her breath caught, and suddenly they were clinging to one another again, and rolling on the bed, passionately touching and teasing, and once again, making love wildly, desperately reaching at moments, smiling at others, laughing...and then climaxing again. The world seemed to have no end. They talked about music and coming home from school and finding a way to make it all work. He talked about lighting and photography, getting into underwater film, loving the world beneath the sea, and she reminded him that Key West had some of the most fantastic sunsets in the world.</p><p>When she slept that night, it was deeply.</p><p>When she woke, the woman was back.</p><p>Not Tanya, the other woman. The dark-haired woman. She was seated across the room in the dressing-room chair, and she was looking at Katie forlornly.</p> <p>Katie bit her lip and turned her head slightly, glad to see that she and David were both decently covered beneath the coolness of the air-conditioning.</p><p>She stared at the girl in her room, and she moved her lips without a whisper. \u201cNot here! Never in my room.\u201d</p><p>The ghost frowned, blinked and then nodded. She stood, and glided sadly toward the door, and disappeared through it.</p><p>8</p><p>Katie woke up early. Lazy, smiling, she\u2019d turned to David, and it seemed the most natural thing in the world that he was there with her. They made love again, slowly, leisurely, feeling the heat of the day grow and glow upon them as the sun rose.</p><p>When she drifted off again, David left her a note, telling her that he\u2019d be at his grandfather\u2019s house.</p><p>He still couldn\u2019t call the place his own.</p><p>He wanted to spend more of his time with the files Liam had left for him. The police reports were filled with sheets on the detectives\u2019 door-to-door questioning of neighbors. No one had seen anyone enter the museum other than the Becketts and tourists.</p> <p>Many neighbors saw him.</p><p>There were the statements, sworn by his grandfather and others, that he had worked at the museum until midnight, and then been at home and with his family until the next morning, when he had left to go to the museum once again.</p><p>Danny Zigler had been questioned; he was one of the few people with a key to the museum. But a set of keys had hung just inside the kitchen door of the Beckett house, and many people knew that they were there. It had been determined that there hadn\u2019t been a break-in, so someone had come in with a key. There hadn\u2019t been an alarm system, despite the expense that had been poured into the place over the years.</p><p>Forensics had yielded little other than the fact that Tanya had been strangled; an injury to her knee was at least a week old. She had apparently skinned it. The autopsy report noted that Tanya Barnard had not been tortured-a small blessing.</p><p>David dragged his fingers through his hair, and began drawing a chart of the timeline. First, time of death. Second, time in which to get into the museum. It had been open until midnight the night before. That meant her body had been elsewhere for several hours, then moved into the museum. Whoever had put her in the museum either had a key, or knew where the keys were kept. Many people knew about the key. But the Becketts had all been home and together after midnight on the night of the murder. Which meant, David thought, that it had been planned. Meticulously planned. Days before, someone had to have taken the key and had it reproduced. He had a key, there was a key they kept in the house, Danny Zigler had a key and Liam had a key.</p><p>David drummed his fingers on the table.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been a random killing. Tanya had been targeted, and the display of her body had been planned ahead of time. Likely, it was someone who had come and gone from the Beckett house. Himself, Liam. Danny Zigler, any member of Tanya\u2019s family, his friends at the time, his grandfather\u2019s friends...</p><p>He was going over the names, trying to think of anyone else. Craig Beckett had been smart, but he\u2019d also had an open heart. They\u2019d welcomed underprivileged kids in for tea, supported the police, the firefighters and every poor wretch who stumbled upon their family. The house had been an open highway.</p><p>Sam Barnard thought that Danny was shady. David had a hard time accepting the fact that he might be guilty of murder.</p><p>Who then? Who had been around? Himself, Liam, Sam, Jamie O\u2019Hara...no, they said that he hadn\u2019t left his bar that night, not until the wee hours of the morning. Still, he could have hidden the body-but he hadn\u2019t been gone between the hours of seven and nine.</p><p>She had last been seen at O\u2019Hara\u2019s.</p><p>There had to be something in the files.</p><p>There were pictures. Bizarre pictures, still barely real. He rubbed his finger over one of the photographs, touching Tanya\u2019s cheek. Had she been targeted and killed because someone wanted to punish her?</p><p>For being free and loose, for finding a new lover while she\u2019d still been engaged?</p><p>He read more of the interview notes and realized that there was a small notation next to the name Mike Sanderson. Itvw b p; subject oos. What the hell did that mean?</p><p>He frowned. They were a policeman\u2019s notes to himself. Guy Levy. He was still a cop; he\u2019d gotten transferred over to investigation from being a beat cop. Guy had at least ten years with the force now.</p><p>Interview by phone; subject out of state?</p><p>David pulled out his cell phone and called the station, asking for Guy. To his surprise, he reached him immediately.</p><p>\u201cDavid! Saw you at the station the other day but you were gone before I could say hello. How are you doing? Dumb question. We hear about-and see-your success all the time. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Hey, Guy, I wanted to ask you a question about Tanya\u2019s case.\u201d</p><p>There was silence, and then a groan. \u201cHey, you know, I wasn\u2019t really in on the case. I wasn\u2019t an official investigator. I was just doing interviews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I was just curious. Did you go up and see Mike Sanderson, Tanya\u2019s new boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I interviewed him by phone. He was gone, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So I heard. Where was he when you spoke to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019d left Key West, you know. Like a day or two before the murder. I didn\u2019t talk to him until the following Monday. I\u2019m sure he could have reached Ohio by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you speak to him on a landline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke to him on the only number I had. He was all broken up. Said he wasn\u2019t surprised when he didn\u2019t hear from her right away-he\u2019d been afraid that once she\u2019d seen you, she\u2019d change her mind.\u201d</p><p>Sloppy work, David thought. Well, they\u2019d dragged in patrolmen. Men who did what they were told, and didn\u2019t think to hunt down the man and talk to him in person.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell Guy that someone should have really traced Mike Sanderson\u2019s movements; he could have been hiding out somewhere in the Keys. He could have surprised Tanya. She wouldn\u2019t have fought him. She would have never suspected that he wanted to do her harm.</p><p>He thanked Guy and clicked the end button on his phone. He needed to get Liam going through official channels to draw credit-card receipts and find out if Mike Sanderson had really left the island.</p><p>The crime-scene photos were not good. The murder had been just ten years ago; the photos should have been better, more extensive. He turned on a high-powered light and ruffled through the desk for a magnifying glass.</p><p>There was something he hadn\u2019t noticed before. Spots. He tried to rub them off the photos. They didn\u2019t rub off. Was it poor photography? No, he thought. There was something there. Something that looked like light blue bruising on her nose and her lips.</p><p>He pulled out the autopsy photos and report. There was no mention of the bruising on the face.</p><p>Maybe it had been so light at the time that the coroner hadn\u2019t seen it?</p><p>Impossible to tell at this late date, and it wasn\u2019t evident until now, until he took out the magnifying glass.</p><p>Death was officially suffocation by strangling. The bruises on the neck were evident. There had been nothing beneath her nails. Tanya hadn\u2019t fought her attacker. She had been taken completely by surprise.</p><p>That suggested someone strong, and, probably, an assault from behind.</p><p>He closed his eyes and tried to imagine someone coming up behind her, someone with the strength to encircle her neck with his hands and choke the life out of her before she could put her hands up to resist. It would have been natural for her hands to dig into the hands that were on her, for her nails to have curled into flesh.</p><p>Not if her attacker was wearing gloves, and not if he stole her air so quickly she couldn\u2019t scream or do more than lift her hands.</p><p>His phone started ringing and vibrating on the desk. He picked it up and checked his caller ID before answering it.</p><p>Pete. Lieutenant Pete Dryer.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d call you right away,\u201d Pete said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d Was he calling because Guy had told him about his questioning?</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>David felt a quickening of dread; he\u2019d made sure that the museum was locked, but he still had a sinking feeling.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m down off Front Street at the new oddities museum,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>Thank God, a different museum, thank God...</p><p>But he knew, he knew something terrible had happened, and he had a feeling that it didn\u2019t matter much where the body had been discovered, just that one had been.</p><p>\u201cI found my missing stripper,\u201d Pete said. \u201cAnd God knows, maybe something is going on again, maybe your mumbo jumbo about an agenda is right. So I\u2019m trying to unofficially let you in on this. Come on down, and I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p> <p>David was frankly surprised that he was permitted to pass by the yellow tape with Liam.</p><p>There was already a good crowd on the sidewalk as they made their way through the outer doors to the tourist attractions. People were whispering, pointing, speculating.</p><p>The museum was a medium-size place, much as the Beckett family had operated, but it was new since he\u2019d been gone. One-storied, it occupied an old warehouse building that was just about ten thousand feet square. It was called the Eccentricities Museum, a good enough name for the exhibits it boasted on the posters flanking the doorway.</p><p>See Carl Tanzler and his Elena! Get to know Robert the Doll! Become a member of the Conch Republic-yes, it was real, for just a few hours. Find out about the secession! Meet Samuel Mudd, take a virtual tour out to the Dry Tortugas and learn what it was like when yellow fever struck.</p><p>Just as in most other museums, other exhibits came first.</p><p>There was a young woman talking to an officer at the entry, sobbing as she did so. She had been the cashier, he realized. There weren\u2019t tours here-visitors walked through at their own pace, he saw.</p> <p>Liam was moving quickly, and David followed at the same speed. He almost bumped into a model of Hemingway-in death, the man was everywhere.</p><p>Pete was already at the crime scene. He was hunkered down by the body, speaking with the M.E., who had already been working on the corpse.</p><p>The exhibit displayed Elena in wedding gown, with Carl Tanzler standing by her side. A plaque announced that they were Tanzler and his bride-he had married her in a private ceremony officiated by himself, in his airplane on the beach. One day, he had believed, he and his bride would sail away to the heavens in his airplane.</p><p>David\u2019s muscles seemed to knot and contort; no model of Elena lay on the bed.</p><p>This time, the girl had dark hair. Long, dark, slightly kinky hair.</p><p>There was a photographer on hand, but Pete seemed to be impatient with him. \u201cAngles-I need the angles. Come on, you should have a couple dozen shots by now.\u201d</p><p>David shot wildlife. Nature. He wasn\u2019t experienced with crime-scene photography. Luckily, there had been a few classes at college on the techniques. But they weren\u2019t much to help him as he tried to use his small digital camera discreetly to get a few snaps.</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes were open wide. She stared in distorted horror into the air.</p> <p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>Pete, the M.E. and the police photographer-who mumbled something about the real guy being on vacation-stepped back.</p><p>Flash, flash, flash, flash, flash. The bruises on her neck. Flash, flash, flash...the way her body was situated on the bed. Flash, flash, flash, her eyes, her eyes, her eyes, just like Tanya\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThis one has been dead for twenty-four hours,\u201d the M.E. told Pete, pointing his gloved hands at the body. \u201cShe was held somewhere else while lividity set in...note the blood and the coloration on her arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe museum had just opened. Liam, you might go and interview the first group through here today, the ones who found her.\u201d He gave directions to other officers and techs, staring at the body and shaking his head. \u201cHell. I wanted to throw her in jail for a night or two, but this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was strangled?\u201d David asked the M.E. It seemed obvious, but nothing could be taken for granted.</p><p>The man looked up at him curiously. \u201cSame as before.\u201d</p><p>Flash, flash, flash. A sheet had been pulled up, but it seemed to have been done hastily. She wasn\u2019t pretty, as Pete had said. In life, she\u2019d had a hard look about her, David thought. There was none of the innocence and youth that had made Tanya so stunning, even as a corpse in a tableau. The woman wasn\u2019t unattractive; she just wasn\u2019t beautiful. Nor had she been laid out with care. There was something off about the scene, something discordant with the last.</p><p>And the last he could remember as if it had been yesterday.</p><p>Pete looked over at him. \u201cThis one isn\u2019t as pretty, maybe it\u2019s a copycat. Or maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, just maybe, you\u2019re right. Someone has an agenda. And...\u201d</p><p>Pete\u2019s voice failed. David knew what he meant to say.</p><p>And look who is back on the island after ten years?</p><p>It was Pete. Because of Pete, he could be here, he was sure Pete\u2019s superiors would see that he was ejected from the scene soon.</p><p>David stared at the dead girl, trying to take in every detail that he could. Bruises rounded her throat. The petechia in her eyes was pronounced. She wore lipstick, but it was smudged. Her blouse had been buttoned out of whack.</p><p>Had she done it herself?</p><p>There was the sheet that had been tossed over her-it almost looked as if the murderer had been forced to hurry. Where Tanya had been laid out to appear perfectly beautiful, it seemed that this girl had been quickly dumped.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant!\u201d</p><p>One of Dryer\u2019s top men came in and whispered to him. Pete glanced at David, sighed and nodded. He came to David and whispered, \u201cWell, my men are beginning to comment on the fact that I\u2019ve got a civilian in here. This is it-time for you to go.\u201d</p><p>David lifted a hand. \u201cThanks for calling me, Pete,\u201d he said.</p><p>Pete inhaled. \u201cYou were so adamant about not reopening the Beckett museum. But...hell, where there\u2019s a psycho... I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s not just you, David, who needs to worry about their displays. Now we know that. Any museum is up for grabs, so it seems. And Fantasy Fest is nearly here. Good God. We\u2019ve got a murderer, and the streets are about to become wall-to-wall people. Heaven help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople may start canceling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. Okay, maybe. Some will. But a little thing like the murder of a prostitute isn\u2019t going to stop anyone from partying. Lord, I hope the crime-scene folk can get something!\u201d Pete said with disgust. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have a few more normal bar fights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about security cameras here?\u201d David asked.</p><p>Pete gave him a dry look. \u201cAh, come on, David. This is your home-we\u2019re not the damned backwoods. We checked that out first. Tape is gone. They\u2019re dusting all over for prints, but...\u201d</p><p>One of the techs finished for him. \u201cThe guy wore gloves. Seems like he knew just what we\u2019d be looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFootprints?\u201d David asked.</p><p>The man shook his head. \u201cHe might even have worn some kind of bootie. Umm, not that we know if we\u2019re dealing with a he,\u201d he added, and looked away, busying himself with his work. He was a tech-the detectives were supposed to be doing the thinking.</p><p>David thanked Pete again.</p><p>He took shots as he left, shots of the entry, shots of ground. Shots of the locks, which seemed to have been undisturbed. He did so carefully, and still, he was surprised that none of the officers seemed to notice or stop him; maybe they were all in a bit of shock.</p><p>David left then, afraid that he\u2019d be shown out soon. Just outside, he saw Liam questioning the people who had been the first through. They were two young girls and an elderly couple. He nodded to his cousin, who realized why he was leaving. Liam nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p>The crowd was growing. News stations were setting up, and several reporters were already on air.</p><p>As he walked out, he thought about Katie. He called her quickly to tell her about what had happened.</p><p>\u201cI already saw the news,\u201d she said.</p><p>Katie stared at the television.</p><p>The dead woman was Stella Martin. She had worked at a strip club on Duval, and most of the locals on the street who didn\u2019t know her well still knew her. The club owner denied that any of his girls engaged in any illicit activity. Stella had been a good girl.</p><p>But the next person the reporter talked to was a pretty young girl from the Czech Republic. She worked in the bikini shop downstairs and next door.</p><p>\u201cStella...well, it is sad, so sad. But Stella...left with men often. She-she could not come in my shop anymore, the manager said. She propositioned men here, and my manager, he would not have it happening in here. A stripper is one thing...well, it is illegal here to charge for sex.\u201d</p><p>A stripper.</p><p>A minute later, Lieutenant Pete Dryer was introduced by an anchor. \u201cLieutenant! Isn\u2019t this a copy of one of the last unsolved murders to take place in Key West?\u201d the reporter asked.</p><p>\u201cA copy, just that,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? The previous killer was never arrested, or known,\u201d the reporter said.</p><p>\u201cThere are differences.\u201d A barrage of questions started coming his way and he lifted his hand. \u201cNaturally, we don\u2019t want to give out details. We need to keep some information quiet so that we can investigate this killing and solve it. We have a lot more scientific investigative techniques now, and we\u2019ll find out the truth this time, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t it true that the last murder involved the Beckett family-and isn\u2019t it true that David Beckett has just returned home?\u201d a reporter asked.</p><p>Pete was silent a second. Just a second too long.</p><p>\u201cNo further comment,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, what about Beckett? Supposedly, all those years ago, he had an airtight alibi, didn\u2019t he?\u201d someone else asked. \u201cAirtight-through Grandpa!\u201d</p><p>Liam must have been nearby. She heard an explosive sound, and the camera angle jiggled for a moment before it settled on Liam Beckett. \u201cTrust me-David had an airtight alibi, and he\u2019ll have one now. Watch it, unless you want to find yourself in court!\u201d Liam said angrily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The doorbell rang and she nearly jumped out of her chair. Bartholomew was watching her. \u201cI\u2019d get it for you if I could,\u201d he said.</p><p>She ran to the door and looked through the peephole. It was David. She threw the door open.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something I was expecting,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cCome in. Come on in,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He stepped in. \u201cAll the old crap is being thrown back up,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou still believe in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnconditionally,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>He smiled, closed the door and drew her close to him.</p><p>\u201cPete\u2019s trying to help-I mean me, specifically. He managed to get me in to see the crime scene. And I managed to get a few of my own pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she seemed worried.</p><p>\u201cHey, I went to school for this. I took a couple of courses in crime-scene work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo-you think that this will help you find out what happened in the past?\u201d She stared at him frankly. She stepped back and put her hands on her hips as if she were indignant for him. In no way did it seem to occur to her that it was just too odd that this had happened right after he had returned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either the same killer or a copycat,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks to Pete, I won\u2019t have to rely on the memory of what I just saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I send out for some food?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can cook something-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the streets?\u201d she asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cDuval Street, as a matter of fact. I\u2019m not hiding. I didn\u2019t do anything then, and I sure as hell didn\u2019t kill a stripper I\u2019ve never seen before. Hell, if they\u2019re going to come at me, I\u2019m going right out where they can do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look overly agitated,\u201d Bartholomew commented. He was perched on a stool next to her at an open-air bar on Duval; David had just been cornered by the press again.</p><p>He could have gone into public speaking, Katie thought. He managed the press well. He spoke about leaving Key West after Tanya\u2019s death because his home memories were far too painful. He managed to make the Becketts sound like the typical American family, and when he spoke about Craig and his grandmother, affection was apparent in his tone. He admitted that he didn\u2019t understand how such bizarre murders could have occurred so far apart; yes, there might be a copycat at work, especially since some aspects of the crime seemed to be different. He had every confidence that the police would find the killer. Someone wanted to know how they thought they would find a killer now-when they hadn\u2019t done so years ago. Someone else suggested that they wouldn\u2019t try as hard. Stella Martin had been a stripper and probably a prostitute.</p> <p>David clearly stated that he was sure the police would work every bit as hard; a human life was a human life, none less valuable than others.</p><p>Katie sipped a rum and Coke, listening to him. Bartholomew watched him, and turned back to her. \u201cAh, if I could but taste that grog,\u201d he moaned. \u201cHey!\u201d He straightened in his seat. \u201cLook. There.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked down the bar. There was a woman with huge breasts and tight shorts sitting at the end of the counter, shaded by some of the palms that covered the bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know her name, but she works at the strip club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this because...?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I may be dead, but I can watch!\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>Katie stood up and came around the bar slowly. She didn\u2019t recognize the woman. Strippers, however, had a tendency to be very transient. She might not have been in Key West long.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Katie said, sliding up on the stool beside her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, fine,\u201d the woman said, trying to act as if she hadn\u2019t been crying. She seemed defensive. And scared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to disturb you. You just appear to be very sad, as if you\u2019d lost a friend, and I just wanted to say that I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>The woman had been twirling her swizzle stick in her pink drink; she looked over at Katie. She nodded slowly. \u201cYes, we were friends. Stella had a few bad habits, but...she liked money. She wanted to travel one day-far, far from Florida. She was born in a trailer up in Palatka, and she always wanted to get out of the state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we can imagine heaven as a place far away, and maybe as wonderful as anyplace she might have wanted to see.\u201d</p><p>The woman stared at her. \u201cYou-you\u2019re Katie-oke, right?\u201d</p><p>Katie nodded.</p><p>\u201cStella liked to stand outside and listen. She had a nice voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should have come in to sing,\u201d Katie said. \u201cDo you know who...was she fighting with anyone? Do you know where she\u2019d been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe picked up a kid the night before... Well, they say she died Sunday afternoon sometime. Yeah, she was with a kid. I might recognize him if I saw him again. But...he was young. He didn\u2019t look like a killer. Then again, that\u2019s what they always tell us-God alone knows what a killer looks like. Oh, Lord-she was murdered!\u201d the woman said, and huge tears formed in her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Katie murmured. She didn\u2019t try to tell the woman that everything was all right-murder wasn\u2019t all right. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMorgana,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>\u201cUm-is that your real name?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>The woman managed a smile. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s my real name, not my stripper\u2019s pseudonym. My mom was a big fan of the King Arthur tales and fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty name,\u201d Katie told her. \u201cJust unusual, even today. Umm, did Stella see anyone regularly?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cAnyone?\u201d Morgana asked. She blushed and looked away. \u201cLots of anyones. Stella said that these days, people came to bars-men and women-just to hook up for the night. She was smarter. You could get paid for sex, and why the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant like...like, almost a boyfriend, maybe?\u201d</p><p>The woman sat up and stared across the street. \u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes-who?\u201d</p><p>The girl pointed.</p><p>Katie followed her line of vision.</p><p>She was pointing at Danny Zigler.</p><p>The museum was closed for the day, but as the afternoon rolled in, reporters announced on radio and television that it would be reopened the following day.</p><p>Fantasy Fest was coming.</p><p>Key West might have once been one of the wealthiest cities in the United States, but the days of privateers, wreckers and sponge divers were long gone.</p><p>The city survived on tourism, cruise ships and snowbirds longing for the sun. Fantasy Fest drew people from around the globe, and it was one of the many local festivals that kept the local shopkeepers, innkeepers and restaurant owners and workers in business. The fest went beyond just the obvious; the business surging down the Keys kept construction workers, charter captains, meter readers, housekeepers, antiques dealers and jacks-of-all-trades surviving, as well.</p><p>David made a point of staying on Duval Street during the day. He spoke with any reporter who approached him.</p><p>Katie was glad to see that he intended to keep himself in the public eye.</p><p>She was somewhat annoyed because she couldn\u2019t seem to get a minute to talk to him alone.</p><p>It was late when the news of the spectacular murder gave way at last to interviews about the upcoming festival days. David had made himself so available that by nightfall, he had spoken to just about every reporter who had rushed down to the city.</p><p>Morgana had disappeared by then. But as David slipped his arm through hers, suggesting that they pick up food somewhere and head back to her house or the Beckett home to eat in peace, Katie managed to tell him that she had talked to the woman, and that Morgana had told her that Stella Martin had carried on a somewhat long-term relationship with Danny Zigler.</p><p>He listened to her gravely, and then said that they should head to her place. Along the way, they picked up a few to-go meals from the Hog\u2019s Breath Saloon. They headed to Katie\u2019s.</p><p>Bartholomew was nowhere to be seen. In fact, Katie hadn\u2019t seen him all afternoon.</p><p>They set up their meal on Katie\u2019s dining-room table. \u201cI know you\u2019ve already been talking to Danny,\u201d Katie said. She shook her head while chewing a piece of chicken. \u201cBut...I...Danny is kind of a skinny little guy. And we\u2019ve known him forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, women have lived with serial killers for years and not known what their husbands or boyfriends did at night,\u201d David reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOkay-but you seem to think that whoever killed Tanya had an agenda. So maybe he\u2019s not your usual serial killer,\u201d Katie pointed out. She shook her head. \u201cBut Danny! I can\u2019t believe it, and yet...Morgana did say that Stella Martin saw him...regularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a customer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like a boyfriend. That\u2019s what I asked her-if Stella saw anybody more like a boyfriend,\u201d Katie told him.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily make him a killer,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that they\u2019ll get anything from forensics?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d David said. He finished off his last bite of chicken and stood, slipping his hand into the pocket of his short-sleeved tailored shirt. \u201cYou have a computer here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure-what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to study the photographs I have of the murder scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the back,\u201d Katie said, rising, as well. \u201cIn the family room.\u201d</p><p>David nodded and walked on through. He hit the power button and waited for the computer to boot up, then slid in the small memory stick he held.</p><p>He looked at Katie. \u201cYou may not want to see these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. This is the age of media-soldiers dead on the battlefield, et cetera. I\u2019m fine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He studied her, then nodded and hit the key to open his photos. Despite her words of assurance, Katie wasn\u2019t really ready for what she saw.</p><p>The scene. The scene of Tanzler and Elena she knew so well from being a kid growing up in Key West was familiar and yet horrible.</p><p>But there was Tanzler.</p> <p>And there was a woman in Elena\u2019s place on her bed who had lived and breathed at a different time. Elena had died of tuberculosis, the woman had been murdered.</p><p>And though Katie had never known her, she knew her.</p><p>She had seen her reflection in the bathroom mirror. She had seen the huge tear form in her eye, and trail down her cheek.</p><p>Stella Martin had not been a great beauty. In death, she was like a caricature of Elena.</p><p>\u201cJust like Tanya, and yet...\u201d David murmured.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s a copycat killing?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI think the same person killed Tanya and this woman,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is not laid out as carefully as Tanya had been. There\u2019s something rushed about the display. And Stella was older and not as beautiful as Tanya. There\u2019s something almost garish about Stella. I think she was a handy victim. I think the killer wanted her displayed because I\u2019m here, because Sam is here. Why else would the killer wait all of this time to kill again? Nothing else makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else makes you think it\u2019s not a copycat?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>David enlarged the picture, showing her the face. \u201cPetechia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hemorrhage in the eyes...caused by strangling. Look, you can see the bruises on the neck. But there\u2019s more-more like the crime-scene photos in Tanya\u2019s file. See the slight bruises...not even bruises, really. But the blue-and-gray smudges on the nose...and there, on the chin.\u201d</p><p>Katie narrowed her eyes. She saw the little marks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think they are?\u201d she asked him.</p> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019re from some form of plastic. I think the killer is putting some kind of plastic bag over their heads. They don\u2019t see him until the last minute. He comes from behind, puts the plastic over their heads. While they\u2019re desperately gasping for breath already, he strangles them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they really don\u2019t know who their killer is,\u201d Katie murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe steals their breath away so quickly, they can\u2019t even fight,\u201d David said thoughtfully.</p><p>Katie looked away. She didn\u2019t want to see her ghost, the woman who had been a stripper and a prostitute but strong and gutsy in her own way, dead in a tableau.</p><p>David left the memory stick in the computer and stood, looking at his watch. He frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t work tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, though Uncle Jamie said something about doing karaoke all week next week for Fantasy Fest,\u201d Katie told him. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to my days off here.\u201d</p><p>He was a few feet away. He nodded, and she was hoping, without being overt, that he meant to keep her with him, spend their time together, from now until then.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the case.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe strip club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s-it\u2019s a strip club.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a dry smile. \u201cThis is Key West, if you\u2019ve forgotten. Men and women are more than welcome together.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cKatie, trust me. This is something I really need to do alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid-Stella was discovered today. People in there...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might be cruel to me? Treat me like a murderer?\u201d he asked. He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made a point of staying on the street today. I\u2019m old hat, and sadly, she was a prostitute, and half the people out there assume that it\u2019s some kind of a copycat deal.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to her, caught her shoulders and looked into her eyes. She stared back at him, her heart beating hard, and she wondered how she could possibly feel so strongly about him when just days ago she had barely known him.</p><p>\u201cKatie, I need to speak with Morgana. You\u2019re the one who told me about her, remember?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Great, she had told him about a stripper.</p><p>\u201cWait for me, please?\u201d he asked huskily.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He kissed her. On the mouth. But it was a quick kiss. A goodbye-for-now kiss.</p><p>But his hands lingered on her shoulders. \u201cKatie, I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you for believing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really thank me for that,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I feel, it\u2019s...intuition. Whatever, it\u2019s not something we really choose. We believe or we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. The man had fabulous eyes. She felt tension ripping through her, and she wanted to hold on to him, beg him to stay with her.</p><p>He touched her cheek. \u201cStill, thank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t grab him; she didn\u2019t hold him, speak to him or try to stop him.</p><p>She nodded, and his lips brushed hers once again.</p><p>She walked him to the door. When he was outside, she locked the bolt.</p><p>She looked through the peephole and saw him walking down the street, toward Duval. When he disappeared, she turned and leaned against the door.</p><p>\u201cBartholomew?\u201d she said.</p><p>There was no answer. Her ghost was off for the day and night, so it seemed.</p><p>She waited, listening. But there was nothing to be heard, and she felt as if she were truly alone.</p><p>With a sigh she headed into the kitchen, and turned on the small television on the counter. She switched around on the news stations, but although Stella had barely been dead for twenty-four hours, the nation had moved on. There had been a bus accident in New Hampshire, killing five, and Cleveland police believed that they had caught a spree killer who was shooting the elderly in the streets. Nanny Nice, a nurse who had killed handicapped children in a California hospital, was planning on a psychiatric defense.</p><p>Finally, the bizarre murder of a prostitute in Key West, Florida, came on the local news. Stella\u2019s name wasn\u2019t even mentioned at first.</p><p>But, as the story wound down, Katie felt as if a chill was settling over her. The tiny hairs at her nape seemed to be rising.</p><p>In the television screen she saw a reflection.</p><p>She turned, and Stella Martin was back, standing in her kitchen, watching the television screen. She looked at Katie, her features twisted in torment.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>But Stella shook her head, tears forming in her eyes again.</p><p>She lifted her hand, beckoning to Katie.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d seemed to hover on the air.</p><p>The ghost of Stella Martin walked to Katie\u2019s front door, and beckoned again.</p><p>I\u2019m an idiot! Katie thought.</p><p>And yet she followed.</p><p>9</p><p>Strippers came in all sizes, shapes and varieties-even ages. Once, in college, David and a friend had done a piece on the strippers of north Florida. A lot of their other friends had ribbed them about the project, but it had earned them both superior marks for a photojournalism class.</p><p>A lot of young and very attractive women went into the work for the money. And the story was usually the same. It was good money with little effort. Prostitution and stripping were not the same, though the latter sometimes led to the first. One girl they had interviewed told them that drugs were readily available, so stripping sometimes led to drug or alcohol addiction. The addiction meant that more money needed to be earned, and stripping allowed a girl to find out who had money and who didn\u2019t, and who would pay, what they would pay for and how much.</p><p>Some strippers remained, even when not addicted to drugs, alcohol or sex, because they liked the thrill of being sexy on a pole. To some, it was empowering.</p><p>Others did love sex.</p><p>Some just loved money.</p><p>When Morgana appeared on the floor, David at first felt sorry for her. The woman was not young, nor did she have a perfect body.</p><p>But she could move. He imagined, watching her, that as a young girl, she had wanted to be a dancer-a dancer, not a stripper. When she moved, there was something special about her.</p><p>Some of the customers in the establishment were talking and didn\u2019t even notice her. Some of the clientele hooted and hollered.</p><p>She seemed oblivious to all of them.</p><p>And yet, when her music ended, she was back playing the game. David thought it was all by rote. There was a look of abject sadness in her eyes, even when she smiled. She was far away, even when she bent down to squeeze a bill between her breasts or accept an offering in the thong bikini she wore that was just strings.</p><p>When she walked from the stage, David rose to meet her, reaching out a hundred-dollar bill. She looked at him, and her eyes grew wider. Fear registered in them. He was afraid she was going to press the bill back into his hands and run.</p><p>\u201cMy friend Katie told me about you today,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I just want to talk to you. I was hoping you could tell me more about Stella Martin.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. She stared at him. \u201cThe place downstairs has a quiet patio in back. But the bartender is a big, old bruiser, and he\u2019s a good friend of mine,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI swear, I have no intention of hurting you,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t go getting the police on me!\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She left, and as she did so, David turned to see that someone was leaving from the far back of the room.</p><p>Someone who had been sitting in the shadows, and was now just about hugging the wall and the darkness to hurry out.</p><p>Danny Zigler.</p><p>There she was. Katie O\u2019Hara. She was leaving her house behind, as she had surely done thousands of times before.</p><p>Katie O\u2019Hara. Such a pretty thing. Sweet kid. She always had been. No doormat, she could handle a drunk out of control, speak with a cool authority that seemed to demand attention and hold her own with the best of them. Actually, she might be called beautiful now. All the rough edges of the child and the teen were gone; she was a woman. She had a magical speaking voice, and as far as Katie-oke went, ah, she was great. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Katie O\u2019Hara...</p><p>She was there, she was alone, she was vulnerable.</p><p>Tonight...</p> <p>Ah, tonight...</p><p>Tonight was too soon.</p><p>Too soon; the death of the stripper had to be noted, puzzled and plastered all over the news. A stripper might be forgotten quickly. That was the way of the world. But Stella Martin, pathetic user that she had been, had now taken her place in importance. Now she was history; she was legend.</p><p>And, of course, that would be it with Katie, too.</p><p>For a moment, he frowned, regretting the fact that he had chosen such a whore to be his victim. Stella hadn\u2019t really deserved to be remembered in any way.</p> <p>Then again, Tanya Barnard hadn\u2019t been pristine, either.</p><p>Katie...well, Katie was a good girl. She deserved the best. She truly deserved to be legend.</p><p>Something very, very special would have to be done for her. Nothing quick, nothing spur-of-the-moment. It must be thought out carefully.</p><p>Fantasy Fest was coming...</p><p>Ah, yes. Something truly magnificent could be done with Fantasy Fest.</p><p>On a Monday night, the streets were quiet. Comparatively.</p> <p>There were still people out and about. The bars were open on Duval, and scattered venues around the city. It was an odd Monday-still Monday, but a Monday with the city beginning to fill. Many people planned vacations around Fantasy Fest, and some had already trickled in. More would arrive on Friday night, when the city went into high gear.</p><p>Katie wondered if there would be an air of nervousness, or if tourists would simply need the diversion for their own lives.</p><p>Usually, people could rationalize away something wrong, heinous or even evil.</p><p>I\u2019m not a prostitute. I can\u2019t be affected.</p><p>I am always with my friends...husband...lover...</p><p>I will be safe.</p><p>Of course it was true.</p><p>The ghost walked ahead of Katie.</p> <p>She thought that the ghost of Stella Martin was going to turn down the block before Duval, but she didn\u2019t. She seemed to hesitate, as if thinking out her move. She looked at Katie, and then she moved on to Duval.</p><p>Katie followed. There was no reason for her to be afraid. Duval was as familiar to her as her own front walk.</p><p>Rick\u2019s was open, as was the Irish bar across the street, and both seemed to be busy. Up ahead, more bars were still issuing the sounds of music out to the road and all those who still prowled the town. They passed the smallest bar, and a few old friends were hanging around; they waved to Katie. She waved back and hurried on.</p><p>They were near one of the inns on Duval Street that many people might pass on a daily basis-and barely notice. They were wonderful places for the city. Small, on top of storefronts, they often had the kind of rooms where spring-breakers might find an affordable stay. Her brother had rented one with a group of friends once. \u201cKatie, there\u2019s one bed. There\u2019s a bed under the bed, and when you open the closet, there\u2019s a mattress standing up! It\u2019s just great. Of course, you have a ton of folks and one bathroom, but it means that kids can afford to come!\u201d</p><p>The ghost stopped. She stared at Katie, frowned, looked worried, then sighed.</p><p>And walked around back.</p><p>Katie hesitated, then followed her.</p><p>A narrow alley led to the back of the building and stairs that allowed guests at the place to depart through the rear of the establishment. Another alley ran between the shops, bars and restaurants on the main street and the shops, bars, restaurants, B and Bs and homes that were on the other side.</p><p>Katie could hear all the sounds from the street. The laughter. The music. The cars and small motorcycles going by. She could hear the light toot of a horn.</p><p>Laughter again.</p><p>The ghost looked anxiously about and ran along the back alley, then stood in the midst of bushes and the dripping branches of a large sea grape tree.</p><p>Katie walked over to her. The ghost seemed very afraid; she looked around constantly.</p><p>She opened her mouth. She couldn\u2019t really make sound. She wasn\u2019t anywhere near as comfortable in her death as Bartholomew had come to be. Katie could barely hear her.</p><p>I was here, it\u2019s all I remember, but the plastic, the darkness and the fact that I couldn\u2019t breathe. Then the hands, I can\u2019t forget the hands around my neck.</p><p>A car backfired away on the streets; the ghost of Stella Martin actually seemed to jump.</p><p>Get to the light, get to the light and the people, it\u2019s the darkness...he knows the streets. He was following me... I didn\u2019t realize...</p><p>\u201cStella,\u201d Katie said aloud, \u201cwas it Danny? Danny Zigler?\u201d</p><p>Stella frowned. I...no. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know! But go...please. It\u2019s dark. Go now, and help me, please help me. Go, and don\u2019t get yourself killed, or how the hell will you help me?</p><p>The ghost was finding her personality. Brash in life, she would be so in death.</p><p>Katie turned.</p><p>She knew the city so well. Knew the streets, the legends, even where trees grew and bushes were thick, where foliage had been cut back, where locals gathered, and where they did not.</p><p>She knew her city.</p><p>But she felt as if she was being watched.</p><p>As if she had been followed.</p><p>And while just a block away the city was alive and bursting with music and colorful revelers, those who had come from near and from far, she felt alone.</p><p>But she knew it; she had been seen.</p><p>She had been seen talking to thin air, right at the place where Stella had been killed.</p><p>Something seemed to creep along her nape. Something more frightening than she had ever experienced. Not of another world, but of this world.</p><p>She sensed evil. Living, breathing evil.</p><p>He was hidden, watching. Her senses seemed acutely attuned, and it was as if she could hear him standing still, and yet causing a slight rustling. Watching her. Stalking her. Waiting, his breath coming fast, his hands clenched at his sides. Strong hands, the kind that could quickly cause suffocation, and then squeeze the life from the living.</p><p>The ghost was agitated, too.</p><p>She began to fade.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d she said.</p><p>And Katie did.</p><p>Cleaned up, dressed in jeans and T-shirt, her face scrubbed, her hair in a ponytail, Stella\u2019s friend Morgana Willams seemed like a woman in her late thirties-in fact, she looked like the girl next door.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d she told David wearily.</p><p>He had offered to buy her a drink. She hadn\u2019t wanted alcohol; just a cup of coffee. It was still readily available.</p><p>They sat at a little open-air table in the far back of the establishment, within sight of many who were escaping the music and yet still partying. Some looked as if they were already preparing for hellacious hangovers the next day.</p><p>Some had been moderate, and were watching out for their friends.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill your friend,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled, a dampness about her eyes. \u201cI believe you. Of course, I wasn\u2019t here ten years ago. I came down from the farmlands of Indiana. I didn\u2019t want a boring life, you know. I\u2019m not sure I exactly planned on this life, but...hey. Maybe I\u2019ll find Mr. Right somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThe police already questioned me,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, it makes sense,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThey questioned everyone in the club. One of the guys is your relative, isn\u2019t he? A cop named Liam Beckett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy,\u201d David told her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe was real respectful. He didn\u2019t treat us like we were all whores-or the underbelly of society.\u201d</p><p>David smiled. \u201cWell, you are gainfully employed. And, by the way, I thought you might have been a dancer-as in musicals-at some time. Were you?\u201d</p><p>Her face lit up. She was almost pretty. \u201cYou could tell that? Really?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI started off in the Big Apple-New York City,\u201d she said. \u201cI even worked Off Broadway. But then I met Joe, and Joe introduced me to...a few friends who weren\u2019t friends at all. Cocaine and heroin, and before I knew it... Never mind. You\u2019re not here to listen to my story, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can dance,\u201d he assured her simply.</p><p>She sipped her coffee. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything I haven\u2019t already told the cops. Stella did have a thing with Danny Zigler-on again, off again. And she had some regulars, but she didn\u2019t even tell me about them. She said that she was sworn to silence, \u2019cause big muckety-mucks never wanted anyone to know that they hung around with folks like us. I told her that the muckety-mucks were ashamed that they needed help to get it up, you know what I mean? But-you think that Danny might have killed her? Danny always seems like a nice guy. He\u2019s not ambitious, but...lots of guys down here aren\u2019t exactly balls of fire, you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t name anyone else she might have had a regular relationship with?\u201d</p><p>Morgana sniffed. \u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ll get you one.\u201d</p><p>The bar itself was still open. The fellow running it seemed to be Eastern European, possibly Russian. When David asked for a pack of cigarettes, the fellow\u2019s accent confirmed his thought. Russian or Ukrainian.</p><p>The bartender didn\u2019t know him, and he accepted the money for the cigarettes with no comment on his past or the day\u2019s events.</p><p>David brought the cigarettes to Morgana. She lit up and inhaled greedily, looking at David. \u201cYeah, yeah, they\u2019re going to kill me one day. But they keep me off the hard stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a judge, I promise,\u201d David told her.</p><p>She managed a laugh. \u201cNo, no you\u2019re not, are you. All right, what else can I tell you? Whoever local she was seeing who was in the higher echelon or whatever, I don\u2019t know. She did care about Danny, and they did see each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for helping me, for telling me that. What I need to know now is what happened that night. When did you last see Stella?\u201d David asked.</p><p>Morgana inhaled deeply and was silent for a few seconds. When she spoke at last, it was thoughtfully. \u201cWe worked that night, but she took off early. No, no, wait, that wasn\u2019t right. She took a break and went down the street. Then she came running back in. I tried to ask her what was going on-but she wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d Morgana hesitated a minute. She grimaced weakly and shrugged. \u201cShe-she could be a bit of a pickpocket, but she told me she figured she was actually helping the youth of America. If she stole their money and their cards, they couldn\u2019t get plastered and kill themselves on their way back up the island.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>David smiled. \u201cI guess there\u2019s some logic to that.\u201d</p><p>Morgana\u2019s smile deepened, and then faded.</p><p>\u201cShe really wasn\u2019t a bad person,\u201d she said. \u201cShe just-well, you know. She just didn\u2019t get the real opportunities in life. Both her folks are dead, at least that\u2019s what she told people. Whatever, she went from foster home to foster home and I guess she kind of learned how to survive. You understand?\u201d</p> <p>David nodded. He set a hand on Morgana\u2019s. \u201cMorgana, you certainly don\u2019t have to excuse your friend to me. She didn\u2019t deserve what happened to her. She had her quirks, she might have been a petty thief and even a prostitute. But I understand. She\u2019d never physically hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>Morgana nodded vehemently. \u201cThat\u2019s it, exactly. I\u2019ve seen the news. Some of those reporters are making it sound like she almost deserved what happened because of the life she led.\u201d Tears formed in Morgana\u2019s eyes again. \u201cOh, God, it must have been horrible. I can just imagine... I hope she didn\u2019t suffer long.\u201d</p><p>David said, \u201cMorgana, I saw her. I think it was very quick. She might not have known anything at all-until it happened. And she probably lost consciousness very quickly, and died after she had passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re all going to die, aren\u2019t we? I just pray that she didn\u2019t suffer.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to go on, but she seemed lost in thought.</p> <p>\u201cMorgana, please, help me,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She stared at him and nodded. \u201cRight. She came back in, and she worked until late. Three or four in the morning. But she was all excited. She\u2019d met a college kid. He\u2019d been in here earlier with friends. I think she was seeing him after. She didn\u2019t tell me, she wouldn\u2019t-because I don\u2019t turn tricks. I won\u2019t. Okay, maybe I\u2019m a fairly naked dancer and I do posture in front of old, hairy men, but I don\u2019t turn tricks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she wouldn\u2019t tell you about it-but you think she went back out to find someone. Was it a real date, do you think? Or was she out looking, hoping to make it a real date?\u201d</p><p>Morgana was thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019m trying so hard to remember what she said... All right, I think she had a run-in with the police. No! Wait, not a run-in. I think she escaped because someone else got nabbed, but let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said something about the \u2018poor kid\u2019 being a cutie and she sure hoped that she could make it up to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right. She was out-picking a pocket. She returned, and she went back out again. But you think the kid-or young man-she went out to find had been in the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you recognize the men who had been in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Maybe,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>David leaned back. \u201cYou\u2019ve been helpful, Morgana. You\u2019ve been great.\u201d College kids. He was sure they were the kids he\u2019d helped Pete with on the street the other night. He was already making a mental note of the local places that he\u2019d need to go to find them again. Liam was already on the case, of course, and he\u2019d already done a lot of the questioning that might be pertinent to this new information. \u201cLet me walk you home,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m way down on the south end. Off the really far south end of Duval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll walk you,\u201d David assured her.</p><p>She smiled. Just as she did so, someone suddenly burst out from the bushes behind them, streaking into the light of the bar\u2019s patio area. She was running so fast she plowed directly into their table.</p> <p>David stared in amazement while Morgana said, \u201cWhat the fu-?\u201d</p><p>David jumped up to steady the whirlwind, already confused and angry.</p><p>Even before she looked at him with wide, green eyes, he knew who it was.</p><p>Katie O\u2019Hara.</p><p>\u201cWhen I said wait for me, I didn\u2019t mean in a dark alley. There\u2019s a murderer on the loose.\u201d</p><p>David was seriously aggravated with her. Even before they had dropped Morgana at her apartment, his jaw had seemed locked, his words had been stilted and, when he touched her, it certainly wasn\u2019t with affection.</p><p>And what in God\u2019s name did she say?</p><p>You\u2019ll never believe this, but I see ghosts. And yes, they can startle me at times, but I\u2019m not afraid of them-they\u2019re just looking for something. They\u2019re here because they need help.</p><p>Her brother had already warned her. She didn\u2019t want to be known as the crazy woman who lived in Key West.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. She decided that she had to be on the offensive.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDavid, look. I like you. I really like you. But I grew up here. I work here. This is my home. I have walked these streets thousands of times. I can\u2019t lock myself in and forget about my life just because you\u2019ve suddenly come home, determined to catch a murderer, certain that what went on in the past is relevant to today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee. What a concept,\u201d he said, his tone grating. She looked at his face. If his features became any more tense, she thought that they might crack and then shatter, like glass.</p><p>He stopped dead. They were alone; the street was deserted.</p><p>He spun around to stare at her, not touching her, his hands at his sides and far too knotted to do so. \u201cWhat the hell were you doing?\u201d he demanded. \u201cThat was the most ridiculous excuse I\u2019ve ever heard! I just decided to go the quiet way,\u201d he mimicked. \u201cAnd there was a rustle in the grass, and silly me, I just panicked. My God, is that a crock!\u201d</p><p>Staring back at him, fighting for both composure and the right words, she felt ridiculously like crying herself.</p><p>It was really so hard. So hard to find someone in life who could make her feel the way that David made her feel. She\u2019d spent so little time with him, and yet, when bizarre things hadn\u2019t been happening, he hadn\u2019t been just sensually and sexually amazing, he\u2019d been someone who really knew her world, loved her world, diving, boats, the water, island life...</p><p>She lifted her hands. It hadn\u2019t gone that far, and by the look of him, it wasn\u2019t going any further. Stop it all right now before she was in deep, before it all hurt more than it already did.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I felt that I needed to be out. I\u2019d intended to stay on Duval with a zillion other people. Then I idiotically cut off and-this should please you-managed to scare myself half to death. Nothing happened. Nothing happened at all. I heard a leaf rustle, and in my present mood, I crashed back into light and noise as quickly as I could. How the hell did I know you were going to be there? Okay, sorry, I did know you were going to the strip club, but I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d be out on the patio. I mean, they strip inside. Except at Fantasy Fest, and that\u2019s not really stripping, that\u2019s just folks who like to show off their body paint.\u201d</p><p>He just stared at her incredulously. Then he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying!\u201d But she was.</p><p>He stared at her awhile longer. She realized that she had caught her breath.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m sorry, and yet I\u2019m not. I live here, this is my life,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou left, and now you\u2019re back, but that doesn\u2019t change the island and I-I can\u2019t let it change me. Please understand.\u201d</p><p>He let out a sigh of impatience.</p><p>He took her by the crook of her arm.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m not getting anything else out of you, not tonight anyway. Let\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>At least he wasn\u2019t going to walk off, just leave her in the street.</p><p>They started walking, almost ten blocks down Duval. Again, music grew loud.</p><p>They turned off and came to her house. She opened the door, and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cAm I invited in?\u201d he asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. To stay,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>They walked in.</p><p>And there was truth to tension, passion and emotion creating something wild and turbulent. In the hallway, they were in one another\u2019s arms.</p><p>As they moved up the stairs, they were already removing one another\u2019s clothing and their own.</p><p>In her room, they didn\u2019t touch a light or even the bedspread.</p><p>They just crashed down, naked and hot, seeking one another\u2019s lips and flesh, and making love as if they had known one another forever...</p><p>And as if there would never be another tomorrow.</p><p>David talked to Liam first thing in the morning, asking him if anyone had reported a burglary-other than the pickpocket the night before Stella Martin had been found. Liam brought up the reports for the night and the next day and told him no.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Stella\u2019s friend Morgana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d Liam told him.</p><p>\u201cI know. She said that you were a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, gee, shucks. Glad to hear it,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking out the angle you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m assuming that the guy you and Pete met up with Saturday night-the guy who filed a pickpocket report-is the guy who Stella worked over. Maybe those college guys involved in the fight are the guys Morgana is talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgana said she thought that Stella met up with a college student,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cBut the thing is, I don\u2019t think she was killed by a college student. Not that a psycho can\u2019t be that age-just that I doubt one of the kids down for the weekend would have the what-have-you to get into that museum, steal the tape and disappear without leaving behind a fingerprint, hair or single skin cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know that there was no physical evidence?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cIf there is, the crime-scene folk don\u2019t have it so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, I\u2019m going around to see if I can find out who was with Stella,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a list of where I, or other officers, have already been,\u201d Liam told him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d David said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to double-check anyway, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my best on this, you know that,\u201d Liam told him.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know you\u2019ve got my back, and I\u2019m grateful,\u201d David assured him.</p> <p>He was just closing his phone when Katie came down the stairs. She was freshly showered, her hair wet and back, wearing a terry robe.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said a little huskily.</p><p>She came up to him. He was perched on one of the bar stools at the kitchen pass-through and she sat on the one beside him, setting her hands on his knees.</p><p>\u201cI think I know where Stella might have been murdered,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He frowned and asked carefully, \u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, her gaze meeting his steadily. But she didn\u2019t speak again; she stood and walked around to help herself to coffee.</p><p>\u201cWalk with me, and I\u2019ll tell you what I think.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her coffee black, staring at him over the rim of the cup.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think you know?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cLogic,\u201d she told him flatly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you want to explain that logic?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me. Give me a minute-I just have to hop into some clothes, and I\u2019ll show you what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said gravely.</p><p>She smiled, and he realized that she had been waiting for him to believe in her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get home, though. I need to shower and change,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cGo to Sean\u2019s room, just grab something of his for this time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Sean on his way home? I feel a little strange, helping myself to his belongings.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe told me ages ago that if he hadn\u2019t taken things, they didn\u2019t matter that much. And you two were friends. His room is down the hall from mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks. But I still have to get home for a bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. But let\u2019s do this first. I may really be able to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She still stared at him for a moment. Smiling.</p><p>He should know the feeling. She looked at him the way people had once looked at him. He remembered his grandparents, his aunts and his cousin. Remembered what it was like to know that they didn\u2019t look at him with suspicion, but complete belief.</p><p>She turned and headed for the stairs. He followed her a second later. Sean and he were about the same size. He felt like an intruder, but he also hated putting on the same clothing after a shower. He figured Sean wouldn\u2019t mind a friend borrowing a pair of button-fly jeans and polo shirt.</p><p>He came downstairs, perched on the bar stool again and waited for Katie.</p><p>As he sat there, the newspaper sitting on the table, with a headline reading Murder in Paradise, suddenly rustled-and moved.</p><p>He frowned. He walked over to the table, thinking that the air-conditioning system must have a vent over the table.</p><p>But there was no vent.</p><p>He moved the paper. Nothing happened; there was no erstwhile bug hiding under the paper.</p><p>His imagination?</p><p>No, he\u2019d seen it move.</p><p>Even as he still pondered the strange rustling, Katie came running back down the stairs, now wearing a pin-striped sundress.</p><p>He found himself watching her.</p><p>She was...</p><p>Katie. Stunning, perfect and with that smile and those eyes that seemed to offer so much honesty, and yet...</p><p>Not really. She was keeping something from him. He hoped that she\u2019d trust him soon, and tell him what it was.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>They left the house together. He was silent, waiting for her to talk as they came around Duval.</p><p>She pointed. \u201cThere-the museum where Stella was posed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking that the person she was with stayed just on Duval-one of the cheaper places. But he didn\u2019t stay in a massive room with a bunch of other people. So, I was thinking there-\u201d She paused and pointed across the street. There was a little inn above a swimsuit shop. \u201cOr there.\u201d She pointed on the same side of the street, just down from the bar and the strip club.</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cNow, if they were on this side of the street, she might have come through the back, trying to avoid the cops. Assuming that Stella did rip someone off. The cops tend to be on Duval. So if she ran around in back... Come on. I\u2019ll show you what I mean.\u201d</p><p>During the day, especially this early, the patio was quiet. There were people walking around, sipping coffee here and there, but not that many. The place really began to come alive in the afternoon.</p><p>Katie took his hand and led him across the bar\u2019s patio and to the alley. There were private homes and B and Bs lining that side of the street, with a Vespa rental place at the end of the corner.</p><p>\u201cHere. Right here,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>She stood beneath the shade of a beautiful, old sea grape tree. The branches were overgrown, and it could certainly offer cover. If she had come here, though, and been murdered, she had to have been followed.</p><p>By her mark-or her john for the night?</p><p>Or by someone else. Someone else who may have known her lifestyle and her hours, and who might have followed her. If all the timing was right, she had been taken in the early or even late afternoon, before the real nightlife and music started.</p><p>Frowning, he came to stand beneath the sea grape tree. There were a lot of wild crotons in the area as well, making it a place where there was cover-where people might be hidden.</p><p>As he did so, he looked around, studying the patches of overgrown grass and weeds around them.</p><p>The wind rustled the leaves on the tree.</p><p>The sun glinted through.</p><p>David frowned and walked a few feet. He bent down. Something had caught the sun for just a moment.</p><p>It was a charge card, a \u201cgold\u201d card.</p><p>\u201cYou have a tissue?\u201d he asked Katie.</p><p>She produced one. He carefully picked the card up by an edge. It bore the name Lewis Agaro.</p><p>Lewis Agaro. He was the kid he had chased down in the street for Pete Dryer. The kid who had been accused of being a pickpocket, when it was probably Stella Martin who had done the picking.</p><p>\u201cYou know the name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know who the kid is, but I sure don\u2019t see him murdering anyone. He was terrified when the cops looked at him for maybe being a thief. I\u2019m pretty sure Pete will remember him, too. I think the kid was innocent, Pete just let him go. I think a few guys had been rolled by Stella, and they\u2019d complained, and Pete was ready to call her out for her extracurricular activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I want to talk to the kid myself before the cops do. And I want to find Danny first.\u201d He frowned pensively. \u201cLook. There\u2019s something sticky on the card.\u201d</p><p>Katie studied the card, as well. \u201cWhat does it mean-anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. If Stella rolled her last john, she might have lost something along the way-this guy\u2019s stolen credit card. If you\u2019re right about her being killed here, it might help us. If you\u2019re right, it might lead us to the kid Stella spent her last night with-Lewis Agaro,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what the hell is on the card?\u201d</p><p>She started to touch the card, but stopped, aware they might need to find prints on it. She looked him in the eyes. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken,\u201d she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s the remnants of drying chocolate ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny Zigler,\u201d he said.</p><p>10</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t see it, I really don\u2019t see it,\u201d Katie said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Danny could be a murderer. He worked for your grandfather. I\u2019d have had him work for me. Seriously, if we had to arrest everyone down here who didn\u2019t make a fortune and was happy just to be, we\u2019d be arresting a lot of people. And he\u2019s responsible-he\u2019s not living off anyone else. He does work. He just doesn\u2019t need to own the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, I came back, Sam Barnard came back-and Danny Zigler was suddenly busing tables at O\u2019Hara\u2019s. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little suspicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cEveryone is grabbing extra help with Fantasy Fest on the way. Hey-I don\u2019t manage O\u2019Hara\u2019s, and I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said. \u201cJon Merrillo hires on extra help when Uncle Jamie is away. Danny Zigler has worked there before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want Danny to be a bad guy, either,\u201d David said. \u201cBut he was at O\u2019Hara\u2019s the night Tanya died, and he\u2019s hanging around there now-and he was seeing Stella Martin. That makes him suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s politically correct anymore,\u201d Katie said. \u201cHe\u2019s a person of interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And I\u2019m interested. And I want to talk to him before they get him down at the station, but I don\u2019t want to hang on to evidence too long.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cKatie, I\u2019m going to talk to Danny Zigler. I have to find him, of course, but he should be at the ice-cream parlor. I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me around,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt will be easier for me to speak with him alone. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, look, I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re afraid for me, I really do. But it\u2019s broad daylight. I\u2019ll hang in clear sight, all right?\u201d Katie said. He was still staring at her. \u201cDavid, this is my home. A home I love. I intend to stay here, live here and be part of whatever the future brings. I cannot become afraid of my own home.\u201d She inhaled, meeting his eyes. \u201cI know how badly you want the truth, and I understand completely. But Tanya\u2019s death went unsolved for more than a decade. Let\u2019s face it, sometimes, things are never solved. I can\u2019t become paranoid, but we should always know how to be very careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever carry Mace or pepper spray or anything like that?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo. And I\u2019m afraid I never took karate classes, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Liam about getting you something,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cDavid, really-\u201d She broke off, seeing his eyes. \u201cPepper spray sounds like something good to keep in my bag,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cAll right.

His phone is turned off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been to his house?\u201d David asked.</p><p>The fellow, a tall, beefy man, leaned on the counter. \u201cDo you see me here? If I\u2019m here, I\u2019m not going by his house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have an address for him?\u201d David asked.</p><p>The man looked angry and exasperated. \u201cYou the cops or something?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the \u2018something,\u2019\u201d David told him.</p><p>The man stared another moment, muttered, then reached under the counter for a memo pad. He wrote down an address off Union Street. David thanked him.</p><p>David\u2019s cell rang as he started toward Union. It was Liam.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d David said. \u201cHave they brought anyone in for questioning yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Uniforms are out looking for Danny Zigler, I guess he and Stella were an item, and Pete is trying to track down the crowd that was outside O\u2019Hara\u2019s the other night. He thinks one of those college kids has to know something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZigler didn\u2019t show up for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything for a search warrant, and he didn\u2019t answer at his place,\u201d Liam told him.</p><p>\u201cSo-do you have anything?\u201d David asked.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019d asked me before about tracing down Mike Sanderson-Tanya\u2019s new boyfriend, the guy she was supposed to meet up at Ohio State.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know this much about Mike Sanderson-he used one of his credit cards for gas in St. Augustine on the thirteenth-the day after Tanya was killed,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>Katie felt Bartholomew striding along at her side. She cast a sideways glance his way. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, I have been using my charm and persuasion to discover the truth,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh? So-where have you been seeking this truth?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI hung around the museum for a long time, just watching the crime-scene folks,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you learn there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they\u2019re not going to get much of anything. Oh, well, I guess everyone knows this-there was no sign of a break-in. They had the owners and managers all gathered in an area, and that lieutenant fellow-Dryer-was pretty hard on them all, demanding to know how many keys were out and around. Two fellows-snowbirds-own the place, but there are three managers, and they\u2019re all local. Dryer wasn\u2019t getting anywhere, but Liam Beckett tried a bit more of an understanding approach, and it turns out that one of the managers left one of the employees to lock the place up a few nights ago, and she managed to lose the keys. They didn\u2019t rekey the place, they just had another set of keys made. Whoever broke into the place used the keys, apparently knew the alarm code and didn\u2019t disturb a thing-other than the Carl Tanzler/Elena de Hoyos exhibit. Oh-they found Elena. The mannequin of Elena, that is. She was just behind one of the other exhibits. So, this is what I know-whoever did it was bright enough to grab the security tapes, use gloves-and find out the alarm code before bringing in Stella Martin\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we are thinking local,\u201d Katie murmured. \u201cBecause I\u2019d say whoever did it had to have followed people around. When the employee lost the keys, he had to have found them-and he had to have known what they opened.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew grinned. \u201cThat, my dear, was not difficult. There was a medallion on the key chain that advertised the museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat opens it up, I guess. Hey, did the police hold anyone from the museum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, they have a task force going over everything that they have and they\u2019ll be bringing folks in for questioning by this afternoon,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cYou were gone overnight,\u201d Katie reminded Bartholomew.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. I came back to the house, but you were-occupied. I turned on the coffeemaker again this morning. You didn\u2019t even realize it!\u201d He was hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bartholomew,\u201d Katie said. \u201cI really am. I didn\u2019t see you and David had gone down first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d Bartholomew said, and sniffed. \u201cYou have rushed headfirst into this!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you, make up your mind. You like him or you don\u2019t like him,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cSince he was with you, he definitely didn\u2019t kill the prostitute,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cAll right, I like the fellow enough. He reminds me of someone I knew a very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew swept aside, as if he were physically there, as a group carrying fresh margaritas came down the street, laughing.</p><p>They could have walked through him.</p><p>Bartholomew liked to think that there was substance to him.</p><p>\u201cSea captain,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cDecent fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was one of David\u2019s ancestors,\u201d Katie said. \u201cThe family dates back to the early years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figure,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply; a woman standing with a beer just outside Sloppy Joe\u2019s was staring at her. It was evident that the woman was wondering if Katie was a crazy person talking to herself, or if she had started drinking too early.</p><p>Katie turned down Greene Street. Captain Tony\u2019s had been the original Sloppy Joe\u2019s. Sloppy Joe, however, had been a real Key West character. Angry over a hike in his rent, he had simply moved his establishment in the middle of the night, lock, stock and barrel. Now, Sloppy Joe\u2019s was right on Duval, and the space on Greene Street was Captain Tony\u2019s.</p><p>She stepped on into the bar.</p><p>A large, open doorway led to a setting with the feel of rustic outdoors, but air-conditioning still coursed through the place. The \u201changing tree\u201d was in the center of a sitting area, and it had become vogue for visitors to leave behind their bras, elegant and old-fashioned, whatever someone might be wearing.</p><p>Katie took a table near the tree. It was impossible to know, through the years, what was authentic and what was legend about the place. Fact or fiction, the stories behind the bar and the building were true Key West legend.</p><p>As she took her seat at the table, she closed her eyes and thought about all of the history behind this very spot.</p><p>Sloppy Joe, Joe Russell, had become friends with Hemingway when he had cashed a check for him that the banks wouldn\u2019t. He had been larger than life, just like Hemingway, and the two had been good friends. But, before that, the building had been a telegraph station that had first received the news about the Maine, an icehouse doubling as the city morgue, a cigar factory and a bordello.</p><p>The hanging tree in the middle of the room was now covered in undergarments. Throughout many years, it had been the place of execution for Key West and its environs. A woman had died here, accused of killing her husband and child, and she supposedly haunted the ladies\u2019 room.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>Katie opened her eyes. A perky and very young waitress smiled as she asked the question.</p><p>\u201cA giant iced tea and a menu, please,\u201d Katie told her.</p><p>She seemed disappointed that Katie hadn\u2019t come in to drown her sorrows with some form of expensive alcohol, but her smile barely cracked. \u201cComing right up!\u201d she said.</p><p>Bartholomew had seated himself next to Katie, extending a booted leg from one chair to another and doffing his hat. He looked disgusted.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason we\u2019re here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI like the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hoping that it\u2019s teeming with ghosts who will give you all the answers you want. Well, don\u2019t count on it. They\u2019re all still whining over the past, and they\u2019re not going to help you with anything in the present,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cStella Martin\u2019s ghost helped me tremendously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, she should have told you who killed her, flat out!\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cBut she doesn\u2019t know. Still, she led me to a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA credit card-and it was smudged with ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew let out a chortle. A few tables up, Katie saw a woman frown and look around. Then she shivered. She had felt that a ghost was near, apparently.</p><p>\u201cBehave,\u201d Katie murmured.</p><p>\u201cMe? You\u2019re the one who appears to be talking to herself!\u201d</p><p>She grimaced and waited for her tea. She thanked the young girl, sipped it and halfway closed her eyes. She tried to open up to anything that might be going on.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear the rope swing against the branches?\u201d Bartholomew asked softly. \u201cYou can hear it, back and forth, back and forth...swinging with the weight of a man.\u201d</p><p>She kept her glass in front of her lips. \u201cYou died here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I died here. I was snatched out of bed and dragged down to the hanging tree-for an act of piracy I did not commit. A bastard pirate named Eli Smith attacked an unarmed American vessel out in the straits, but when he was confronted by the authorities, he swore I was the guilty party, and I was hanged before the truth could be known. I was dead by the time a friend-the original Craig Beckett-came around to decry the act and tell them that I had truly turned merchant when my privateering days were over, and it was Eli Smith who attacked the vessel in the eight-gun sloop Bessie Blue. The true tragedy is that I, of all men, would have never attacked that ship. I was madly in love with Victoria Wyeth, and she died in the attack. Her father became a madman because of her death.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did they believe Eli Smith and assume you had attacked the ship?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause Victoria had been the love of my life, and we were going to run away together. Her father sent her out ahead, planning to make her live with relatives in Virginia until she forgot about me. I knew that I didn\u2019t have a chance of living with her, happily ever after, if I didn\u2019t convince her family that I was the man she should have, and Craig Beckett was highly respected. I\u2019d been on a simple fishing expedition with him when the attack had taken place, and he had promised that-after dealing with a smuggling problem up the islands-he\u2019d see to it that the old bastard Wyeth learned that I had been a privateer, and that I had never been a cutthroat pirate. All right, in some instance, there might have been little difference. But I had never, ever attacked an American ship. But that night, I was down toward the south of the island, sound asleep, and a lynch mob broke in on me. I managed a bit of a defense-slashed the nose off one hairy, old bastard!-but there were two dozen of them, and me. And so I was hanged from the neck until dead, and when I come in here now, I can still hear the rope scrape against the tree.\u201d</p><p>She forgot where they were, forgot that people might be watching, and set her hand over his. \u201cBartholomew, I am so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cWell, there were interesting years, and dreary years. I wanted to get to know Hemingway, he was an odd and interesting fellow-and that Carl Tanzler, he was certainly a curiosity. I wondered what I was doing here. My Victoria seemed to be long gone. Then I came across you, and well, if nothing else, Katie-oke is entertaining, and I think I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m hanging around because you so obviously need help and guidance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBartholomew, that\u2019s very sweet, but seriously, I\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d not be leaving you now, dear girl, for all the tea in China!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind, Bartholomew, but if the time comes when there\u2019s a better place for you, I want you to go,\u201d Katie told him earnestly.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s the strange thing. Maybe I have waited all these years for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you see, I was avenged,\u201d Bartholomew told her.</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, and that\u2019s probably why I like your boy David-even if I remain skeptical, wary and watchful. You see, his ancestor-Craig Beckett from many, many years ago-came back into town and saw that Eli Smith was hanged for his part in the attack and Victoria\u2019s death. Maybe that\u2019s what I hear!\u201d Bartholomew said with a touch of bitterness. \u201cSmith, eyes bulging, organs giving out, as he swung from the tree!\u201d</p><p>As Katie glanced across the room, she saw a woman leaning against the wall near the ladies\u2019 room. Her hair was loose, hanging down her back, and her clothing wasn\u2019t the elegant apparel of a nineteenth-century lady, but more like that of a woman who worked hard in her home throughout the day. Her blouse was white cotton, open at her throat, which bore angry, red marks. She seemed very sad. Katie had seen her before, but the woman never spoke to her.</p><p>The ghost saw a table where a group of young children sat with a mother and father. The kids were drinking Shirley Temples and munching on fries.</p> <p>The ghost drifted over to the table. She took an empty chair.</p><p>She looked longingly at the children.</p><p>The mother perked up, looking around. She nudged her husband, uncomfortable and not knowing why.</p><p>The husband asked for the check, and the family left.</p><p>The ghost faded away, still sad.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that Danny Zigler was capable of either of the murders,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back to the same question,\u201d Bartholomew told her. \u201cWere they both committed by the same person? Or was this a copycat killing?\u201d</p><p>Katie stood, deciding not to order any food. She left the girl bills that were double the price of the iced tea.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. I want to see if Liam is at the police station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Bartholomew asked her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know-you said something that made me start thinking that somehow we\u2019re missing something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer is crazy in the head, that\u2019s a motive!\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cI\u2019d hate to tell you a few of the things I saw in my day-just because someone could get away with it.\u201d</p><p>But Katie was already moving. She heard Bartholomew sigh-and follow her.</p><p>It took a few minutes to get through to Liam on the phone, but David knew his cousin would find the time to talk to him. Eventually, Liam came on.</p><p>\u201cSorry, David, this place is insane today. Procedure. We\u2019re bringing in everyone who worked at the strip club, and we\u2019re trying to track down anyone who was at the strip club that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable. What about Mike Sanderson? Has anyone pursued that angle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve put through some calls. Apparently, he became a salesman, and he isn\u2019t working by computer. We\u2019ve reached his wife, and she said he was traveling. She gave us all his numbers, but we haven\u2019t reached him yet. We\u2019ve contacted the Cleveland police to let them know that we need their help in a cold-case investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no one knows where he is right now, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But to go assuming he might be in the Keys or Key West again is a long shot, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But it\u2019s not the time to ignore any suspicion, however thin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not ignoring it, I promise. I don\u2019t have much time. I have to get back to questioning folks. No one is under arrest-everyone is coming in willingly, so we have to make it all quick and cordial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo word yet on Danny Zigler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. There\u2019s an APB out on him, and the black-and-whites have gone by his place to try to find him several times. We\u2019re getting a search warrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Liam said carefully, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollowing hunches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing illegal, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, if I do anything illegal, I sure as hell don\u2019t intend to tell you and compromise your position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, I have the police reports and all the old crime-scene photos and info to study. Don\u2019t worry, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted,\u201d Liam said with a groan.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d David said.</p><p>And he would. After his next stop, he\u2019d go by the station and turn in the credit card. The police might have already questioned the kid who had been with Stella.</p><p>He was glad to have the card; he wanted to talk to the kid. But he was pretty sure that Stella hadn\u2019t been murdered by a chance john. Whoever had killed her had premeditated the murder. She\u2019d been an easy mark. The display of her body had been far more important than her life.</p><p>He reached the house where Danny Zigler had his apartment.</p><p>It was on the second floor. He climbed up the stairs, came to the door and rapped on it loudly.</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>He hesitated, looked around guiltily, then pulled out his key chain and looked for a small tool that had helped him a dozen times in his travels in third-world nations when his belongings had wound up behind locked doors. He jimmied the little tool in the lock and it gave easily. This was the kind of thing that Liam didn\u2019t need to know.</p><p>The house had been built sometime in the eighteen nineties, divided into four apartments in the nineteen seventies and had had little done to it since. If there was one thing David knew well, it was Key West architecture. Two nice old features remained-open beams held up the ceiling, and the original marble fireplace stood across from the entry.</p><p>He stepped into the room. \u201cDanny?\u201d</p><p>But there was no reply. A quick look through all the rooms-kitchen, parlor, dining room, bedroom and bath-assured him that Danny wasn\u2019t here. Frustrated, he stood in the parlor. Danny wasn\u2019t particularly neat and clean, but it seemed that he picked up his clothing and washed his dishes.</p><p>A pile of books on the dining-room table drew David\u2019s attention and he walked over to see what they were. He hadn\u2019t thought of Danny as being a big reader.</p><p>They were all on Key West. One was on the New World discovery and Spanish settlement of the island, one was on David Porter, military rule and the end of piracy, and another was on the age of wrecking and salvage.</p><p>As he looked at the last, something fell out.</p><p>Money.</p><p>Ten thousand dollars.</p><p>Curiouser and curiouser, he thought.</p><p>Had Danny been bribing someone? Did he know something, and was he taking blackmail?</p><p>David wasn\u2019t supposed to be in Danny\u2019s apartment. Technically, he was guilty of breaking and entering. He really needed to get moving.</p><p>He laid the bills out on the table along with the books and reached into his pocket for the small digital camera he carried as naturally as his wallet. He took photographs of the bills and then the books, then returned the bills where they had been and stacked the books in their original position. He quickly walked around the apartment, taking shots of each room.</p><p>At last, he left.</p><p>As he did so, he had the feeling that Danny hadn\u2019t been back to his apartment in a while. He wasn\u2019t at home, and he wasn\u2019t at work.</p><p>Somehow, that didn\u2019t seem to bode well for Danny.</p><p>Sergeant Andy McCluskey was at the reception desk when Katie reached the station. He greeted her warmly. Andy had been a few years older than she in high school, and had been with the police department for the past four years.</p><p>\u201cLiam is pretty busy right now,\u201d Andy told her. He leaned across the counter, his voice low. \u201cNasty business going on. He\u2019s interviewing folks one by one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Well, I suppose there are a lot of people he needs to interview,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cI can tell him that you\u2019re here,\u201d Andy offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s all right, thank you,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know what you thought you were going to do here, anyway,\u201d Bartholomew said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She ignored him, thanked Andy again and headed back out into the sunshine.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d Bartholomew demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But when we were by the hanging tree, I felt that we needed to be looking into more than we\u2019re looking into. Let\u2019s say that these murders were carried out by the same person. That\u2019s kind of crazy in itself. Bizarre murders, or bizarre display of the victims. Over ten years apart. And both when people were suddenly reappearing in town. Sam Barnard is suddenly back. David is suddenly back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s two people,\u201d Bartholomew pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMy brother is due in soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree people. What a horde.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sarcastic. It\u2019s not at all gentlemanly,\u201d Katie told him.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Forgive me. You\u2019re young. I decided that my function in death was to keep you alive, and if it takes sarcasm...\u201d</p> <p>His voice drifted. She saw that he wasn\u2019t paying the least attention to her. He was looking down the street. \u201cThere she goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady in white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the story you just told me, you were in love with Victoria.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs she Victoria?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know who she is.\u201d He gave Katie his attention again. \u201cOkay, so, you wanted old police records-that\u2019s why we were visiting Liam. But I don\u2019t think you were going to get anything. David might be able to get information from Liam, but they don\u2019t hand out evidence to everyone on the street. We\u2019re not going to get any further on this today so maybe we should look into something else. Maybe we can find out who the lady in white is through old records. Let\u2019s go to the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but aren\u2019t you a bit fickle? What about Victoria?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cI know, in my bones-or lack thereof-that Victoria has moved on, and is happy. The woman in white needs help.\u201d Bartholomew smiled. \u201cShe needs me. So...let\u2019s go do some research at the library!\u201d</p><p>After spending some time reading the history of Key West, Katie looked up at Bartholomew. She glanced at the book he was reading, and was surprised to note that he had managed to turn a page.</p><p>She looked around quickly, but they were the only two seated in that section of the library. Leaning across the table, she saw that he was studying wreckers.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Katie asked.</p> <p>Bartholomew looked at her. \u201cI found my lady in white. Look-look at the picture. That\u2019s her! You can see the picture has her in the same white dress we\u2019ve seen her in. She\u2019s Lucinda-Lucy-Wellington. Her parents died of a fever, and she and her brother were left in penury. The brother earned command of a ship. She watched every day for him to return from a voyage to Boston. Captain Wellington was caught in a storm just off the south side of the island. Lucy\u2019s house was near O\u2019Hara\u2019s, and she spent the storm atop the widow\u2019s walk, praying the ship would come home safely. The wreckers discovered the ship, but not the body of Captain Wellington. Some say that Lucy cast herself to her death from the same widow\u2019s walk she had paced, and others say that she fell, trying to get a better view down to the shore when they were bringing in the flotsam and jetsam-and the bodies that washed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were here then,\u201d Katie reminded him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, I wasn\u2019t hanged until a few years later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t know Lucy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe might have been broke, but she was descended from...a better quality of people. I was a gentleman-surely you know that! But back then, social strata were strict. No matter what my demeanor, manners and riches, I wasn\u2019t easily accepted.\u201d He stared hard at Katie. \u201cYou have to talk to her for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBartholomew, I will try,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cLook, Katie, I\u2019ve turned another page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. Can we keep reading then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha! I just found a reference to your house, Katie. It was sold to Shamus O\u2019Hara in eighteen twenty-nine. He purchased it from a John Moreland, who had bought it from John Whitehead. Am I ever glad I was named Bartholomew! They were all John in those days. Thank the Lord.\u201d He looked up at her suddenly. \u201cImagine that, Katie. Your ancestors would have watched me on the day that I was hanged. And they certainly didn\u2019t lift a finger to stop the injustice of my execution.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>It wasn\u2019t difficult in the least to find Lewis Agaro.</p><p>David simply went from bar to bar, and found him in a small but rustic place near Mallory Square.</p><p>He sat down on a bar stool next to the slim young man. Lewis Agaro turned, took one look at him and started to bolt.</p><p>David set a hand on the kid\u2019s on the bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to take you down,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lewis looked around. He was looking for his older brother, David thought. But the brother didn\u2019t appear to be here.</p><p>Lewis sat. A barmaid came up, and David ordered a beer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be a blind and deaf man not to know about the murder,\u201d David said, his tone conversational. \u201cAnd I\u2019m wondering how it feels. You were the last one with her. She might have been a prostitute and a stripper, but she was a human being and you\u2019d definitely been attracted to her. Even though the cops were trying to bust you for something that she did.\u201d</p><p>The kid let out a breath, picked up his drink and swallowed down the remainder. A pulse was ticking at his throat. \u201cShe was cool,\u201d he said. \u201cShe-she had balls. She ripped me off, and I knew that when I woke up, but she didn\u2019t take all my money-she left me enough to get around. I would have gone back to the club. I would have called her out on it, but I swear, I wouldn\u2019t have hurt her.\u201d He turned to David then, and he did look tortured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that you killed her, kid,\u201d David said.</p><p>Lewis Agaro let out a long breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I swear I didn\u2019t. I had a night with her like no other. I woke up and my wallet had been rifled and she was gone. I went back to the club, but she wasn\u2019t there. Then-they found her body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone that night? Did she talk to you about anyone?\u201d</p><p>Agaro frowned, shaking his head. He was thoughtful. \u201cShe-well, we talked about the fact that I had almost been arrested for a pocket she had picked! She thought it was funny, and she wasn\u2019t afraid-even when I told her the cops thought it was her. She said she knew her way around town, and she knew her away around the law, real well. You-you don\u2019t understand. She wasn\u2019t a bad person. She was cool. She was like one of those folks on that TV show-Survivor! She wasn\u2019t like all-sex. She was affectionate, she had feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cops are going to arrest me, aren\u2019t they? They\u2019re going to think that I did it. Billy-my brother-he\u2019s all disgusted with me. He wanted to get the hell off the island. Billy-\u201d He paused, wincing. \u201cBilly didn\u2019t even know that I\u2019d hired her for the night. He wound up hanging out with some of his friends from FSU. He thinks I\u2019ll be called in-along with him-cause we were stopped in the street by that Neanderthal the other night and accused of robbing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be arrested, Lewis, but they will bring you in for questioning. Just tell them the truth. You\u2019re a kid from out of town, you couldn\u2019t possibly have staged the death scene at the museum. The cops aren\u2019t stupid. They know that.\u201d He pulled a cocktail napkin toward him and reached in his pocket for a pen. He scribbled down a name and handed the paper to the young man. \u201cThere\u2019s a name for a good attorney down here-a criminal attorney. If you need help, call him. He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford an attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I referred you. He\u2019s older than hell, better than anyone else you\u2019ll ever meet. I know-he stood by me once. He\u2019s an old family friend. You\u2019ll be all right. That\u2019s over with, so... Think. Please, think. Is there anything else you can tell me?\u201d</p><p>He perked up suddenly. \u201cThere was one thing. There was this guy. He\u2019d been upstairs-during the show. He tried to get Stella to talk to him, but she ripped her arm away from him and hissed something at him. And he told her he was working a whole lot. He was going to get money-she should quit what she was doing. I think that he knew that she had promised to come home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the guy look like?\u201d David asked, though he was sure he knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cSkinny, kind of thin face, about your age. Ah, hell, I\u2019d seen him before around here. My brother\u2019s friends were heckling one of the ghost tours, and he was the guy leading it. He made everybody yell at the hecklers, something like, \u2018You\u2019re cursed!\u2019\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He set a hand on the kid\u2019s shoulder and rose.</p><p>Danny Zigler.</p><p>But where the hell was he now? David was afraid that he wasn\u2019t going to find Danny. He still didn\u2019t believe that Danny Zigler was capable of murder. But neither was Danny capable of holding down the kind of job that could account for the money he had at his apartment. Danny had known or suspected something-maybe he even knew why and how Stella had died. The police would find the money in Danny\u2019s apartment eventually. Until then, it was something he was going to keep to himself.</p><p>He still had to find Danny. He was just afraid that he wasn\u2019t going to find him alive.</p><p>Katie\u2019s phone rang in the quiet of the library, making her jump. She answered it quickly, wondering if her heart was thumping because her caller ID read David Beckett, or just because she had been so startled.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. Danny Zigler is nowhere to be found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019ll turn up, I\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>David didn\u2019t reply to her statement. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not on Duval Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a happening place.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed softly. \u201cMaybe, but...while you\u2019re there, want to do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need these books,\u201d he said, and rattled off three titles. She scrounged in her purse for a pen.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll get them-if they have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that they do. Want to meet me at Craig\u2019s place?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t call it \u201cmy\u201d house. He called it Craig\u2019s place.</p><p>He didn\u2019t intend to stay.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get the books and be right there.\u201d</p><p>She hung up. Bartholomew was watching her. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting him at his house. Or-the Beckett house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe museum?\u201d Bartholomew asked, frowning.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no. The old Beckett homestead. Are you-coming with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, no. The Lord alone knows where the two of you might start madly coupling once you\u2019re there! Far more than I want to know or see or...\u201d</p><p>Katie groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s not all that...it\u2019s certainly not all that we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hang around the street. Watch the Fantasy Fest preparations. See if I can find the regular habits of my lady in white. But I\u2019ll walk you over, and I\u2019ll not be gone too long. God knows, that fellow is so determined to find the truth, he keeps leaving you alone.\u201d</p><p>Katie planted her hands on her hips. \u201cChill. He\u2019s going to get me some pepper spray. And I\u2019m not the karate kid, but I\u2019m not a ninety-pound weakling, either.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew leaned toward her, his face set seriously. \u201cKatie, this killer is strong. It seems that he snuck up on Stella Martin, surprised her and killed her with his bare hands. You\u2019re not a weakling, but this isn\u2019t someone you want to tackle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes it almost impossible for Danny to be guilty of anything,\u201d Katie said. \u201cHe is just about a ninety-pound weakling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, my dear, let me escort you,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p> <p>\u201cI just have to get these books,\u201d she said.</p><p>At home, David cleared off the formal dining-room table, removing his grandmother\u2019s silver candlesticks and the lace doilies she had used to protect the beautiful old, carved mahogany.</p><p>He laid out the photos from the original crime scene.</p><p>He also laid out his photos of the second crime scene.</p><p>He set out the files with pertinent crime-scene information and witness reports, but the latter revealed nothing. No one had seen anyone at the museum. No one had seen anyone on the street. No one had seen anything. In Tanya\u2019s case, she had been at O\u2019Hara\u2019s bar. She had left. She had never been seen again by anyone-except the killer-until she had appeared in the tableau.</p><p>Stella Martin. The police were still questioning people, but he knew more than the police did. She had slept with Lewis Agaro. She had rifled through his wallet, left his small lodging house through the rear and been killed beneath the branches of a large sea grape tree.</p><p>Someone had seen her leave the lodging house. She had been staying off Duval to avoid the cops, probably. She had gone around back. She had argued with Danny Zigler, and he was missing.</p><p>The crime-scene pictures were different. Tanya had been laid out like Sleeping Beauty; in death, she had been gorgeous, heart-wrenching.</p><p>Stella Martin had been dumped.</p><p>Two different killers?</p><p>The doorbell rang. He left the table and went to the door, letting Katie in. She seemed to enter hesitantly. He had a feeling that it was the first time she had been in the house since his grandfather had died.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t changed anything within it.</p><p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d he told her huskily. He reached out, taking her hand, pulling her in. Then he pulled her against him and she looked up and he stroked her cheek and kissed her. Instant fire. Anticipation increased by the fact that he knew her, and knew what could come.</p><p>He stepped back, smiling. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She cleared her throat, looking down the hallway. \u201cI got the books. What about these books do you think will help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were the books Danny Zigler was reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke into his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, David-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will know. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. You\u2019re a practiced lock pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was important that I see his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Danny was somehow in over his head. He was looking up all kinds of information on the area, too. Which makes me more curious about the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe past? You mean, the past as in ten years ago?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean the past. Something happened in the past, that is, history, that somehow has to do with all of this. I don\u2019t really understand yet. I\u2019m fishing. I think that Danny knows-or knew-something, and that it got him to thinking and...he was a carefree-Keys kind of guy, but we\u2019re mistaken if we take him for stupid. Anyway...I don\u2019t really know what we\u2019re looking for. I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll know when we find it.\u201d</p><p>She was frowning. \u201cYou have no idea where Danny is? You made it sound like something might have happened to him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that at all,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>He took the library books from her and set a hand on her back, guiding her into the dining room. She stepped away from him, frowning as she saw the display on the table. She whitened, looking at the full array of photos of the dead women, but she didn\u2019t turn away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if Tanya was treated with respect, and Stella was...well, treated as if she were lower class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes me think that our killer may believe in a social stratum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. But none of this seems to jive. You\u2019d need someone like a good old boy to have such a feeling of superiority, and someone smart to carry off planting the corpse in the museum, even if she was rather-dumped.\u201d</p><p>David pulled out a chair for Katie and then sat down, watching her. \u201cAh, Katie, it\u2019s rather nice and totally naive that you feel that way. Trust me. I\u2019ve seen it around the world. White supremacy groups-east, west, north and south-are not all peopled by the stupid or illiterate. And someone doesn\u2019t have to be that rabid or prejudiced to feel superior to a woman they might see as white trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true. David, what are the blue smudges-they\u2019re on the faces of both women. It\u2019s not something with the film, is it?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>He stood, rifled in a buffet drawer and produced a magnifying glass. He had noted the smudges before. They were on the tips of both noses, on the foreheads and the chins.</p><p>\u201cThey look like bruises. Pressure bruises, premortem,\u201d David said. \u201cAnd, I believe, it means that we are looking for one killer-a man who attacks from behind with a plastic bag or some such other item, smothering his victims before strangling them when they haven\u2019t the breath left to struggle. He wears gloves, and that\u2019s why his victims can\u2019t get their nails into him.\u201d</p><p>He sat back. \u201cI\u2019ve got to give Liam a call and then talk to Pete. He let me reopen the old case through Liam, just so long as I report to him. I really want to let them both know that they need to be taking a look at what I think are bruises. It really shows, in my opinion, that the victims were ambushed from behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThen-let\u2019s go barhopping.\u201d</p><p>Dusk was coming. In another hour, the sun would fall. Then night, with the sound of music and laughter. It became distant, like whispers from the past. Darkness was a lovely time, a time when the old trees tipped down protective branches, when streets were shadowed, when all manner of evil might exist and never be seen.</p><p>She was with him again.</p><p>Soon, the sun would set again. A magnificent sunset, the kind that had made Key West famous. On Mallory Square the entertainers would begin their night\u2019s work, hoping for tips. Cat trainers, magicians, acrobats, robotic people, all would begin in earnest...</p><p>Katie O\u2019Hara was with David Beckett.</p><p>Ah, yes, once again, David Beckett on top, carrying with him all the pompous righteousness of decades of Becketts, Becketts who shouldn\u2019t have survived to populate the island.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be with him all the time.</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t be with him all time. There were times when she would have to be alone.</p><p>He stared at the house, and he smiled, because he felt powerful. They all thought they were such great detectives, and they were such fools.</p><p>It was all moving along so smoothly. The island was agog with the murder of a whore, but hell, it was a capitalist\u2019s world. Fantasy Fest was on the way.</p><p>Oh, Lord, that would be so much fun.</p><p>It would make everything so easy.</p><p>And it would set the scene for one final and beautiful curtain call. He would finish it all, taking down the family.</p><p>Katie would have to die, and be immortalized.</p><p>The main thorn was David Beckett, so beloved of Craig!</p><p>And, at long last, David would go down.</p><p>He had seen his mistakes of the past; he knew better now. He had learned. David would go down.</p><p>Bless the state of Florida, and the death penalty.</p><p>The next time Katie\u2019s phone rang, it was Clarinda. David was still on his own phone, pacing around the table in the dining room as he put through two calls, one to his cousin Liam and another to Lieutenant Dryer.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, you there?\u201d Clarinda asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, hey, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonas and I are going to go down to Mallory Square. Want to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to Mallory Square?\u201d It was a huge destination for tourists, and, actually, beautiful and a lot of fun. The sunsets were spectacular. Jugglers, musicians, all kinds of entertainers came from all over the world to perform on the square. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe thought it would be nice. I take it you\u2019re still hanging with David Beckett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, of course, you\u2019re both obsessed with the death of that poor Stella Martin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you imagine,\u201d Katie agreed.</p><p>\u201cWell, no one can solve something like that, and if you two become too obsessed, you\u2019ll be worthless because you won\u2019t see straight. Come on out, we\u2019ll have drinks and dinner.\u201d</p><p>David had hung up. Katie looked over at him. \u201cIt\u2019s Clarinda. She wants us to meet with her and Jonas and walk around Mallory Square, have drinks and dinner.\u201d</p><p>She thought that he would turn down the idea, because he was-obsessed.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fine. What time are we meeting them, where?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat time, where?\u201d Katie repeated to Clarinda.</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour-sunset is coming soon. The bar behind the Westin, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>David had turned and was starting for the stairs. \u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to freshen up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I have to freshen up, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes!\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll run by your place, and you have twelve minutes.\u201d</p> <p>He was good to his word, but he came down having stepped into the shower, and with freshly shaven cheeks and damp hair. He was devastating, she thought. It wasn\u2019t the simple fact of his good looks, it was more. There was something that seemed hard and chiseled about his features, strong about his stature and compelling when he smiled. She took one look at him and nearly ran for the door, eager to get out before she longed to do something rather than leave and make their appointment.</p><p>They walked to her house, and he seemed light, taking her hand, swinging it as they hurried along.</p><p>Once in the door, he was all business. \u201cYou have twelve to fourteen minutes,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI can be faster than a speeding bullet,\u201d she promised.</p><p>And she was. She managed a sixty-second shower and chose a halter dress and sandals with one-inch heels, ran a brush through her hair, splashed water on her face and ran on back down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed-you have two minutes to spare.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, walked to him, leaned against him and kissed him. He smelled divine. He felt rock-hard, and yet warm and vital. His tongue moved in her mouth, and she forgot all about the sunset.</p><p>He moved back, smiling, smoothing her hair. She quickly opened the door and stepped into the night, locking the door behind her.</p> <p>\u201cSunset on Mallory Square. I can\u2019t remember the last time I was there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in a while myself,\u201d she said.</p><p>The city seemed to be teeming with people, even though it was a weekday. The air was already a hint cooler, and the sun was low in the western sky. Shadows seemed to darken doorways, as lights came on in the streets and streamed from shops and bars.</p><p>They crossed Front Street and continued to the square. The bar was crowded. There were advertisements everywhere for Fantasy Fest.</p><p>Body painting here. Whatever body part you want-painted!</p><p>Costumes of the absurd!</p><p>Beer for a buck!</p><p>Live your Fantasy-clothes optional up in the Garden!</p><p>\u201cHmm. I guess we are pretty decadent here,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cGrown-ups still like to dress up, that\u2019s all,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cOr dress down. I\u2019ve seen lots of costumes that consisted of nothing but body paint,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>They\u2019d reached the bar. Clarinda, dressed casually in a white pinstripe dress-one that made Katie glad that she had changed-came running out to meet them. \u201cCan you believe it? It\u2019s crowded as hell in there, and we haven\u2019t gotten to the first of the activities. But we\u2019ve got a table up top, so we can see the sunset and some of the performers.\u201d Clarinda smiled broadly, looping her arm through David\u2019s. \u201cCome on up and meet Jonas. He\u2019s a conch, too, but younger than you-he was in our class in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d David said pleasantly.</p><p>It might have been a normal night, Katie thought. Two couples out to enjoy time together.</p><p>Jonas was tall, on the thin side, with a shy smile, but a pleasant manner. He seemed honestly pleased to meet David, and greeted him without any mention of the past-or the present.</p><p>\u201cThe city is insane!\u201d he said, beckoning to their waiter. Katie and David ordered the draft-beer special for the night. David had his camera in his pocket, and though it looked like the usual slim digital camera that many people carried, Katie noticed that the lens was larger than most, and that it seemed to extend farther. Jonas asked him about the camera and David showed it to him, giving him the technical specifications. As he did so, Clarinda turned to Katie.</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that poor girl...it\u2019s a similar murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means a killer is loose,\u201d Clarinda said, and shivered. \u201cI\u2019m not making a move by myself, not a single move. I\u2019ve moved right in with Jonas, and you know that I always liked keeping my independence. You-you\u2019re hanging with David, right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Katie opened her mouth to answer, but Clarinda kept going. \u201cI mean, all you have to do is know him to know that he didn\u2019t kill anyone, but it is so bizarre that he\u2019s back here, and that girl...you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have complete trust in David,\u201d Katie assured her.</p><p>As she spoke, David, who had been showing the camera to Jonas with the lens extended, suddenly stood.</p><p>He stared through the camera for a long moment.</p><p>She tried to see what had so captured his attention.</p><p>Below them, one of the local entertainers-originally from France-was performing with his multitude of cats. Cats that walked on wires and hopped over one another, and cats who jumped through burning hoops. Katie had always liked the man-he adopted strays to train, or saved animals from the local pound. A group was around him, laughing and chatting, and he had just chosen two youngsters to come up and help with the act. Beyond him were a pair of comedians who worked with balloon animals, and they had the group around them laughing, as well.</p><p>Beyond the entertainers was the sea, darkening like the sky. It was a calm night. Sea and sky together were picture-perfect.</p><p>The lights in the square suddenly seemed to brighten.</p><p>The sun had taken another plunge downward into the night. Orange, mauve and crimson streaks were streaming across the sky, with a deep purple on top, promising that night was nearly here.</p><p>David suddenly moved. He dropped the camera on the table, and he was gone, streaking down the stairs to the ground level below.</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d</p><p>Katie strained again to see what had attracted his attention before grabbing the camera and bolting down to follow him.</p><p>Just past the balloon men, there was a lone figure gathering his own fair share of the audience. The actor was dressed up as Robert the Doll. His mask must have been off; as Katie watched him, frowning, she saw that he was adjusting it, retying the bow at the back of his head that held the mask in place.</p><p>Katie had always considered the doll to be an ugly thing-and she was stunned that any parents would have allowed anyone to give their child such a present. Maybe the parents had been afraid of the servant who had given their child the doll, and it was easy to believe that whoever had made the doll was well versed in voodoo. Though the real doll was about three feet tall, the man wearing the costume was at least six feet, his size seeming to make the \u201cdoll\u201d even uglier. The man\u2019s mask was well made, and he seemed to have a bizarre and creepy face, just like the doll. Most of the time, Robert sat at the East Martello Museum, but he had recently been at a paranormal convention where he had been reputed to show an aura with special photography. The doll was good for the museum and for tourism.</p><p>But it was creepy.</p><p>The actor was standing on a little plastic platform, holding a stuffed dog toy just like the real doll\u2019s and looking around the crowd in straw-stuffed silence with threatening moves.</p><p>Katie saw that David was making his way through the crowds, watching the cat man and the balloon artists, and heading for the doll.</p><p>She raced down the stairs in his wake, doing her best to weave through the crowd without plowing anyone down.</p><p>But as she reached the area where Robert the Doll was working, David burst in on him.</p><p>The actor forgot that he was working in silence. He let out a startled scream, jumped off his pedestal and started running.</p><p>David took off after him, and Katie took off after David.</p><p>David caught up with Robert the Doll on the grass behind the aquarium. He tackled him, as if he were sacking a quarterback, and the two plowed to the earth together.</p><p>People around them jumped back. Some gasped. One lady screamed. Another laughed and said it was part of the entertainment.</p><p>Katie rushed up to David, grabbing him by the arm. \u201cDavid! Stop it, stop! You\u2019re going to be nabbed for assault. What the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The man beneath him wasn\u2019t fighting. A crowd was gathering. David let her drag him up, but he stared down at the man below him, then extended his hand. The actor took it slowly. He rose. David reached out, ripping the straw mask from the actor\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cKatie, I don\u2019t think you ever met Mike Sanderson. Mike was the fellow Tanya fell in love with while I was gone. He was supposedly in Ohio when she was murdered. But he wasn\u2019t. He was in St. Augustine, we know, the day after, which means he could have easily been down here when the deed was done. And how very, very odd. Here he is-back again. Playing with history, dressed up like Robert the Doll. Maybe he likes to play at being Carl Tanzler, Count von Cosel, too. Maybe he needs a new dead bride every decade.\u201d</p><p>The man was big; as big as David, and even bulkier. The sailor suit had hidden some of his muscle.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t look as if he wanted to fight anyone.</p><p>It looked as if he suddenly wanted to do anything but entertain the crowd.</p><p>There was a sudden spurt of applause. Katie turned around to see that they had garnered a loud crowd-and they seemed to think it was all being done for entertainment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, good Lord! Go watch the cats,\u201d Katie cried out.</p><p>Mike Sanderson hadn\u2019t uttered a word. David was staring at him as if he could manifest daggers and press them into the man\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here!\u201d she said.</p> <p>She grabbed both men by the elbows, hating the fact that to get out of the crowd, she was going to have to get through the busy streets.</p><p>Walking arm in arm with Robert the Doll.</p><p>But Clarinda had reached them by then, and Jonas was right behind her. Neither of them had the least idea of what was going on, but Clarinda was always intuitive in any situation. \u201cWe can go right down Front Street, past the Old Customs House and the Westin, and then duck into Jonas\u2019s place. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>Katie felt absurdly like a college professor, struggling with fighting young adults. But after the first few seconds, there was no resistance from either man. When Mike Sanderson did stop suddenly, he explained himself quickly. \u201cI have a boxful of money back there-I need it.\u201d He blushed. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be on a sales trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Jonas told them.</p> <p>\u201cYou pretend to be on a sales trip-and you come here to pretend to be Robert the Doll?\u201d David demanded.</p><p>\u201cFantasy Fest, every year,\u201d Mike Sanderson admitted sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been doing this?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cSince I left. Well, not exactly. I finished college, and then, since then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cI love it. I love Fantasy Fest. I always have. My wife hates it. So I pretend I\u2019m on a sales trip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you love this place-when Tanya died here?\u201d David demanded.</p><p>Mike Sanderson stopped walking. He was rock-solid; Katie almost tripped when as she had been leading him along, he then pulled her back.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill Tanya!\u201d Sanderson said angrily. \u201cAnd don\u2019t kid yourself-I know exactly who you are, and I know that she stayed here just because she wanted to talk to you. I don\u2019t think she was ever coming with me. Not once you had come back. But I didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really think we should get inside for this discussion,\u201d Clarinda said. \u201cThat\u2019s Jonas\u2019s place, there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an inn,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, but go up the stairs, he keeps the whole second floor of the main house for himself.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, Jonas came running back up to them, Mike\u2019s donation hat in his hands. \u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it? Crowd like that-not a soul touched his money. Sometimes, human beings are decent.\u201d</p><p>No one answered him. He cleared his throat. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get upstairs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The outer door was open; it led to hallways with signs that indicated room numbers and pointed to cottages outside. They hurried up the stairs; the door in the hallway was locked and Jonas quickly opened it for them. They piled in.</p><p>Mike Sanderson moved first, striding across the room, tearing off the Velcro that held his Robert the Doll sailor outfit together in the back. He was wearing the costume over a pair of cutoff jeans and a simple white T-shirt. He folded it and put it at his feet. Katie realized that David was still holding the man\u2019s cloth mask and sailor hat when Sanderson reached out to him. \u201cDo you mind? I don\u2019t intend to press charges, but I do make good money at this gig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make good money, standing in Mallory Square, pretending to be Robert the Doll?\u201d Clarinda said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cFour hundred bucks already tonight,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cBeats selling vacuums, which I do to keep the family going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-you were supposed to be a big-shot football player at Ohio State!\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cKnee injury. They loved me before it-I was yesterday\u2019s news afterward,\u201d Sanderson said.</p><p>She studied him. He was a big fellow with sandy-blond hair, light brown eyes and a pretty-boy face that seemed to be getting just a little fleshy at the edges now, as if he were a man who liked his booze.</p><p>\u201cThe police down here want to talk to you,\u201d David told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, my wife called me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you come into the police station?\u201d David asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here,\u201d Sanderson said with a sigh of impatience. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? No one knows I do this. Hell, what, everyone\u2019s life turns out to be what they want? I come down here. I see all the naked painted boobs for Fantasy Fest. I don\u2019t go with any lowlifes, I don\u2019t pick up any sexual diseases, I just do a lot of looking and drinking, and I make money to bring home by putting on a Robert the Doll costume and scaring people in the square. It\u2019s a personal thing. What the hell is wrong with you, and what the hell business is it of yours that I do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s police business because you lied when they questioned you a decade ago,\u201d David said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s police business because another woman was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook-I do this for the money! I\u2019m not hung up on Key West legend,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cI loved Tanya! I wouldn\u2019t have hurt her for the world. I was young. I waited for her-then I figured that she\u2019d chosen you over me. When I heard about the murder, I panicked, and I got the hell out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will have to tell that story to the police,\u201d David said.</p><p>Sanderson straightened where he sat. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll be happy to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sanderson shook his head and winced. \u201cLast Friday,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBefore Stella Martin was murdered,\u201d David pointed out.</p><p>Sanderson stood, pointing hard at David. \u201cLook, you bastard, you were the jilted lover. You owned the damned museum. You\u2019re a fucking conch, for God\u2019s sake-you\u2019re the one all into the history and legend of Key West. They would have locked your ass up if you weren\u2019t David Beckett!\u201d</p><p>To David\u2019s credit, he completely controlled his temper. He stood dead still without speaking for long seconds.</p><p>Sanderson took a step back from him. \u201cLook, maybe you didn\u2019t do it. But I know this much-I didn\u2019t do it and you can haul me down to the station anytime you want.\u201d</p><p>David looked over at Jonas. \u201cWant to take a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-uh-sure,\u201d Jonas said.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? The sun has been down a long time now,\u201d Clarinda said. \u201cWhat a lovely evening out with friends!\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>The night sergeant on duty was ready to bring them in. David had called Liam, and Liam, who had just left for the evening, called Pete Dryer, who had left just a bit earlier, and the result was that both men would be returning to the station.</p><p>Clarinda sat in the waiting area, shaking her head at Katie. \u201cI feel as if I\u2019ve just been brought in on some kind of a sting. Look around, will you?\u201d</p><p>There was an odd assortment of people in the station that night. There was a drunk who was crying in the arms of another drunk.</p><p>A junkie.</p><p>A belligerent fellow being held on a drunk-driving charge.</p><p>It was hopping.</p><p>Fantasy Fest was all but here.</p><p>Liam Beckett came back through the door first. His white polo shirt bore a police insignia and he was in neat work khakis. He was totally professional, shaking hands with Mike Sanderson and thanking him for coming in on a voluntary basis. Pete came through the doorway just a minute later, looking worn-as he should. One of the city\u2019s most important and biggest festivals was on the way, and a murderer was loose in the city.</p><p>Pete nodded at David. \u201cThanks. Thanks for talking this fellow into coming in. We can take this from here, David.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, David looked as if he didn\u2019t want to move. Then he nodded. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said.</p><p>But as they started out, he held back for a minute. \u201cHang on, I just have to catch Liam quickly.\u201d</p><p>He went back in before Katie could try to stop him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord-is he coming back out, do you think?\u201d Clarinda asked.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cUmm, maybe not,\u201d Jonas said after a minute.</p><p>Just when Katie was about to give up, David came out. He was smiling. He slipped an arm around her shoulders and one around Clarinda\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhere shall we go for dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUmm-anywhere,\u201d Jonas said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure we can get in anywhere,\u201d Clarinda said. \u201cThe city is teeming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Hara\u2019s,\u201d Katie said dryly. \u201cI can always get in there.\u201d</p><p>Clarinda laughed. \u201cMy night off! But that\u2019s all right-I do know they have good food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we can park in back there, too. I know the owner,\u201d Katie pointed out.</p><p>The evening ended, oddly enough, on a good note. Jonas was fascinated with photography, and David talked about different places he had been. Jonas pointed out that with all that David did, now was the time for him to go back and do some shots and film work in his own backyard. \u201cMy God, think about it. We\u2019ve got more wildlife and shipwrecks than a dog has fleas,\u201d Jonas pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou know, that\u2019s odd,\u201d Clarinda noted. \u201cDavid, you and Sean wound up going into just about the same thing. You\u2019ve been very successful with your still work and Sean\u2019s usually doing video or film or whatever. Do you ever work with video?\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cI love both. Still life is capturing a single moment with the subject, light and characters just right. But film is great-it\u2019s life in motion, or dust motes moving through the air. Last year, I did some work in Australia, filming oceanographers searching for one of the really well-preserved wrecks recently discovered there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut have you and Sean worked together?\u201d Jonas asked.</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Sean in ten years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe keep up with e-mail now and then, but we\u2019ve never worked on the same project.\u201d</p><p>Jon Merrillo, Jamie O\u2019Hara\u2019s main manager in his absence, stopped by the table. He was about forty, and hadn\u2019t been in the Keys very long. He had taken to the area like a native; he loved it, and never wanted to go back North. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou guys can\u2019t get enough of this place, huh?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cI just love a night when the drunks aren\u2019t pestering me!\u201d Clarinda told him.</p><p>\u201cHey, we don\u2019t let drunks pester folks here, Clarinda, and you know I\u2019d never let that happen,\u201d Jon said.</p> <p>\u201cI do know, Jon.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. \u201cHey, Katie, have you talked with your uncle Jamie?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She felt guilty. She shook her head. \u201cNo, but I have spoken with Sean. Sean is coming home-I expect by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it will be good to see Sean. I\u2019ll give Jamie a call myself tomorrow. I figured he\u2019d want to be back by the end of the week. It\u2019s already getting insane.\u201d</p><p>He left them. Clarinda sighed. \u201cAh, well, so much for my plans for a lovely sunset and dinner on the water.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try again later in the week,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Clarinda sniffed. \u201cI get next Monday off and that\u2019s it-we\u2019re heading straight into ten days of events and pure mayhem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll go next Monday,\u201d David assured her.</p><p>They finished with their coffee and the Key lime pie-really homemade-that Katie had talked them all into ordering. In the car, Jonas asked, \u201cShould I drop Katie, we\u2019ll see her in safely, and then drop you, David?\u201d</p><p>Clarinda smacked him on the arm. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Just go to Katie\u2019s place. David is staying there. This is not a time for pretense of any kind. Katie should not be alone, and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha,\u201d Jonas said. He looked at David and David nodded.</p> <p>Jonas left them at Katie\u2019s house, and they waved goodbye. They could still hear the loud sounds of revelry coming from Duval Street. \u201cKind of like Christmas, huh?\u201d David asked. \u201cFantasy Fest starts just a little bit earlier every year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to be glad. We do survive off tourism,\u201d Katie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYep. I guess I have been gone a long time,\u201d David noted.</p><p>They walked into the house. Katie moved ahead, into the kitchen. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s interesting that Danny Zigler was reading about the history of Key West. I mean, he grew up down here, we all heard it all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe heard the history-but Danny must have had a reason to want to learn more about it.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew thought so, too. So did she.</p><p>Katie made a mental note to pursue that theory the following day. \u201cDo you think that something happened in the far past that might have had something to do with Tanya\u2019s murder? Is that why her body was left in the museum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Oh, by the way, I gave the credit card we found to Liam and told him that I was pretty sure that the stuff on the card was ice cream. I don\u2019t know what is going on, but sure, maybe something from the past can explain it all. Tanya was from the area, and her family went way back-I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know. But, I intend to find out. I\u2019ll start reading the books tomorrow,\u201d David said.</p> <p>She had started to pick up the kettle. \u201cWant some tea or something?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He took the kettle from her hands and set it back on the range top. He pulled her into his arms. \u201cYes...I want to bury myself in you, and forget the world, and even my own obsessions for the night,\u201d he told her. \u201cI mean, of course, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. She stared up at him, wondering how she could feel so mesmerized by the sound of his voice and the feel of his arms.</p><p>She threaded her fingers through his dark hair and met his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re good, you know,\u201d she teased. \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEloquent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, very.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? It gets worse. I was thinking that I could die in the radiant sunset of your hair, drown in the sea of your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy eyes are kind of hazel-green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen our waters blue and green, every shade between, and even dark and wild and wicked when storms are coming through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery eloquent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd strong, too,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He swept her up into his arms.</p><p>Her world was in turmoil; he was still, she was certain, to others, a person of interest in a murder case-or cases. He was obsessed with the truth.</p><p>But at that moment, it didn\u2019t matter. The world was holding still, and the world was pure magic. Wonderful, carnal, hot, wet magic.</p><p>\u201cStrong, too,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>They fell into her bed so easily. So quickly, naturally. Clothing only half off, they were kissing and removing tangles of clothes. She was aware of him as she had never been before, the sound of his breathing, every movement of his muscles, twist and turn, the beating of his heart. He was an experienced lover, and she didn\u2019t want to think of anything that had come before in his life, or in her own. She just wanted to feel. And it was so easy. He knew where to touch, and where to kiss, and where to tease most sensuously with his tongue and teeth. Movements could be so tempestuous and passionate, and then just a breath or a whisper against her skin could send her spinning into a new spiral of arousal.</p><p>He kissed along her breasts. Ribs and abdomen. Teased beneath her thighs.</p><p>Moved ever more erotically.</p><p>And when she nearly reached a pinnacle, he would pause, just to lead her upward again, until she was frantic, returning every whispered breath, every touch, seeking to crawl into his very flesh, writhe and arch in absolute unison and abandon.</p><p>Eventually they lay together sated, exhausted and replete, and still touching while the cool air moved over their flesh.</p><p>She curled more closely to him.</p><p>\u201cEver so eloquent, in so many ways!\u201d she whispered to him.</p><p>\u201cAye, but you make it so very easy to speak ever so ardently!\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Smiling, she lay against him, and slept.</p><p>An hour later, she opened her eyes.</p><p>A breeze was blowing.</p><p>A breeze shouldn\u2019t have been blowing. The windows were all closed.</p><p>But...</p><p>She thought that her drapes were billowing, blowing inward.</p><p>A bolt of lightning flashed across the sky.</p><p>And for a moment, it seemed that Danny Zigler was standing there. Standing there-just outside her window. He couldn\u2019t have been; her bedroom was on the second floor. There was no balcony beyond it. There was just...air.</p><p>She gasped, blinking.</p><p>She bolted up, and next to her, David bolted up, as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe window!\u201d she said.</p><p>He jumped out of bed and went over to the window. The drapes were flat; there was no breeze. He moved the drapes.</p><p>The window was closed. And bolted.</p><p>He turned back to her in the shadows of night.</p><p>\u201cDavid...I\u2019m sorry. I must have had a nightmare,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry to have wakened you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right, perfectly all right,\u201d he assured her, climbing back in bed with her and taking her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m probably the reason you\u2019re having nightmares,\u201d he said, smoothing her hair back.</p><p>She felt cold, chilled, and yet he was warming her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak, she just curled against him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the reason for her nightmares, she might have said. He was far more a dream of something real and wonderful.</p><p>But time here and now was suspended; she didn\u2019t know where it could take him, and pride was a wonderful thing. Something that was great to cling to-when the warmth went away. If it went away. She just didn\u2019t know what the future would bring.</p><p>She lay silent.</p><p>She drifted off, and it wasn\u2019t until morning that she opened her eyes and really wondered about what had happened the night before. What she had seen in her mind\u2019s eye, or in her soul, or with the strange gift/curse that was just part of who she was.</p><p>A sense of dread and pain filled her.</p><p>Danny Zigler was dead.</p><p>Coffee had already brewed when David came down the stairs. He was surprised; he\u2019d never seen her set a timer the previous night, but the coffee was good.</p><p>He had come down quietly, trying not to wake Katie after slipping into Sean\u2019s room for a shower. He didn\u2019t dress, just put on a towel, but swept up his clothing, needing his cell phone, which was in the back pocket of his jeans.</p><p>It had seemed that Katie had tossed and turned much of the night. He didn\u2019t want to awaken her until she was ready; she might want to sleep late. He didn\u2019t want to leave the door unlocked, but he was also anxious to get to his house-they\u2019d left the books there.</p><p>But he could at least make phone calls.</p><p>After he poured himself coffee, he called Liam.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he asked his cousin.</p><p>\u201cSo, we spent a couple of hours with Mike Sanderson. I have a bunch of computer geeks following all the information he gave me. He said that he wasn\u2019t in Key West when Tanya was killed, that he had gone up to Miami, and he can surely find the charge-card slips to prove that he\u2019d taken a room-and if he can\u2019t find them, we can get them from the credit-card company. We found the one for St. Augustine, but not Miami, and he claims he had a bunch of student cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he was in Miami, it\u2019s a three- or three-and-a-half-hour drive down. You could easily book a room in Miami and come back down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. But I\u2019m not taking Mike Sanderson to be a boy genius. I just don\u2019t see him renting a room, getting down here, killing Tanya and getting her into the museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see Danny Zigler managing such a feat?\u201d David demanded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. We still can\u2019t find hide nor hair of Danny Zigler,\u201d Liam told him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t show up for work as a tour guide last night. We\u2019re getting a search warrant to go through his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pick up the kid? Lewis Agaro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPicked him up and questioned him. And I had the lab analyze the substance on the credit card. It was sticky, and might have given us a clue as to where Stella had gone once she took the card. Of course, the kid might have gotten the stuff on the card himself, but we can\u2019t leave anything to chance. Have to follow up on everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was chocolate ice cream,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do. I think Stella was pretty tight with Danny Zigler, which, of course, doesn\u2019t mean anything. She might have seen Danny, and she might not have,\u201d David said. \u201cBut I believe Danny knows something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went into his place. He was researching Key West, and had thousands of dollars in one of the books he was using. Liam, for now, let\u2019s not let this get out to others, or to the press.\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t! I\u2019d have to admit my cousin was guilty of breaking and entering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t break anything,\u201d David assured him.</p><p>\u201cPete has called the D.A. about getting a warrant to get in there, but if Danny has been guilty of...something, he wants it all by the book. I\u2019m assuming a warrant is coming soon,\u201d Liam said. \u201cBut-you didn\u2019t leave fingerprints anywhere, did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t worry-I watch TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did it go with the kid? Was he able to give you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s guilty of anything other than a wild crush on a wicked older woman,\u201d Liam said. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve told me about Danny Zigler\u2019s apartment and the money...what the hell do you think is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that Danny is dead. He knew something. He was blackmailing someone, or someone was paying him off for his silence in some way, shape or form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would he be dead now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe that he suspected or knew something before-and that he might have pieced whatever it was together-and knew who killed Stella. Liam, I know you\u2019re a cop, a detective, and that you have to carry on an active investigation. But you only know about that because I\u2019m guilty of a crime, so until you get that search warrant, can you keep what I\u2019ve told you to yourself for your own investigation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to... Ah, hell. I\u2019ll follow whatever angles I can on that in confidence-for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Do you know anything else? What about forensics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you know what I do. She wasn\u2019t violated-she\u2019d had sex with condoms, don\u2019t know how much, but there was no evidence of sexual force or violence of any kind. She had chicken nuggets and fries for dinner. Oh-this is new. We had known, of course, that the killer wore gloves and took the women by surprise. But the lab found bits of cells that might help us eventually-amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara? It\u2019s a synthetic leather, used in making warm-water dive gloves,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cRight. Our killer wears dive gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf of Key West might own dive gloves with amara,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Liam sighed. \u201cLook, at this point, it eliminates half of Key West, so that\u2019s good. Oh, yeah, the gloves have silicone on the fingertips. That might narrow down the brand. Look, I\u2019m grabbing at every straw out there, and so is the entire force.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you holding anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have Sanderson, but we can only keep him until tonight. He hasn\u2019t called an attorney, because we aren\u2019t going to call his wife-unless we find something on him. I let the kid, Lewis Agaro, go. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s staying for Fantasy Fest anymore. It was his first year down here as a twenty-one-year-old. Guess he\u2019s going to be looking back at being underaged as the good old days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. All right. Keep me posted. I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re keeping an eye on Katie, I take it?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d David said.</p><p>His cousin was silent.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you disapprove?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cShe deserves more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean she deserves more than someone who is just using her while trying to chase away the ghosts of his past. Sorry, you might want to belt me for that, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>David hesitated. \u201cDid I move in on anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, she and I are friends, good friends. She\u2019d deserve a lot better than me, too-all I seem to do these days is work. You\u2019re leaving, David. You know you\u2019re leaving. So keep it honest, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am honest,\u201d David assured him. He hung up, reflecting.</p><p>He was honest, wasn\u2019t he? Or was anything about him really honest? What he felt was. The need to leave this place had been just as basic. What did he feel now? He didn\u2019t know. He\u2019d been a lot of places-he\u2019d hit every continent, every ocean.</p><p>And now?</p><p>He tensed, hearing something at the door. He tightened his towel and looked around instinctively for a weapon.</p><p>As he did so, Katie came tearing down the stairs from her room-heading straight for the door. \u201cKatie!\u201d he warned.</p><p>He grabbed the coffeepot; he wasn\u2019t going to be able to stop her.</p><p>She was already throwing the door open.</p><p>Sean O\u2019Hara stood there.</p><p>It had been ten years, but Sean had changed little. He was tall, well built, redheaded, lithe and muscular. He\u2019d made an amazing running back during their high-school days.</p><p>He had a backpack on, and two huge duffel bags sat by his feet.</p><p>\u201cSean!\u201d Katie said, and threw herself in her brother\u2019s arms.</p><p>Awkward as hell! David thought. He hadn\u2019t ever intended to lie, he\u2019d never meant any harm to anyone, nor did he feel any need to apologize. He and Katie were definitely adults now, and they had chosen to be together.</p><p>He just hadn\u2019t planned on wearing a towel when he first saw Sean.</p><p>\u201cKatie O\u2019Hara!\u201d Sean said, sweeping her up and spinning her around as he came into the room. He let out a fake groan. \u201cWait, give it a minute, I\u2019m getting old now, and you and the backpack at the same time... Nope, nope don\u2019t think so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home!\u201d she told him, standing, righting herself and stepping back. \u201cI thought you\u2019d call me, though, and tell me you were in the state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you have a cell phone, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it never works when I try to call you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, well, I\u2019m here, and-\u201d Sean\u2019s voice broke off sharply. He stared at David. David realized that he was still holding the coffeepot. He set it on the range and stepped forward, his arm extended.</p><p>\u201cSean. Good to see you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think that Sean was going to accept this situation easily; he was just stunned. He shook David\u2019s hand.</p><p>But then he stepped back. He looked from Katie to David, and back to Katie. Then David again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? What the hell is going on here?\u201d he demanded. He lifted a hand. \u201cNo, no, no, wait. I don\u2019t want gory details, I can see what the hell is going on. The question is...what the hell is the matter with you? David, hell, this is my baby sister! Katie-the man could be a murderer. Sorry, David, no real offense meant, but by statistics... You idiots!\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cSean, your \u2018baby\u2019 sister is in her midtwenties, and capable of making choices and decisions,\u201d David said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a murderer, and frankly, no offense, our sleeping arrangements aren\u2019t any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell they\u2019re not!\u201d Sean exploded. He wasn\u2019t a redhead of Irish lineage for nothing, David decided. \u201cKatie is-my sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, this is my choice,\u201d Katie pleaded. \u201cAnd David was one of your friends-a good friend, until you more or less deserted him and turned against him like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d David said, grating his teeth, \u201cthanks, but don\u2019t defend me. Look, Sean, I care about your sister a great deal. I believe she feels the same way about me.\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t answer him. He turned on Katie. \u201cI did not turn my back on David,\u201d he protested. \u201cI never deserted anyone.\u201d He looked at David. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in contact through the years, off and on. I have never turned on a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, I never suggested that you turned on me,\u201d David said. \u201cLook, Sean, honest to God, I mean no offense, and certainly no disrespect here. I care about your sister, a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a murderer loose in the city again,\u201d Katie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping with him for protection?\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Katie said, horrified. \u201cNo, oh, Lord, Sean, will you please...chill! Let\u2019s get your stuff. Have some coffee-give me a minute to take a shower and get dressed. You and David talk-you haven\u2019t actually seen each other in a decade. Talk. Don\u2019t either of you go defending me or my honor in any way, do you understand?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wearing a towel!\u201d Sean said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not in the high-school gym anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have clothing,\u201d David assured him. With dignity, he swept up his shirt and jeans-desperately glad that he had needed his phone and so taken his clothing from Katie\u2019s room-and headed into the downstairs half bath. When he emerged, Sean had brought his bags in. They were dumped in the hall. Sean was sitting on one of the bar stools, a cup of coffee gripped in his hand.</p><p>Sean glowered at David. \u201cSo. Now a prostitute named Stella Martin has been found dead at a different museum in a similar pose. Fill me in,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>David told him what he could. There wasn\u2019t much.</p><p>\u201cDanny Zigler?\u201d Sean said. \u201cHe\u2019s weird enough-but he\u2019s a runt. And not the sharpest knife in the drawer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny didn\u2019t do it,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that because?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that Danny had the strength to kill with his bare hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he suffocated his victims first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuffocating, you still fight. I think the killer had to be big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur size,\u201d Sean said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Our size.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean shook his head. \u201cAnd...Katie is the one who showed you the area where she thought that Stella had been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say...or do...anything weird, did she?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d Sean stared at David. He was still frowning.</p><p>\u201cSean, I have never felt about anyone the way that I feel about Katie,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cThat was fast,\u201d Sean said, his tone dubious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRemember that fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast, slow, whatever, it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you suddenly love her and you\u2019re going to give up a life of fame and fortune to come home and live the easy life of an islander and raise a passel of little conchs?\u201d Sean mocked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen in the future,\u201d David said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that I take nothing about your sister lightly, and that we are emotionally entangled and not just opting for something like a best-friends-with-benefits deal.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked away and nodded. \u201cSorry. She is my sister. And I did walk in to find a man who had been a good friend-and a suspect in a murder-in a towel in my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Katie came hurrying down the stairs. \u201cSo, do you know everything that\u2019s happened on the island since you\u2019ve been gone?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Sean glanced over at David. \u201cI haven\u2019t been gone for a decade-I was here at Christmas,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about-well, I guess I\u2019m talking about Stella Martin,\u201d Katie said lamely. \u201cAnd the past,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Sean let out a sigh of aggravation. \u201cKatie, I told you to stay out of it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, you\u2019re not my keeper. And thank God-you\u2019re never here. So don\u2019t go all protective on me now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you letting her get into danger?\u201d Sean asked David.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting her into danger-I\u2019m trying to stay with her as much as I can to make sure that she\u2019s not alone,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m home now,\u201d Sean said.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d Katie protested. \u201cHey, I did fine on my own without either of you, so don\u2019t you two go getting the testosterone thing going and try to manage me, either of you!\u201d</p><p>She stared at the two of them.</p><p>Sean looked at David.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m with her when you\u2019re not,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be alone. And there will be times...when I might be worried about her,\u201d David admitted.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Katie protested.</p><p>David\u2019s phone started to ring again. He snapped it open. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>The voice was sweet and feminine. And old.</p><p>\u201cAunt Alice!\u201d he said, his heart sinking.</p><p>\u201cDavid, you are here. And you haven\u2019t been by.\u201d</p><p>Alice and Esther were actually his great-aunts. They had never been anything but patient and kind, and he knew that they loved him, that his leaving had hurt them and that he had been a selfish ass not to have taken the time yet to see them. They were both octogenarians now, with Esther closing in on ninety.</p><p>He loved them both.</p><p>They were incredible storytellers; they knew the island far better than any teacher he had ever had in high school.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Alice told him, \u201cwe\u2019ve heard all about that dreadful business with another poor woman murdered. Your cousin Liam has been terribly busy, and he\u2019s said you\u2019ve helped out with talking to folks, but...we were hoping you could stop by for some lunch.\u201d</p><p>Katie and Sean were staring at him, curious. As he looked at them, they looked away, embarrassed at inadvertently eavesdropping.</p><p>\u201cMay I bring a few old friends?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, David! When haven\u2019t we welcomed your friends?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>Katie had thought that Sean was going to refuse the invitation to David\u2019s aunts\u2019 house, but he was determined at the moment to stay close to her, she realized. It was good that her brother cared, she thought.</p><p>And irritating.</p><p>He had rented a two-seater convertible in Miami.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I could possibly need more than two seats,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy car is in the drive-just move your rental, mine is the obvious choice,\u201d Katie told him.</p><p>\u201cWe can walk,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re past the cemetery-it\u2019s almost a mile. Let\u2019s just drive,\u201d Sean said. He was coming with them, but it was obvious that he was tired.</p><p>So they drove, Katie at the wheel. She slowed down as they passed the cemetery, trying to drive and see what spirits might be about in the bright light.</p><p>As ever, the beautiful, spectral figure of Elena de Hoyos moved among the graves.</p><p>She saw no one else.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Sean asked her sharply.</p><p>\u201cDriving,\u201d she replied.</p><p>She pressed harder on the gas pedal. Past the cemetery two blocks, she turned the corner and came to the beautiful old Victorian where Alice and Esther Beckett, spinster sisters, had lived most of their lives. As she pulled into the drive, the two came hurrying out the door and down the porch steps.</p><p>She recognized them; they were known throughout Key West and the islands. They had been born rich, and they had used their money wisely and well all their lives, helping with every cause in the world. They gave money to several churches-Alice was quite certain that God didn\u2019t discriminate between minor differences in worship-as well as animal-rescue leagues and all the medical charities for every organ in the human body. They were truly loved.</p><p>They both rushed to David as he exited the car, fawning over him with hugs and kisses. They knew Sean as well, chiding him for not coming by when he was in town. Sean, perhaps feeling a bit of guilt, flushed and told them that he was seldom in town-he and David did similar work.</p><p>At last it was Katie\u2019s turn, and she received an abundance of love as well, even if she had never visited the house at all.</p><p>\u201cMy Lord! Sean\u2019s sister! Oh, my goodness, well, Jamie O\u2019Hara\u2019s niece, of course. What a beauty!\u201d Alice gushed. \u201cEven more so than your mother, and oh, my, Esther, remember how lovely and sweet she was. I understand your parents have moved from the house, but when they\u2019re home, you must beg them to stop by, too. Sadly, we tend to be such hermits these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just horrible,\u201d Esther said. \u201cAnd, oh, how I miss your grandfather, David. The world is a far sadder place with Craig gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was certainly the best and finest man,\u201d David agreed.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, we\u2019re standing around here outside when lunch is waiting!\u201d Alice chastised.</p><p>\u201cCome along in,\u201d Esther urged Katie, taking her by the arm.</p><p>They were all introduced to a woman named Betsy, an attractive thirtysomething Bahamian who tended to the elderly sisters\u2019 needs. She had already set up lunch on what the sisters referred to as their spring porch, a back porch with a tiled floor and screened windows that caught the sea breezes.</p><p>Lunch was a feast. Salad with berries and nuts, blackened grouper, vegetarian pasta-just in case-and all manner of fresh-baked breads.</p><p>The conversation was light at first as David and Sean talked about a few of their foreign exploits with photography and film, and Katie explained how she had wanted to come home to live, and thus formed her corporation, Katie-oke.</p><p>They were delighted.</p><p>\u201cI used to carry quite a melody in my day!\u201d Alice assured her.</p><p>\u201cEver hear a honking swan?\u201d Esther asked.</p><p>\u201cEsther!\u201d Alice chastised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m teasing you, dear, of course!\u201d Esther said. \u201cMy sister still has a lovely voice for a torch song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to get you in there,\u201d Katie told her.</p><p>\u201cWell, certainly, but not until Fantasy Fest is over,\u201d Alice said.</p><p>Later, when pecan pie had been served, they moved out to the parlor for \u201ca touch of sherry,\u201d as Alice phrased it.</p><p>\u201cExcellent for the constitution,\u201d Esther assured them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that, Aunt Alice?\u201d David asked, pointing to a large ledgerlike book that sat atop the mantel.</p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d Alice replied. \u201cThat is our family history, young man. It\u2019s always been there. You\u2019ve never asked before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cCertainly. We\u2019ve been here forever-but then your family has, too, Katie, Sean.\u201d</p><p>David stood and brought the large, embossed book back to the sofa. \u201cHow old is this thing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, it was started in the eighteen twenties,\u201d Aunt Esther said. \u201cThe first fellow to write in it was Craig Beckett-not your grandfather, David, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was quite a man, from all accounts,\u201d Alice said proudly.</p><p>\u201cCraig Beckett?\u201d Katie said. She wanted to see the book herself. Actually, she wanted to take it right out of David\u2019s hand. \u201cHe was a sea captain, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, he was. He sailed for Commodore Perry, and then for David Porter. In fact, the name David came into our family because of David Porter. Craig was admired far and wide. He could take down pirates-but he wasn\u2019t a cruel man. I mean, many a pirate was hanged here, of course, but if a man could prove himself a privateer, Craig Beckett always showed mercy. He was strong, and he was fair.\u201d</p><p>David was turning pages carefully. The ledger was nearly two hundred years old. It hadn\u2019t been kept under glass-it was part of the family\u2019s heritage, and Katie was certain that both aunts had read it through and through.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, look-he writes it himself. He had a fellow named Smith hanged. Seems like Smith was a bit of a bastard. Attacked a ship and killed all aboard-then saw another man hanged for the deed.\u201d David closed the book, carefully set it back on the mantel, and turned to his aunts. \u201cThat was wonderful. I\u2019ll be in town for a while, at least. Next time, I\u2019ll take you out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean rose and Katie followed suit. The aunts stood as well, ready to walk their guests to the door.</p><p>\u201cDavid, darling, you must come here again, too-anytime. You\u2019re family, and we do love you so!\u201d Esther told him.</p><p>\u201cOf course. But I want to take you out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it will have to be somewhere quiet these days,\u201d Esther said. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk!\u201d</p><p>They both stood on tiptoe to kiss David then Sean goodbye. When they came to hug Katie, she asked, \u201cWould you two trust me to take your ledger for a few days? I would absolutely love to read it. I\u2019ll be very careful with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course!\u201d Ester said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be delighted for you to read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we know you\u2019ll take care with it,\u201d Alice said.</p><p>She thanked them. Sean looked at her and rolled his eyes, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to be careful!\u201d she whispered to him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit frightening, borrowing a family treasure,\u201d Sean said, aware that the others were looking at the two of them.</p><p>\u201cKatie, I know you\u2019ll take it home and take good care of it,\u201d Alice said. \u201cWe\u2019re not worried in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll defend it with my life,\u201d Katie promised.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, don\u2019t do that, child,\u201d Alice said, smiling. \u201cYour life is worth far more.\u201d</p><p>A minute later, they were in the car, heading back. One of the streets was blocked for construction; Katie hadn\u2019t intended on coming down Duval with its throngs of tourists, but she did so.</p><p>\u201cGood God, what is that?\u201d Sean demanded from the backseat.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. Her eyes were on the road. Tourists didn\u2019t have the sense to look before they stepped off the sidewalk.</p><p>A red light allowed her the chance to look. One of the shops had a Robert the Doll mannequin out in front, except it was oversize.</p><p>\u201cA balloon?\u201d Sean asked, puzzled.</p><p>David was looking out the window, as well. \u201cNo, I think it might be canvas, but it\u2019s got some kind of an inner structure, wood or metal. Damn, that\u2019s ugly.\u201d</p><p>Katie kept driving. She could see that there was a line to get into the museum where Stella Martin had been killed and laid out.</p><p>Stella was still at the morgue.</p><p>And people would be thronging in to see where she had lain.</p><p>\u201cCapitalism at its best,\u201d Sean murmured.</p> <p>\u201cWe do need to survive as a city,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>She drove on, turning down her street and bringing the car into the drive. \u201cSean, should I back out and park in the street so that you can reach your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to bed. I could sleep for a week. If I go to sleep now, I may feel human again by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She parked the car and they all got out. Sean headed toward the house and then looked back. He strode over to them with purpose. \u201cAll right, someone has been killed, and Fantasy Fest may be starting off with a bang, but there is a killer on the loose. Katie, if you two don\u2019t come here for the night, you make sure that I know you\u2019re staying out.\u201d</p><p>He stared at David.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d David told him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, it\u2019s a little bit weird, but I actually prefer it if you stay here at night,\u201d he said.</p><p>Neither of them moved.</p><p>Sean waved a hand in the air and walked on into the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a run down to the police station. Will you go in for a while and promise me that you\u2019ll stay there?\u201d David asked her.</p><p>She lifted the journal. \u201cSure. But you know, I work tomorrow night again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m getting to just love karaoke,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>She kissed his cheek and headed into the house. \u201cLock it!\u201d he called to her, and then started walking.</p><p>Katie went on in and set the ledger on the dining-room table. She wished that she had the books from the library as well, but they were at David\u2019s house.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t read more than one at a time anyway, she told herself.</p><p>It had been hot outside. She ran upstairs, jumped into the shower and afterward slid into the coolest cotton dress she could find. The shower refreshed her, and she went back downstairs. She set the kettle on the range top to boil. Now that she was cooled down, she was in the mood for a cup of hot tea.</p><p>She turned away from the stove and went dead still.</p><p>Her heart thudded against her chest, and seemed to stop.</p><p>Danny Zigler was here.</p><p>She looked to the door, and saw that it remained locked.</p><p>She had seen him last night; it might have been a dream, or something like a dream, but she had already seen Danny, and she had thought that he was dead.</p><p>But now she knew.</p><p>How she had ever imagined that he might be flesh and blood, that he might have broken into the house, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>He began to fade even as she stared at him. He had his old baseball cap in his hands, and his hair seemed unkempt. His clothes looked mussed and dirty.</p><p>\u201cDanny,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He faded away completely.</p><p>Then he reappeared. He pointed to the table.</p><p>She frowned, looking down.</p><p>He was pointing at the journal she had taken from the Beckett house.</p><p>\u201cDanny, what is it? What am I looking for?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He faded away again, his arm, hand and then fingers disappearing last.</p><p>Then, there was no one there at all.</p><p>13</p><p>Craig Beckett wrote a wonderful log. It was personal, but she assumed that he had gotten accustomed to keeping such a diary because he\u2019d been a ship\u2019s captain.</p><p>He had lived a long life, dying at the age of ninety-six in eighteen ninety-five. He painted a vivid picture of when Key West had been little more than a trading post with a hardy group of settlers working to turn it into a place that would boast, in the Victorian era, the highest per capita income in the United States.</p><p>It was the early pages she turned to first. He wrote about being a young sea captain in the navy and his decision to leave the navy and work for David Porter as a civilian.</p><p>He described the events she had learned about from Bartholomew in detail. Of course, he hadn\u2019t seen the attack that had taken Victoria\u2019s life-the attack that Eli Smith had blamed on Bartholomew-but described it from imagination and experience. The canons firing and fire streaking through the sails of the ship, men and women screaming as smoke, fire or the tempestuous sea threatened their lives. Pirates killing everyone in their path with their broadswords. It was an unprovoked attack, and one that shocked the town, because David Porter had all but eliminated piracy a few years before it had taken place.</p><p>Craig Beckett wrote about his friendship with Bartholomew. \u201cA man of my heart; a man who loved the sea, and his country. He might have remained a brigand, but he knew that I spoke to him truly, that I understood how he had taken enemy ships and no others. In the city, he was a model citizen, but also a man, who came to love too deeply if not with sense. I sincerely doubt that the rascal Smith could have ever started such a rumor, one so vile as to take a life, if Bartholomew had not so deeply loved Victoria. It was with the heaviest of hearts that I learned of the crowd that formed, a lynch mob, one with no more sense than that of a school of fish, darting here and there at the whim of one, that burst in upon that good fellow and dragged him to the hanging tree. They say that he died with dignity, claiming his innocence and showing no fear.\u201d</p><p>Katie was surprised to feel her eyes stinging, and then she realized that tears were dampening her cheeks.</p><p>She wished that she could hug Bartholomew.</p><p>Not that she knew where he was!</p><p>Ah, well, she would do her best when she did see him next.</p><p>When he had seemed so taken with the woman in white-the one he now knew to be Lucinda, whose brother had died in a storm-he had told her with a certain wistfulness that Victoria had moved on. She was not among those walking the streets of Key West in any spectral way. She must have been a very strong woman-killed so ruthlessly, and yet able to move on to the higher plain of heaven, or wherever it was that the souls of the dead finally found peace.</p><p>Katie turned a page in the book, careful to dry her hands so as not to smear the ink or hurt the delicate pages.</p><p>Bartholomew\u2019s story was a sad one. She could certainly understand it if he was to walk around near the hanging tree, still crying out his innocence.</p><p>She started reading again. The days of the bold wreckers came into play. Sponge divers, builders, settlers...</p><p>After a while, she felt a presence near her. She looked up, thinking that Sean might have awakened, even if he had said that he could sleep for a week. But it wasn\u2019t her brother.</p><p>Bartholomew was back. He was perched on the edge of the table.</p><p>\u201cI was reading about you,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand in the air. \u201cYes, it was quite unjust, but a very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been this time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPolice headquarters. Apparently, Lieutenant Dryer has been combing the streets, and he\u2019s quite irritated by all the shenanigans for Fantasy Fest. Seems he can\u2019t get in the questioning he wants at various bars because there are so many people in the streets. Anyway, that\u2019s left most of everything at the station in the hands of Mr. Liam Beckett, who is dealing with all competently, even if his frustration level is quite high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you learn anything new?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot at the station,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can tell you this-Danny Zigler is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen him, too?\u201d Bartholomew asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was here-for a split second. He pointed at the book,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the book is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain Craig Beckett started it, and other Becketts over the years have kept it up. It\u2019s not exactly a family bible, but it\u2019s history as the Becketts saw it over the years,\u201d Katie explained.</p><p>\u201cThere we are-back to the past,\u201d Bartholomew said, deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you see him?\u201d Katie asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDown on Duval. He was looking up at the strip club. He faded to nothing the minute he saw me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that, unlike our other ghosts, Danny may know who killed him,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cHave you told anyone that he\u2019s dead?\u201d Bartholomew asked.</p> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Katie sighed deeply. \u201cWho is going to believe me? What am I going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that is a problem. You might suggest to someone that you believe that he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I don\u2019t think they need me for such a suggestion. No one has been able to find him.\u201d</p> <p>Bartholomew waved a hand in the air. \u201cThey might believe that he killed Stella Martin, and that he\u2019s in hiding. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what the lieutenant believes. When he left the station, he told Liam Beckett that he was sorry, but that he was going to damned well take care of the whole Danny Zigler disappearing act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d</p><p>The sharp sound of her name startled her. She glanced up the stairway.</p><p>Sean was awake. He hurried down the stairs, his hair tousled, a worried frown twisting his features. He came to her at the table, looking around.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m reading the Beckett family book,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, I heard you-loud and clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>She was suddenly weary of the doubt from her own brother. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you taught me to say, Sean? People will think that you\u2019re crazy, don\u2019t ever tell them that you speak to ghosts?\u201d</p><p>Sean groaned. \u201cOh, God, Katie, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, I\u2019m telling you the truth!\u201d</p> <p>He walked away from her, slamming his palm against his forehead. \u201cI should never leave you. Screw the whole career thing. My only sister is going to wind up locked away in a nuthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you so much for the vote of confidence!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, the dead are-dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. As you say. Therefore, I wasn\u2019t talking to anyone.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her and walked to the end of the table.</p><p>Right where Bartholomew was sitting.</p><p>He walked by Bartholomew, pacing. \u201cAll right, Katie, you talk to the dead. If you talk to the dead, why don\u2019t you mumbo jumbo up one of the murdered girls and ask her who killed them?\u201d Sean demanded.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know who killed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer walked up behind them with some kind of plastic bag, slipped it over their heads and then strangled them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow convenient. They never saw his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d she said stubbornly.</p><p>He reached for the chair at the end of the table. \u201cCall one of them. Let me ask a few questions through you.\u201d</p><p>He started to sit. She gasped as Bartholomew stood and angrily tugged at the chair. To Katie\u2019s amazement, it moved.</p><p>And Sean plunked down on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Katie cast Bartholomew a glance and hurried to help her brother to his feet, but Sean was already up.</p><p>And confused. He gripped the chair hard before sitting in it again.</p><p>He stared at Katie, folding his hands slowly before him. \u201cKatie, you\u2019re beautiful. And brilliant. And you have the voice of a lark. You love it here, you want to live and work here, and that\u2019s all great. But maybe you shouldn\u2019t be here. Maybe you\u2019re just too steeped in the history-and water sports,\u201d he added dryly.</p><p>\u201cSean, I talked to ghosts when I was in school, in New York, and in Boston,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cIs there a ghost in here now?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the dead women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sean was waiting. \u201cA pira-a privateer named Bartholomew,\u201d she said. \u201cHe moved the chair because you were mocking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBartholomew. Bartholomew, can you hear me?\u201d Sean called out loudly in a deep voice.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell him that I\u2019m dead-not deaf?\u201d Bartholomew demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe said that he\u2019s dead, not deaf,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Her brother shook his head. \u201cKatie, I want to believe you. If he\u2019s here, why can\u2019t I see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t he see you?\u201d Katie asked Bartholomew. \u201cBy the way, you can ask the questions yourself. I don\u2019t need to repeat them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t see me the way some people can\u2019t hear a tempo, the same way some people have no empathy for others, the same... He doesn\u2019t have the right sense for it, and he just isn\u2019t willing to try,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cNo insult-most people don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says that you don\u2019t have a sixth sense,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo protect you, of course!\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to protect me,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cTell him that I\u2019m home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why won\u2019t he leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s got the sense and intuition of a peg leg!\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the sense and intuition of a peg leg,\u201d Katie told her brother.</p><p>\u201cLord help us all!\u201d Sean muttered.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Katie, he\u2019s your brother, but he\u2019s just about daft,\u201d Bartholomew said. He walked to the book. She saw him concentrate.</p><p>Then he picked it up; it floated in the air.</p><p>He let it fall with a heavy thud.</p><p>Sean leapt out of his chair, staring. He looked at Katie, then at the book. Naturally, he picked up the book, searching it for wires.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Katie said, \u201cI am good friends with this fine fellow, Bartholomew.\u201d</p><p>Sean set down the book. \u201cKatie... Look, whatever this was, whatever you see...hear, you still have to keep it quiet. Do you understand? A man like David will think you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that you were happy about David to begin with,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cDavid was my friend. An all-right guy. But he\u2019s bitter, tainted. Life hit him hard, and now he\u2019s back, and there\u2019s been another murder. It\u2019s almost like someone is trying to frame him-or he is a murderer and brilliant and I\u2019ll have to shoot myself when I haven\u2019t saved you from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know that for a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was sleeping with me when the last murder was committed.\u201d</p><p>Sean groaned. \u201cOh, good God, I don\u2019t want details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Here\u2019s the truth of it. He\u2019s gone off and gotten rich on his own, and pretty damned famous and respected in his field, as well. He isn\u2019t going to stay here. He hates Key West. He\u2019s going to care for you-and leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he leaves, I\u2019ll be glad of the time we shared,\u201d Katie said stubbornly.</p><p>Sean looked around the room. \u201cBartholomew, talk some sense into her.\u201d</p><p>Sean started for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he turned to look at her, a hand on the banister.</p><p>\u201cDanny Zigler is dead.\u201d</p><p>Sean let out a long, low groan. \u201cDo you happen to know who killed him? I mean, does he happen to know who killed him? Or where he is, for that matter?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe-he doesn\u2019t really know how to be a ghost yet.\u201d</p><p>Sean just continued up the stairs.</p><p>Katie sat back down at the table. Bartholomew perched on the edge of the table again, grinning. \u201cActually, your brother is not wretched. After all, he\u2019s an O\u2019Hara. They usually knew how to drink, and how to fight-and all in all, remain honest men!\u201d</p><p>David was glad of the phone call when it came. He\u2019d been reading computer screens for so long, his eyes were blurring. He was going to find the truth. Where Mike Sanderson had been and when.</p><p>Thanks to Liam-and the fact that everyone knew Pete tolerated him, and he\u2019d gone to school with half the force-he was able to hang around the station and make use of it.</p><p>\u201cDavid, it\u2019s Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, everything is fine.\u201d Sean hesitated a minute. \u201cI just wanted to check in. Any word on Danny? Katie is really worried about him. She thinks he might be dead.\u201d</p><p>David was quiet a minute. \u201cI think he might be dead, too. I don\u2019t think he could have been the killer. I think Pete does, though. He\u2019s been out most of the day, hunting for Danny. I\u2019m not sure if he thinks Danny was guilty, or if he\u2019s angry that he\u2019s disappeared. Or if he\u2019s worried. He\u2019s getting a search warrant for Danny\u2019s place, and he\u2019s going to serve it himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, well...I\u2019ve known Danny a long time and I was just thinking about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>When he hung up, David stood and stretched. He closed the files and glanced at his watch. It was eight o\u2019clock, and he was getting hungry. He thought about stopping for takeout, but decided that though he could call, he\u2019d just walk back to Katie\u2019s house and find out what she wanted to do for dinner.</p><p>What they wanted to do. Her brother was home now. Sean would be included.</p><p>He stuck his head into Pete\u2019s office, where Liam was still working. \u201cDo you ever go home?\u201d he asked his cousin.</p><p>Liam looked at him bleakly. \u201cI want to be on the street. Can\u2019t-not with Pete out. Sure, I get to go home. I usually have it pretty easy. But, sweet Mother Mary, this is just not good. Fantasy Fest-in the midst of all this.\u201d He sat back and tapped a pencil on the desk. \u201cMike Sanderson is back out there now, and Tanya\u2019s brother is out on the street, as well. No one seems to care too much about Stella Martin, other than her friend Morgana. She\u2019ll wind up in a pauper\u2019s grave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you follow through on the location where I found the charge card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Couldn\u2019t find anything else. Here\u2019s what\u2019s sad, really sad. This guy is good. He doesn\u2019t leave evidence. He leaves the bodies in an exposed place-seriously exposed. They\u2019re posed almost as if he\u2019s fooling around, as if he\u2019s using the most bizarre local story. I talked to one of our police behavioral profilers today. He\u2019s convinced that the killer has to be local and uses the scenarios to prove that he\u2019s local, that this is his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping we find something soon. Before he strikes again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d David said. \u201cWell, thanks for letting me pry. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie goes back to work,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there. Oh, and Sean got home today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Liam seemed surprised.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Katie knew he was coming. She didn\u2019t know exactly when,\u201d he said dryly, remembering how Sean O\u2019Hara had come upon them.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think he was expected for another few weeks,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him being home?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I was just thinking that it is all so odd. You\u2019re back. Sam Barnard is here. Mike Sanderson has apparently been coming back for years, and now...Sean O\u2019Hara, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the tides,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s odd. That\u2019s all-it\u2019s odd. Hey,\u201d Liam said, changing the subject. \u201cIf I don\u2019t hear from you during the day, I\u2019ll see you at O\u2019Hara\u2019s tomorrow night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Fantasy Fest starting up,\u201d David said.</p><p>Liam nodded, and let his head fall to the desk.</p><p>David left then, deciding to walk home and see what was going on. There were throngs on the sidewalks everywhere. Music blared from the clubs. He passed the giant effigy of Robert the Doll. It appeared to be anchored at the feet by a large weight, covered by plastic.</p><p>A woman walked by him, snorting. \u201cIt smells almost as bad as Bourbon Street!\u201d she told her companions.</p><p>It did smell, David thought. He paused for a moment. It wasn\u2019t bad booze, it wasn\u2019t vomit. There was something dead somewhere. The Keys weren\u2019t immune to rats, and Lord knew, there were roosters everywhere. He couldn\u2019t pinpoint the odor; there was too much perfume in the air, too much smoke from the fellows hanging outside with cigars, and too much alcohol. Someone had just broken a bottle of bourbon somewhere nearby.</p><p>He kept walking. He was outside O\u2019Hara\u2019s when he suddenly heard shouting. Frowning, even though he knew Katie wasn\u2019t working, he felt his heart pound. He rushed in. Clarinda was there; she had just jumped back from a table because the two men who had been seated at it were now standing.</p><p>\u201cFellows, you\u2019re going to have to sit, calm down or take it outside or I will call the police!\u201d Clarinda said.</p><p>They didn\u2019t hear her.</p> <p>One of the men was Mike Sanderson.</p><p>The other was Sam Barnard.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d David said with deep authority.</p><p>The busboys were backing up. Jon Merrillo was coming around the bar nervously.</p><p>\u201cHey, you heard Clarinda,\u201d David said.</p><p>Sam looked at him, and shook his head sadly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but screw this!\u201d he said. And he turned on Mike Sanderson with a wicked right hook.</p><p>David dove in, shouting for Clarinda to call the police. He tackled Sam Barnard down while Mike Sanderson made it back to his feet. Sanderson then tried to punch Barnard, but all he managed to do was fall on the man\u2019s abdomen.</p><p>They were both drunk as skunks.</p><p>David dragged Sam from beneath Mike, and by then, uniformed cops were spilling in. They dragged up both men, and assured them both they could discuss it all at the station. Clarinda turned to David, thanking him.</p><p>\u201cThat might have gotten really ugly,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jon had joined her by then. \u201cOh, man, they\u2019re both huge. They could have really torn this place to pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so-they\u2019re drunk. They\u2019d have passed out before they\u2019d gotten too many hits in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks. Can I get you anything on the house?\u201d Jon asked him.</p><p>\u201cSure. Actually, doesn\u2019t need to be on the house. What didn\u2019t we eat last night? I\u2019ll take three of anything different to go,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Jon told him.</p><p>Jon headed to the kitchen. He helped Clarinda right the chairs that had fallen. The other customers seemed disappointed that the show was over. They had turned back to their own conversations.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s good in a way,\u201d Clarinda said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat those two got into a fight. That means that they\u2019ll be locked up for the night, and no one will have to be afraid of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid-of Mike Sanderson or Sam Barnard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s face it, Mike Sanderson seems a little whacko. He\u2019s spent years-with no one knowing it-dressing up like Robert the Doll. And Barnard...well, he was Tanya\u2019s brother. He might be out for some kind of revenge, or God knows, he\u2019s here, and there\u2019s another murder...who knows? Maybe he secretly hated his sister. Maybe he strangled her in a rage. Stranger, more bizarre things have happened in Key West.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to work. Thank you, David.\u201d</p><p>Then she made a face. \u201cFantasy Fest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it can be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say-that\u2019s because guys love to see women with nothing but paint on their breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cOkay, so women see male chests all the time. Sadly, that means the thrill is gone.\u201d</p><p>Clarinda laughed. \u201cI repeat-\u201d She made a face. \u201cFantasy Fest!\u201d</p><p>He went to the bar to pay for the food, but Jon wouldn\u2019t let him. He thanked him, took his to-go bags and headed back out.</p><p>He paused. So many sounds and scents in the air.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>Underlying it all...</p><p>There was the scent of death.</p><p>The knock on the door startled Katie.</p><p>She had left the kitchen to curl up on the sofa, the Beckett family book in her hands. Bartholomew was seated on the curve at her back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Beckett,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to get up to answer the door; Sean got it.</p><p>\u201cCool. Dinner. I was thinking I\u2019d have to start cooking, since Katie has had her nose in that book all day.\u201d</p><p>Katie rose slowly, stretching. She saw David and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s shepherd\u2019s pie from O\u2019Hara\u2019s, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood nose,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Katie has amazing senses,\u201d Sean said dryly. \u201cSet her all down in the dining room. I\u2019ll get plates and utensils.\u201d</p><p>Sean did so. Katie met David in the hallway. He reached for her, pulling her close, and kissed her lightly on the lips.</p><p>Sean made a point of clearing his throat. \u201cIf you two don\u2019t mind? I\u2019m not quite accustomed to this yet, if you could show a little restraint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, I hardly attacked the man,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Sean ignored her, as David opened the bags on the table.</p><p>\u201cAnything at the station?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cI told Liam that Katie thinks Danny is dead. He agrees. But Pete is on a tangent, looking for him, convinced that he\u2019s going to find him, and that he either killed the women, or had something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>They sat and passed around the tossed salad and entr\u00e9es that David had brought. Sean went to the kitchen for beer, while Katie opted for a bottle of wine.</p><p>David wound up with a beer and a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up here?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cI slept most of the day. I\u2019m figuring that by tomorrow, I\u2019ll be functioning again,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAnd, naturally, tomorrow night, I\u2019ll be hanging out at the old family bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read that book all day. David, your family was fascinating. You know, your aunts have kept records in it since the nineteen forties. They were children here during the Elena de Hoyos death and reburial. They remember the Otto family-they\u2019re really fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read the book all day?\u201d David asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that... Oh, I don\u2019t even know why. But museums preserve the past. That\u2019s why a murderer might leave a body in a museum, right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sean stared at her. \u201cThey have to find the guy this time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey will,\u201d David said. \u201cSomeone will. So what else was in the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot was written by Craig Beckett, sea captain, a fellow who arrived in the area along with the first American settlers,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cYour family showed up around the same time, right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes, so we\u2019ve always heard. But we don\u2019t have anything like that great book your aunts have preserved so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018The truth is out there,\u2019\u201d Sean quoted wearily.</p><p>\u201cSo what is going on tomorrow, do you know?\u201d David asked Katie.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, for us, it\u2019s business as usual, with three extra servers. The first of the big pirate parties is happening tomorrow, and one of the bars is also throwing something it\u2019s calling the Vampire Bite. I know that Mallory Square is supposed to be crazy, and that a lot of acts from elsewhere have already been out staking their ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be a long day,\u201d David said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>When they finished, Sean yawned. Katie told him to go back to bed. He gave her a kiss, bid David good-night and went up the stairs.</p><p>Katie was going to pick up, but David stopped her. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. You were yawning, too, and you have a really long day tomorrow. Go on up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had left the book on the sofa in the parlor. She went back in to make sure that she had closed it, so that the delicate pages wouldn\u2019t be damaged. She thought that Bartholomew might have kept reading it, but he was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>She sat, reading the page that had been left open.</p><p>It was about the legal execution of Eli Smith, brought about by Craig Beckett, and the witnesses he had dragged into court.</p> <p>As she was looking at the page, David came behind her. He moved aside her hair with a gentle brush and kissed the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow will be a long day for you. You need your sleep.\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms. \u201cAre you really thinking about sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. Eventually. I mean, if we get started early enough...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe it\u2019s early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>She went up the stairs quickly, letting him follow her. That night, she closed her door carefully, and had to turn on the lights to keep from tripping when they went in. With the lights still on, she saw him lying like a lion awaiting his due on the bed, and she started to laugh, and jumped down on him.</p><p>And once again, it was the most natural thing in the world to become naked and intimate. They made love with laughter, and then with passion, and then with tenderness.</p><p>It was late when she rose at last to turn out the lights, and they finally fell asleep.</p><p>The city was like something that breathed, as real and vital as any man or woman who had ever lived. It was the tempest of the past, the craziness of the present, the promise of the future.</p><p>It was his city.</p> <p>He loved it as a parent loved a child.</p><p>And his people had borne the injustice of others, when they should have had free run. What was fair, and what was not? Beckett had fired many a cannon, he had set many a ship afire, he had killed time and time again...</p><p>And yet he had been so self-righteous!</p><p>Ah, well...</p><p>The bitterness assailed him as he watched the house, and yet he continued to do so, despite the torture it brought him. His muscles were clamped tight, his jawline hurt, his teeth hurt, he was grating on them so hard. And still he stood, covered by the shadow of the trees, and he watched.</p><p>He saw her silhouette.</p><p>Saw as she disrobed.</p><p>The drapes were drawn, but she was there, curved and lean and glorious.</p> <p>And he saw Beckett. Saw him rise to take the naked woman into his arms.</p><p>Saw them fall down together.</p><p>Saw them rise...</p><p>In his blood, he could feel them writhing, feel the thunder of their hearts.</p><p>Hatred burned through him.</p><p>It was his city.</p><p>It had been his city throughout time. Some fools didn\u2019t see it; they didn\u2019t realize that things never really changed, nor did people. Beckett had been self-righteous and superior years ago, and he was the same now. But time came round and round, and the evils done in the past could and would be rectified now.</p><p>Beckett had brought death and destruction to his people. But he knew that it was all one. He knew that it was his duty to bring real justice to his city.</p><p>And the time was coming.</p><p>He was suddenly filled with pride; subterfuge was a game he played perfectly. There was simply not the least suggestion that he was anything but completely mentally fit; his calm, cool action and meticulous machinations proved that. That he could wait, that he could play the game of life so easily, and others never saw...</p><p>He nearly laughed aloud. There were those who might think him insane, when, in truth, he was simply a genius-a man with an agenda as deep and important as the spirit and the universe itself, and the brilliance to move about as if he were invisible. He knew more about life and death and time and pride than anyone, and he was so damned good that it was almost-criminal.</p><p>Katie O\u2019Hara was so beautiful.</p><p>She rose, and he could see the perfection of her silhouette on the drapes, the curve of her breasts, the lean length of her torso, the exquisite stretch of her legs...</p><p>He imagined her, as she would be.</p><p>And his fingers itched to touch her.</p><p>Her death would be spectacular. She deserved the true immortality.</p><p>The light went off at last, and he turned away.</p><p>14</p><p>They\u2019d barely woken up before the phone rang.</p><p>In fact, it was quite a jolt. Katie\u2019s eyes had just opened, and David\u2019s had just opened, and she was thinking that it could be a lovely morning.</p><p>Then the startling sound of her phone, and when she saw the caller ID, she answered.</p><p>For a moment, Katie had a strange sensation of, \u201cHail, hail, the gang\u2019s all here!\u201d</p><p>Her uncle Jamie was back in town, just in time for the festivities.</p><p>\u201cPirates!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPirates. Here, there, everywhere. Oh, and with a vampire or two thrown in. Katie, my girl, bless you, wonderful! I need you-desperately! I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t get you. Ah, and I heard that your brother is here in town, too, eh?\u201d Jamie said. \u201cTell him to get his rich, famous, sorry ass down here with you. Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I thought we\u2019d have a small breakfast crowd and the good Lord help me, I told Merrillo to open her up, and it\u2019s a deluge! A deluge of pirates. And, oh, Lord have mercy. You should see the hottie who just walked by with a wench\u2019s costume painted on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie, if she\u2019s twenty, behave yourself.\u201d</p><p>He chucked. \u201cI need you, my girl.\u201d</p><p>Katie covered her phone and looked at David.</p><p>\u201cI need to go into O\u2019Hara\u2019s,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d he asked, his hand on her midriff as he pulled her closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in just a bit, Uncle Jamie. And I\u2019ll get my brother\u2019s sorry ass out of bed, too.\u201d</p><p>She hung up. It was good hearing from Jamie. Business as usual.</p><p>No worry about corpses taking the places of mannequins.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She started to get out of bed, but the hand on her midriff didn\u2019t let go. David\u2019s eyes were alight and a subtle smile was curved into his features.</p><p>He rolled over, pinning her. \u201cNow?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She laughed. Something seemed beautifully normal about the day. She ran her fingers through the thick richness of his hair. \u201cWell, now, yes...\u201d</p><p>She felt his fingers stroke down the length of her body.</p><p>\u201cWell, almost now,\u201d she amended. \u201cI mean, really, almost now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime schedule, yes,\u201d he said, and they locked in one another\u2019s arms.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, breathless and laughing, she leapt out of bed while he rolled over and groaned. She flew into the shower, raced out in a towel and banged on her brother\u2019s door while David took his turn in her shower.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a message for you to get your sorry ass up!\u201d she called to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m still supposed to be filming in the China Sea!\u201d he called back.</p><p>\u201cYou were seen. Get your-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry ass up, yeah, yeah, all right. What the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie is back and we\u2019re being deluged by pirates,\u201d she called. \u201cTen minutes, downstairs!\u201d</p><p>Jamie hadn\u2019t lied. Pirates were once again walking the streets of Key West. The street was already packed with people, but it helped everyone, and everyone knew-this was one of the big chances to make money. Shopkeepers and bars weren\u2019t stingy; they didn\u2019t try to grab customers and hang on to them all night. They depended on one another. O\u2019Hara\u2019s was filled with flyers for another Irish bar, just as they advertised O\u2019Hara\u2019s bands and Katie-oke nights.</p><p>Katie parked in back. Sean and David were with her.</p><p>\u201cSee, here\u2019s the point,\u201d Sean pointed out. \u201cYou go off, and the world respects you as a filmmaker. You come back, and you\u2019re a busboy,\u201d Sean said, shaking his head sadly.</p><p>\u201cHey, big shots,\u201d Katie said, \u201cyou have both forgotten what\u2019s in your own backyards. You should get together and do a documentary right here. I know where you can find cheap divers. Then again, what would make a better film than Fantasy Fest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusboy by day, the Spielberg of documentaries by night! Like it-has a ring,\u201d Sean said. \u201cLet\u2019s get in, and dig into the mayhem, huh? David, you\u2019re not obliged in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help out for a while,\u201d David assured them.</p><p>He did. They walked into pure insanity. There was a mile-long line for the advertised breakfast.</p><p>Fantasy Fest Special! O\u2019Hara\u2019s opens for ye olde Irish breakfast.</p><p>Clarinda was working the floor, and she\u2019d gotten Jonas to come in. One bartender held down the liquor angle, even though it was ridiculously early. \u201cHair O the Dog that Bit ye!\u201d was a Bloody Mary, while \u201cSunrise Screamer\u201d was an O\u2019Hara\u2019s concoction of rum and various juices.</p><p>Her uncle was a good-looking man, the family baby, sixteen years younger than her father and only nine years older than Sean. He was definitely harried when they walked in. He didn\u2019t seem disturbed in any way to see David Beckett arrive with his niece and nephew. He studied David and grinned. \u201cHeard you came in last night and saved the place, Beckett. Thanks. I owe you.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked at Jamie and then at David, but they were still studying one another. \u201cWhat went on?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>Clarinda came hurrying by with a tray carrying four of the house specialty-bangers and grits. She\u2019d heard the question. \u201cIt was almost a heavyweight bout,\u201d she said. \u201cSanderson and Barnard-Mike versus Sam. But David set them straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou beat them up?\u201d Katie demanded.</p><p>\u201cThey beat themselves up. They were about to break into a mammoth fight, after, it appeared, drinking together in commiseration,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cAnd then-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey went to lockup for the night to sober up,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, times a-wasting!\u201d Jamie said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get onto all this later. Katie, you, in the kitchen. You still know the menu, eh? Gloria is still back there. She\u2019ll call the shots.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, aye, captain!\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cDavid, the bar, if you will. Sean-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. Bus tables,\u201d Sean said, rolling his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat damned Danny Zigler comes in, wanting work, and where is he now?\u201d Jamie said, shaking his head with disgust.</p><p>Dead, Katie wanted to say, but she didn\u2019t. She hurried back to the kitchen.</p><p>The breakfast rush lasted into lunch, but by then, Jamie had managed to gather all his part-time employees and the operation was running smoothly again. At two o\u2019clock, the regular employees had the dining stragglers under control. Katie, emerging from the kitchen, saw that her uncle, her brother and David were seated at one of the tables near the bar and the band stage where her karaoke equipment was set up. They seemed to be eased back, and talking.</p><p>Like old friends who hadn\u2019t seen each other in a very long time.</p><p>She saw that Clarinda had stepped outside and went to join her on the sidewalk. \u201cThe air! Ah, the air, the air!\u201d Clarinda said.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what was going on with Mike Sanderson and Sam Barnard last night?\u201d Katie asked. \u201cDid they come in together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sam came in-he\u2019s been coming in here pretty regularly since he got into town. Strange, huh? He\u2019s been living up in Key Largo all this time, never came here, as far as I know, and now, this week, here he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, wow, really go figure! Mike Sanderson, dressing up like Robert the Doll,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Clarinda shuddered and grimaced. \u201cNow, that is frigging creepy- Oh, look!\u201d</p><p>Katie looked down the street. She didn\u2019t see anything unusual-not for Key West in the midst of Fantasy Fest. A pirate with a peg leg was escorting a vampire down Duval. The pirate was fairly customary-and good. He had an eye patch, a real peg leg and looked as if he might have stepped off the pages of Treasure Island.</p><p>The vampire wore a sweeping black skirt with stripes of blood that continued from the bodice of the gown, a tight-fitting corset. She was wearing the typical long black wig and white makeup, along with ruby-red lips.</p> <p>\u201cCool costume-she looks good,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cLook harder!\u201d Clarinda said, laughing.</p><p>Katie did. She gasped. \u201cThat corset is body paint! Oh, my God, that is amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is!\u201d Sean announced, stepping up behind them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lech!\u201d Clarinda accused.</p><p>\u201cI am not. I\u2019m commenting on a great paint job,\u201d Sean assured her. He yawned. \u201cLadies, it\u2019s been a thrill. Such a thrill. I\u2019m going home and back to bed. Katie, be good, be careful. I\u2019ll be at the house if you need me. All right, well, I\u2019ll be at the house whether you need me or not, but I\u2019ll have my cell. And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be here for the Katie-oke, even if Jamie guilts me into busing tables again.\u201d</p><p>He gave her and Clarinda a kiss on the cheek and started walking.</p><p>\u201cHey, the car\u2019s in back!\u201d Katie called.</p> <p>\u201cLeave it there-by the time tonight is over, we may be too tired to walk!\u201d</p><p>Sean left, and David replaced him. \u201cHey, are you going to hang around here for a while?\u201d he asked Katie.</p><p>\u201cMaybe an hour,\u201d Katie said. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay long enough to see that Jamie really has things under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back then.\u201d</p><p>He gave both girls a kiss on the cheek, and was gone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Clarinda said. \u201cThink about it-all our lives! Except for college, of course. All of our lives, and this place is still just crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s why I love it,\u201d Katie said. \u201cBlack, white, gay, straight, Hispanic, Russian, Israeli, you name it. Somewhere along the line, someone made a rule that we\u2019d all accept one another, and it seems to have stuck. I do. I love it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve never even seen you in body paint!\u201d Clarinda teased. \u201cHey-Jamie was just saying he wanted us in the pirate costumes tonight. Want to walk down to Front Street and the pirate-costume-slash-sex shop with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Let me tell Jamie what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need one, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, he wants to help celebrate the Fantasy Fest pirate party,\u201d Clarinda said. \u201cHe\u2019s open to vampires, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Katie said. She hurried back in to tell Jamie what she was doing, then joined Clarinda on the street.</p><p>\u201cThat thing is just creepy,\u201d Clarinda commented as they passed by giant Robert the Doll.</p><p>\u201cAnd it stinks around here,\u201d Katie commented.</p><p>Clarinda frowned. \u201cOld booze. Sweat. Maybe someone was sick.\u201d</p><p>They walked down to Front Street, turned right and went the few blocks to the store. It was one of Katie\u2019s favorite places. Half of the store sold sexy lingerie, sex toys and naughty Halloween costumes. The other half carried an amazing array for the pirates of Key West. Vests, period coats, shirts, skirts and more. It was possible to be a wench, an aristocrat, an elegant buccaneer or a scurvy mate. The morning had been so busy, she\u2019d been able to set aside everything that had been happening.</p><p>Certainly, the city did not seem to be mourning the passing of one of its strippers.</p><p>Clarinda tried on a variety of costumes, and decided on a wench. Katie was musing between a corset, blouse and skirt, and a recreation of an Elizabeth Swann costume when Bartholomew appeared at her elbow. \u201cThe corset,\u201d he said. \u201cVery real. Miss Swann wasn\u2019t a true pirate wench in any way-she was forced aboard, a kidnap victim. I did love that movie,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been this time?\u201d Katie asked him.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d he said. She arched a brow, but the ghost had claimed her house as his own, and didn\u2019t appear to notice the way she looked at him. Bartholomew was deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, Katie,\u201d Clarinda said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go with the shirt, corset thing and skirt,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cCan you sing in that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ties are fake-there\u2019s a zipper in back and it\u2019s stretchy. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reading the book,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cNice piece of nostalgia for me. Beckett was a damned decent man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Clarinda said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be able to hear me fine,\u201d Katie said. She glared tight-lipped at Bartholomew, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI know that the key to all this is in the past. Did you see the part where Beckett mentions that Smith cursed him from the noose?\u201d</p><p>Katie lowered her head. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you now, Bartholomew,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d Clarinda said.</p><p>\u201cSorry, arguing with myself,\u201d Katie said. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s pay for this stuff.\u201d</p><p>At the counter, she produced her credit card, assuring Clarinda that they were giving the bill to Jamie. As she waited to sign the slip, Katie gazed out the window.</p><p>The sun was filtering in. For a moment, it seemed to blind her.</p><p>Then, she saw that Tanya was standing there. Standing there, beautiful and sad in white, as if waiting for her company.</p><p>\u201cSign that for me, will you?\u201d Katie said to Clarinda. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going? Katie, are you all right? Hey, wait!\u201d Clarinda said.</p><p>But Katie was already on her way out.</p><p>Tanya waited, caught in that glimmer of sunlight, until Katie was nearly upon her. Then she started to walk.</p><p>Katie made her way through buxom lasses and strapping pirates, and a U.S. Navy sea captain here and there. Vampires and zombies were crowding the streets, as well. The season was changing-it was just hot instead of dead hot-but all manner of costumes were being worn-naked and in paint, almost naked, to period frock coats and heavy fabric skirts.</p><p>Music was emitting from restaurants and bars already; a fire-eater was working a corner of Front Street.</p><p>Tanya managed to stay just ahead of Katie.</p><p>Bartholomew was following close behind her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s headed for the hanging tree,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Katie murmured.</p><p>Bartholomew said, \u201cI keep telling you, it has to have something to do with the past. It has something to do with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She turned to stare at him, crashed into a wolfman, righted herself, apologized and hurried on. \u201cWolfman-the guy is crazy! He\u2019ll be sweating to death before tonight,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>They reached the saloon. It was busy. Katie saw Tanya slip in and she followed. There were no tables. There was one seat at the bar and she grabbed it, ordered a drink from a harried bartender and looked around.</p><p>\u201cImagine back,\u201d Bartholomew said, standing right behind her and whispering in her ear. \u201cWhen I died, the building wasn\u2019t here. The area where you\u2019re sitting was built in eighteen fifty-one. Morgue. Quite convenient. After one of the hurricanes, folks came back and found that the bodies weren\u2019t in great shape. They ripped up the floorboards and buried them right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. There\u2019s still a tombstone here,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd bones in the ground,\u201d Bartholomew said sadly.</p><p>\u201cAnd the woman who haunts the bathroom,\u201d Katie said. \u201cBut, Bartholomew-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to go back before that. Military law-and no law. Evidence? What was evidence in a buccaneer town like Key West?\u201d he asked bitterly.</p><p>\u201cDid you see Smith hang?\u201d Katie asked him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI had friends. I was buried on the beach. After the same hurricane, they dug me up with the others-and what pieces they discovered were transferred to the new cemetery-the Key West cemetery.\u201d</p><p>She actually felt his hands on her shoulders. \u201cKatie, it\u2019s all attached, I just know it, somehow. You have to go through that book again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny Zigler had checked out several books. They\u2019re at David\u2019s house. We\u2019ll get them first thing in the morning, how\u2019s that? Or, I\u2019ll call David. I\u2019ll ask him to get them before tonight, and then I\u2019ll have them to read.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d the bartender asked Katie, concerned despite the insanity of the bar. She had large brown eyes and a Romanian accent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, muttering to myself, practicing for tonight,\u201d Katie told her.</p><p>Her cell phone was ringing. She saw that it was Clarinda. She answered quickly. \u201cSorry, I saw an old friend-from school,\u201d she said quickly.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone I know?\u201d Clarinda asked.</p><p>\u201cCollege,\u201d Katie lied, and winced. \u201cMeet me on Duval and Front, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there, looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there!\u201d Katie promised.</p><p>Katie offered the bartender a bill and slipped off the bar stool.</p> <p>She turned, and Tanya was there, staring straight at her. Her lips were moving. Katie froze, staring, and then inhaled, watching Tanya\u2019s lips.</p><p>Then she could hear. Barely.</p><p>\u201cRevenge. He whispered the word when he was behind me. Revenge.\u201d</p><p>Tanya then stared at Bartholomew; her lips moved again, and she seemed distressed.</p><p>She faded, and was gone.</p><p>\u201cSee, she wants you to listen to me,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cThat\u2019s why she brought you here. Revenge! And she must somehow know or sense that it has to do with the past.\u201d</p> <p>Katie nodded. \u201cRight. She\u2019s gaining strength as a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she just used it all, bringing you here, whispering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it, I got it!\u201d Katie assured him.</p><p>Her cell started ringing again. Clarinda!</p><p>She waved a thanks to the bartender and hurried out. It was all crazy. Two women were dead, dressed up and laid out like a twentieth-century corpse. And yet Tanya had come here, and Bartholomew insisted that it all went back to something that had occurred before the buildings here even existed.</p><p>She saw Clarinda on the street, waved and blocked her mouth with her hand as she told Bartholomew, \u201cPlease, please, please! Don\u2019t make me keep talking, okay?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. He was silent as they met Clarinda.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head back to O\u2019Hara\u2019s, and I\u2019ll get the car and we\u2019ll bring it back later. We\u2019ve only got an hour or so, but I\u2019d like to take a shower before tonight. I feel like I\u2019m covered in bangers and grits,\u201d Katie said.</p> <p>\u201cAh, and I have a fine sheen of maple syrup,\u201d Clarinda said. \u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d</p><p>As they walked along, Katie thought that she might tease and mock, but she loved Fantasy Fest. So many of the costumes were amazing. They passed by a fellow dressed up as a parrot; he had magnificent feathers, body paint-and the subtle decency to wear a brilliantly fashioned loincloth. It was a beautiful costume-fitting right in with the fellow\u2019s Mohawk-and both Katie and Clarinda gave him quick compliments as they passed.</p><p>As they neared O\u2019Hara\u2019s, Katie wrinkled her nose.</p><p>\u201cSomeone from the city has to get out here and find out what that smell is!\u201d Clarinda said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have Jamie call it in,\u201d Katie agreed.</p><p>They reached O\u2019Hara\u2019s. As they started in, Katie felt the brush of Bartholomew\u2019s fingers on her shoulder.</p><p>She spun around.</p><p>And there was Danny Zigler. He was in the middle of the street, oblivious as cars and scooters and pedestrians passed him by, or walked right through him.</p><p>He lifted a beseeching hand to her.</p><p>Then faded into the crowd.</p><p>At the station, Liam told David that Mike Sanderson and Sam Barnard were being held at the detention center up in Stock Island.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be let out soon. They were just being held for drunk and disorderly, and, well, the place\u2019ll be filling up with pirates and vampires now,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cCan you find out if they\u2019ve already been released?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Liam put through a call. The two would be released within the hour.</p><p>\u201cI hope I can make it in time,\u201d David muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d Liam stood. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a patrol car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were holding down the fort, with Dryer prowling the streets,\u201d David said.</p><p>Liam shrugged. \u201cWe have more units. The lieutenant is good, but no one is on duty all the time. I\u2019ll just tell the chief that I\u2019m leaving, working the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get in trouble here-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chief is a cool guy. He put in his hours-bike patrol, night shift, day shift. And we\u2019re speaking with persons of interest in two murder cases, even if we haven\u2019t a shred of evidence.\u201d</p><p>Liam was gone less than a few minutes; a detective sergeant took over his place at the desk, which had apparently become the hot spot for the Stella Martin investigation.</p><p>The drive to Stock Island in the patrol car, even with mad traffic streaming into the city, took less than twenty minutes.</p><p>When they arrived, Sanderson and Barnard were already being released.</p><p>David and Liam stood at the exit, watching as the men procured their belongings and signed out. Sam saw them first, and stood still. Mike halted behind Sam.</p><p>\u201cYou came to pick us up?\u201d Mike asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a car just outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, it was a drunken bar brawl,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver what?\u201d David asked.</p><p>The two looked at one another sheepishly. \u201cMy sister,\u201d Sam said at last.</p><p>Mike looked at David remorsefully. \u201cI called her-a not nice name. I told him that if Tanya had ever been able to really make up her mind, she might still be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take it outside,\u201d David suggested.</p><p>The two followed David and Liam to the patrol car. They looked suspiciously at Liam. \u201cYou\u2019re not under arrest-it\u2019s a ride,\u201d he said.</p><p>They crawled in. Liam took the wheel and David sat in the front passenger\u2019s side. \u201cWhat were you two doing together to begin with?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, first it was friendly,\u201d Mike said. \u201cWe started talking about Stella Martin-who was a whore, I mean, no doubt about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanya wasn\u2019t a whore,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cGod, no,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThat was never what I meant. I was hung up on her, totally smitten. She was beautiful, man. So much spirit in her!\u201d</p><p>David glanced over at Liam. The two had to be sober now, but it almost looked as if they were going to fall into a hug and sob together.</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s work the whole thing out,\u201d David said.</p><p>Liam pulled the car over into the lot of a fishing-and-tackle store that had closed its doors for the weekend.</p><p>Mike and Sam looked at one another again.</p><p>\u201cMike, you were a liar. You told the cops you were up north the night that Tanya was murdered. You weren\u2019t up north,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Mike looked out the window. \u201cI was in Miami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you prove it? We\u2019ve managed to dredge up the information that you were in St. Augustine twenty-four hours after she was killed, but the night of the murder...\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cLord, do you know how long ago that was?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cBut I can tell you where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what he was doing,\u201d Sam said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d Liam asked sharply.</p><p>Mike let out a sigh. \u201cI was with a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA decade ago-that is going to be hard to prove,\u201d Liam noted.</p><p>\u201cYou know her name?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah-Tiffany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a last name for her?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cTiffany-Number One?\u201d Mike suggested. \u201cHell, that year, half the working girls in the country were named Tiffany.\u201d He stiffened suddenly. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not the asshole I sound like, really. I told you, I didn\u2019t believe that Tanya was going to come with me. She\u2019d seen you again, David. I wasn\u2019t old, I wasn\u2019t mature-and I was lonely and hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cheated on her-with a whore,\u201d Sam said morosely.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cheat. She was leaving me, and I knew it,\u201d Mike said. He straightened suddenly. \u201cHey, maybe I can prove it! She was working for something called Elegant Escorts, and soon after, there was some kind of a sting operation on them. I did pay with a credit card.\u201d He looked out the window again, embarrassed. \u201cI didn\u2019t help with the prosecution. I told them that I had just signed on for a massage and that nothing else happened. I was a kid. I lived at home. My mother would have killed me.\u201d</p><p>David looked at Liam. Liam shrugged. \u201cWe can track it,\u201d he said.</p><p>David stared at Mike.</p><p>Mike glared back at him. \u201cHey, you know what-you were the one in the hot seat, not me. I talked to her earlier. We know she was at O\u2019Hara\u2019s. I was home all night after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you can\u2019t prove,\u201d David pointed out. \u201cWhere were you that night, Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was my sister,\u201d Sam said angrily. \u201cAnd, hey, I\u2019m sorry, the people who could vouch for me-like the people who could vouch for you-are dead. You are a prick, Beckett. She was my sister. And no one ever looked at me with accusation before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another dead woman,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were suddenly back here, just like the two of us,\u201d Sam pointed out.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve been back frequently,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cRight. Dressing up as Robert the Doll and lying to your wife,\u201d David pointed out.</p><p>\u201cPoint is, I\u2019ve been here before-and you and Sam have been gone forever,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cI live in Key Largo. Two-hour drive. If I\u2019d wanted to kill someone again and set them up in a Key West exhibit, I could have done it at any time,\u201d Sam pointed out.</p><p>Liam started the car up again. \u201cI\u2019ll be checking on your whereabouts the night Tanya was murdered, Mike. Procedure, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we believe one another,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou bastards need to find out who did kill my sister.\u201d</p><p>Liam drove straight down Roosevelt to the police station. It was a long walk back to Old Town, but he made it evident that he was parking and going back into his office, and that was that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mike and Sam sat in the car for a minute, and then got out. \u201cYou heading back, Beckett?\u201d Mike asked David.</p><p>\u201cIn a while.\u201d</p><p>The two walked off, muttering to one another.</p> <p>\u201cThat Beckett isn\u2019t a cop-he\u2019s a filmmaker or a cat photographer or whatever. And suspicious as hell, if anyone asks,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but, hey, he\u2019s a Beckett. Damned Becketts still think they own the island,\u201d Sam complained.</p><p>Liam, watching them, grinned. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s see if we can check out Mike\u2019s alibi. Then I\u2019ll head on back in. I want to hang around O\u2019Hara\u2019s tonight. I figure things will start getting wild.\u201d</p><p>David waited, mulling over the past, and the present, while Liam went through various conversations with Miami and Miami-Dade County law-enforcement groups.</p> <p>Why did Danny have the Key West history books, and why had ten thousand dollars been slipped into one book?</p><p>Liam set his phone down, drawing David\u2019s attention. \u201cMike Sanderson was telling the truth. A vice guy in Miami remembers the sting. There was a Tiffany, and when it all went to court, she vouched for Mike Sanderson\u2019s statement-she had just given him a massage.\u201d</p><p>Scratch another one off the list.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Liam,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a walk-you want a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch a cab,\u201d David told him.</p> <p>He called Katie on his way back and found out that she was at the house. He had himself dropped off at her address, and when he knocked, Sean let him in. \u201cGood timing. We\u2019re about to head out again. Katie is in the parlor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d David said. He looked at Sean, who was wearing a pirate\u2019s bandana, a tricorn hat, striped pants and a black poet\u2019s shirt.</p><p>Sean grimaced. \u201cUncle Jamie wants to support the pirates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>He went into the parlor. Katie was perched on the love seat, his family ledger book in her hands. She didn\u2019t even notice him as he entered.</p><p>He noticed her.</p><p>She wore pirate attire extremely well. It was definitely a look, and though she was completely covered, he thought that she\u2019d rival any woman who was stark naked. Just the line of her throat and collarbone was visible, and the beautiful rise of rounded breasts. Her waist seemed minuscule, and her pirate boots added a touch of the wicked woman to her apparel.</p><p>He whistled.</p> <p>She looked up, startled, nearly dropping the book.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said. She looked at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cI visited the jailbirds. Mike Sanderson has an absolute alibi for the night Tanya was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was with an escort,\u201d David said.</p><p>She was startled. \u201cBut, I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says that he was certain that he\u2019d already been ditched-for me,\u201d David told her.</p><p>She looked at him sympathetically, then rose, carefully putting the book down. \u201cI need you to bring those books over tomorrow. It\u2019s important, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not arguing the point, but why are you so convinced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it to you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThe little ghost of an idea keeps coming to me. It keeps leading me back to the hanging tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hanging tree?\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYour ancestor avenged a pirate, did you know that?\u201d Katie asked. She jerked forward suddenly, just as if she had been pushed. \u201cPrivateer!\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>Frowning, he said, \u201cI know the story, of course. Some wretch named Smith managed to shift the blame for his own deed to another man. That man was hanged by a lynch mob. Later, the first Craig Beckett saw to it that Smith was hanged, as well. Katie, it was close to two hundred years ago. That\u2019s one hell of a long time to bear a grudge.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that Smith\u2019s ghost is rising up to kill women and try to frame the Becketts, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts don\u2019t really have that kind of strength,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Katie, these murders are being committed by someone who is flesh and blood, whatever may have gone on in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do think that the key lies in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019ll get the books tomorrow-we\u2019ll spend all the time before you have to go to work reading through them.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and nodded, and then her smile faded. \u201cAny word on Danny Zigler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that you believed that he was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that he\u2019s dead. I was wondering if they had found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know for certain?\u201d David asked her.</p><p>Sean came to the doorway. \u201cShe saw it in a dream. Come on, Katie, you don\u2019t want to get started late tonight. The flaming temper of the Irish-American Jamie O\u2019Hara is a terrible thing to behold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, let\u2019s go,\u201d Katie agreed, anxious to be out.</p><p>When they walked in, David found himself instantly welcomed by Jamie O\u2019Hara-who had shirt and frock coat waiting for him. \u201cArrrrr!\u201d Jamie said. \u201cPirate night! They\u2019re closing the street off-there\u2019s going to be a parade happening in a few minutes. Katie, the place is hopping. Start them off with something pirate-y, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure-can I boot up the computer and set the microphones and the amps?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cArrrr!\u201d Jamie said in good humor.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sean nudged David. \u201cHead on back and change into that pirate garb, my good fellow.\u201d</p><p>David was about to protest; he didn\u2019t. Why not? He wanted to blend into the crowd. He wanted to watch. Years had gone by now, and he had no intention of leaving until the whole thing was solved. He couldn\u2019t explain it but he felt as if some pieces of the puzzle were coming together. He\u2019d watch until, eventually, the killer made a mistake.</p><p>He headed back to the men\u2019s restroom to change. The acoustics and sound system in the place were good. He could hear Katie, welcoming everyone to Key West, Fantasy Fest and O\u2019Hara\u2019s Pub. She pointed out her request slips and her songbooks, and said that anyone was welcome to ask her about a song not in the books, as well-some could be found on the computer. She opened the evening with a charming rendition of a Disney pirate song-one that every pirate in the place sang along with her.</p><p>He headed out, appropriately attired then in his huge blousy shirt, frock coat, swashbuckling hat-and Levi\u2019s jeans and Nike sneakers. As he headed around the bar to the stage area, he saw that Katie had stopped singing.</p><p>The pirates in the place assumed it was their job to keep going, and they were all certainly rowdy enough-and drunk enough-to do so.</p><p>Katie set down her microphone-and headed out the door.</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d He shouted her name and went running after her.</p><p>She was out in the middle of the street. The parade had begun, and chanting pirates, wenches, fire-eaters, flag wavers, small floats-even costumed dogs-were marching along, and sidestepping Katie. There was a figure running north down Duval.</p><p>Someone dressed as Robert the Doll!</p><p>Katie was chasing him.</p><p>David chased Katie.</p><p>Suddenly she stopped, and stared across the street at oversize Robert the Doll. Held in spot by a weight at the bottom by the feet, the figure seemed to move back and forth.</p><p>The huge effigy remained. The costumed Robert the Doll had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d David cried.</p><p>She seemed completely oblivious to him.</p><p>He rushed after her, but he was captured by a pirate wench, and spun around the street.</p><p>As politely and firmly as he could, he extricated himself.</p><p>He turned around, seeking Katie. She was across the street, wrenching at the effigy.</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he knew.</p><p>He knew the smell in the street.</p><p>And he knew what was going to happen.</p><p>Katie was tugging with a vengeance at the straw arms of the effigy. He reached her just in time to wrest her away as one of the arms came free.</p><p>As straw spilled out onto the street...</p><p>The thing crumbled, falling apart around the bottom weight.</p><p>Exposing the decomposing corpse of Danny Zigler.</p><p>15</p><p>It took forever for the sounds of sirens to cut through the revelry of the crowd, or so it seemed. It seemed forever that Katie stood there, staring at Danny.</p><p>The stench that rose from him was horrible. Even when the dead heat of summer ebbed and fall began to arrive in South Florida, the sun was viciously hot. Encased in the effigy, Danny had been held in something like an oven.</p><p>When she had ripped up the effigy and he was exposed, the odor had risen like a miasma.</p><p>Katie imagined that the odor was actually what had finally alerted the revelers to the fact that there was something very serious, horrid and tragic going on. At first, people thought it was all part of a Key West game.</p><p>A game...</p><p>Key West loved her pirates.</p><p>She loved her ghost stories.</p><p>Her eccentrics...</p><p>She was a city that loved equality and fairness, a party, a good time, history, water and more.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t customary.</p><p>Finally, though, the screams in the street became louder than the sounds of the sirens. The parade dispersed. Shopkeepers, innkeepers, costumed entertainers, bartenders-all came out to the streets, staring with horror. There was such a crowd that everyone had to whisper to everyone else, asking what had happened.</p><p>Uniformed officers on horseback were the first to arrive. The rescue vehicle was forced to park on a side road along with the detectives and crime-scene investigators.</p><p>Katie just stood, feeling it all, seeing all, sensing it all and feeling David\u2019s supporting arms around her, for what seemed like forever.</p><p>Then Liam was there, the one to officially question her while they awaited Lieutenant Dryer\u2019s arrival on the scene.</p><p>She heard snatches of conversation from the medical examiner and techs.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, he\u2019s ripe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen in there at least a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have been dead since he went missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause of death?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo way to know-he\u2019s far too bloated. Got to get him to the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWhat happened? Witnesses said that you just came to the effigy and started tearing at it. How did you know that Danny was in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, blinking.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know that Danny had been stuffed into the effigy?\u201d Liam persisted.</p><p>\u201cI-I, umm, well, I saw someone. Out the door-the doors at O\u2019Hara\u2019s are open, of course, you know. And I saw someone dressed in a Robert the Doll costume, and then the giant Robert the Doll effigy was right behind him, and I remembered the-the odor-and it seemed as if it was coming right in the bar and I...\u201d She let her voice trail away. \u201cI guess that I freaked out a bit, Liam. I\u2019m so sorry, I just couldn\u2019t take the smell and I suddenly realized it was coming from the effigy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the manufacturer-how did Danny wind up in the doll?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cThe doll was up before Danny disappeared,\u201d Liam said, glancing at his notes. \u201cThe manufacturer is local, just up on Stock Island. They\u2019ve done these dozens of times. And the effigy was set up by the salsa club right there, and they\u2019re baffled and mystified-again, they said that the doll was in perfect shape from the manufacturer when they assembled it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo someone killed Danny Zigler and stuffed his body into a giant-size effigy of another Key West legend,\u201d David said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like so far,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>The medical examiner and police photographers gave the word and the corpse was lifted into a body bag-oozing liquids-to be taken to the M.E.\u2019s office.</p><p>The owners of the salsa bar argued with the police; that area of the street would have to remain cordoned off until it had been thoroughly inspected and cleared by crime scene. It was Fantasy Fest. What was the city going to do about the amount of money they were going to lose?</p><p>Katie had felt ridiculously frozen and weak. Paralyzed. Horrified.</p><p>But she was suddenly angry. It wasn\u2019t a shock; she had seen Danny\u2019s ghost. When she had looked out the door and seen him, then the costumed Robert the Doll performer, she had known. Danny had been showing her where he could be found. Poor Danny. He would have been so horrified. He loved Key West.</p><p>Now, he was part of Key West. Part of the stories and lore that would be told to generations from now until eternity.</p> <p>\u201cAm I free to go?\u201d she asked Liam suddenly.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Katie. But-\u201d Liam began.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She made her way through the gaping crowd on the street and back to O\u2019Hara\u2019s. Her brother was there, looking aggravated, but managing to put up a stream of pirate songs with singers, music and words intact. He was startled when he saw her arrive.</p><p>\u201cKatie, you just found the corpse of an old friend. Get David to take you home,\u201d Sean said. \u201cOr leave David. I\u2019ll take you home. Hell, Jamie would close this place down and take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Katie said angrily. \u201cNo, everyone is acting like Danny is something disgusting in the street, as if he\u2019s an annoyance, ruining a pirate parade.\u201d</p><p>She took the microphone. \u201cFolks, everyone knows that something terrible just happened. Everyone tried to get close, to find out what happened. Well, I\u2019ll tell you. A friend of ours disappeared a few days ago. People were mad at him-they thought that he\u2019d sloughed off work. In fact, it was even suspected that he had killed a woman. But he didn\u2019t. He was murdered himself. He wasn\u2019t an odor in the street-he was a good guy, a true conch, a real part of Key West. His name was Danny Zigler. He didn\u2019t need a lot of money. He loved Key West, and he loved the simple things in life. This is for him. Honor him with me, if you will.\u201d</p><p>She went to the computer and set \u201cDanny Boy\u201d to play. There was a dead silence at first.</p> <p>\u201cDanny Zigler was Irish?\u201d Someone asked with confusion.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s Irish on St. Patrick\u2019s day,\u201d a drunk sloshed out in reply.</p><p>\u201cSing along, a good fellow is gone and departed!\u201d someone else said.</p><p>When it was over, she felt David at her side. \u201cKatie, come on. We\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go,\u201d she said dully.</p><p>\u201cWe can. Sean and Clarinda can handle your system. And it will thin out early-even in the middle of Fantasy Fest, a dead man means something, Katie.\u201d</p><p>She let him drag her away. She had known that Danny was dead. He hadn\u2019t been her best friend, but he had been a fixture in her life. He had always been there.</p><p>David took her home. She wondered that he was with her, and she felt a little numb, and a little awed. He probably wanted to be haunting the police station. He\u2019d want to know what happened to Danny Zigler. He had to be noting the fact that all the deaths were coupled with Key West legends.</p><p>At her house, she ran up and showered the minute they were inside. The smell of death had seemed to permeate her. She scrubbed her hair several times. At last she emerged and wrapped into her terry robe.</p><p>David had evidently decided to use her brother\u2019s shower-the scent of decay and death had been too much for him, too. He was out of his pirate garb and in Sean\u2019s clothing, something she was certain he would explain and Sean would understand. He had made her something hot.</p><p>\u201cTea-with a good dose of whiskey,\u201d he told her, handing her the cup.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. I\u2019m really all right. I knew that Danny was dead. It was just that it was so horrible-seeing him, like that. I\u2019ve seen the dead before, I\u2019ve been to funerals...but that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath is seldom gentle,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She sipped the tea, and noted that it was very strongly laced with whiskey. She carried it out to the parlor and saw that Bartholomew was seated on the sofa, watching her with sorrowful eyes. \u201cI wish I had realized, Katie. I can\u2019t really...I don\u2019t get scents and odors anymore. I would have stopped you. I tried to stop you, and you didn\u2019t even see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>David had come behind her. He set his hands on her shoulders. \u201cGo on up to bed, Katie. Try to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>She nodded after a moment, draining the tea. The whiskey washed through her, warm and soothing. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She gave him the cup and headed for the stairs. She heard him make a startled sound. On the first step, she turned back.</p><p>David was still standing in the middle of the parlor, holding her cup.</p><p>He was staring at the table.</p><p>The ledger, the Beckett family ledger was moving.</p><p>Bartholomew was pushing it toward him, of course. He didn\u2019t see Bartholomew.</p><p>But he had to see the ledger moving.</p><p>She went on up the stairs. As he had said, despite all that was haunting her mind-or perhaps because of it-she slept.</p><p>He\u2019d had one beer. One damned beer.</p><p>And it seemed that the ledger on the table was moving. It was open.</p><p>He was tired. So damned tired. And more disturbed than ever. When Katie had gone on into the pub, Liam had told him that the police had gone into Danny Zigler\u2019s house at last.</p><p>There had been no sign of books about the history of Key West.</p><p>There had been no money.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s what you saw, David?\u201d Liam had asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m a photographer. I have pictures,\u201d David told him.</p><p>\u201cThen someone else let themselves into Danny\u2019s apartment. Hell, David, I may have to let Pete know that you were in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, don\u2019t do anything just yet. Give me a little more time before I get arrested myself, thrown off the island, or until Pete decides he\u2019s not letting me move out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, I\u2019m feeling pretty damned slimy right now,\u201d Liam told him.</p><p>\u201cPretend I never trusted you. Just give me a little more time. I don\u2019t know why-I\u2019m feeling that I can almost touch the last piece of the puzzle.\u201d</p><p>He hated what he was asking Liam to do. But he also knew that someone out there was wearing a facade of complete normalcy-and killing people under that cover.</p><p>The ledger had been moving. In his mind\u2019s eye, anyway. It was subconsciously telling him that the answers were right in front of him-he had to find them.</p><p>He set Katie\u2019s empty teacup down and walked toward the ledger. It was open to a page filled with elaborate script that was somewhat difficult to read. But he knew the book; it had been in the family forever. Craig had told him that Alice and Esther had decided that their role in life was to preserve family history. They had recorded births and deaths, and events that had occurred in Key West during their lives.</p><p>Before Alice and Esther had recorded in the book, the task had been taken on by Josiah Beckett, his great-grandfather. Before that, it had been Helena, youngest daughter of the first Craig Beckett. And before that, it had been Beckett himself who had kept the records.</p><p>None of that mattered. The book was open to a page that recorded when the territory of Florida had become a state, and when David Porter had brought down his Mosquito Squadron, and piracy had been brought to an end.</p><p>He read over and over the part about the assault on the ship, the death of Victoria and the lynching of Bartholomew. He read about his ancestor\u2019s fury and insistence that an innocent man had been hanged, and that a guilty man must be brought to justice. And how he had watched at the hanging tree himself while Smith had met with his end. Craig Beckett had stood there while Smith had cursed his family, something that hadn\u2019t disturbed him in the least. He believed in men, in justice and in God-he did not believe in curses.</p><p>He definitely hadn\u2019t been cursed, David thought. The first Craig Beckett had lived out a long and prosperous life.</p><p>The key turned in the outside lock and Sean O\u2019Hara came in. David glanced at his watch. It was nearly 5:00 a.m. He should have been sleeping himself.</p><p>Sean came into the parlor. \u201cKatie?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe went to bed several hours ago,\u201d David said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean nodded. \u201cWhat a night, huh? Life is so-messed up, really. And then, maybe not. Maybe we all know that we\u2019re mortal, and we live just like Poe suggested in \u2018The Masque of the Red Death.\u2019 Dance until we drop ourselves. A man was found dead-even the most dense person has to assume murdered, since it would have been impossible for him to stuff his own corpse in an effigy. The revelry continued though. Cities have lives of their own, I suppose. And since tourists didn\u2019t know Danny Zigler...\u201d</p><p>Sean left off. \u201cDid you wonder why I came home, David?\u201d he asked then.</p><p>\u201cBecause you knew I was coming here,\u201d David answered.</p> <p>Sean nodded. \u201cBizarre, really. I knew that you hadn\u2019t killed Tanya. Or, should I say, I believed that you hadn\u2019t killed Tanya. But there was just something about the fact that you were going to be here. I didn\u2019t know that you were seeing Katie, but I knew she wanted to open the museum. Maybe I knew that you would try to stop her. God knows, you\u2019re the only one not trying to make a buck off of tragedy! But something is going on. Something that started when we were kids just out of school and heading into college. It\u2019s still going on.\u201d He reached into his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ve made a list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on it, and I\u2019m on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>Sean came in and sat down on the end of the sofa, spreading out his list, made on a cocktail napkin.</p> <p>In a neat row Sean had lined up names.</p><p>Pete Dryer</p><p>Pete Dryer\u2019s family</p><p>David Beckett</p><p>Liam Beckett</p><p>Mike Sanderson</p> <p>Sam Barnard</p><p>Sean O\u2019Hara</p><p>Jamie O\u2019Hara</p><p>Danny Zigler</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made a similar list a dozen times in my mind,\u201d David said. \u201cWe can scratch out Danny Zigler-Danny is dead. We can scratch out Dryer\u2019s family. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever come back, even though they don\u2019t live far away. Oh, you can scratch out Mike Sanderson-he proved that he had an alibi this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to scratch out you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can scratch out Jamie, your uncle, too. A dozen witnesses knew that he never left O\u2019Hara\u2019s that night,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so that leaves Tanya\u2019s brother, Sam Barnard, my cousin and a cop, Liam Beckett, and Pete Dryer, a major-league cop,\u201d David said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin was nowhere near the museum that night,\u201d David said. \u201cPete was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete\u2019s a police lieutenant. And who knows? Maybe Sam hated his sister. Maybe Liam has envied you his whole life. Hey, you were the apple of your grandfather\u2019s eye. You were the star football hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam played football, Sean. I was a linebacker, he was a quarterback. He was never jealous of me. I have a hard time believing that Sam killed his sister. And Pete has risen like a meteor at the station. He was just a beat cop when the murder took place. He loves Key West. Maybe this list is bull. Maybe we should both be on it. Me more than you, of course. I found Tanya in the museum, and I was the one dating her. Odd, though. I\u2019ve read the ledger over and over. Katie seems convinced it all has something to do with the first Craig Beckett, who had a man executed.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked around the parlor. He stared back at David.</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that we both need to pay more attention to my sister,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI always listen to your sister.\u201d</p><p>Sean gave him an awkward and crooked smile. \u201cNo, no, you\u2019re not really listening to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He could have sworn that Sean was going to say something-that he was about to break down and tell him something about Katie that was incredibly important.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Sean shook his head, disturbed. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou have to speak to Katie. This is crazy. I\u2019ve told Katie over and over... I love my sister. And people would think that she was crazy. You\u2019d think that-never mind. I\u2019m telling you, just pay attention to my sister. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>David frowned, watching him.</p><p>Sean stood suddenly. \u201cHell, I\u2019m exhausted. And there\u2019s tomorrow. Great idea for me, this coming home thing. Not a vacation at all. Two murders in a week, but for the living, life goes on. I guess that\u2019s the way that it always has been, and always will be.\u201d</p><p>David was tired, and wished that he could somehow shake Sean to find out what he meant. But Sean wasn\u2019t going to talk. He seemed really tired, disgusted and frightened for his sister.</p><p>\u201cSome major cities have a murder rate of one a day, and they can\u2019t shut down, I suppose. Of course, statistically, our murder rate is two a year, not two a week. The investigative unit deals with drug deals, and cleaning up the street most of the time. Drugs are dangerous, the officers are up against a lot, but...not usually like this,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYou just said \u2018our,\u2019\u201d Sean told him.</p><p>\u201cOur-as in Key West,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cWe both left,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cStill, we\u2019re conchs,\u201d David said.</p><p>Sean was watching him thoughtfully. \u201cSo, once a conch, always a conch?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d David asked, irritated. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through history and statistics, so what are we on now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister,\u201d Sean said softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the city is safe right now, and I don\u2019t intend to let anything happen to her,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly where I was going. She is my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this sounds odd as hell. Just what are your intentions with my sister?\u201d</p><p>David stared back at him.</p><p>What the hell were his intentions.</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, you\u2019re going to keep her safe. And I will, too. There\u2019s some kind of psycho out there, but a couple of fellows who work in video and print film are going to keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>David realized that Sean had made a good point, and his defenses rose to the fore. \u201cI served in the military, did my time in the desert, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you\u2019re the one putting her in danger?\u201d Sean asked. \u201cSay someone had been out to get you all those years ago-kill Tanya, frame you. So now that person has killed a prostitute-and Danny Zigler. And he still hasn\u2019t left clues, and he still hasn\u2019t been caught. It\u2019s not like you and Katie have this long-standing love affair. You could be putting her in serious danger,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cTen years ago, a killer got away with murder,\u201d David said. \u201cBut that was then, and this is now. Science has come a long way. They\u2019ve just discovered Danny\u2019s body. The killer has to make a mistake. And it will be found,\u201d David said.</p><p>Katie suddenly appeared in the entrance to the parlor.</p><p>She walked into the room. She paused, giving her brother a kiss on the cheek, and then walking over to David. She looked up into his eyes and slipped an arm around him before she faced her brother. \u201cSean, I love you. I\u2019m grateful that you came home, and I\u2019m grateful that you care about me. I\u2019ll answer your earlier question. None of what\u2019s happening between us was intended, so no one can have intentions. I know that I\u2019m not backing away from my life, and I don\u2019t want David backing away from me because of anything that\u2019s happening. No one knows what will come in the future, but I know that what\u2019s going on between us is honest, and that\u2019s the only intention I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you two should just pretend then to step away from one another,\u201d Sean suggested.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be too late for that,\u201d Katie said. She smiled and shrugged. \u201cI think the damage is done, Sean, so please, don\u2019t go asking David to stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to...I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve got to be careful with every move, that\u2019s all I have to say,\u201d Sean told her. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not all I have to say, but we\u2019re all exhausted. I\u2019m going to bed. After I make sure the doors and windows are locked.\u201d True to his word, he walked around the room, bolting the windows. With a nod, he left them there.</p><p>Katie turned in David\u2019s arms. \u201cSorry you got involved?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He held her close and shook his head. \u201cNever, Katie.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer and lifted her chin. \u201cNever,\u201d he said. \u201cKatie, Sean said that you had a dream, that you believed Danny was dead.\u201d</p><p>She started to move away from him.</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d he said, pulling her back.</p><p>She stared at him, and he thought that she was holding her breath, that like Sean she was about to say something.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>She stood on her toes and lightly kissed his lips. \u201cWe really do need some sleep,\u201d she said. She caught his hand, and she led him toward the stairs.</p><p>They slept...</p><p>And they didn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>At first, they held one another.</p><p>He drifted to sleep. He woke, feeling the heat of her form against him, feeling her moving. He didn\u2019t move, not wanting to wake her.</p><p>But she was awake. Her fingers trailed down his chest, circled around his abdomen, moved lower. His breath caught as he felt her sudden, sure touch. He rolled, pulled her against him, taking her into his arms, meeting her lips and then using his own to create a slow trail of liquid fire along her collarbone and breasts.</p><p>For a moment, she was still, breath caught.</p><p>Then she moved. Fluid, easy, ridiculously graceful for the vital energy that suddenly poured through the two of them. Passionate, fierce...the ardent movement of her body escalated by the soft whisper of tenderness that came with the brush of her lips against his.</p><p>He became the aggressor, sweeping her beneath him.</p><p>The world went still, and there was nothing but the hunger and the need, the basic feel of flesh and cotton and sheets, and their words as they edged closer and closer to climax. Again, the world went still, and there were moments that were oddly as fulfilling as the instinctive need for sexual satiation, that could never be achieved unless more than just sex was involved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was becoming a philosopher, he thought.</p><p>No. Feelings were what they were. All the psychology and science in the world could never really answer the human question of why emotions raged where they did.</p><p>She lay beside him again, and slept, and he thought that again, maybe something as old as man was rising inside of him. He knew that he would die to protect her.</p> <p>As the morning passed, he held her close, felt her flesh against his flesh, the rise and fall of her breathing.</p><p>What were his intentions?</p><p>He had never come home to stay. And then again, he had never felt this intimate with a woman, no matter how long they\u2019d been together, no matter what the sexual appeal.</p><p>Not the time to think about it. There was a killer out there.</p><p>And they were no closer now than they had been ten years ago.</p> <p>Or were they?</p><p>It seemed that the curtains suddenly flew, as if cool air whirled into the room. Katie sat up and looked around, and the ghost of Tanya Barnard was standing by her bed.</p><p>She reached out, and Katie took her hand.</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d the ghost whispered.</p><p>She looked beyond Tanya. Danny was there, looking at her with prayerful eyes, and at his side, Stella Martin stood, watching her, waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou must help me,\u201d she told them. \u201cYou must help me. Please, think, what do you know? Who followed you, who was with you-who killed you? Show me.\u201d</p> <p>They shook their heads, staring at her.</p><p>She looked to Danny. \u201cThe books, Danny-and the money. David saw them in your house. Who were you blackmailing-who gave you the money?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hear him. His lips were moving. She tried to come closer to him, to study the movement. She wanted to scream with frustration.</p><p>I took the books from the library. And then I got the call. Stop. Stop looking for the past, or I would join it. Leave it be, and there would be money. And there was money. I found it under my pirate-skull doormat. And I didn\u2019t know, but someone seemed to think I would find out what happened to Tanya, but I had no idea...that was the past. I kept the money. There was no way to give it back, no one to give it back to, because I really didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Katie looked at the three ghosts. \u201cCan\u2019t you help me at all?\u201d</p><p>Something, I saw something, someone thought I saw something. I saw Stella briefly. She came to the window, kept her back to the street. But then she was gone.</p><p>Stella stepped forward. Now we\u2019re all gone, all gone, and there are impressions and things we see in our minds... Katie, help, you must help, you are the only one who can help.</p><p>She had the oddest sensation of being approached by the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future, all in one. Air seemed to sweep around her in massive currents. She was suddenly standing with a group in back of La Concha Hotel. She could hear the ghost-tour guide speaking, talking about the tragic suicides from the roof, and telling the story of the young man who haunted the place, a young man who had perished in the not-too-distant past when he had been distracted by a pretty young woman and plunged to his death down an elevator shaft.</p> <p>Danny was with her. So was Tanya. And Stella. They were grouped around her on the tour. The others in the group seemed to be faceless. The guide was wearing a Victorian frock coat and vest, and a top hat. She couldn\u2019t see his face. But then he turned. His face was Danny\u2019s face.</p><p>The tour group moved from tragic event to tragic event. All the while, the tour guide talked of the ghosts that still haunted these places. Behind him, like the chorus in a Greek tragedy, Tanya and Stella sobbed softly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still here,\u201d Danny said clearly. \u201cShe\u2019s still here. Go anywhere on the island, wax museum, oddities museum, history museum, you\u2019ll see our dear Elena, Elena Milagro de Hoyos... You will see her. She is Key West. She is our most famous, and most bizarre, story.\u201d</p><p>Tanya let out a long, wailing cry, and the wind shifted and the earth moved beneath Katie\u2019s feet.</p><p>They were standing before the hanging tree.</p><p>By the tree, the building began to fade and disappear. Next door, where the main section of Captain Tony\u2019s stood, bar stools evaporated, and she might have been on a whirlwind tour through a time machine. Bar...telegraph office...morgue...the visions swept by. Then, the landscape was suddenly raw and overgrown, rocky, with patches around them that were barren. She could hear the sound of the water, coming from the south, coming from the north, and the west. It was all around her...</p><p>A man was being dragged to the gallows...</p><p>Cursing...</p><p>Cursing a man named Beckett who looked on with fierce and furious eyes, eyes that seemed so familiar...</p><p>Again, the wind blew; it was as if she stood still while a hurricane raged. Time whipped by her. Fishermen, pirates, wreckers, smugglers and thieves...soldiers in blue, and soldiers in gray, and then sailors from a country united once again. She heard a cry on the wind. \u201cRemember the Maine!\u201d</p><p>And then, suddenly, the world was still. She was walking down a long hall in a building.</p><p>A strange-looking, skinny old man turned to her, arms before him, fingers flexing. \u201cIt is love, love for what is ours, love. Love-ah, yes, and family name. We are all that we create. And I have created love.\u201d</p><p>He moved aside. There was a bed, within the confines of an airplane cabin. There was a woman in a bridal gown, laid upon the bed.</p><p>It was just an exhibit. Count von Cosel, and his Elena.</p><p>But Elena rose from the bed and looked up. It wasn\u2019t Elena. Katie stared at her own countenance. She was there. She had taken Elena\u2019s place in the exhibit this time.</p><p>Her own arm raised and pointed.</p><p>She turned.</p><p>And once again, she was staring at the hanging tree, and the noose and the dead man who dangled and swung beneath the branches.</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d David said.</p><p>She had let out a cry; she was sitting up in bed, soaked with beads of perspiration, and yet shaking as if it had suddenly plunged to ten degrees in Key West.</p><p>He drew her to him. \u201cKatie, I\u2019m here, Katie, it\u2019s all right. You had a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. For a moment, her eyes were unfocused. Then she seemed to really see his face.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a nightmare, Katie. And I\u2019m here. I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed in his arms. Then she pulled away. She stood, and she was naked and beautiful and natural, but somehow putting a distance between them, as well.</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, sat back down next to him and said, \u201cDavid, even if we\u2019d found Danny alive, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to help us. He wasn\u2019t blackmailing anyone, but someone did think that he\u2019d seen something, or knew something. I think he had the books on Key West just because he wanted to make his stories better, but the killer knew that there was something in the books-in the history of Key West-that might give him away. He saw Stella the night before she died. The killer must have thought that Danny saw him then, because he\u2019d seen Stella, and maybe the murderer. That\u2019s why Danny died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d David said blankly. Her words were so assured and natural. \u201cKatie-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to walk out on me, David. But you have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, I don\u2019t understand you. Your words about Danny are making sense, but...you had a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t just a nightmare. I-I see things that other people don\u2019t, David.\u201d</p><p>It was late; she\u2019d been through a lot.</p><p>\u201cKatie, we all have nightmares and dreams. And sometimes, they\u2019re good and they help us. You have a lot on your mind. We\u2019re pretty damned sure that the truth is in the past. Your mind was working while you were sleeping, and what you\u2019re saying might be right.\u201d</p><p>She took his face between her hands. \u201cDavid...I\u2019m...I care about you so much. And that\u2019s why I have to say this. You can leave if you think I\u2019m crazy. I see-I see the dead. When they remain. Not all the dead-some do pass on immediately. But I-I see ghosts. And I\u2019m telling you because you have to listen to me and believe me now. I see ghosts.\u201d</p><p>He was dismayed by the harshness in his voice, but he was worried about her. \u201cGreat. Ask them all who killed them.\u201d</p><p>She rose, stepping away from him. \u201cThey don\u2019t know. Sean has always warned me to keep my mouth shut. You don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bear the distance between them. He stood, walking to her. She backed away, but he caught her and pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cKatie-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, that\u2019s a lot to take in suddenly. Please, you have to realize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I understand. You think I\u2019m...not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, I think everything about you is right. Do I believe in ghosts? I don\u2019t know-that\u2019s asking a lot. But do I believe in you? My God, yes, Katie, please... Let me digest some of this, huh?\u201d</p><p>She was tense. So tense, she was like a piano wire pulled taut.</p><p>\u201cLet me just give it all to you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fellow named Bartholomew. He was a pirate-no, no, a privateer. He\u2019s-he\u2019s been hanging around a long time. He was hanged for something that he didn\u2019t do. It was your ancestor who came back and indignantly saw to it that the real culprit, Eli Smith, was hanged, as well. That\u2019s when Smith cursed the Becketts. David, please, the killer really means to have his revenge on you. I can\u2019t really communicate with all ghosts, but Bartholomew has been around a very long time. He\u2019s very good at being a ghost.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. It was crazy.</p><p>He\u2019d seen the pages of the ledger move. He\u2019d been drawn to it, as if a force was trying to make him understand, help him.</p><p>\u201cKatie, I can\u2019t just...I can\u2019t just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d She was trying to slip away.</p><p>He really didn\u2019t understand, but he didn\u2019t give a damn. He would try.</p><p>\u201cKatie...\u201d</p><p>She must have heard something in his voice. The words he couldn\u2019t express. Suddenly, she eased, and she fell against him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held her with strength and warmth, smoothing her hair back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me?\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI swear, I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t know what I believe...but...\u201d</p> <p>She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cKatie, I believe in you,\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>16</p><p>Sean was awake, back out at Katie\u2019s desk, working at her computer, when David came downstairs in the morning. He had showered and dressed quietly, not wanting to wake her, although a glance at the bedside clock had informed him that they\u2019d slept until well past two in the afternoon.</p><p>That happened, he decided, when you finally had some sleep when the light was coming up.</p> <p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Sean said, hearing David come down and head over to him. He looked up at David. \u201cOr afternoon,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s late. Have you been up long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly half an hour,\u201d Sean said. \u201cDid you put the coffee on a timer last night?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf you were the one who did it, your timing was perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Katie seems to have it rigged to start in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to be brewed fresh when the first person makes it down the stairs. And I sure didn\u2019t wake up in the morning. Odd,\u201d Sean mused.</p><p>\u201cShe must have set it. Great plan, in my opinion,\u201d David said. He felt they had a great deal more to worry about than coffee. \u201cI\u2019m going to my place. Danny Zigler had three books on his table when-when I checked out his place. I had Katie get me the same books from the library. I\u2019m going to my place to read. When Katie gets up, want to bring her over?\u201d</p> <p>Sean nodded at him, studying him. \u201cSure. I won\u2019t let her come alone. I promise you that!\u201d</p><p>David thanked him. Sean locked him out of the house.</p><p>The newspaper lay on the front lawn. The headline blazed, Local Found Murdered and Decomposing in Festivity Decoration.</p><p>David read the article quickly. There was nothing there, except for the facts he already knew. Danny Zigler had been found, his body in a bad state of decomposition. The body had been removed to the Monroe County Medical Examiner\u2019s office for autopsy.</p><p>He started to leave with the newspaper, but then decided not to do so. Danny had been murdered; his body had been discovered. By Katie. Her seeing the story wasn\u2019t going to change what had taken place. They\u2019d both see the bloated remains of Danny Zigler in their minds for years to come, he was certain.</p><p>He reached his house and opened the door right when he heard wheels in the drive. He turned around to see that Liam was pulling into the driveway.</p><p>David walked to the driver\u2019s side of the car. \u201cAnything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo answers,\u201d Liam told him. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting help. The streets will be filled with our own force tonight, and with officers down from Miami-Dade. The chief is considering canceling a lot of the events, the commissioners are going crazy and Pete has been nuts, prowling the streets.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good force. Your chief is a good guy-he\u2019s been up the ladder, he\u2019s local and he intends to make it the best force in the world, as he says,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cHe put through a call to the FBI. We\u2019re supposed to have a team of agents and profilers down here by the start of next week,\u201d Liam said. He winced. \u201cSome folks aren\u2019t happy about that. We were the Conch Republic, briefly. Some of the guys are convinced we could have solved it all ourselves, but the chief says that pride isn\u2019t worth a life. Anyway, I was actually headed to Katie\u2019s place, looking for you. I\u2019m going up to the M.E.\u2019s office. Danny\u2019s autopsy is scheduled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an invitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hitchhiking?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p><p>He got into the car. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Katie woke with a start. She had been deeply asleep, but when she woke, she remembered the dream.</p><p>And that she had told David that-ghosts came to her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t believed her. Neither had he walked away. She had told him about Bartholomew. He hadn\u2019t said that she was stark, raving mad.</p><p>She shivered, remembering herself as the corpse of Elena de Hoyos.</p><p>Maybe it meant nothing. No, it meant that two women had already been left that way!</p><p>They always came back to the hanging tree.</p><p>That was what was important, she thought.</p><p>When she came downstairs, she didn\u2019t see David, but Sean was at the computer. She thought that he was working. But he was looking up sites on the Internet. Sites that had to do with Key West.</p><p>\u201cHey. Where\u2019s David?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe went to his place. He wanted to read through the books that Danny Zigler had apparently been reading,\u201d Sean told her. He rose and stretched, pushing away from the computer chair. \u201cYou know, just a few years ago, they dug up seven bodies from the cemetery, trying to match them with DNA to missing persons cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember, vaguely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know where most of our investigations into unnatural deaths are centered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccident victims? Drunk drivers?\u201d Katie asked, pouring coffee.</p><p>Sean said, \u201cNo. Drowning and diving and snorkeling accidents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that makes sense,\u201d Katie said. \u201cSean, what are you trying to do?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head with disgust. \u201cFind anything that we don\u2019t know about Tanya\u2019s murder. Instead, I think I\u2019ve just become a walking encyclopedia of trivia on my hometown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing we learn can ever hurt,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Bartholomew took a seat at the computer. \u201cMorning, Katie,\u201d he said.</p><p>She ignored him. He was purposely trying to annoy Sean, she thought. He hit a computer key, and pages started flashing by.</p><p>\u201cYou really have to replace that thing, Katie,\u201d Sean told her irritably. \u201cOr is it the cable company? I think I had better service on the China Sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Internet is great-when it works,\u201d she said, staring at Bartholomew with a glare that meant, Behave!</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d she said to her brother, \u201cI\u2019m going to go on over to David\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll walk you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is broad daylight, and the streets are busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you, too,\u201d Bartholomew said. He stood up and fluffed her brother\u2019s hair. Sean spun around, eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Bartholomew,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean demanded sharply.</p><p>She inhaled deeply. \u201cSean, for the love of God! You\u2019re not blind, you\u2019re not an idiot. I know you\u2019ve spent your life afraid that people will think I\u2019m crazy, and I get that! But you have to feel it, you have to have seen things move. Please, Sean, right now, it\u2019s important that you believe in me!\u201d</p><p>He rose. He dragged his fingers through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe!\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAdmit that there\u2019s something!\u201d she told him.</p><p>He held his breath; he let out a sigh. Bartholomew laughed, and tousled Sean\u2019s hair again. Sean jumped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bartholomew, and-\u201d Katie winced. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend. He wants to help us, and maybe he can. Please, Sean, for once, and now, believe in me!\u201d</p><p>Sean was still for a long moment. \u201cYes, there\u2019s something in this house,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSomeone. It\u2019s Bartholomew. He\u2019s real, Sean.\u201d</p><p>Her brother\u2019s face was hard. Then he grated his teeth, and let out a long breath. \u201cBartholomew. All right. Bartholomew the ghost. Tell him that I have to be in love-and that I am heterosexual-to enjoy anyone messing with my hair,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you. He can hear you,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Bartholomew proudly made a mess of Sean\u2019s hair again.</p><p>\u201cEh! Tell him to stop that,\u201d Sean said. His eyes narrowed. \u201cIf he\u2019s a damned ghost, why can\u2019t he help us solve the killings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just ask the other ghosts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, I\u2019ve tried to explain. They don\u2019t know.\u201d She turned away from him. \u201cI\u2019m just going to grab a cup of coffee quickly, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Then I\u2019ll get you over there. I\u2019m running up to my room for a minute. I\u2019ll be right back down.\u201d</p><p>She went to pour herself coffee. Bartholomew leaned against the counter casually. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny Zigler has nothing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBartholomew, if I knew who the killer was, I\u2019d be announcing it to the world.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew was thoughtful. \u201cSo, Danny was taken by surprise, from the back, just like the others. Odd, though. I have a feeling that Danny knows something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a talkative ghost. Except for...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night, I had a dream, or a nightmare, whichever way you want to look at it. Danny was in it, and so were Tanya and Stella. First, I asked him about the books and the money. He received a threatening call-to drop looking into the books. Then, he found the money under his doormat. I don\u2019t think that the killer wanted to kill him, but finally felt that he had to. Oh! He saw Stella before she died. Maybe the killer thought that he might have seen something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI begged them to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went on a ghost tour together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny did enjoy giving a ghost tour,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cThe dream ended at the hanging tree. Bartholomew, you must know something more. Let\u2019s say that we\u2019re figuring this thing correctly. The killer is an islander. Someone with an old grudge, trying to relive a past they don\u2019t even really know. Can you think of anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not a descendant of mine!\u201d Bartholomew said defensively. \u201cI was avenged.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBy David Beckett\u2019s ancestor. But what about Smith?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you know a Smith?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cBut decades-almost two centuries-have gone by.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that the ghost of Eli Smith has come back, do you? I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m a dammed good ghost, and I couldn\u2019t sneak up behind someone, smother them and then strangle them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no ghost. There\u2019s a human being out there doing all this,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Sean came quickly back down the stairs. His hair had been brushed. \u201cReady?\u201d he asked his sister.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Bartholomew followed as they left the house, waiting patiently as Sean made sure that he locked the door. Katie picked up the newspaper and read the headline.</p> <p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Bartholomew asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just the facts we already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo what?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing new on Danny,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cBartholomew asked first, right?\u201d Sean asked with a groan.</p><p>\u201cSean, he\u2019s real,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>Sean squeezed her arm. \u201cI believe you. Well, I believe something, anyway. Let\u2019s get this straight then. You\u2019re there, Bartholomew? Quit being a horse\u2019s ass! Flipping my hair around is really beneath your dignity.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew puffed himself up. Katie thought that he was going to explode with anger.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He laughed. \u201cTell Sean that he\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Katie did so.</p><p>Sean lowered his head, hiding a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They walked the few blocks to David\u2019s house.</p><p>Sean knocked on the door, stepped back, frowned and rang the bell.</p><p>Katie did the same.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d she said with dismay. \u201cOr, he\u2019s not opening the door if he is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, there\u2019s this modern invention. It\u2019s called a cell phone,\u201d Sean reminded her.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d she told her brother. She pulled her phone out and dialed David\u2019s number. He answered before it seemed to ring.</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d he said, sounding as if he were aggravated with himself.</p><p>\u201cHey. Where are you?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWith Liam,\u201d he said briefly. He groaned. \u201cI should have gotten those books out and given them to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can go back to the library. They might have more copies,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sean nudged her, glaring at her. \u201cWell? Where is he?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, where the hell is he?\u201d Bartholomew asked.</p><p>She covered the phone. \u201cWith Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cKatie, Danny had the books-and you found them for me at the library. I\u2019m not sure how many more the library will have. They\u2019re research books. Look, I probably won\u2019t be more than a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to start reading now. It\u2019s worth a try. I\u2019ll go to the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. You don\u2019t need to do that. You still have keys to the family museum, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the desk where you buy tickets and go through the stiles?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird drawer down, under guidebooks with old prices. You\u2019ll find house keys there. I\u2019m really sorry, Katie. And don\u2019t go anywhere alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Sean is with me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure. Sean loves walking around town when the sun is beating down like a mother!\u201d Sean said.</p><p>She nudged him with an elbow. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Sean told her. \u201cLet\u2019s go get the keys. And walk around some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could have taken the car,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cWonderful. Take the car to drive three blocks here and there-and spend an hour looking for parking.\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cBitch, bitch, bitch! David\u2019s house has a driveway. We wouldn\u2019t have had any trouble parking, but we\u2019re not going far! Anyway, walking is good. Let\u2019s go get the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie? Katie?\u201d David\u2019s voice called to her from the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, and as I said, I\u2019m with Sean, and we\u2019re going to go and get the keys to your house. What are you doing-exactly?\u201d she asked.</p><p>There was silence for a minute.</p><p>Katie waited, but then she thought that she had lost him.</p><p>Then he answered.</p><p>\u201cAutopsy,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cBe careful, Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with my brother. Everything will be fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>David knew that sometimes people thought of the Keys as being backwoods. Laid-back meant slow.</p><p>But the facilities in the Keys were state-of-the-art. The department was small, and like most other agencies in the world, when faced with an anthropological question, human remains might be sent out across the country. But the autopsy facilities were sterling.</p><p>David was offered a mask by an assistant.</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d Liam advised him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a cop, and so David kept his place in the background and remained silent.</p><p>The mask didn\u2019t help much.</p><p>Danny\u2019s body had been washed and cooled, but he still barely resembled a human. Gases had exploded through bloated skin and crevices, and his flesh was horribly mottled and discolored.</p><p>The medical examiner had a good, clear voice, and he offered facts and figures of the body\u2019s appearance to Liam and two other officers who attended, and to the microphone above his head. He stated that due to lividity, the body was certainly left at an unknown location for some time; blood had pooled to the buttocks, shoulders, back, thighs and calves.</p><p>The room was cold, sterile. He could remember similar occasions, but in far less pristine conditions, when he had served in the military.</p><p>Land mine, a man\u2019s body all but blown to bits, picking up the pieces.</p><p>Unchecked syphilis.</p><p>Gunfire straight in the face.</p><p>Danny Zigler, more bloated, distorted and discolored than any horror he had seen before.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t right. And why Danny? He had been a suspect himself, a perfect patsy, just about.</p><p>\u201cAll right, he died somewhere else,\u201d Liam said, suddenly impatient. \u201cHow did he die?\u201d</p><p>There was silence. The medical examiner looked at him. \u201cLiam, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to determine.\u201d</p><p>Still, something about Liam\u2019s words made him change his intended direction. He turned to one of his assistants. \u201cLet\u2019s slide him into X-ray.\u201d</p><p>Rearrangements were made. They stared at a computer screen.</p><p>\u201cX-ray of the body shows a broken cervix. The neck was broken when he was strangled.\u201d</p><p>Sean stared up at the Beckett museum.</p><p>Katie looked at her brother, and then the old Victorian mansion.</p><p>There was something forlorn about it today. Craig had loved the place. He had believed that he had found a way to preserve a history he loved. He\u2019d been such a good and decent man, and she had really loved him. What was the future for the museum? The oddities museum down the street was already back up and running.</p><p>\u201cHate the place. Hate it,\u201d Sean said, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful old house,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember everything that happened as clearly as I do,\u201d Sean said. \u201cDavid had been my friend. Tanya and Sam...they\u2019d been friends. Everything fell apart. Craig Beckett was never the same. David left, the Barnards left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople move on, no matter what,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I hate it most because David had been my friend. Did I back away from him?\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cWe were kids,\u201d she reminded him. She smiled, touching her brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMaybe you actually learned from it, and became a stronger person?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAll righty, Katie-oke. Let\u2019s do this thing.\u201d</p><p>Katie tried the door, remembering how it had been unopened the night she had come to find David here. What a fool she had been, walking right in. Bartholomew had warned her. But she hadn\u2019t believed at the time that such a heinous crime could come back to haunt Key West again, in the way that it had. She had been worried about a commercial venture, which seemed silly and so long ago already!</p><p>Today, the door was securely locked; both bolts were secured. But her keys worked, and within seconds, they stepped into the entry.</p><p>Sunlight gleamed in. From the stairway, Hemingway looked down at them both, as if they were intruders on a secret party that raged when the doors were closed.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the keys?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cDesk. Third drawer.\u201d</p><p>He leapt over the turnstile and pulled open the third drawer. Katie leapt the stile and stood behind him, looking around. Sunlight couldn\u2019t penetrate the whole house. She was pretty sure that David still kept auxiliary lights in the floor, but they were on a timer.</p><p>Now, with the sun falling but not quite down, the place was cast in a strange shadow. It was somehow disturbing. Through the door to her left, she could see a number of the displays.</p><p>She had never been afraid or uneasy in the museum. Even knowing its history.</p><p>The figures were frozen in place.</p><p>And yet, in the ghost shadow of the house, it seemed that they might move at any minute.</p><p>And, if she were to move into the hallway, she knew what exhibit she would come to. That of the Otto family, Artist House and Robert the Doll.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to look through the doorway that led to the exhibit. Danny had been found in an effigy of Robert the Doll.</p><p>She had to look. She had to make sure that the little robotic was standing right where he should have been.</p><p>He was.</p><p>Sean was oblivious to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with David? Sending us on a wild-goose chase. They\u2019re not here,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cOf course they are. He wouldn\u2019t have told us to come if the keys weren\u2019t here,\u201d Katie said. \u201cOh, hell. It\u2019s already heading toward sunset. I\u2019m not going to have any time to read anything if we don\u2019t hurry. I\u2019m supposed to be at work soon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, where did he say-exactly-that they were?\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cThe third drawer, under the old guidebooks,\u201d Katie said. \u201cHe was certain of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not here,\u201d Sean said.</p> <p>Bartholomew had followed them in. \u201cImpatient fellow, your brother.\u201d</p><p>Katie sighed. \u201cYou, chill,\u201d she said to Sean. \u201cAnd, you! You just hush up,\u201d she said to Bartholomew.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Your ghost is still with us?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cTell him that I\u2019m learning to work a razor. I\u2019ll shave his hair right off his head next time,\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cBartholomew is with us, yes,\u201d Katie said. \u201cAnd David might have been wrong, or mistaken. Try the second drawer. Never mind, move. I\u2019ll find the keys. I don\u2019t mind messing anything up here. I was already in here with Liam,\u201d Katie said.</p> <p>She glanced up as she started rummaging through the drawers. Sunset was coming, and it was causing the light to play tricks.</p><p>It looked as if something was moving.</p><p>Something...a ghost shadow, in that first exhibit where Robert the Doll and the Otto family reigned supreme.</p><p>\u201cKatie, you need to get out of here!\u201d Bartholomew said.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Sean demanded.</p><p>\u201cSean, let\u2019s just go,\u201d Katie said.</p> <p>But Sean didn\u2019t heed her warning. \u201cKatie, call the cops,\u201d he said. He started toward the exhibit.</p><p>\u201cSean, no, let\u2019s just get out of here!\u201d Katie pleaded.</p><p>\u201cWhoever the hell you are,\u201d Sean yelled angrily, his voice loud and deep, \u201cshow yourself. Come on out-you\u2019re breaking and entering and the cops are on the way.\u201d</p><p>Katie had dropped her purse when she\u2019d started rifling through the drawers. She reached for it, couldn\u2019t find her cell phone and dumped the contents on the desk.</p><p>\u201cSean!\u201d she called.</p><p>Bartholomew swore; she saw the ghost go striding after her brother.</p><p>Sean became shadow, walking through the doorway to the Otto family tableau.</p><p>She found her phone. Her fingers curled around it. She keyed in 911, and to her dismay, got a busy signal. \u201cFuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!\u201d</p> <p>She searched her entries and found Pete Dryer\u2019s cell number and punched it in. There was no answer.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Sean roared.</p><p>\u201cPete, Pete, it\u2019s Katie O\u2019Hara, I\u2019m in the old Beckett museum, and there\u2019s someone in here. Please, please get this, and come quickly!\u201d</p><p>Sean let out an oath, and then it seemed as if the world exploded. The sounds of breaking glass, thumping, crashes, came shrieking out at her.</p><p>\u201cSean!\u201d</p><p>Katie grabbed a paperweight from the desk, and went tearing in after her brother.</p><p>They were in the car, driving back to town. David turned to Liam.</p><p>\u201cThe killer is playing with Key West legend. He\u2019s someone that history means a great deal to. He\u2019s fascinated by all the legends.\u201d He was quiet for a minute. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anyone named Smith, do you?\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed. \u201cSmith? In my life, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve met a number of people named Smith. And Gonzalez, Rodriguez, Jones...and I even know a pack of O\u2019Haras, none of them related.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Liam. I believe that Tanya was murdered to hurt our family. So, there is someone out there who is carrying a grudge. And it seems to be a grudge that\u2019s hundreds of years old. Okay, first off, think about it. It couldn\u2019t be Sanderson to begin with-he was a tourist. He didn\u2019t know the Elena legend, he didn\u2019t know our family. He was an outsider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn outsider with an alibi,\u201d Liam reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, as odd as it may sound then-Sam Barnard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanya\u2019s own brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew the island like the back of his hand. Knew all the legends. He admits that he saw Tanya the night that she was killed. He admits that they argued. He told me that he was angry with her for acting like a flirt-a tramp. And maybe it even went deeper. Damn it! If we\u2019d just found Danny alive, he might have known something. He had the books, and the money. Lord, here\u2019s what it has to be-the killer read something sometime, during his life that ticked him off about the Becketts. Maybe he\u2019s like a functioning psycho. I believed from the time I came back here that the murder wasn\u2019t random. Think about it. Stella Martin winds up dead. The method of death didn\u2019t change. Danny winds up dead. Danny is small, but still, he might have put up a fight. Get him from behind. Smother him. Strangle him. And then here\u2019s the piece that makes it the same-he is found in a giant effigy of Robert the Doll. Who else knows these legends and stories better than anyone else? A local. And when violence happens, don\u2019t the police look at family members first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, so what do I do? Well, I\u2019ll give your reasoning to the team, of course,\u201d Liam said. \u201cBut there\u2019s the thing-we still don\u2019t have a shred of physical evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m not certain. I think I will be-if I just get through those books,\u201d David said. \u201cMaybe, by the time we get there, Katie will have found something. Maybe she\u2019s already found something,\u201d he said. He pulled out his phone and called Katie\u2019s cell. It went directly to voice mail. He swore softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s either talking, or she never charged her battery,\u201d David said.</p><p>He was already dialing again.</p><p>\u201cSean?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>David nodded. But Sean\u2019s phone rang and rang-and went to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d David told Liam.</p><p>\u201cHell, this isn\u2019t a sci-fi car, even if I have a siren!\u201d Liam said. \u201cI can\u2019t fly over those other cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut the siren on, do your best. Hey, have someone get over to Katie\u2019s house, and to my place, Liam. Please. Have them do it now.\u201d</p><p>There were figures tussling on the floor. Sean. And someone else. Someone else big and brawny, rolling with Sean. She heard a whack-a fist connecting with flesh. She heard another whack.</p><p>Robert the Doll stood in place, looking at her with his ugly face and beady eyes. She looked beyond him to the small-scale model of Artist House.</p><p>\u201cBastard! Asshole!\u201d Sean raged. \u201cThe cops are on the way, you idiot!\u201d</p><p>For a moment, one of the shadow figures rose high above the other. He turned blindly, heading toward the archway that lead to the next exhibit.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sean roared, making it to his feet. Ahead of him, as if he had hit a wall that wasn\u2019t there, the big shadow figure suddenly fell back to the ground.</p><p>\u201cSean, stop it, let him go!\u201d Katie cried.</p><p>The figure crawled to its feet, then doubled over and came at Sean like a bull. Katie heard the sickening thud as they met. Her brother went down with the lug on top of him. Katie found a piece of wood that had been used to construct the miniature of Artist House.</p><p>She wrenched it free, and brought it down with all her strength on the back of the man on top of her brother.</p><p>He bellowed in pain, rose and staggered toward her.</p><p>She held the wood, and whacked him again, as hard as she could, across the shoulder.</p><p>Sean was up, hurrying toward her.</p><p>Light suddenly flickered in from a car passing by on the street.</p><p>It was Sam. Sam Barnard. And he was stumbling toward her now with the ceaseless drive of a zombie, his face frozen into a mask of anger.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>Sam lunged for her. She tried to back up; she crashed against the Artist House miniature and fell flat back on the floor.</p><p>Sam came down on her.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>Robert the Doll looked down at her with malign eyes.</p><p>Sean was on top of Sam next, dragging him off her. He straddled over Sam, punched him, and punched him again.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Sam screamed. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou murdering bastard!\u201d Sean raged.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no! I didn\u2019t murder anyone,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI swear, I swear. I just came here...because I had to come here. Tanya was killed. That whore was killed. And now Danny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You were just sneaking around in here,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking my ribs, Sean, please, get up,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cNo. The cops are coming, right, Katie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t really know if they were coming or not. She was struggling up from the broken pieces of the Artist House.</p><p>Pete would come. For the moment, though, they were in the house, alone, with Sam. And she didn\u2019t know for the life of her if he was telling the truth or not!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you up,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cHey, did you like that stop? Did you see it? Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t see it. I stopped him like a brick wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it,\u201d she assured Bartholomew. He had extended his hand. She took it, not expecting much real help. But she could feel him-she could actually feel him, as she got to her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing, who\u2019s she talking to?\u201d Sam cried out, as if he were in mortal terror.</p><p>\u201cMy sister talks to ghosts,\u201d Sean said, eyes widening, waving his arms in the air. \u201cAnd guess what, asshole? The ghosts aren\u2019t saying good things about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam cried.</p><p>\u201cThe spirits are assembling!\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cSean!\u201d Katie protested, stunned. But Sam was scared. It was the place, it was her brother\u2019s fury. Maybe it was a combination.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong!\u201d Sam swore. \u201cYeah, all right, I broke in here, but I just needed to see the place. I needed to see the place again where my sister died.\u201d</p><p>There was something forming in the shadows behind Sam and her brother. The two were still talking, but Katie didn\u2019t hear them.</p><p>It was Danny. Danny Zigler. And once again, just as in her dream, the girls were with him. Tanya and Stella. They flanked him, looking over at her with sorrowful expressions.</p><p>Danny pointed upward. She frowned, and realized that he was referring to the exhibits above them. She thought briefly, and she knew which tableau stood right above them, on the second floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hanging tree.</p><p>They heard the door open.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on in here?\u201d Pete Dryer demanded in his husky, authoritative voice.</p> <p>\u201cThank God!\u201d Sean breathed. \u201cPete, we found this bastard lurking around in here,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cIs that a fact?\u201d Pete demanded. \u201cWhat are you, some kind of a sicko? You killed your own sister, and now you\u2019re back at the scene of the crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sam cried out. \u201cGet this jerk off me, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Sean stood. Pete pulled out his cuffs. \u201cTime to pay the piper, you little snot-nose creep!\u201d Pete said.</p><p>Pete was here. It was all under control.</p> <p>\u201cWhether he killed anyone or not, Pete, he was breaking and entering here,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cOh, what, it\u2019s your place because you\u2019re sleeping with Beckett?\u201d Sam demanded. \u201cThat asshole-my sister dies over him and he\u2019s still out there poking everything in a skirt!\u201d</p><p>Katie ignored him. \u201cI have to run upstairs for just a minute. It\u2019s important. Pete, you\u2019ve got Sam, right? Sean, you can fill Pete in? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give them a chance to answer. Danny was beckoning, and he looked worried, as if speed might be of the essence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling it in,\u201d Pete said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll drag the little goon in myself. Tell me exactly what happened, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, what the hell...?\u201d Sean demanded angrily.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back down!\u201d she swore.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid. Her brother was there, and Pete had Sam Barnard-he\u2019d be cuffed any minute, and safe.</p><p>She came out upstairs. The auxiliary lights had come on, giving her a footpath to follow. In the very strange orange-and-purple light that filtered in from the sky of the dying day, figures rose all around her. Pirates, smugglers, scalawags. Navy men and soldiers, Union soldiers, Confederate soldiers. They posed, ready to speak, ready to move.</p><p>She made her way to the hanging tree.</p><p>The figure there was posed with its back to her as it dangled from the tree. She stepped up. There was a large plaque on the floor, noting the tree, telling its present location, stating its grim utility as a means of execution.</p><p>On the wall, closer to the exhibit, was a small handwritten explanation. Craig Beckett had lovingly written up small wall plaques when the place had been younger, when no velvet ropes had barred visitors from getting too close.</p><p>\u201cThe hanging of Eli Smith,\u201d the plaque read. \u201cJustice was hard; another man hanged for his crimes, lynched by a mob. But truth caught up with a reckless killer.\u201d</p><p>Underneath it Craig Beckett had noted that Smith still had descendants living in the city today. He had left behind a daughter.</p> <p>The cursive handwriting was difficult to read. Katie leaned closer.</p><p>As she did so, there was a tremendous thud from down below.</p><p>The auxiliary lights went out.</p><p>As they did so, her mind comprehended Craig\u2019s cursive handwriting, and she gasped as the room fell into a shadow land of darkness.</p><p>She knew the killer.</p><p>And she knew he was in the museum with her.</p><p>He already had Sean.</p><p>17</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine,\u201d Liam assured David, snapping his phone shut.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess there was some trouble-and that you might have been right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam Barnard was at the museum. Sean and Katie heard him, and there was a major tussle, I guess between Sam and Sean. But Katie had gotten through to Pete Dryer and he arrested Sam. Katie might have lost her phone, what with everything going on. Anyway, she\u2019s supposed to be at work now. Should I leave you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re sure everything is all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lieutenant called it in. He had it under control,\u201d Liam said. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll leave you at the bar, and I\u2019ll head to Katie\u2019s house, and then, if she\u2019s not working or at her place, I\u2019ll meet up with you at Craig\u2019s place. Your place. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, thanks,\u201d David said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why. He\u2019d been the one pointing out all the reasons that it had to have been Sam Barnard. But was it?</p><p>Liam let him off before reaching the insanity of Duval Street. David turned the corner and headed into O\u2019Hara\u2019s. Katie had not set up.</p><p>He found Clarinda and caught her by the arm. \u201cKatie, where\u2019s Katie?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t come in yet.\u201d Clarinda\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cShe isn\u2019t with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Sean. She was with Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie just sent Jonas to the house. She hasn\u2019t answered her phone, and neither has Sean. Jamie is breathing fire,\u201d Clarinda said. \u201cOh, my God! Has something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to my house. If she shows up here, call me immediately. Screw Jamie and every customer in this place, Clarinda, and call me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, David, you\u2019re scaring the hell out of me!\u201d Clarinda said.</p><p>\u201cJust call me!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to reassure Clarinda, not when suddenly he was so convinced that he didn\u2019t have time. He left the bar, and ran down the backstreets. A drunken party of six swaggered by him, almost knocking him over. A woman, in ridiculously high heels, staggered and caught his arm.</p><p>\u201cCool, thanks... Hey, help us along there, shoulders, will ya?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He pressed her onto the nearest man; if they all fell flat on their faces, so be it.</p><p>He hopped a hedge to race across the lawn and up the porch steps of his house. He inserted the key in the lock, and twisted it. He reached inside to flick on the lights.</p><p>The electricity was out.</p><p>Her heard movement in the bushes and swung around. Liam.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cElectric.\u201d</p><p>Liam swore. He reached for his phone. David stopped him. \u201cIf he has them, they might still be alive. No alarms.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. He drew his service revolver and they went into the house. \u201cFuse box?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>David nodded. \u201cI can see-I can see enough.\u201d</p><p>He went up the stairs and made a hurried sweep of the house. He came back down the stairs and went into the dining room.</p><p>The books lay on the table, undisturbed.</p><p>He turned to go back and look for his cousin.</p><p>But he was shoved. Shoved, back toward the table.</p><p>He swung around, ready to fight, ready to survive. There was no one there.</p><p>He was shoved toward the table again.</p><p>The top book flew open.</p><p>He drew out a penlight and threw the glow onto the page. He looked at it, puzzled. It was a family tree. He turned the page.</p><p>The paper nearly ripped as the page turned back.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What?\u201d he demanded aloud. The book offered a host of pages of old names, the kind of names the streets had taken on in honor of early residents, and names of those who had gone before and not been honored.</p><p>He studied the page again that the unseen entity wanted him to read. The headline read, Smith.</p><p>He ran his fingers down the page, following the descendants through the ages, births, marriages and deaths.</p><p>He swore aloud as Liam came back into the house. \u201cSearch this place, top to bottom!\u201d he told him. \u201cGet someone here, Liam, quickly, for the love of God!\u201d</p><p>David burst out into the night and started running.</p><p>Katie was stunned as she heard movement-real movement-behind her. She blinked, trying to adjust to the slim filter of outside light that made its way in.</p><p>She longed to cry out; she was terrified for Sean. Tears stung her eyes.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t cry out. She had to find Sean in silence.</p><p>A noise startled her.</p><p>She swung around. It was as if the museum had been activated. Next to the hanging tree, military ruler Porter waved a broadside that promised death to all pirates. His arms were jerking spasmodically. His jaw jerked and there was an awful moment when he talked without sound.</p><p>Then a bad recording came on. Rasping and hollow. \u201cDeath...death...death...to...to...all...all...all...pirates!\u201d</p><p>She moved quickly by Porter, only to crash into a tall robotic of a wrecker.</p><p>\u201cStorm! Storrrrm...warning. First ta\u2019 reach her, salvage is mine...mine...mine...mine.\u201d</p><p>She had to stay calm. She couldn\u2019t heed the jerky movements or the eerie voices of the robotics. When she moved again, a sailor with the insignia for the Maine seemed to leap ahead of her in her path. He hadn\u2019t moved. She was terrified, and she knew that someone had hit the mechanization that Craig Beckett made.</p><p>They were just robotics. Just robotics coming to mechanical life. She had to ignore them.</p><p>She had to get downstairs to Sean.</p><p>She started to walk again, and then she heard stealthy movement. Not a robotic.</p><p>Someone was stalking her in the darkness. She made her way carefully then, letting the robotics talk and move, and using them for cover.</p><p>She came to the robotic of Ernest Hemingway. He jerked and spoke, complaining about his wife, Pauline. He said, in grating and broken words, that he\u2019d set a penny into his patio-because his wife had certainly taken his very last penny. Katie slipped by him, glad of the noise he was making, and headed down the servants\u2019 stairs to the exhibits below.</p><p>She paused, having reached the first floor. She was going to have to sneak across the open entryway to get to the left bank of rooms if she didn\u2019t go through the pantry corridor in the back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to go through the pantry corridor; it was too narrow. If there was someone there, that someone could too easily nail her.</p><p>As she hesitated, she heard a strange whooshing noise, and, at first, she thought one of the robotics was speaking in a rusty voice once again.</p><p>\u201cYou...you...you...you...you. You are going to die. Come out, come out, wherever you are! We\u2019re locked in, and your poor brother! Paying for the fact that you had to sleep with a Beckett!\u201d</p><p>She froze. The voice was near. But from which direction? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She streaked out from the passage beneath the stairway and raced over to the left hall of exhibits where she had left her brother. She burst in on Robert the Doll. In silence, he was jerking back and forth on his stand.</p><p>She nearly tripped over a body. She hunched down. It was Sam Barnard. He was wearing handcuffs, and when she gingerly touched him, she discovered a plastic bag wound tightly around his head. With trembling fingers, she ripped it away from him.</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d</p> <p>The whisper was Bartholomew\u2019s. His hands were on her shoulders. He motioned her to silence, but beckoned her to follow him.</p><p>Her brother was stretched out in the facsimile of the cemetery, where the servicemen from the Maine were buried and honored. A bag was on his head; it wasn\u2019t tightened. She ripped it away from him, and lay against him, desperate to hear his breathing.</p><p>He had a pulse. There was a gash on his head; she knew from the stickiness beneath her fingers when she touched him.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d she prayed in a breath.</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d Bartholomew warned her again.</p> <p>\u201cYou...you...you...you...you...are dead!\u201d The words were followed by laughter. She tried to rise carefully, to start to move.</p><p>\u201cKatie, the other way!\u201d Bartholomew urged her.</p><p>Too late. She ducked to avoid a nineteen-twenties flapper, and crashed right into the wall of a big man\u2019s chest.</p><p>He reached for her. He was wearing gloves. The gloves he had always known to wear. Diver\u2019s gloves, so plentiful in the Keys!</p><p>His hands wound around her neck. She struggled.</p><p>He winced and jerked suddenly, as if he\u2019d been hit from behind.</p> <p>Katie took the moment. She pushed against him and bit his arm, bit as hard as she could. She clawed at his flesh.</p><p>If she died, which well she might, the bastard wasn\u2019t getting away with it again.</p><p>Nor would he blame David Beckett.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d he roared.</p><p>His huge hand came flying across her cheek. The blow was stunning; she felt it with her jaw and head, stars sprung up before her eyes.</p><p>And then a darkness deeper than any she had ever imagined.</p><p>David slowed when he reached the lawn of the museum. Any alarm now would cost Katie her life, and he knew it. He had to believe that he had a chance. That the killer was determined to tease and taunt her before ending it. He wondered if she was meant to be his finest work. Katie O\u2019Hara, so well-known and beloved in Key West. Beautiful, and a songstress. With a family as old and renowned as his own.</p><p>And Sean was in there, somewhere.</p> <p>The door hadn\u2019t been locked. It remained open. He couldn\u2019t be sure how the killer would act and react, and he was certain that Liam would turn the house upside down. But he had to hurry-if sirens suddenly riddled the streets, if he knew that time was nearly up, the killer would work faster.</p><p>The killer had made a mistake. He wouldn\u2019t be able to cast suspicion on David or anyone else. But David thought that he was so overconfident now in his quest for some kind of belated family vengeance that he wouldn\u2019t believe that. He would still believe himself invincible.</p><p>And he would have taken care.</p><p>David didn\u2019t enter right away. He stared at the floor behind the doorway. It took him a moment, and then he saw it. A trip wire. Somehow it would alert the killer that he was here.</p><p>His eyes had attuned well to darkness. He paused for just a moment at the entry, then leapt the turnstile as silently as he could. He hurried toward the left hall.</p><p>There was a body on the floor. Heart in his throat, he hurried to it.</p><p>Sam Barnard. David checked for a pulse. The man was breathing.</p><p>\u201cCh-cha-cha-Charleston!\u201d A flapper warbled out in a gritty voice.</p><p>David jerked around. There was movement. He hadn\u2019t intended to ever have these robotics work; he\u2019d have brought in some experts and gotten them off to good homes elsewhere.</p><p>But tonight, they had a life of their own.</p><p>They\u2019d been activated to hide other noises in the museum. They had been turned on to scare and frighten, and distract.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be distracted. But he had to be very careful. He knew where the killer was. And he knew that the killer would be waiting for him.</p><p>Hurriedly, he searched the room, but he could only find Sam Barnard. He silently swore to the unconscious man that he would arrange for an ambulance the second he could. Once he had found Sean. And Katie. Katie...</p><p>Alive. She had to be alive!</p><p>He thanked God that he was good in darkness, and silence. He started through the museum. The killer would be waiting. He prayed that there was a way to surprise him.</p><p>Katie felt a stunning pain in her head. She blinked, and the world was still a realm of murky darkness-with odd, milky shapes blurring her vision.</p><p>She tried to move, and she could not. She tried to twist around, and she realized that she was strapped to a table.</p><p>She was covered in...</p><p>White. White. A white wedding dress.</p><p>She was wearing a wedding dress and veil, and she was strapped down on the slab that was a bed in the Elena de Hoyos exhibit in the museum.</p><p>Terror streaked through her, filling her with horror and panic. She almost squirmed; she would have screamed in hysteria if it hadn\u2019t been for the gag in her mouth and the tape over it.</p><p>\u201cKatie, Katie O\u2019Hara!\u201d</p><p>She was more horrified as she heard the crooning voice. For a moment, things seemed to jiggle above her, and then come into focus.</p><p>Pete. Lieutenant Peter Dryer. Of course. They\u2019d been so stupid.</p><p>Who knew the families? Who could get keys to houses and museums? Who could be at any crime scene, and be expected?</p><p>Who had been the great-great-great-grandson of a man named Smith, Smith who had left behind a daughter who had married an immigrant named Dryer?</p><p>\u201cOh, Katie, I\u2019ve saved the best for you. There\u2019s a trip cord there, by the door. When David Beckett comes to save you, he\u2019ll pull the wire. So cleverly planned. See-well, you can\u2019t really see, so I\u2019ll explain. I have your brother all trussed up and dressed like Carl Tanzler. All right, all right, so you saved your brother once! But I\u2019m very good, and I can change my plans, and I really like this. I like this so much. Tanzler! Ha-ha. Sure, sure, Sean is young and much, much better looking, but... He\u2019s got himself a syringe full of embalming fluid and other toxins, and if I\u2019ve got this right, he\u2019ll plunge them right into your heart when David enters. Then, of course, I\u2019ll shoot the bastard for what he\u2019s done to you. At first, I thought about letting him squirm in prison, but there are so many appeals, and hell, this is Key West, and the State of Florida considers us their wacky tailpiece to begin with. He might not get the death penalty. So! Old Key West justice. He dies here on the spot.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, unable to speak.</p><p>He fixed that for her, ripping off the gauze, jerking out the gag. It was horrible. She thought that she would choke.</p><p>She opened her mouth to scream, \u201cDavid! It\u2019s a trap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, loverboy isn\u2019t here yet,\u201d Pete said. \u201cYou can scream for a moment. Oh, yes, and it\u2019s so good, so damned good! See what I did for your brother? He is a fine, strapping lad! Had that Sam Barnard down for me, and in a lock. Held him while I handcuffed him. And didn\u2019t blink until I crushed his skull with the butt of my gun! There you go. Even the big and powerful fall to knowledge and careful planning. Remember that. Ah, well, you won\u2019t really need to remember it long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cop!\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cA good one. But you have to understand, Katie. I thought that maybe you did. My ancestor cursed the Becketts. He was hanged-because of a Beckett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was guilty!\u201d</p><p>Pete shook his head. \u201cKatie! You don\u2019t understand. Some vile pirate had already been hanged, and there was no reason that my ancestor should have died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a right! We were meant for great things. Don\u2019t you understand anything? I had to get revenge on the Becketts for my family. For honor! I am the curse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re a cop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, and such a good one. Katie, time has gone by-time has waited. For me! Don\u2019t go thinking I\u2019m crazy, young lady. I have been on a mission. And David Beckett will finally pay the piper for his vile family. He should have been arrested and sent to the electric chair for Tanya-now that didn\u2019t really hurt much. She was a little tramp. I was only a patrolman at the time, but she was so tipsy. And it was so easy. She was walking on one of the side streets, pacing. I stopped to give her a ride. She got right in the car, and I said I\u2019d take her to the museum, to see David. She looked out the window, and I was ready. I didn\u2019t even really know what I was doing then, but it was easy. I\u2019d been prepared for the right moment, so I slipped that clean plastic over her head, and she had so much alcohol in her system...well, she went easy. Laid her out in back of the car...used the key to the museum I\u2019d copied at least two or three months earlier, just waiting on ol\u2019 David to get back, Mr. Hero Serviceman! Then, after midnight, I had lots of time to set her up. Now, that Stella, she was just at the right place at the right time, and I was at the right place at the right time, and good ol\u2019David was back in the city, thinking he could tear the case apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you let him?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m so damned good. With Stella, the city was rising. I just walked right up behind her while she was peeking through the bushes-afraid of the cops! Killed her-and left her there for hours. Who knows? Maybe folks even saw her and thought she was a drunk, sleeping it off. I went back for her, and hell, yes, missy, I had a copy of the key to that place, too-that shoddy new museum where I left Stella. Of course, I took the tapes from the surveillance cameras.\u201d He paused to chuckle. \u201cI even called David Beckett to come see the crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny,\u201d Katie whispered. At least he was talking, at least she was playing for time.</p><p>\u201cDanny, well, that saddened me,\u201d Pete said regretfully. \u201cI thought I could bribe him to just stop playing around. He got interested in old curses and figured out that I was descended from Eli Smith. He thought that it was funny that the police lieutenant\u2019s ancestor was hanged for murder-funny! I tried to bribe him anonymously-couldn\u2019t work up enough anger to kill the guy and thought that a little money might satisfy him. It would have worked, too-Danny was never exactly what you\u2019d call ambitious! But then he saw me with Stella and I knew that he would start to put the pieces together. Danny wasn\u2019t ambitious, but he wasn\u2019t stupid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe left the money and the books-that\u2019s why you took your time getting a search warrant for his apartment, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I had to get in there first,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she asked softly.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Katie! Such a pretty, sweet thing! But he loves you, so...this is really the revenge I wanted. With Tanya, it was perfect-he had motive, he was young, he was big, he should have been angry. There\u2019s motive for you! And...he cared about her, but not the way he cares about you. That\u2019s too perfect. That\u2019s real revenge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete, Pete, think, you\u2019re a cop, they\u2019ll know it was you now!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m a cop, yes. And that\u2019s the point. We\u2019ve come full circle from the hanging tree, and now it can all rest. The past will really be avenged. And as to my position, it\u2019s perfect. And I am the best! I\u2019ve served this city. I\u2019ve been firm, and I\u2019ve been fair. I\u2019ve taken down some of the biggest drug lords to darken our door. And now, my life will be purged. Now, once Beckett is dead and he\u2019s history-a vicious killer brought down by the descendant of the man he wronged-I\u2019ll make history myself. I\u2019ll take the chief\u2019s place in a few years. And, in time, I\u2019ll run for office. I\u2019ll be governor, you\u2019ll see. My life is bigger than this small island. It\u2019s my destiny to carry out the curse. That\u2019s how powerful I really am!\u201d</p><p>He was serious. Dead serious. That was perhaps the most terrifying aspect of it all. He believed that he had been wronged. He probably had been a good cop-other than being a psycho murderer.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you hurting my brother?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cKatie O\u2019Hara! You don\u2019t know your history. Your brother\u2019s death adds so much to all this. Don\u2019t you know? Oh, please, you might have guessed. An O\u2019Hara was on the jury that denounced my ancestor, did you know that? An O\u2019Hara helped deliver a death sentence. So, well, I just hadn\u2019t expected quite this much justice, but it\u2019s all fallen in nicely.\u201d He lifted her head for her, twisting it so that she could see clearly.</p><p>She winced, trying not to cry out.</p><p>Sean looked like an oversize doll. He\u2019d been set up in a stand. He was lolled against it, still unconscious. He was wearing Tanzler\u2019s hat. Sean was tall and broad-shouldered. It must have irritated Pete that he couldn\u2019t possibly shove Sean into Carl Tanzler\u2019s much smaller clothing.</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d</p><p>She heard the soft whisper. Bartholomew was standing by her side. Behind him she could see Danny, Stella and Tanya.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying, Katie. Work your left wrist. We\u2019re trying...we\u2019re trying.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. Her head was killing her.</p><p>She wondered if she was going to join them soon.</p><p>Suddenly, something flew across the room and crashed against the wall. Pete Dryer spun around, his gun out. He fired shots into the wall, then he turned to face the dark corridor that led to the room.</p><p>\u201cBeckett! I know that you\u2019re out there!\u201d Dryer warned. \u201cShow yourself-or I\u2019ll shoot her in the kneecaps long before I put her out of her misery!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that will go unnoticed by law enforcement,\u201d David\u2019s voice called from the darkness beyond.</p><p>\u201cYou ass! I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Pete said.</p><p>David moved into view. He didn\u2019t look at Katie. She was certain that he didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>She felt movement at her wrist. She twisted it. The tie was loosening.</p> <p>\u201cShoot me, Pete-isn\u2019t that your plan?\u201d David asked.</p><p>Pete raised his gun. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>He fired.</p><p>But David wasn\u2019t there. There was a sound of exploding glass. Katie dimly realized that he had taken a mirror from one of the exhibits. Pete had shot at his reflection.</p><p>Something came flying into the room. It was a headstone from the Maine exhibit.</p><p>It caught Pete right in the chest, slamming him backward. She heard his gun fly-and crash into the floor.</p><p>Somewhere.</p><p>\u201cGet up, Katie, get up!\u201d Bartholomew urged her.</p><p>She wrenched her wrist free. Halfway up, she started tearing at the other tie herself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! David, there\u2019s another-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrip wire, I know!\u201d he shouted back to her.</p><p>Pete Dryer made a dive for the gun. David leapt the wire, and went flying down for it himself. Pete was closer.</p><p>He almost reached it.</p><p>But someone else was there.</p><p>Not Bartholomew. Not Tanya, or Stella.</p><p>She was Bartholomew\u2019s lady in white, the broken-hearted Lucinda, and she used a foot that was clad in a delicate white slipper to send the gun sliding farther back in the room. Katie freed her hand and leapt from the table.</p><p>Pete staggered up, ready to fly for the gun again.</p><p>But David was in a fury. He tackled Pete, bringing him facedown on the floor, sending his nose, chin and forehead into a hard thud against the wood. He slammed the man\u2019s head down again, and again, then jerked up to his feet, and slid back down to reach the gun.</p><p>He caught it.</p><p>Pete staggered up. David had the gun on him.</p><p>Pete started to lunge, but wavered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me shoot you, Pete. Don\u2019t,\u201d David said.</p><p>Pete\u2019s nose was bleeding profusely. He was bleeding from a gash on his forehead. He smiled.</p><p>He didn\u2019t go for David, and he didn\u2019t go for the gun.</p><p>He made a dive for the trip wire.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d David raged, flying after him.</p><p>\u201cGet up, all the way!\u201d Bartholomew screamed to Katie.</p><p>And she did so.</p><p>Just as her brother\u2019s trussed and propped-up arm came crashing down on the bed where she had lain. The sad marital bed of the long-dead Elena de Hoyos.</p><p>But it was empty.</p><p>And this time, David laid a punch into Pete Dryer with such a fierce anger that the man went down like a limp rag.</p><p>It would be a long while before he gained consciousness again.</p><p>Katie ran over to David, and threw herself into his arms. He held her against him as if she were as fragile as blown glass for a moment, then he crushed her to him and buried his head against her shoulder, trembling.</p><p>\u201cAmbulances, we have to get ambulances out here!\u201d Katie said.</p><p>David worked his mouth. \u201cLiam,\u201d was all that he said. And then managed, \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re on their way by now.\u201d</p><p>He was right. The night came alive with the sound of sirens.</p><p>Then a shout. \u201cDavid! David, where the hell are you?\u201d his cousin shouted.</p><p>\u201cUp here!\u201d David yelled in return. There was a clatter in the entry below as Pete Dryer\u2019s trip-wire sound alarm went off. There were footsteps hurrying up the stairs.</p><p>David was staring in the shadows over Katie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>She spun around.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d David said. \u201cThank you, all of you.\u201d</p><p>They were all there. Bartholomew, Danny, Stella and Tanya.</p><p>Bartholomew swept off his hat and bowed elegantly. \u201cAh, yes, well, I owed a debt of gratitude to the Becketts, you know. And the O\u2019Haras.\u201d</p><p>Tanya\u2019s spirit stepped nimbly past Bartholomew. She came to David, and Katie. She touched their cheeks.</p><p>She faded as she did so.</p><p>Then Stella was gone.</p><p>Then Danny.</p><p>\u201cBartholomew!\u201d Katie whispered.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He stepped past them all, and Katie saw that his lady in white, Lucinda, was waiting for him on the other side of the room. He took her hands in his own.</p><p>\u201cDear lady, what a lovely, feisty creature you\u2019ve proven to be! Lucinda, I\u2019m Bartholomew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, Katie!\u201d Liam was there, with officers behind him. The room became flooded with light. \u201cMedics, get the medics up here!\u201d he roared.</p><p>The worst of it all, to Sean, since they had all survived, was the humiliation.</p><p>Katie was released from the hospital in the early hours of the following morning.</p><p>Sean was not.</p><p>But Katie wasn\u2019t going to leave him.</p><p>He was bandaged in a massive turban, and though his skull hadn\u2019t been crushed, he had stitches that ranged over a large mass of it.</p><p>\u201cI beat Sam practically to a pulp-did that bastard\u2019s work for him, and sat there like a sitting duck while he creamed me!\u201d he told Katie and David from his hospital bed. Then he mused, \u201cHow the hell could he have been so damned crazy, and none of us known it?\u201d he demanded, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how we didn\u2019t see so many of the clues staring us straight in the face,\u201d David told him. \u201cAnd you did what you thought you had to do-you defended your sister. Sam appeared to be the real enemy. Who the hell could know?\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded bleakly, and looked at his sister. \u201cYou saved our lives, Katie. We\u2019d have died for sure if you hadn\u2019t kept us from suffocating in those bags.\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew was seated in the one big chair in the room while David stood and Katie perched on the end of her brother\u2019s bed.</p><p>He sniffed loudly. \u201cExcuse me, but I do believe I get a little of the credit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hug you if I could,\u201d Katie told him.</p><p>\u201cAlmost-I\u2019m getting there,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cLook, you can all talk this out until you turn blue in the face. No one will ever be able to understand the human mind.\u201d He waved a hand in the air. \u201cLiam is down at the station now, where he will be for hours on end, filling out paperwork, and filling in the gaps from all the statements that were taken last night.\u201d He pointed a finger at Katie. \u201cYou two-go home. Get rest. I\u2019ll be looking after Sean. Have you seen your brother\u2019s notes? He wants to get David in with him and start filming the shipwrecks of the Keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s marvelous! He\u2019ll stay home,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s talking to herself again,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s talking to Bartholomew,\u201d David corrected.</p><p>Sean\u2019s jaw dropped. He stared at his sister. Katie shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, you can see him, too?\u201d Sean asked David.</p><p>David shook his head regretfully. \u201cNo-but I did see him, for a brief minute last night. He\u2019s real, and he\u2019s looking out for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Katie grinned, patting his leg. \u201cSean, cool.

Tanya, Stella and Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Stella and Danny were together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Tanya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.

We don\u2019t forget those who mean everything to us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He looked over at her, a slanted smile cutting his features.</p><p>\u201cBecause love is our finest human emotion,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd losing it is the true depths of hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely,\u201d she said.</p><p>He pulled off the road suddenly, turned to her and took her hands. \u201cKatie, I know that I\u2019ve barely had time to really get to know you, for you to have time to know the real me. Your brother asked me my intentions. Well, my intentions are to stay here. To be with you.
