More emotion. More excitement. Just more. But she didn\u2019t know what.</p><p>Her dress was gorgeous. The elegant hotel, all decorated in wedding regalia, looked stunning. No doubt, her groom-to-be had dressed impeccably for the occasion. The sky above Manhattan was a cloudless, perfect blue. Five hundred of the country\u2019s wealthiest and most influential people waited to see her walk down the aisle in the Plaza\u2019s grand ballroom. It was a dream wedding, but the encroaching panic made it feel more like her nightmare.</p><p>Was it too late to run screaming down Fifth Avenue?</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure you want to wear that dress?\u201d Becks asked, standing behind her and eyeing her critically.</p><p>Kinley sighed. It was a good thing her father hadn\u2019t remarried and brought a wicked stepmother into her life. She hardly needed a hypercritical parent when she had her sister. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>There was always something wrong, according to Beckin Kohl Abernathy. Admittedly, her sister was one of the most prominent fashion plates in New York. Society looked to Becks for style advice, while those same women, along with the tabloids, mostly called Kinley unpleasantly plump.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t get me wrong, hon. The dress is fabulous.\u201d Becks gave her a little half hug, careful not to crush or ruffle her perfectly coiffed platinum hair. It was longer in the front than the back and had an asymmetry that accentuated her high cheekbones and drew attention to her well-glossed lips.</p><p>\u201cIt just seems a little...snug.\u201d Becks gave a delicate wince. \u201cDid you and Greg decide to start your family early?\u201d</p> <p>Kinley turned on her sister, feeling her face flush with humiliation. \u201cI\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d</p><p>In fact, what Becks suggested was impossible. She and Greg had never shared a bed. Actually, Kinley had never had sex with anyone. And now, she was about to become a virgin sacrifice to help the family she loved. Of course, it would be easier to feel good about this whole choice if her sister wasn\u2019t quite so judgmental.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess stress eating with such a big wedding is understandable.\u201d Becks sent her a tight smile of sympathy. \u201cBut unadvisable. Don\u2019t frown. I\u2019m only saying that for your own good. The press is already unkind to you.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled Kinley\u2019s eyes. She had eaten only protein shakes, brown rice, and fish for three weeks. She\u2019d lost thirteen pounds so she could fit perfectly into this dress. She thought it had worked...until now. \u201cI want to be alone, Becks.\u201d</p><p>Her sister sighed, brushing imaginary lint from the sleek gray sheath she\u2019d selected for the bridesmaids. Kinley had wanted a soft pink, but Becks had insisted that her choice was much more elegant. Her older sister had a way of getting what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you on your wedding day when I know you\u2019re already nervous. I\u2019m sorry, Kinley. I\u2019m being a bitch. Don\u2019t mind me. I\u2019m sure Greg will think you look lovely.\u201d</p> <p>But now she couldn\u2019t look at herself and not see the slight curve of her stomach that no amount of dieting ever eradicated. She wasn\u2019t a size six. Hell, she wasn\u2019t even a ten. The dress had been custom made because it didn\u2019t come in her size. She sniffled a little.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Kin.\u201d Becks grabbed a tissue and handed it to her. \u201cThis is your wedding day, and you\u2019re marrying the richest guy we know. What could you possibly have to cry about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love him.\u201d There she\u2019d said it. She was shocked everyone hadn\u2019t guessed. Her father kind of knew, but he was ignoring it. Becks couldn\u2019t possibly think she loved Greg. They had nothing in common, but each had something the other needed.</p><p>Becks rolled her eyes and crossed the room to reach for the champagne sitting by her bouquet. \u201cIs that all? No woman I know loves her husband, at least no one in our world.\u201d</p><p>That stunned Kinley. She\u2019d always wondered, but... \u201cNot even you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d With a surprisingly unladylike snort, her sister rolled her eyes. \u201cAfter Brian and I got married, I tossed out my birth control. The key to my future was in spitting out a couple of kids and tying him up legally. Even if he starts thinking with his pecker and tries to trade me in for a younger model, he\u2019s going to pay handsomely for the privilege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecks, how could you think like that?\u201d Children weren\u2019t to be used for a payday.</p><p>Then Kinley started imagining her own children. Panic engulfed her again. She couldn\u2019t imagine being pregnant by Greg. She couldn\u2019t even imagine sleeping with him, like married people were supposed to do. And by sleeping, she was sure that Greg expected something more active than snoring.</p> <p>Kinley gulped back her nerves. He was good-looking, but she wasn\u2019t attracted. Did that make any sense? How could she have babies with someone she had no interest in touching intimately?</p><p>Becks gave her a dazzling grin. \u201cIt was hell for a few years, but the nanny certainly helped. My personal trainer whipped my body back into shape, and it was bye-bye pregnancy pounds. Then when the kids turned six, I shipped them off to boarding school. Now, life is grand again. My two angels are practically my retirement fund.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cIf Brian wants a divorce, he\u2019ll have to pay through the nose before he sees his kids again. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve kept my hand wrapped firmly around his balls. Oh, his dick probably runs around on me, but as long as I have his testicles, he\u2019s not going anywhere. You should take a page out of my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That parody of marriage wasn\u2019t at all what Kinley had in mind. Shouldn\u2019t \u201c'til death do us part\u201d be about commitment and devotion? \u201cThat\u2019s you, Becks. Mom loved Dad.\u201d</p><p>Kinley wished her mother were still here. Mom would never have allowed either of her daughters to marry someone they couldn\u2019t give their hearts to. Her father was a wonderful man, but...he was weak. Though the situation wasn\u2019t entirely his fault, he\u2019d put her in a position that basically forced her to marry Greg. If she didn\u2019t, they would all be ruined.</p><p>\u201cNot in the beginning,\u201d Becks said. \u201cYou have this silly, white-lace ideal of their marriage, but Daddy married Mom because Granddaddy told him that if he didn\u2019t, Daddy was getting cut off. Aunt Mayrene gave me the whole story. Daddy ran off to become an artist and ran right back three weeks later and proposed. He liked the art part, but apparently he didn\u2019t love the starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeil and Sharon Landry are in love.\u201d They were the sweetest couple she knew. They sent out the loveliest Christmas cards with all four of their kids dressed in red sweaters while Neil and Sharon held up mistletoe and kissed. She\u2019d looked at that last card and wondered if she would ever be so in love.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fucking his barely legal nurse, Kins,\u201d Becks said, wrinkling her nose. \u201cHow did you not hear about that? It\u2019s all over town. And for a highly respected obstetrician, I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s rough on that girl\u2019s vagina, if you know what I mean. You would think since he\u2019s got his hands shoved up them all day that he would be a little more tender.\u201d</p><p>But Neil and Sharon had looked so happy. Blinking mutely, Kinley gaped at her sister, trying to process this ugly underside to marriage. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>Becks held her glass of champagne up in an ironic toast. \u201cThat\u2019s life, sister. The love thing is for people without money. Two nobodies without a cent to rub between them are perfectly free to fall in love and get married and have a cluster of children because nothing is at stake.\u201d</p><p>Kinley turned slowly because her dress was still a teensy bit tight and grabbed her phone like a comfort object. \u201cHello, Ms. Hypocrite. I\u2019m a nobody without any money now. Or have you forgotten?\u201d</p><p>Their father had lost everything in a Ponzi scheme. For two hundred years, the Kohls had acquired money, property, and political power. Her father had lost it all in the blink of an eye. Then he\u2019d gotten sick, and the need for money had become critical.</p><p>\u201cNo, you are not.\u201d Becks wagged a finger at her. \u201cYou\u2019re an heiress. You inherited a majestic and vastly respected name that\u2019s valuable to a man like Greg. Because of you, the doors to every old-money house on the East Coast will be open to him.\u201d</p><p>Her name was all she had, and she was basically selling it. \u201cI don\u2019t have to do this. I could get a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what? You have a degree in art history.\u201d</p><p>It had seemed like a good idea at the time, but then she\u2019d never thought she would need an actual job. \u201cI could work for a nonprofit. I\u2019ve run our charities ever since Mom died.\u201d</p><p>And now that money was running out rapidly. The economy had gone south, and demand for assistance among the poor had grown. Greg said he\u2019d endow the charity her mother had started with fifty million dollars after their honeymoon. He\u2019d already started making business connections for her, including several manufacturers willing to donate clothes for the organization at cost. He had also instituted some changes in the way the charity ran that he swore would make them more efficient so she could get more aid to the people who needed it. And he was willing to pay for her father\u2019s medical treatment and support her whole family. All she had to do was marry him and become his smiling hostess.</p><p>Fifty million dollars bought a lot of clothes and coats for inner-city and rural kids. People were counting on her, and all this wanting \u201cmore\u201d and pining for love was hopelessly selfish.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sweet thought,\u201d Becks said. \u201cBut working at a nonprofit wouldn\u2019t pay enough. This is the only way. I\u2019d help if I could, but since I\u2019m already married, walking down the aisle with a really rich, handsome guy falls to you. Poor Kins.\u201d She winked. \u201cBrian\u2019s business does okay, and you know I\u2019ll kick in what I can, but...times are tough all around. You understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Becks had a point. Kinley just didn\u2019t like it. She sighed and forced herself to face reality. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. For a minute there, I thought you were going to be unreasonable.\u201d Becks sipped her champagne. \u201cAre you waiting on a call?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her phone again, just like she did every couple of minutes. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just habit.\u201d</p><p>Becks\u2019s eyebrow rose. \u201cReally? Who\u2019s Michael?\u201d</p><p>Someone I\u2019ve been wishing I could talk to all morning.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a business contact.\u201d Becks didn\u2019t have to say anything. Kinley felt herself withering under her sister\u2019s judgmental stare. \u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. I\u2019ve never even met the man. How do you know his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I saw it on your phone earlier. He\u2019s sent you a lot of texts. And he\u2019s either called you or you\u2019ve called him at least once a day for the last week. This sounds like more than business. How do you think it would make Greg feel to know his fianc\u00e9e is consorting with another man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spied on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your sister. When, in all of the years you\u2019ve known me, have I ever respected things like privacy? It\u2019s a sister\u2019s right to snoop.\u201d She grinned. \u201cSo are you fucking him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Like I said, I\u2019ve never actually met him. He\u2019s starting a charity on the West Coast. He contacted me for some advice, and we started talking. He\u2019s a nice guy. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>No way was she going to admit that she thought about Mike from California way too much. And yes, she\u2019d been looking down at her phone, hoping he would call. Hearing his voice had become something she looked forward to everyday because it made her smile. God, she was pathetic.</p><p>Becks shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t screw up the chance to be rich again for some guy you\u2019ve never met. You know how much Daddy is depending on you.\u201d</p><p>And that was why she still stood here instead of giving into the impulse to fly out to California and meet Mike. Everyone was counting on her. She couldn\u2019t abandon the future she had planned for a man she\u2019d only known a week. Mike seemed wonderfully down-to-earth, and Kinley enjoyed talking to him\u2014but that had to be it. Somehow, she had to stop hearing his gravelly, rough-and-tumble voice in her dreams. Heck, she didn\u2019t even know what the man looked like, but she got a little giddy every time he called. Mike always put her at ease. With him, she felt interesting\u2014and oddly cared for. Their relationship didn\u2019t mean anything and it was fleeting. Once his charity was up and running, she would have no more reason to talk to him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t looking forward to that day.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m not screwing anything up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear. Keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded on the door adjoining her suite with the one next door.</p><p>Becks ignored it. \u201cI\u2019m going to call the caterers and make sure the cake is ready. Is that all your luggage? It needs to be ready since you\u2019re not coming back here after the ceremony.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d Kinley made her way across the suite in her heavy wedding gown and opened the adjoining door.</p><p>Her best friend Annabelle, who had stayed next door last night, walked in\u2014or tried. She was wearing the sheath Becks had selected, too. While the gray looked lovely against her caf\u00e9 au lait skin, unfortunately Annabelle possessed curves like Kinley\u2019s. The dress didn\u2019t camouflage a thing.</p><p>\u201cHi. How are you holding up?\u201d Her friend\u2019s pretty round face, framed by dark curls, softened with an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m...\u201d Having really cold feet and wishing my sister would shut the hell up. \u201cFine.\u201d Kinley forced herself to grin back.</p> <p>No sense in dragging Belle into her misery. Besides, her friend would only pounce on it.</p><p>Kinley glanced back at the Louis Vuitton vintage luggage that had been a gift from her fianc\u00e9. It was beautiful, and she\u2019d gasped and teared up a little when he\u2019d first given her the two trunks, two roller bags, and a brand new oversized shoulder bag that had a name, the Metis. She\u2019d liked the jeans and blouses he\u2019d sent along with them, although it wasn\u2019t what she normally wore. Someone with an ass her size didn\u2019t need to draw attention to it with a bunch of bling all over the back pockets. But her trunks and cases were all packed up and lined in a row. The Metis had a little stowaway in it, too.</p><p>\u201cYes, everything\u2019s packed and ready to go,\u201d Kinley answered dutifully. She\u2019d spent an enormous amount of time packing. Greg had left her a list and then there was Gigi to think about. Gigi had a very sensitive stomach. She wasn\u2019t about to hope a tropical island had the food her dog was used to. If Gigi missed a meal, the world knew it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re taking everything Greg asked about?\u201d Becks asked with a frown. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to disappoint him on your honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>Her husband-to-be had given her a list of essentials that he expected her to pack. \u201cI\u2019ve got everything. I\u2019m a good girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are. Ta-ta, sister.\u201d With a jaunty little wave, Becks slipped out and closed the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou know I call her Skeletor behind her back,\u201d Belle said with a grimace.</p><p>Repugnance shone in her dark eyes, hidden behind chunky librarian glasses. She tucked back a strand of her raven black hair. \u201cI would say it to her face, but I tend to avert my stare. I\u2019ve heard some Medusa-like stories about looking into your sister\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so bad, Belle.\u201d She held her hands out, and Belle took them immediately. Becks might be her sister by blood, but Belle was the sister of her heart. Since they\u2019d been little girls, Belle had stood beside her. Even though Kinley\u2019s family had been Belle\u2019s mother\u2019s employer, class hadn\u2019t meant anything to either one of them.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the mean one, Kinley. You\u2019re just too good to see it.\u201d She stood back and shook her head. \u201cYou look so beautiful. If your mama could see you now, she would have cried.\u201d</p><p>Kinley had really needed to hear that today. \u201cThank you. I have to admit, I\u2019m going to be really happy when this whole wedding thing is all over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would be happier if we left and headed for Vegas right now. Come on. Let\u2019s Thelma &amp; Louise this sucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd drive off the side of the Grand Canyon?\u201d The thought horrified Kinley.</p><p>\u201cIt would be better than marrying Greg Jansen. Before you do this, I really wish you would just meet with the private investigator\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m getting married in less than an hour. Don\u2019t bring this up again. I\u2019m marrying Greg.\u201d She had to.</p><p>Belle sighed. \u201cHas Mike called lately?\u201d</p><p>She should never have told Belle about him. \u201cHe\u2019s just a work peer. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to him for three hours one night, and I doubt it was all about tax exempt status and donation channels. I think you like him.\u201d</p><p>She did. \u201cBut that\u2019s no reason to call off the wedding, Belle. Come on...\u201d</p> <p>Her rapport with Mike had started out all business with a few calls. She\u2019d talked about how her mom had set up Hope House and what it had meant to her to help her mother with a cause so meaningful. Before long, Mike told her about his military service and his desire to start a charity with his brothers for wounded soldiers and their families. After a couple of talks that strayed more into the personal, she\u2019d begun looking forward to hearing his voice over the line.</p><p>One night she\u2019d spent three hours on the phone with him, rapt and fascinated. He\u2019d admitted that he wasn\u2019t married or even dating now because what he really wanted was a woman to share with his brothers.</p><p>Kinley had been shocked. And utterly intrigued.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t even think about this again. She had to marry Greg. Her father\u2019s chemo bills were stacking up, and he didn\u2019t need the added stress of wondering where the money was going to come from. He was so embarrassed by his weakness and distressed about it all that he wouldn\u2019t even allow her to go with him to his therapy sessions. And with her charity about to go belly up, Kinley needed the money, too. She couldn\u2019t allow years of her mother\u2019s good work to end.</p><p>So she had to sacrifice and do what thousands of women had done before her. She had to keep her chin up and make the best of things. \u201cI love Greg.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell Belle that she was basically prostituting herself. Besides, if she said it enough, maybe she could make it true. Kinley was a great believer in affirmations. If that didn\u2019t work...maybe Becks was right, and no one was really happy in marriage. Maybe all a woman could do was put on a smile the same way she affixed her makeup.</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d Belle rolled her eyes, then looked around the room. \u201cWhere\u2019s Gigi?\u201d</p><p>Her little Yorkie baby had shown her deep disdain for the proceedings by crawling into Kinley\u2019s Louis Vuitton bag and settling down for a nap. Gigi had taken an almost instant dislike to Greg and everyone on his side of the wedding party. At first, Kinley had thought it would be fun to include her little dog in the ceremony, but Gigi had refused to go anywhere near her fianc\u00e9. \u201cShe\u2019s asleep. She had a rough night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she did. She growled at Greg all through the rehearsal dinner. Your dog is very smart.\u201d</p><p>Kinley wanted to cry. She was utterly and completely alone, and arguing with her best friend in the world sent her into a tailspin. \u201cI wish you could accept that Greg is going to be a part of my life.\u201d</p><p>Belle leaned in. \u201cAre you doing this because you need a man? I can get you one. If you\u2019re not interested in California Mike, I can find you the hottest man who will rock your world. Then you will forget you ever heard the name Greg Jansen. As a matter of fact, I could find you two or three amazing guys. I could get them here really fast, too.\u201d</p><p>She wondered what Mike and his brothers looked like and wished she could see them just once and indulge in a moment of fantasy before she had to face reality again.</p><p>Kinley turned back to the mirror because she couldn\u2019t stand to look at Belle when she was lying through her teeth. \u201cI only want Greg.\u201d</p><p>Two or three hot guys might light up her world for a night, but all her responsibilities would still be waiting the next day. She just had to accept that sexual desire wasn\u2019t in the cards for her.</p><p>\u201cKinley, I don\u2019t understand. When we were kids and we were planning out our weddings, I ask you to describe your groom. Do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that you wanted to marry Leonardo DiCaprio.\u201d They had watched Titanic about a hundred times that year and she\u2019d cried every single time. What would have happened to Rose and Jack if he\u2019d lived? Would she have regretted leaving the money behind? Would Rose have been able to live with the ruin it would have brought her family?</p><p>Or would she have been happy to have lived with her soul mate?</p><p>There were tears in Belle\u2019s eyes as she forced Kinley to turn. \u201cYes, I was very picky back then. But you weren\u2019t. You only had one requirement. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it didn\u2019t matter how he looked or how much money he had as long as he was a good man.\u201d Which just showed how young she was. Na\u00efve. God, she wanted to be that little girl again.</p><p>\u201cGreg Jansen is not a good man, Kinley.\u201d She whispered the words as though they had some kind of power, as though she prayed they would make their way into Kinley\u2019s heart.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let them in.</p><p>Kinley broke away and turned back to the mirror, forcing down the need to cry. She didn\u2019t want to lose Belle, but it looked like she might. \u201cThe feds cleared Greg of all charges. And I don\u2019t care about how good he is. He\u2019s going to be my husband. Have you seen all the gifts he\u2019s already given me?\u201d</p><p>A long sigh came from Belle and her oldest friend hugged her from behind. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d She put her head on Kinley\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI wish I was more than a secretary so I could bail you out of this mess.\u201d</p><p>Relief swept over her. Maybe she didn\u2019t have to tell Belle a thing. \u201cYou understand?\u201d</p><p>Her best friend\u2019s face softened. \u201cI know you feel like you have to marry him. I think it\u2019s wrong and you deserve better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d She sniffled a little. It would be horrible if Belle walked out.</p><p>Belle took her hand, giving it a hearty squeeze. \u201cBecause we made a promise. I will love you forever. You are my best friend and that will never change. I will forgive you for the stupid things you do and I will be there to help you hide the bodies. God, Kin, call me when you need to bury Greg. I will come with a shovel and a bottle of tequila.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little but shook her head. Once she said \u201cI do,\u201d she was in it for life. No matter what Becks or Belle said, Kinley was going to make her marriage work. Even if she worried that her husband was a major douchebag.</p><p>Belle peered closer at her. \u201cYou look pale. You\u2019re not eating, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a light breakfast.\u201d Of course it was almost three o\u2019clock now, and all she\u2019d had today was a grapefruit. With a little bit of sugar, and she\u2019d felt guilty about that.</p><p>\u201cI speak Kinley so I know what that means. You had next to nothing. I\u2019m calling room service.\u201d Belle moved toward the phone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m getting married in an hour. I can\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating is normal. You have to do it or you\u2019re going to pass out.\u201d</p><p>She did feel a little faint, but... \u201cI will after the ceremony. It\u2019s just...Becks said the dress looks too tight. I don\u2019t want to be the fat bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. Becks planted that idea in your head because she\u2019s a heinous bitch. You\u2019re perfect the way you are. Seriously, you have a whole ceremony and pictures to get through. It could be hours before you get to eat again, so I\u2019m going to make sure you do it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelle, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. I\u2019m your best friend. I\u2019m going to watch out for you.\u201d She picked up the phone. \u201cYes, we\u2019re in suite 2010. That\u2019s right the Presidential Suite. We need a couple of burgers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA salad.\u201d If she ate a burger, she would split her dress open. But a burger sounded so good. \u201cNo dressing.\u201d</p><p>Belle rolled her eyes. \u201cA salad with grilled chicken and vinaigrette on the side. And a burger, medium with fries, and two Diet Cokes.\u201d She hung up. \u201cI will get some of those fries down your throat.\u201d She stopped for a moment. \u201cYou know I love you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She counted on it. Sometimes the only thing in the world she could count on was Belle\u2019s friendship. \u201cPlease understand that we all have to do what we feel is best.\u201d</p><p>Her lips turned down in an almost sad expression. \u201cThat\u2019s true. I just need you to know that I want only the best for you.\u201d</p><p>Belle\u2019s cell trilled.</p><p>\u201cYou should answer that,\u201d Kinley said. Belle called herself \u201cjust a secretary,\u201d but Kinley knew that she valued her job\u2014and the three lawyers she worked for. She ran their office like clockwork and had for the last year.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kellan,\u201d Belle said apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re working on a big murder case. Do you mind? I\u2019ll probably have to run back to my room because my files are there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d She was glad Belle had a career she loved.</p><p>The door closed behind her best friend. Someday one of those three lawyers she worked for was going to wake up and see what a huge catch Belle was. She\u2019d met Kellan, Eric, and Tate. They were gorgeous and smart, and any one of them would be a great husband for Belle.</p><p>Or all three.</p><p>Kinley let her head fall back. She had to let that notion go, but the idea of those three hot lawyers just played in her head. It wasn\u2019t that she thought they were right for her\u2014they had their eyes on Belle\u2014but the idea of being surrounded by strong men just did it for Kinley. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She loved her dad. She really did, but she\u2019d watched her mom have to be the strong one all her life. Certainly, it wasn\u2019t wrong to wish for something more...</p><p>Was Greg capable of loving and protecting her? She worried about that...</p><p>Staring at the woman in the mirror, Kinley acknowledged that she was his entr\u00e9e into old-money society, a second chance for Greg Jansen. His first wife had been a model. Carrie Anthony had been beautiful and successful. As far as Kinley could tell, she\u2019d become a star. Then mental illness had tragically cut her life short.</p><p>Two months after their marriage, she\u2019d killed herself.</p> <p>But Kinley wasn\u2019t that girl. She was strong. She didn\u2019t run away from her responsibilities. Once she said \u201cI do,\u201d she would be there forever.</p><p>Kinley turned back to the mirror and straightened her dress. It was almost time to start the rest of her life. Nothing could save her from it now.</p><p>Through the hidden cameras they\u2019d planted in the suite the night before, Dominic Anthony stared at the blonde in the wedding dress on the screen. After a few minutes of surveillance, he knew that the gorgeous bride had a pretty heart-shaped face and a juicy hourglass figure. Too bad she was a money-grubbing whore.</p><p>\u201cThere. I think I fixed the audio. Is the sound in the suite back on?\u201d Riley asked, looking up from his computer, already dressed in the black and white uniform of room service staff.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Dom nodded.</p> <p>\u201cGood. Shitty that it crapped out through that whole conversation with her sister,\u201d Riley groused.</p><p>Dominic didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d doubted they\u2019d missed much. Everything was in place now. Years of planning was finally coming together. So why did he have a deep pit in his stomach, a feeling of gnawing anxiety as he listened.</p><p>\u201cOh, the audio is definitely working again. She\u2019s talking about how much she loves the creep.\u201d And Dominic couldn\u2019t stand it. Somehow hearing her say she loved a hardened criminal made his skin crawl.</p><p>He almost wished Riley wasn\u2019t so good at his job. To be honest, he\u2019d enjoyed just watching the blonde. She was so freaking beautiful. Her seeming innocence made her look like a girl who would appreciate a man\u2019s\u2014or men\u2019s\u2014comfort and protection. But the second Riley had restored the sound, the words that had come out of the bride\u2019s mouth proved the image was all false.</p><p>I don\u2019t care about how good he is. He\u2019s going to be my husband. Have you seen all the gifts he\u2019s already given me?</p><p>And to think he\u2019d mooned over her for even a second. He was a stupid ass. He\u2019d seen Kinley Kohl\u2019s picture and half fallen in love with her sweet face and banging body on the spot. Blonde curls and caramel brown eyes, and that husky voice that went straight to his cock.</p> <p>But she couldn\u2019t wait to jump into bed with Satan, so she was pretty much on the \u201cno touch\u201d list.</p><p>Still, he was going to do what he must in order to save her life. She wasn\u2019t going to die like his baby sister had. Greg Jansen was going to pay for his crimes\u2014and Kinley Kohl was the key.</p><p>Law Anders stepped up and looked at the screen. He was wearing the same starched uniform as his brother. It was almost go time. \u201cDoes that mean she\u2019s stopped talking about how fat she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dominic scowled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just before all that crap about loving Jansen.\u201d Law made gagging sounds. \u201cI heard everything she said to both her sister and Annabelle. I don\u2019t get it. She\u2019s gorgeous. How can anyone think she\u2019s fat? I swear, my hand is itching.\u201d</p><p>Law liked to spank women, especially pretty women who mouthed off about how unattractive they were. Kinley Kohl was practically his perfect woman. Fuck, she was practically all of their perfect woman, if only her heart was half as sweet as her looks. But no. She was willing to marry a violent killer because he bought her some luggage.</p><p>\u201cFocus, man,\u201d Dominic barked. \u201cShe\u2019s talked a lot about how much shit Jansen\u2019s bought her.\u201d</p><p>Law frowned, his eyes never leaving the screen. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s an act. She\u2019s scared. She needs us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane, Law. Delusional.\u201d</p><p>He stared at his friend. Law Anders was supposed to be the surly one. He mostly communicated in growls and snarls, but ever since Dominic had put him on the surveillance of Kinley Kohl, he\u2019d been all complete sentences and smiles. Oh, his lips didn\u2019t curl up much, and he looked a little like he was in pain, but for Law, that was a brilliant grin.</p><p>Riley stared at his older brother. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you, Law. You know who she is.\u201d</p><p>So they\u2019d had conversations. Dominic had wondered about that. Riley and Law Anders were the closest thing he had to a family because he\u2019d more or less grown up with the brothers.</p><p>He\u2019d helped Riley get into Harvard and they\u2019d attended the Ivy League institution together for a time. When patriotic duty had called, Dominic had gone off to the military. Law had joined up, too. Before it was all over, Law had taken an IED and lost function of his legs, so Dominic had left the service to come home and help the men he considered his brothers. Law was a tough son of a bitch. Even after the doctors had told him he would never walk again, he was up and running eighteen months later. Now Anthony Anders was one of the premier investigative firms in the country. They worked for law firms and police departments.</p><p>But this case was personal.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the target,\u201d Dominic said in no uncertain terms. \u201cShe\u2019s the woman who\u2019s going to give us all the ammunition we need to finally prove what kind of a man Greg Jansen is.\u201d</p><p>The kind willing to kill a woman for money, Dominic thought in a rage. Even a woman as sweet as his sister.</p><p>The time had come to avenge Carrie by beating Jansen at his own game. And Kinley Kohl was his sledgehammer. He had everything he needed with the singular exception of a witness. After today, problem solved. He\u2019d do whatever it took to make Kinley spill everything she knew until she practically sang. What he didn\u2019t need was Law falling in lust with her.</p><p>Even though it would be a really easy thing to do.</p><p>\u201cYou guys haven\u2019t been watching and talking to her the way I have.\u201d Law\u2019s eyes never left the screen. \u201cShe has little tells. She smiles a little too brightly when she\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has different smiles?\u201d Riley asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Law replied. \u201cAnd she\u2019s using her fake smile now. Watch the difference between the one she uses on our little Benedict Arnold and her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, she\u2019s trying to help Kinley.\u201d Dominic wasn\u2019t going to let Law throw Annabelle Wright under the bus. She was a hell of a woman, choosing to do something brave and save her friend\u2019s life. \u201cIf Annabelle hadn\u2019t agreed to intervene, do you really think Kinley would have come back from her honeymoon alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying we should let her marry the fucker,\u201d Law replied. \u201cI just wish you would let me talk to her instead of carrying through with this crazy plan. She\u2019s a smart woman. She\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>Dominic seriously doubted that. \u201cLike she\u2019s been listening to Annabelle all this time? She\u2019s a socialite who takes lunches and goes to charity balls. How fucking intellectual can she be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s raised millions of dollars for the homeless. And those lunches she takes are usually about her charity.\u201d</p><p>He hated to burst Law\u2019s bubble because the guy so rarely had a positive outlook on anything, but he had to do it. \u201cHer charity is on the brink of ruin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of her father.\u201d Law could also be a little like a pit bull with a nice hunk of meat when he decided something. He never fucking let go.</p><p>But Dominic needed Law on his side. \u201cHer gambling father who\u2019s run the whole family into the ground. Yeah, and she just keeps feeding him money. She\u2019s giving him funds earmarked for warm coats and shoes for poor children. She\u2019s probably hoarding some herself for shopping sprees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got her all wrong.\u201d Law\u2019s jaw squared, and Dominic just knew he wasn\u2019t going to like what his best friend was about to say. \u201cI think she\u2019s the one for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Riley put a hand to his head, shaking it as though he couldn\u2019t believe what his brother had just said.</p><p>Dominic felt his blood pressure tick up. \u201cAre you fucking crazy?\u201d</p><p>Law held out his hands in defense. \u201cJust listen to me. She\u2019s not what you think she is. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s marrying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor his money,\u201d Dominic shot back.</p><p>Law ran a frustrated hand on top of the dark stubble of his buzz cut. \u201cYeah, but the money isn\u2019t for her. I think she\u2019s trying to save her family. You should know something about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never spread my legs to save my sister.\u201d What he didn\u2019t say was that he would have. He would have done anything to save Carrie. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the same thing at all. She\u2019s marrying for money because her father gambled everything away. You are willfully misjudging her because you want to fuck her. Do I need to take you off this case? You\u2019re either with me or against me, brother.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he would do without Law. Riley was the computer genius, but Law was really smart muscle. He\u2019d come to rely on the man\u2019s instincts, his training, his sheer tenacity. His friendship.</p><p>But he owed it to Carrie to succeed. He couldn\u2019t allow Law\u2019s obvious attraction to Kinley Kohl to stand in the way of justice.</p><p>He could still hear his sister\u2019s whispers on his voice mail.</p><p>Dom, I need to talk to you as soon as possible. Please call me back. It\u2019s all going wrong. I\u2019m leaving Greg. I think he\u2019s...I have to go. He\u2019s here. Call me.</p><p>He\u2019d been off with Riley and Law, screwing some brunette he\u2019d met at a bar while his sister was being murdered.</p><p>Law\u2019s face cleared, becoming a polite blank. \u201cOf course not. I know how much this means to you. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from the monitors, all excitement gone. Law was a predator again, cold and unfeeling. Exactly what Dominic needed. So why did he feel like he\u2019d just taken something precious from his friend?</p><p>Riley leaned in. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, man. We\u2019re both here for you. She\u2019s just his type, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Pretty, blonde, and stacked was just about every man\u2019s type, but he\u2019d never seen Law react so fiercely to a woman. What had he learned about her that Dominic hadn\u2019t?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. Getting her isolated and making her talk did.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got movement. Annabelle just rang for room service. That\u2019s our cue. She\u2019ll make sure Kinley is alone in that suite for the next fifteen minutes.\u201d Riley turned back to him. \u201cWho\u2019s ready to roofie a blonde? This guy. Come on, Law, you can stare at her boobs up close.\u201d</p><p>Law sent his brother his happy middle finger. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done.\u201d</p><p>Dominic put a hand on Law\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hurt her. We\u2019re saving her.\u201d She might not thank him for it, but... \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Law nodded, but Dominic wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cSure. We need to go. See you at the extraction point.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes Law sounded like he was still in the military. He and Riley walked out.</p><p>Dominic turned back to the screen. Kinley was a gorgeous woman, and he had a wistful, fleeting thought that it would have been nice if she had been the one woman who could love all three of them. The woman who could become the center of their world.</p><p>She turned, her face so sad, so beautiful that he nearly reached out and touched the screen.</p><p>He growled a little as he turned away and started wiping the room clean. He didn\u2019t have time for bullshit. He had a killer to catch.</p><p>And a hostage to nab.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cI deserve to find happiness.\u201d Kinley forced herself to take a deep breath as she paced the floor in her white, four-inch Manolo Blahniks. \u201cGreg will be my happiness and my joy.\u201d</p><p>The room responded with an echo of utter silence. Yeah, no one believed that, not even the walls.</p><p>Was this how she would spend the rest of her life? Would she wake every morning and try to convince herself that she was happy and fulfilled? Since she was a kid, she and Annabelle had a ritual before big events like Christmas, birthdays, and big dates. They would get together and hold hands and wish out loud for their dreams to come true.</p><p>Tears threatened as she remembered the last time they had done it. It had been at her mother\u2019s bedside. Annabelle had flown home from Chicago. She\u2019d beaten Becks to the hospital, despite the fact that her sister lived only a few miles away at the time. It was a silly ritual, a daydream between young girls. It hadn\u2019t saved her mother\u2019s life, and it wasn\u2019t going to work today. But when Annabelle had taken her hand, she\u2019d wanted so desperately to believe that magic could work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kinley sighed at herself. Wishing for happiness and joy and love was futile now. It was time to grow up.</p><p>A brisk knock on the door startled her out of her thoughts. \u201cRoom service.\u201d</p><p>That was quick. Still, how could she possibly eat now? She could barely move in this dress. All these sad thoughts were killing her appetite... But it would be rude to send the food away when Annabelle had gone to the trouble of ordering it.</p><p>She made her way across the suite. It was very likely a long way here from the kitchens.</p> <p>Tip. He would want a tip. Oh, she hoped she had some cash.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t Annabelle come back? Must be a long phone call with Kellan.</p><p>Kinley opened the door, ready to graciously thank the worker, accept the food, and send him away. But the sight that greeted her stunned her mute.</p><p>The two most gorgeous men she\u2019d ever laid eyes on stood in the hallway, a large cart between them. Something was off about that cart, but she couldn\u2019t stop staring at the men long enough to figure it out.</p><p>Tall, with broad shoulders ready to burst out of their white jackets. The one closest to her had to be six and a half feet tall. He had a military cut of pitch-black hair and the most arresting blue eyes she\u2019d ever seen. She wouldn\u2019t really describe his face as beautiful. He was far too masculine for that. There was something savage about him that belied his formal tuxedo-like uniform.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Kohl? May we come in?\u201d Though the words were spoken more like a growl and a rumble, they were so very polite.</p><p>And for some insane reason, that voice felt like a caress to her skin. He could make love to a woman with that voice\u2014and if she wasn\u2019t about to walk down the aisle to meet Greg, she\u2019d probably let him.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Her own words came out in a breathy little puff. She forced herself to look at Hottie Number Two.</p><p>He was an inch shorter than big brother\u2014and there was no question they were brothers. It was in the set of their eyes and the identical coloring, but after that, they differed. The shorter one looked slightly younger, as though the world hadn\u2019t weighed him down as heavily as his brother. There was the beginning of a truly gorgeous smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cMiss? It\u2019s hard for us to move into your room when you\u2019re standing in the doorway.\u201d Hottie Number Two couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your food to get cold, do you?\u201d</p><p>How could anything possibly get cold when they were around? She actually felt a stifling heat. Except for her feet. Her feet were ice cold\u2014at least metaphorically. Not only did she not want to meet Greg at the end of the aisle, but she\u2019d rather find herself in between these two men in a totally inappropriate position.</p> <p>She flushed and stepped back, allowing them into the room. Her runaway thoughts were all Annabelle\u2019s fault. She joked about being in love with three guys and refusing to choose. She\u2019d told Kinley that she would have them all or they simply wouldn\u2019t have her.</p><p>She\u2019d been joking, surely. But Belle had planted an interesting notion in Kinley\u2019s head...</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want it, sweetheart?\u201d Hottie Two asked.</p><p>She could think of several places that she wanted it, each more inappropriate than the last. But that probably wasn\u2019t what they meant. Even so, Kinley got totally flustered because all she could think about was the man\u2019s lips. They were full and sensual, and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder how he would kiss.</p><p>\u201cThe tray. I meant the tray.\u201d Those lips were curved up in a knowing smile.</p><p>Embarrassment flooded her. If they could read her thoughts, she\u2019d die. \u201cBy the window, please.\u201d</p><p>She needed to pull her damn self together and stop being an idiot. And her heels were already killing her. She stepped gingerly around the couch and reached for her purse. She pulled out a ten.</p><p>\u201cThis light must be bothering you.\u201d Hottie One was standing at the windows. The view was spectacular, but he made quick work of the first set of blinds, closing them and blocking out the afternoon light.</p> <p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She liked the view.</p><p>The man slid the second set of drapes closed. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like it better if you know prying eyes can\u2019t see in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrying eyes?\u201d Kinley asked. \u201cWhy would anyone want to look at me?\u201d</p><p>Hottie One turned and pinned her with his stare. He was so much more serious than his brother. She could tell it by the set of his mouth. This was a man who almost never found anything to smile about. \u201cBecause you\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p><p>Tears threatened. They perched right there, making the world watery. She wasn\u2019t lovely. She was too fat and her eyes were a muddy brown instead of Becks\u2019s spectacular green. Even though she was only twenty-five, her breasts probably sagged a little. Nothing about her face was remarkable.</p><p>But when the man told her she was lovely in that low rumble, she almost believed him.</p><p>Greg never said a thing about her beyond the fact that she would be a good business asset to him. He would never find her lovely.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Miss Kohl?\u201d Hottie Two asked, his expression graver than before.</p><p>Yes, she was rapidly making a complete fool of herself. She gave them her brightest smile, the one she used on the snootiest society ladies and men who thought she didn\u2019t have a brain in her head. \u201cOf course. Here. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>She held out the ten-dollar bill. As she did, her stare fixed on the cart they\u2019d pushed in. It was far larger than normal. At least twice as large and three times as tall. There were two silver trays on top, but no glasses and no silverware.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kohl,\u201d the one with the unsmiling eyes began.</p><p>A little thrill of fear spiked up her spine. Something was wrong. \u201cThat\u2019s not a delivery tray.\u201d</p><p>What they had rolled in was made of canvas. She could see it plainly now.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not,\u201d the second man agreed. He took a step toward her.</p><p>Kinley backed up. \u201cThat\u2019s a laundry hamper.\u201d</p><p>It was the industrial kind used in hotels. Why had they brought her food on a laundry hamper? Except there wasn\u2019t actually any food because that would have come with silverware and glassware, not two silver covers that she could now see weren\u2019t actually covering anything at all.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scream, sweetheart. We\u2019re not here to hurt you.\u201d The second man was inching his way toward her.</p><p>Holy crap! Then what were they going to do?</p><p>Kinley wasn\u2019t about to obey them. She opened her mouth and let out a long shout as she turned on her heels and sprinted for the door.</p><p>At least she meant to sprint for the door. Unfortunately, she tripped on the stupidly long train of her dress and fell to her knees. She scrambled, her heart pounding. Get up! She had to. Kinley had no idea what these men wanted, but she wasn\u2019t about to give it to them.</p><p>An arm wound around her waist, and she was pulled back against a hard body. She screamed again, but this time a hand clapped over her mouth.</p><p>Did they mean to rob her? Rape her? Kill her? God, was this really happening? Tears overflowed.</p><p>The first man, the really big one, stepped in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Kinley. We\u2019re going to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Yes. It looked like they were going to take care of her\u2014by burying her somewhere or tying her feet to cinder blocks and dropping her in the ocean. She\u2019d watched enough ID TV to know what came next.</p><p>She tried to sink her teeth into the hand that covered her mouth. He cursed, and she managed to gain a tiny bit of purchase, but otherwise, he held tight.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fucking biting me, Law,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>A smile crept across the face of the one called Law. It looked rusty from disuse, but when he smiled, his eyes lit up. \u201cGood for her, Ry. I told you she was stronger than you thought. Baby, you have to stop fighting us or I\u2019ll have to do something I\u2019d rather not. I want to talk to you. I want to explain everything.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to explain how he was going to rape and murder her? She bit down harder. The arm around her waist tightened, but the hand never moved.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Law. She\u2019s about to take a fucking piece out of my hand. She\u2019s got two of the fingers I type with,\u201d he snarled. \u201cTake her out or I will.\u201d</p><p>Law stepped up, and she noticed the needle he was carrying. Nothing scared her more than that. She stopped biting the hand over her mouth and tried to scramble away. She couldn\u2019t be unconscious. She couldn\u2019t be at their mercy.</p><p>Kinley kicked back, desperate to escape their hold.</p><p>The mass of muscle behind her didn\u2019t move an inch.</p><p>Law looked down at her, those blue eyes of his filled with some unnamed emotion. He reached out for her with an odd tenderness as he smoothed back her hair. \u201cI will take care of you, baby.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head frantically, but that needle hit her arm anyway. It went right through her silk gown and sank into her flesh.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep now,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Almost immediately, the world began to turn hazy, her vision fading from the periphery in. Her muscles went soft, her knees weakening. But she didn\u2019t hit the floor. Ry picked her up, lifting her into his arms as he started across the room.</p><p>\u201cGently,\u201d Law said as he pulled the top off the laundry cart and shoved it to the side. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>No matter how hard Kinley tried to stay alert, she couldn\u2019t fight the drug anymore. Her whole body went limp, held up only by Ry\u2019s strong arms. As her mind floated, she had the vague thought that it was nice. She\u2019d never been held like this before. She was too big. She would probably kill his back. She opened her mouth to protest, but nothing would come out. Her eyes slid shut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d Ry promised, holding her close.</p><p>He lowered her down as the world went dark.</p><p>Law looked down at the woman in the cart and felt a blazing sense of satisfaction. Kinley Kohl was safe, and he intended to make sure she stayed that way. Two months of surveillance, then adopting a cover to watch her a bit closer for the past week had convinced him that Dominic was completely wrong about her.</p><p>And, if his instincts were right, she was also a virgin\u2014and a submissive one at that.</p><p>Yeah, that got his cock hard. He\u2019d always been a raging pervert, but Kinley Kohl had turned him into an obsessed freak. The moment he\u2019d seen her, he\u2019d known he wanted her. She was gorgeous and had the kind of soft body that made him hard all over. If he\u2019d just wanted to bang the fuck out of her, he would have been all right. Then...he\u2019d seen her with a bunch of homeless kids at a charity event, and his damn stupid heart had engaged for the first time.</p><p>He had to protect her. Yeah, from Dominic, but mostly from her dickwad fianc\u00e9.</p><p>Riley walked out of the bathroom, shaking his right hand. \u201cWell, we know she has all her teeth. Fuck that hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a pussy,\u201d Law barked, still staring at her.</p><p>He was proud that she\u2019d fought back, especially since she tended to be submissive to the stronger personalities around her, like Greg and her bitch of a sister. More than once, he\u2019d seen them take advantage of her sweet nature. Law had been a little worried that when he and Ry abducted her, she would just cry and beg. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle that. Instead, she\u2019d bitten the shit out of his brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Riley screeched.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky she had her back turned to you or she would have kneed the holy fuck out of your cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how crazy you look right now?\u201d Ry\u2019s question dripped sarcasm. \u201cYou are the very picture of a psycho stalker. Do I need to grab a camera for you so you can capture the moment?\u201d</p><p>Law needed to be honest with his brother. \u201cI care about her.\u201d</p><p>A long sigh filled the room. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t who you think she is.\u201d Riley and Dominic hadn\u2019t watched her for months. They weren\u2019t looking past the fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>Riley slapped a hand on his back. \u201cEven if she\u2019s the sweetest thing in the world, I would tell you this a mistake. She won\u2019t be able to handle the lifestyle you want. How the hell would all her society ladies react if she showed up at the charity gala with her three husbands, two of whom came from the wrong side of the tracks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have money now.\u201d He could take care of her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we got it the hard way by dealing with criminals and lowlifes. None of us is a poster child for the country club set. Even though Dominic comes from money, he looks like a gangster. Despite this buff body, I\u2019m a computer nerd. And dude, you talk to your guns.\u201d</p><p>Only occasionally. \u201cEveryone has their quirks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t do it, Law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not Simone.\u201d He was so sick of this argument. The one woman they had thought for half a second about marrying had turned out to be more concerned about other people\u2019s opinions than love, so Riley had given up trying.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all Simone in the end, brother. If we try this long-term thing with someone, it\u2019s damn near impossible to hide. What woman in her right mind wants to be thought of as a whore? You remember what it was like for Mom to even go to the grocery store.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019d pimp our wife out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s how everyone would see it, especially among Kinley\u2019s old-money circle. It won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Riley sighed. \u201cI think we have to get her out of here before someone wonders where the bride is. This ceremony is supposed to start in less than thirty minutes.\u201d He grabbed the heavy canvas cover they had brought along to hide the fact that they weren\u2019t pushing the laundry around.</p> <p>Law shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t cover her yet. We have to get her luggage.\u201d</p><p>Riley rolled his eyes. \u201cWe are not bringing the princess\u2019s luggage.\u201d</p><p>His brother wasn\u2019t thinking. \u201cShe can\u2019t run around in her wedding dress the whole time. We don\u2019t know how long she\u2019s going to be with us.\u201d</p><p>Riley picked up his cell and started texting. \u201cThen you\u2019re in luck. She can run around naked. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing her naked. She is fucking gorgeous. Too bad she\u2019s in the habit of banging a douchelord. What the fuck does she see in him except a whole lot of zeroes in his bank account?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t sleep with Jansen. They don\u2019t spend the night at each other\u2019s places. When they travel they have separate rooms. And we\u2019re taking her luggage. She could have medication packed that she needs.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t take anything more than a couple of vitamins a day, but his brother didn\u2019t have to know that. Having her belongings around Kinley would comfort her.</p><p>God, when had he turned into a guardian angel? Law wasn\u2019t suited for the role. He was pure muscle, good at killing scumbags or making them wish they were dead. He didn\u2019t know a damn thing about taking care of a woman. Riley was probably right. She was too sweet to want what they needed. Even the suggestion would probably shock her down to her painted pink toes.</p><p>So he\u2019d have to settle for watching over her in Alaska.</p><p>Grumbling, Ry grabbed the first of her suitcases. There was room in the cart...if they mashed down the shit ton of puffy fabric in her dress.</p><p>Gently, Riley laid the first piece next to her. Law helped him with the next three bags. He guessed she\u2019d gotten them all secondhand because they were embossed with someone else\u2019s initials. Someone really fucking liked themselves. There were little gold Ls and Vs all over the luggage. If Kinley was his woman, he would make sure everything had her sweet name on it.</p><p>\u201cDominic is having trouble finding a parking spot. We have to hold tight for a few minutes. Damn New York traffic.\u201d Riley cursed at his phone, then lifted the drape to peek out the window as though he could see where Dominic was circling the building. This high up, there was no way. Everyone looked like ants from this height.</p> <p>He tucked the last of the four cases around her. She moaned a little, and the sound made him goddamn hard. Why did he have to ache for this woman?</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck does it have to be her?\u201d Riley asked. Sometimes Law thought his brother could read his mind.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. It won\u2019t. You\u2019re right. She won\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>Again those eyes rolled. His brother needed a better form of communication than sarcasm. \u201cOh, she\u2019ll probably want you. I just don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to keep you. Or any of us. Women like a m\u00e9nage for sex, but no one wants to put up with three dudes for life. The laundry alone would choke her.\u201d</p><p>Law didn\u2019t think that was funny. \u201cI can do my own. All of us can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at this from her point of view. If by some miracle, Kinley could handle a relationship with all three of us, would the pressure from her family or the tabloids be too much for her? How long would it take her to want to leave? Maybe you should try to win her on your own.\u201d</p><p>And leave his brother and best friend behind? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He wanted what the James brothers had. He wanted a family. He\u2019d spent too many years needing someone watching his back to go it alone. Maybe it was his perverse nature, maybe it was something he\u2019d learned, but he didn\u2019t even want to try making this a solo act with Kinley.</p> <p>And there was a little voice inside that worried what would happen to her if he died. He couldn\u2019t leave his wife alone the way his own mother had been. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her turning to a terrible life on her back just to feed herself and her kids.</p><p>\u201cNah. I just like her, okay? I\u2019ll get over it. I don\u2019t particularly love the idea of going into the kidnapping business, and she\u2019ll want nothing to do with me after this, most likely.\u201d</p><p>God knew he\u2019d been forced to play the bad guy most of his fucking life. One more time shouldn\u2019t matter. He just couldn\u2019t stand the idea that she would be afraid of him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re saving her life. Eventually, she\u2019ll understand.\u201d Annabelle slipped into the room through the adjoining door, her voice low. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>The curvy secretary approached the laundry cart and looked inside.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019ll sleep it off on the plane.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he grabbed her handbag, they were out of here. But when he lifted it, Law frowned. It felt heavier than it looked. What was she carrying? Not that it mattered. He laid it in the cart beside her with the rest.</p><p>\u201cHow is it coming from your end?\u201d Ry asked.</p><p>The law firm of Baxter, Cohen, and Kent was working on their side\u2014to bring Jansen to justice and to try to keep their asses out of jail. Law wasn\u2019t sure which would prove to be the harder job.</p><p>\u201cI brought Eric with me. He\u2019s waylaid her sister. She was probably coming back in to snip at Kinley one more time. Good, you got her luggage. She\u2019ll be calmer if she can keep her things around her.\u201d Tears were threatening to spill down her cheeks. \u201cAm I doing the right thing?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d pondered the same question every day since they\u2019d decided on the assignment. \u201cYou tried to tell her the truth, and she wasn\u2019t accepting it.\u201d</p><p>Annabelle shook her head. \u201cI know. Kinley is so loyal and wants to believe the best about everyone. If I\u2019d pushed too much more, she would have gone straight to Greg and demanded explanations. You know how he would have taken care of the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s safe,\u201d Law assured.</p><p>Riley stepped up. He was always the one to handle the ladies. Being somewhat civilized, he didn\u2019t tend to scare the crap out of them the way Law did.</p><p>His brother gave her his surest smile. \u201cShe\u2019s in good hands, Annabelle. I went to college with Kellan. He\u2019s talked to you about me, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, relaxing a little. \u201cHe said you were a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you trust him, then trust me. I\u2019ll be good to her. And Law here is already half in love with her, so there\u2019s no worry.\u201d</p><p>Law felt his jaw drop. \u201cYou motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>Riley shrugged. \u201cHey, I tell it like it is.\u201d</p><p>Annabelle went silent, her dark eyes staring through him. Damn it. Riley\u2019s sense of humor was going to get him gutted one day. Now Annabelle would be afraid to let Kinley go with him. The secretary could cause real trouble.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to...\u201d Law struggled. How did one politely tell someone that he wasn\u2019t going to molest her friend? \u201cTouch her. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I sincerely hope you do.\u201d Annabelle stepped up and smoothed down his tie. \u201cYou charm her and seduce her and you make her very happy in bed. That\u2019s practically an order.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard that right. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She stepped back, wearing a mysterious smile. \u201cI love that woman. She\u2019s my sister and she deserves someone who can make her feel good. You\u2019ve been watching her. I see the look in your eyes. You seem like a smart man, Law Anders. I know Dominic Anthony is. No truly smart man is going to be able to resist my best friend.\u201d Her eyes narrowed as she studied Riley. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you. You might be dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI graduated top of my class at Harvard.\u201d Riley seemed slightly put off.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll get with the program because she\u2019ll need the security and affection all of you can provide. Just remember...if you taste that particular icing, you\u2019ve bought the whole cake. If you try to get out of taking the cake home and enjoying every bite, I will come after your asses. And you have not seen fury until you\u2019ve seen it from this girl. Are we understood?\u201d</p><p>They both nodded dutifully. Law was pretty sure that Riley had been struck as mute as him.</p><p>Annabelle took one last look at her friend, then stepped to the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure the coast stays clear. You two think about what I said. And take care of Gigi. She can be a handful.\u201d</p><p>Annabelle disappeared, leaving Law with one final question.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is Gigi?\u201d</p><p>Riley shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think that girl might be crazy. Are you thinking of trying Kinley\u2019s cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t just eat the frosting and then not take a bite of the cake, if you know what I mean. Hell, I\u2019m not sure what I mean. I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>Damn, he didn\u2019t understand women half the time. Shaking it off, he looked down at Kinley, who appeared to be sleeping so peacefully, despite her awkward position. She was really the most fucking gorgeous thing he\u2019d ever seen. And what had he done? He\u2019d shot her full of tranquilizer, stuffed her into a laundry bin, and dumped her luggage inside.</p><p>Very smooth.</p><p>\u201cI really want to try the frosting,\u201d Riley admitted. \u201cBut Annabelle will take our balls off if we do and then don\u2019t eat the cake.\u201d He frowned. \u201cIs that what she\u2019s saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDumbass.\u201d Sometimes he wondered if Harvard was all it was cracked up to be. \u201cShe was saying she approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of thought so. She shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Riley stood beside him staring down, too. His brother\u2019s face softened. \u201cWe\u2019d only get hurt if we started something with her. She really is quite lovely when she\u2019s not biting my hand.\u201d</p><p>His phone buzzed, and Riley\u2019s whole body went on alert. \u201cWe\u2019re a go.\u201d</p><p>Law grabbed the canvas and covered the bin. \u201cSleep well, princess. When you wake up, you\u2019ll be in a whole new kingdom.\u201d</p><p>And he would very likely be in hell.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Riley stared down the long hallway just outside Kinley\u2019s suite and wondered what jail would be like. If he and Law were caught, they\u2019d probably be sent to a maximum-security prison for violent offenders. He hoped he wouldn\u2019t be popular there, but he worried. Because deep down, he knew there was no fucking way they got away with kidnapping and transporting a debutante across state lines. Hell, with the amount of Louis Vuitton luggage Kinley Kohl had, they would probably get nabbed for grand theft baggage, too.</p><p>He was going to end up living out the rest of his days as some thug\u2019s girlfriend, being traded for cigarettes and sexual favors. It wasn\u2019t really how he\u2019d expected his life to play out, but he couldn\u2019t back out of this assignment. A man didn\u2019t have much if he didn\u2019t have any loyalty.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re clear to the elevator.\u201d His brother was cool as a cucumber. Not a single line on his face revealed a hint of anxiety. He wasn\u2019t thinking up ten different ways he could be shanked in prison. No. Law Anders was steady.</p><p>It was the way he\u2019d been all their lives. Nothing fazed his big brother...but for a few minutes, Law had warmed up while staring down at the woman who would likely cost them twenty-five to life. Just for a moment, there had been something like hope in Law\u2019s normally barren expression.</p><p>If they weren\u2019t careful, Kinley Kohl might cost them more than their freedom.</p><p>Riley pushed the laundry cart forward, keeping his expression carefully blank. Nothing to see here, folks. Just a couple of average Joes doing their job, kidnapping a blonde with nice tits. Happens every day.</p><p>Actually, Kinley\u2019s tits weren\u2019t just nice. From what he could see, they were gorgeous. Round and full... At first, he\u2019d suspected they were cosmetically augmented, but then he\u2019d held her close and she\u2019d been so fucking soft against him. His cock had gotten hard as a rock. Then she\u2019d bitten the holy shit out of him.</p><p>And he\u2019d gotten even harder.</p><p>Riley wondered what she would look like when he tied her up, when he had so much of his rope around her that she couldn\u2019t move. He could imagine the pattern on her fair skin, a tortoiseshell that would mold her curves and wrap around those breasts, making them thrust out proudly. He would dress her in silk rope and nothing else. Well, next to nothing else. Those ridiculous heels she was wearing would look awfully good wrapped around his neck while he shoved his cock into what was likely a very tight pussy.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem, brother?\u201d</p><p>Riley nearly groaned. He was in the middle of a criminal endeavor, and he was hard as hell, thinking about all the ways he could violate his pretty little hostage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wasn\u2019t just going to prison. He was going to hell in a hand basket. Well, a laundry cart, at least.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t be, not in the way he wanted to. Nope, there was going to be no coming around Kinley Kohl at all. He pushed the cart again and swore to all of the mystical beings of the universe that he wasn\u2019t going to molest their prisoner. No way. He was keeping his hands to himself. The only way he\u2019d be coming in the near future was by the power of his own fist or with a properly paid for hooker. And he wasn\u2019t above either method.</p><p>The elevator door was open at the end of the hall, not the pretty one the guests used, but the hefty, industrial-sized one meant to keep the workers out of sight of the hotel\u2019s posh clientele.</p> <p>On his left, he caught sight of one of the CCTV cameras that dotted the hallways. He kept his head down. All anyone watching the feeds would see was a tall man with dark hair pushing a laundry cart along the hallway. There would be nothing to distinguish him.</p><p>Just a few more steps and then they would be safely in the elevator.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>To his horror, the canvas started to move and a perfectly manicured hand appeared.</p><p>Law rushed across the hall, his feet making not a single sound against the carpet.</p> <p>\u201cHafta getta way.\u201d Kinley was trying to haul herself out of the laundry cart. One fist came up. \u201cWon\u2019t let you. Won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Riley peered down at her. How did she make that look so fucking adorable? She was a mess of white tulle, and all he could think about was wrapping himself around her.</p><p>\u201cBaby, it\u2019s all right.\u201d Law reached for her hand, his voice softer than Riley could ever remember hearing it. Law was rough and tumble, but he got so tender around this one bit of blonde fluff. \u201cWhat the hell. I thought I emptied the fucking syringe in her arm. We need the chloroform, Riley.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it was their last resort. It wouldn\u2019t keep Kinley out for very long, but they had to keep her out long enough to escape this damn hotel.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to get married. Want the beach. Happy there.\u201d They weren\u2019t taking her to the beach, but at least Law seemed to be calming her down. Then she turned those kick-him-in-the-gonads brown eyes his way. \u201cSo pretty. Wanna get married?\u201d</p><p>Just then, he almost did because she was so sweet with her ridiculously sensual bow of a mouth and honey blonde hair. In that moment, he could picture her at the center of their world. It was perverse. He fucking knew it, but he couldn\u2019t shake the image of the three of them loving her\u2014their queen, their beating heart\u2014as she loved them in return.</p> <p>He had to stop indulging in ridiculous fantasy. Sure, she was soft right now, but she wouldn\u2019t be when the drugs wore off. Besides, they couldn\u2019t abduct her on her wedding day, then imagine she\u2019d be receptive to romance with him...and Law...and Dominic. The pretty blonde would likely cut them cold for trying to steal so much as a kiss. If they were dumb enough to bring up marriage to all three of them, she\u2019d probably laugh her ass off. If she was crazy enough to try it and stay, she\u2019d end up leaving.</p><p>Even so, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say anything beyond, \u201cSure, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d A brilliant, if loopy smile crossed her face. God, she was gorgeous. His freaking heart nearly stopped. \u201cYou\u2019ll be good to me?\u201d</p><p>She asked as if it was the gravest of concerns. Maybe she knew her fianc\u00e9 better than he thought.</p><p>\u201cEvery single day.\u201d He grabbed the rag from his pants pocket and held it up. She didn\u2019t even flinch, just kept smiling at him as he placed the cloth over her mouth. His heart sank a little as the light left her eyes and she slid back down into the laundry bin.</p><p>Law caught her, helping to ease her down. He smoothed back her hair. For just a moment, a primal growl started in Riley\u2019s throat. He craved the chance to soothe her. It was stupid. When she came to, she\u2019d want nothing to do with them, yet he couldn\u2019t stop imagining how nice it would be to put his arms around her and hold her while she slept off the drugs they\u2019d just fed her. Then making love to her when she awoke.</p><p>Yeah, he was going to do well in prison.</p><p>After Law settled her, his head came up. Right into the line of the cameras.</p> <p>\u201cDude, look down. Now!\u201d What the hell was his brother thinking? Law never fucked up an op. Law was the be-all, end-all of operatives. He was ice cold, but it looked like Kinley Kohl was getting his brother too hot to think. Damn!</p><p>Law jerked his head down. \u201cShit! Sorry. Let\u2019s get her out of here. Dominic is probably freaking out by now.\u201d</p><p>He jogged down the hall and pushed the elevator button again. Luckily, it hadn\u2019t gone anywhere. Riley started pushing the cart in, his thoughts racing.</p><p>Okay, maybe Law hadn\u2019t fucked up all that badly. Maybe the cameras hadn\u2019t been pointed in their direction. Or maybe no one was watching them. In that case, they\u2019d be gone before anyone noticed Kinley was missing. And with any luck, the cameras hadn\u2019t been recording. No one would know anything about her disappearance then, at least until Dominic had the proof he needed. What they\u2019d do with her when it came time to release her and how they\u2019d keep her from running to the police... Well, none of them had figured that out yet.</p><p>\u201cHey, hold up!\u201d</p><p>Fuck. As fast as he could shove the cart in, a man in a badly tailored suit was right behind him, crowding into the elevator.</p><p>\u201cSir, the guest elevator is down the hall.\u201d Law\u2019s voice was perfectly steady as he held the door open for the man to exit.</p><p>Not just any man. Fuck times two. Vincent Dargo, Greg Jansen\u2019s heavy. There was no way to mistake the man. He looked like something a pit bull had chewed up and spit out before someone decided to shove him into a suit.</p><p>\u201cNah, I hate those fucking snooty elevators. I hate places like this in general. Will this get me to the ballroom floor?\u201d</p><p>Riley wondered if there was any chloroform left. Law shook his head slightly and removed his arm from the doorway. The doors closed with a little thud, and Law hit the buttons for the ballroom floor and the street level.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir. We\u2019ll get you there,\u201d Riley forced himself to say.</p><p>This was a man who, by all accounts, did Greg Jansen\u2019s dirty work\u2014and had for years. Being this close to the asshole who probably had more than a thing or two to do with Carrie\u2019s murder made Riley want to strangle him.</p><p>\u201cYou two working this fucking sham of a wedding?\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his brother tense slightly, but Law\u2019s eyes stayed on the doors as the elevator descended. \u201cNah. We\u2019re dropping this set off for cleaning, then we\u2019re done for the day.\u201d</p><p>Vincent frowned. \u201cI thought you had maids to cart that shit around. You two aren\u2019t dressed for laundry.\u201d</p><p>It was Riley\u2019s turn. He\u2019d had a lot of experience with being friendly and non-threatening. He\u2019d spent much of his life making up for the fact that Law acted like a Rottweiler on steroids. \u201cNormally, we wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the laundry, man, but there\u2019s this girl...\u201d</p><p>Vincent nodded and sent him a knowing wink. \u201cHey, you gotta give a little to get some. Well, some of us do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a cute little thing. I don\u2019t know that she\u2019ll last long in the job, though. She\u2019s skittish about some of the nasty stuff we have to send out for cleaning.\u201d Riley shrugged. \u201cWhen you work in a hotel for as long as I have, you see just about everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the hotel have its own laundry?\u201d Dargo scowled.</p><p>\u201cSure, but some couple got freaky on one of our thousand thread count sheets. Can\u2019t just throw those out. You know how it is. Some stains are harder to remove and need a professional.\u201d</p><p>Vincent Dargo was a stain that Riley would dearly love to remove, but Dargo\u2019s boss was more important. \u201cWell, you won\u2019t have that problem in the bridal suite tonight. God, I\u2019ll be surprised if they fuck at all. That girl is so bangable, but she\u2019s cold. Society women. You think you have a rough job. Try having a boss who tells you to go out and find him a wife with society connections and a fat ass. Oh, but she has to be pretty. Lucky me, I found one, but it was hard. I had to find a go between, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t. Thankfully, the door dinged and opened to the ballroom level because Riley could practically see his brother vibrating with the need for violence.</p><p>Down the long hall, Riley caught sight of Jansen in his immaculate tuxedo. For all that Dargo looked like a thug, Jansen fit into society perfectly, a shark masked by designer wear.</p><p>He spoke to a man Riley recognized as a senator from Georgia. They were having an intense conversation. Chamber music flooded the halls. It sounded like the wedding was getting ready to start. Someone would start looking for Kinley soon.</p><p>\u201cGotta go.\u201d Dargo rushed out to meet his boss.</p><p>Riley reached out and very calmly pressed the button to close the doors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d Law said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that would make you feel better.\u201d Sometimes he thought snuffing the breath out of lowlifes like Dargo was one of Law\u2019s ways to relax. Today, Riley understood. \u201cWhen the time comes, make him suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he meant?\u201d</p><p>Riley had already reviewed the conversation in his head. He was pretty sure he knew what was bugging his brother. \u201cYou mean, why was he concerned with her ass?\u201d He\u2019d seen her pictures. Kinley Kohl had a luscious backside that she tried to camouflage with her clothing. He shrugged. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s an ass man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis other girlfriends have all been model types, very thin. So thin that I\u2019ve wanted to feed them a cheeseburger,\u201d Law muttered. \u201cEven Carrie was that way.\u201d</p><p>Carrie Anthony had been beautiful, but neither Riley nor Law had ever been tempted by her. She\u2019d been like their little sister, too. Beyond that, she hadn\u2019t been anywhere close to their type. Sometimes Riley wished they didn\u2019t have a type, but it was true.</p><p>Over time, he\u2019d fallen into sharing women with his brother and Dominic. It was just the way he preferred things. Oh, it wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t have sex on his own. He could totally do that, enjoy it even, but he didn\u2019t picture picket fences and forever without backup.</p><p>Life in a trailer park, watching his mom pay for their food by whoring herself out, had taught him to always have a contingency, other resources. But finding someone who wanted to be involved with him and his backup had been next to impossible.</p><p>So if Jansen wasn\u2019t attracted to juicy asses, why had he insisted on one?</p><p>The doors opened, and suddenly that was a problem for another day. It was time to get a move on. Workers rushed around them as they strode down the hallway toward the loading docks.</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d Dominic said. He was dressed in coveralls emblazoned with the name of a local specialty cleaner. \u201cIs that everything we need?\u201d</p><p>He was holding a clipboard that likely contained a crossword puzzle and nothing else. It was all just a part of the ruse.</p><p>\u201cThis should do it.\u201d Riley pushed the cart into the back of the truck.</p><p>Just before he was about to close it, Law jumped in. \u201cI\u2019ll ride back here, make sure the merchandise doesn\u2019t get damaged in transit.\u201d</p><p>He slammed the door shut.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a pervert.\u201d</p><p>Now that they were about to escape the hotel, the worry that Law\u2019s face had been captured by that hallway camera returned. Riley was right back to wondering how he would look in an orange jumpsuit. His guess? Not so great.</p><p>But some part of him was more fixated on the moment, was the tiniest bit jealous that Law had Kinley all to himself. He would very likely pick her up because it wouldn\u2019t be nice to leave her in a laundry cart. He would cradle her to make sure she was safe. He would have that very fine ass sitting right on his lap.</p><p>Maybe Law wasn\u2019t the only pervert.</p><p>\u201cCan we go now?\u201d Dominic asked. \u201cOr do you want to ride in the back, too?\u201d</p><p>His longtime best friend was so obviously not amused. \u201cI\u2019m good to go.\u201d</p><p>He jogged around the truck and hopped in.</p><p>As they lost themselves in the Manhattan traffic, Riley\u2019s thoughts stuck on the woman in the back of the truck.</p><p>Dominic couldn\u2019t quite take his eyes off the woman reclining in the seat of the private jet he\u2019d chartered to take them to the James\u2019s landing strip in River Run, Alaska. They\u2019d been in the air for over an hour and she hadn\u2019t moved yet.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look anything like Carrie. He\u2019d known it from the pictures he\u2019d studied, but somehow he\u2019d thought that when he got into the same space as Kinley Kohl, he\u2019d see something that reminded him of his sister.</p><p>After all, they had both fallen for the same man\u2014a cold-blooded killer who had offed Carrie and intended to do the same to Kinley.</p><p>Riley sank into the seat next to him. \u201cLaw says we\u2019ll be flying all night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was somewhere around ten hours from New York to Alaska. Dominic had a long night to ruminate on the task he had to complete tomorrow.</p><p>He had to break Kinley Kohl.</p><p>\u201cCan we get her out of that ridiculous dress?\u201d Dominic asked, eyeing her all wrapped in white silk and satin. He couldn\u2019t contemplate playing hardball with her when she looked that damn innocent.</p><p>When Law had passed her to him from the truck, she\u2019d nestled down into his arms like a trusting child. Or a lover. But she could never be his lover. Or Law\u2019s\u2014no matter what he imagined.</p> <p>\u201cI think Law would be happy to undress her,\u201d Riley said. \u201cYou want me to take his place in the cockpit?\u201d</p><p>Riley wasn\u2019t half the pilot his brother was, but he would be able to keep them in flight.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to tempt Law any further. \u201cShe can change when we arrive and she comes to. She won\u2019t wake up during the flight, will she?\u201d</p><p>Riley shrugged. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t gotten much sleep lately. At least that\u2019s what Annabelle said. But she had a weird reaction to the sedative. She came out of it for a minute in the hall. Law held her then and stroked her hair. She went back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Dominic bet that little episode had done nothing to dampen Law\u2019s infatuation. That man had a deep-seated need to protect. Kinley looked fragile right now, but surely when the interrogation started tomorrow, she would show her true colors.</p> <p>\u201cGigi.\u201d She started to mutter in her sleep. \u201cWhere...Gigi?\u201d</p><p>Dominic frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s Gigi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnabelle mentioned her. Then she gave us that half smile women often do, the one that looks a little evil and makes you wait for things to start falling. You know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d</p><p>Annabelle could be a bit mysterious, but he had other problems now. \u201cDid you check through her luggage? I don\u2019t want to find a cell phone.\u201d</p><p>Cell phones had GPS. GPS meant they were up shit creek and all his careful planning had been for nothing.</p><p>\u201cI left it sitting on the table in the living area of the suite.\u201d</p> <p>Not good enough. There had been a ton of people going through that bridal suite all day long. \u201cHow do you know it was hers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you looked at her? Look, man, it was in her room and it was pink and blinged within an inch of its life. She seems to like little fake diamonds on everything. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>He was going to have Law\u2019s head. It had been a sloppy operation. Law should have made damn sure that was her phone. He could forgive Riley, who was usually behind the scenes, but Law knew damn well how to run an op. Now Dominic had to check through the luggage to make sure they weren\u2019t going to be met by feds when they landed in River Run.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Law decide to bring a half ton of designer luggage with us?\u201d</p><p>Dominic knew he shouldn\u2019t, but he stared across the aisle. Her blonde hair was the color of honey. The pictures didn\u2019t capture its natural beauty. Lighter shades threaded through the darker ones, forming a gorgeous honey and amber color that contrasted beautifully with her skin.</p><p>Porcelain. Her skin was like porcelain, perfect and creamy white.</p><p>He needed to remember that porcelain, while beautiful, was also cold.</p><p>\u201cHe was worried she might need something in there,\u201d Riley answered with a touch of disbelief, as if he, too, thought his brother had gone mental.</p> <p>\u201cSo he wanted to be the guy who brought all her clothes along. He\u2019s going to kill me over this.\u201d He pulled the first bag free and slid the zipper around. The top popped open as though deeply happy at being free. She\u2019d stuffed the bag to the hilt. \u201cHoly shit. How many pairs of jeans does one woman need?\u201d</p><p>There were at least a dozen pairs of jeans in the case, each with more and more elaborately placed rhinestones across the pockets that would hug her ass. It was like Las Vegas had taken over her luggage. Every eye in the world would go straight to her ass because there was no way anyone could miss it.</p><p>\u201cThere seems to be a theme here. She likes shiny objects. Maybe if we get some jewelry we can distract her enough so she\u2019ll just give us all the intel we need,\u201d Dominic offered.</p><p>There were several shirts but they were blousy and draped, rather modest by modern standards. Her bras and panties were utilitarian, all white cotton. Nothing lacy and pretty to show off her stunning body on her honeymoon. That was a riddle. Dominic would have bet that Kinley used that sexy body to get everything she wanted, but her underwear told a different story.</p><p>There was a makeup bag with bright pink trim and black polka dots. In fact, nothing was plain about anything Kinley owned\u2014except her underwear.</p><p>He opened the makeup case. Nothing was sacred now. He needed to know everything about her, understand her better before he began his interrogation.</p><p>Her makeup was drugstore. Cheap. That surprised him. The luggage was wretchedly expensive, but she got by with crappy makeup and inexpensive moisturizer.</p><p>He was sure she would be wearing Chanel right before Jansen killed her.</p><p>Dominic took a long breath and repacked her bag, using the little gold lock to run the zipper back around the edge.</p><p>\u201cThis one is full of shoes.\u201d Riley held up a pair that he would expect a stripper to wear. They were fucking hot. \u201cShe has twelve pairs of shoes for a five-day trip. Why does she need all those shoes?\u201d</p><p>To make a man crazy. To make her legs look a million miles long. To wrap them around his back and press into his flesh. Her shoes were everything her undies weren\u2019t. They were hot sex on stilettos.</p><p>He had to turn away because he was getting agonizingly hard just thinking about her in those heels.</p><p>The bag to his left began to shake. And bark.</p><p>Well, now he could guess who Gigi was. He unzipped the travel bag and a puffball leapt out.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d Riley asked, frowning down at the little thing. Kinley had tied a pink bow in its fur, and there was a rhinestone-studded collar around its tiny throat.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s supposed to be a dog.\u201d It started to yip, a deeply annoying sound. The little thing started to bark and run in circles as though trying to communicate.</p><p>\u201cIt looks more like a rat. Why would she put bows on a rat?\u201d Riley leaned down and held out a hand. \u201cHere, girl. Let\u2019s get you back in the bag. That\u2019s your home, right? Don\u2019t you want to go back home and stop that infernal sound you\u2019re making? I can\u2019t call it a bark. Real dogs bark.\u201d</p><p>But the little rat thing proved it could bite. The minute Riley reached for it, it nipped him.</p><p>Riley popped back up, shaking his hand, then staring at it. \u201cDamn it. I\u2019m going to go wash my hand and hope that thing doesn\u2019t have rabies.\u201d</p><p>He stalked back toward the bathroom.</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t seem to understand that all creatures needed to know their place in the pecking order, whether person or dog or weirdly dressed rat thing. Dominic knew who was in charge\u2014him.</p><p>He picked up Gigi by the scruff of her neck, lifting her high in the air, and bringing her up to meet his eyes. Gigi made an odd sound in the back of her throat that Dominic thought might pass for a snarl in rat-dog world.</p><p>Dominic spoke in a language the animal could understand. He gave her a real snarl.</p><p>Gigi whimpered and tried to rear back into a protective ball.</p><p>Now, they understood each other. He set the dog thing back down. It immediately ran to hide in Kinley\u2019s skirts, apparently not caring that its mistress was unconscious.</p><p>Dominic sighed and sat back in his chair.</p><p>Riley plopped down beside him. \u201cIt didn\u2019t break the skin. Maybe its teeth aren\u2019t sharp enough. Have you thought about the fact that Butch is going to eat that thing?\u201d</p><p>His bulldog was already in Alaska. River Run and the compound there had become their base of operations for this particular mission. One of their largest clients, Black Oak Oil, had offered to let them use the large house they kept outside their center in Alaska. When Dominic had asked about it, Gavin James had simply handed over the keys and the security codes, insisting that he didn\u2019t want to know a damn thing else.</p><p>Gavin knew him fairly well, but their connections in public were almost purely professional. If Kinley\u2019s kidnapping got tied back to him, it would be a while before the feds got around to questioning Gavin. \u201cButch will be a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p><p>He hoped. Kinley probably wouldn\u2019t be too helpful if his dog swallowed hers whole and burped up those pink bows.</p><p>With great effort, she lifted her head and sighed. \u201cFind Gigi...\u201d</p><p>The words were slurred like she was totally trashed. It was a reasonable reaction to the sedatives, though they should have just knocked her out for at least eight to ten hours. She was certainly stronger physically than he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>\u201cGigi is hiding in your skirts,\u201d he explained in a soft voice.</p><p>She smiled, and his heart actually skipped a beat. What the hell was that about? Those plump lips curled up, and she flushed a little. He could imagine that exact expression on her face when he pressed his cock deep and found that perfect place deep inside her.</p><p>Had Jansen ever given her a screaming orgasm? The thought of his sister\u2019s killer fucking Kinley deflated his dick in a second. He wasn\u2019t going to have sex with Jansen\u2019s leftovers. No fucking way. No matter how much he wanted her.</p><p>She lurched up on wobbly feet and immediately stumbled, landing right in his lap.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Kinley.\u201d He tried making it an order. Maybe Kinley was a little like her rat-dog thing and just needed a firm hand.</p><p>\u201cKay,\u201d she slurred and nuzzled her face in the crook of his neck where he could feel her breath on his skin.</p><p>Yeah, his cock was hard again. She settled her ass against it, and Dominic thought he might come in his slacks. Damn it. \u201cIn your own seat, Kinley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKay.\u201d But she just snuggled closer and sighed as though she\u2019d found right where she wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cShe seems very affectionate when she\u2019s incapacitated.\u201d Riley had the faintest smile on his face. \u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t move her. She might sleep better like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get Law out here to hold her.\u201d He couldn\u2019t just sit here with her all pressed up against him for hours. Even as he thought it, the plane hit an air pocket. With the momentary turbulence, his arm wound around her waist, tugging her more firmly into his lap. She would fall if he didn\u2019t, and he couldn\u2019t have her injured at this junction. That was the only reason he did it.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Law is flying the plane,\u201d Riley pointed out, then turned quiet for a moment. \u201cShe seems sweet actually. She\u2019s not totally what I thought she was.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Riley drank her in with that same glazed, lustful expression Law did. This could spell trouble.</p><p>Kinley\u2019s breathing evened out as she went utterly limp. Knowing he was stuck with her indefinitely, Dominic held in a curse. \u201cPull your head out of your pants. She\u2019s exactly what we thought. She\u2019s just better at manipulating men than I gave her credit for. She even does it in her damn sleep.\u201d</p><p>Riley snorted. \u201cWe gave her the equivalent of a horse tranquilizer, and she\u2019s managed to worry more about that little hairy thing than herself.\u201d</p><p>It was time to remind his partner of some hard truths. \u201cShe\u2019s marrying for money.\u201d</p><p>Riley sat back, sighing a little. \u201cIs that really the worst crime you can think of?\u201d</p><p>He could think of worse. Murder, for instance. But once Jansen had the money his sister had earned modeling and entr\u00e9e into her glitzy New York social world, Jansen hadn\u2019t needed her anymore. So he\u2019d killed her. Carrie had married the bastard because she thought she loved him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to spread her legs for money,\u201d Dominic reminded. \u201cYou know what we called that back home?\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s face flushed angrily. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure you called those women whores. Of course I called her mom. I think I\u2019ll go sit with Law for a while.\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s stomach dropped.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about your mother,\u201d he said, trying to come back from the precipice of a really nasty fight. God, he wasn\u2019t thinking these days.</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t bother to turn around. \u201cYeah, you were. I just think you should stop for five minutes and consider that the world isn\u2019t always fair. Some people get dealt a shitty hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? The world isn\u2019t black and white.\u201d Riley gritted his teeth. \u201cGood people can sometimes do bad things for the right reasons. The fact that I have to say that to you is ridiculous. We just kidnapped a woman, and you\u2019re planning on making her life a living hell until she gives you the information you need. In light of that, ask yourself if whoring really seems that bad. I\u2019ll see you when we touch down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d he called out, but the other man ignored him and disappeared behind the cockpit door.</p><p>Kinley didn\u2019t move, just laid there trustingly in his arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He heard a little whimper and looked down at the floor. Somehow Gigi had managed to work free of the endless yards of freaking fabric that made up Kinley\u2019s skirt. And now the little thing was looking up longingly at its mistress. It whined and turned those bug eyes on him.</p><p>God, he was the wicked witch in this scenario. He was taking out Dorothy and her little dog, too.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Dominic reached down and scooped up the little dog with one hand. As soon as he set it in Kinley\u2019s lap, it curled against its mistress and immediately went to sleep.</p> <p>Which left him holding his beautiful hostage, who would likely hate him come morning, and her dog thing. It really couldn\u2019t get worse.</p><p>He would make it up to Riley and Law. He had zero intentions of really hurting the girl in a long-term way. But in the short term, she would likely be...uncomfortable. At least she would be alive.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the fucking bad guy here.</p><p>\u201cSo warm.\u201d She rubbed her head against his neck and her hand petted the dog.</p><p>He had a sudden vision of that soft hand stroking his cock. That quickly, he was the uncomfortable one.</p> <p>Dominic closed his eyes and tried to not think about how close his rigid dick was to her silken pussy and her lush ass. He could withhold her orgasm until she told him exactly what he needed to know. God, that would be a sweet bit of torture.</p><p>And then he would walk away and never think about her again.</p><p>Yeah, he was a real fucking good guy.</p><p>So he wouldn\u2019t touch the girl sexually. Good thing he had other methods to break her down.</p><p>He was just about to doze off when the dog started snoring.</p><p>It was going to be a long flight.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>Law looked through the windows in the great room, over the lawn\u2014not that the wilderness around the compound could be called that. The River Run, Alaska, facility sat in the middle of endless miles of pristine beauty toward the southeastern end of the state. There was a small town a few miles away, but everyone who lived there was on the James\u2019s payroll. They wouldn\u2019t be calling the cops. He doubted anyone even knew they were here with the exception of the man who tended the grounds and had been dog sitting Butch while they\u2019d been in New York. An hour before they\u2019d arrived, they\u2019d called to let the man know they\u2019d care for Butch from here on out. No sense in putting Gavin\u2019s employee in the sticky position of being an accessory to a crime.</p><p>Morning in Alaska this time of year came mighty early, but it was something to see. Fog around the mountains and brilliant colors lighting the sky.</p><p>Right now, Kinley probably didn\u2019t really give a damn about the view.</p><p>Down the hall, the banging on the door began again. She\u2019d been awake for half an hour, but he didn\u2019t think she had complied with his very reasonable request.</p><p>\u201cHave you changed your clothes yet?\u201d he called, striding to her door.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell. I\u2019m not getting naked with you around, criminal!\u201d Kinley\u2019s voice got higher with each syllable and carried quite well. The doorknob jiggled before the banging began again. \u201cLet me out of here!\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the wall with a sigh. She\u2019d been screaming since the minute she\u2019d awakened. With the exception of a few delirious interruptions, she\u2019d slept for almost fourteen full hours. He\u2019d gotten worried about her and had started looking up the names of doctors in the area, but once she\u2019d opened those pretty brown eyes, she\u2019d started fighting. He\u2019d left, hoping that she would comply. And calm down. No such luck.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, you can\u2019t run around in that wedding dress. Isn\u2019t it uncomfortable? And you can\u2019t eat in it. You\u2019ve got to be hungry, so why don\u2019t you take a nice long shower and change into the jeans and shirt I left for you. Then you can eat some breakfast. I\u2019ll fix it for you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d start out civilized, try not to scare her too much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything you say! I\u2019ll fight to the end. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re scared, but we\u2019re not trying to hurt you.\u201d He closed his eyes briefly. \u201cThink about it for just a second. I\u2019m trying to give you a little privacy so you can change and be more comfortable. If I was a violent rapist, would I give you clothes? If I was a crazed killer, wouldn\u2019t I have at least tied you up or something?\u201d</p><p>That last phrase flashed lightning to his cock. When he tied her up, he wanted it to be totally consensual, with their mutual pleasure in mind.</p><p>God, he had to stop thinking that way.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re trying to lull me into a false sense of security before you kill me because you like to play with your victims\u2019 minds,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>The only thing he wanted to play with was her boobs. Hell, that wasn\u2019t the total truth. He wanted to play with her mouth, pussy, and ass, too. He could even think of some fun things to do with her feet. \u201cI promise, I\u2019m not trying to mind fuck you.\u201d</p><p>That was Dominic\u2019s job.</p><p>Riley joined him in the hall, a single eyebrow arched quizzically. \u201cNo luck getting Sleeping Beauty to give up the white gown?\u201d</p><p>Since she\u2019d awakened, only Law had dealt with her. He hoped maybe his brother could sway her with some smoother logic.</p><p>\u201cWho is that? How many of you are there?\u201d Kinley whispered the question through the door as though she was terrified of the answer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just me and my brother right now, baby. Neither one of us is going to hurt you. We\u2019re here to help you.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was time to let her out. She was scared. If he let her have her way this once, she might see that they could be reasonable. Hopefully, they could start building some trust so she wouldn\u2019t be terrified out of her mind.</p><p>Trying to play Prince Charming? You kidnapped her, dumbass. She\u2019s not going to buy that. Sometimes the voice in his head was annoyingly honest.</p><p>Dragging in a deep breath, he shoved the key in the lock and opened the door. He spilled into the bedroom as though she\u2019d yanked it open. When she tried to run out and slam the door behind her, Riley kicked it open and blocked her path, catching her between the two of them.</p><p>Kinley stopped dead in her tracks, letting loose a breathy gasp. Law wasn\u2019t surprised that she was star struck by his younger brother\u2019s Hollywood good looks. It was a typical female reaction, but it hit Law squarely in the chest. Women preferred his brother, and he\u2019d never cared much until now.</p><p>As Law leaned around her for a peek, he saw her simply stare at Riley. His gut clenched.</p><p>His brother frowned down at her. \u201cAre you going to bite me again?\u201d</p><p>She gasped a little and scrambled back\u2014into his arms. She turned on Law. \u201cYou two! I remember. You came into my suite and pretended to deliver food. You drugged me.\u201d</p><p>Kinley stared at him as well. She probably only saw a monster who\u2019d kidnapped her from her wedding\u2014a rough-and-tumble ex-soldier who was better at killing than talking. Still, he had to try to reach her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Deep breath. No one is going to harm you here.\u201d</p><p>His reassurances didn\u2019t make her look any less terrified. \u201cM-my fianc\u00e9 is wealthy. He\u2019ll pay you a big ransom for my return. Anything you want.\u201d</p><p>Jansen probably would, but Law didn\u2019t give a shit. \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in money. Are you hungry? Do you want breakfast?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her face paling beneath her smudged makeup. Her hair was a complete mess and every inch of her dress looked wrinkled and worn. And he both felt bad for Kinley and found her adorable.</p><p>\u201cSo you can poison me after you drugged me? I\u2019ll pass. If you let me go right now, I won\u2019t call the police. How late is it? I need to get back to the hotel. I need to get married today,\u201d she said with a grim look of determination. There was no desperate pleading for her love, just a simple statement of duty.</p><p>In his gut, Law knew he was right about her. It made him very patient.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday now, baby. You were supposed to get married Saturday afternoon, so it\u2019s all right for you to take a shower, change your clothes, and eat some breakfast. I\u2019ll make some eggs and toast.\u201d It was all he could cook.</p><p>Her hands shook a little. She put one to her head as though trying to clear it. \u201cIt\u2019s Sunday? How long was I out? Why did you bring me here? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>Law wanted to reach out a hand to steady her so badly, but knew the tactic would be counterproductive just now. \u201cWe\u2019ll explain everything once you\u2019re dressed and fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I have to get out of here now. I have to find Greg. How am I going to explain this to him?\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s eyes narrowed, and Law knew whatever came out of his mouth was going to be nasty. He was obviously taking on the bad-cop role. Because he\u2019d been listening to Dominic again. Because he wanted her and he didn\u2019t know how to not imagine that she wasn\u2019t Simone all over again. Riley hated being confused. It brought out his worst. Law sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou miss your sugar daddy?\u201d Riley glared.</p><p>Kinley whirled back to his brother and her voice shook. \u201cHe\u2019s my fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>It was obvious to Law that she hadn\u2019t enjoyed the accusation.</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t obvious to Riley. \u201cReally? You had a very quick engagement. You went out with him for a month and decided you were in love?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes slid to the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. I\u2019m not talking until you tell me why I\u2019m here. If you don\u2019t want money...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, I think you don\u2019t love Jansen any more than he loves you. I think he bought you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s utterly ridiculous,\u201d she shot back. \u201cI don\u2019t have to listen to this. Move out of my way. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d Riley didn\u2019t budge, just crossed his arms over his chest and blocked the narrow hallway. Then he invaded her space, backing her up into Law. \u201cI think Jansen wanted your social connections. They would be very helpful to a man like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man like him?\u201d</p><p>Riley sent her an ugly laugh. \u201cLike you don\u2019t know everything about Jansen. I have no doubt that you know exactly what he does for a living and you just don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an importer,\u201d she replied hesitantly, nervously, trying to stand her ground. \u201cHe imports merchandise, then he sells it. He also helps foreign companies make connections in the States.\u201d</p><p>Kinley sounded like she was repeating something she\u2019d forced herself to memorize.</p><p>\u201cBaby, no.\u201d Law kept his voice low because he was pretty sure she was going to be hurt by the fact that Jansen had been lying to her. \u201cHe\u2019s a criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I\u2019ve been to his offices. His business is legitimate. Your accusations are preposterous, and I\u2019m not talking to you. Stop calling me baby.\u201d</p><p>Riley pressed his advantage, towering over her, backing her up again until her ass rubbed his cock. \u201cHis business is a front. He\u2019s in bed with more than one mafia group. He\u2019s making a name for himself in the cleaning biz.\u201d</p><p>Law gripped her hips to keep her from backing into his granite-stiff erection. \u201cIt\u2019s true, swee... My brother isn\u2019t lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg doesn\u2019t own Laundromats,\u201d she argued.</p><p>Riley\u2019s eyes rolled. \u201cGoing to play the dumb blonde, huh? He launders money, cupcake. But I suspect you knew that. How many people died so you could have that ridiculously expensive luggage or wear that overdone bling all over the ass of your jeans? You think you\u2019re just selling him your social connections and that pretty, tight pussy of yours, but he\u2019s Satan and you sold him your soul.\u201d</p><p>A loud smack cracked the air around them as Kinley slapped Riley\u2019s cheek. She didn\u2019t back down an inch now. She tilted her head up and glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me that way! I might be here against my will, but I won\u2019t have it. I\u2019m still a lady.\u201d</p><p>Riley stepped back. \u201cSure you are, cupcake. The sort who sells herself to gangsters.\u201d</p><p>Law sighed. His brother was fucking this up. \u201cEnough, bro. Let her shower and eat and take a fucking breath.\u201d</p><p>Kinley ignored him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your game is or what you want, but I don\u2019t deserve this. If you\u2019re some enemy of Greg\u2019s, then take up your problems with him. Why involve me, especially by taking me from my wedding?\u201d</p><p>Tears streaked down her face, ruining what was left of her makeup, and Law couldn\u2019t stand it a second longer. \u201cKinley, we\u2019re not going to hurt you. I promise. We really are here to help you. You don\u2019t know Jansen or what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. If you\u2019ll calm down, I\u2019ll explain it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you realize that your fianc\u00e9 took out a life insurance policy on you two weeks ago?\u201d Riley butted in.</p><p>Her eyes widened. That got her attention... Then her body slumped, shoulders curling in as though she was protecting herself from a blow. \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Riley confirmed. \u201cI have copies of the policy, Kinley. In the event of your death, he\u2019s the sole beneficiary.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and seemed to rally. \u201cSo? Married people take out policies on one another. They protect their future, just in case. I\u2019m sure he took one out on himself, too. He probably meant to tell me, but life has been so chaotic. All we\u2019ve been able to talk about lately is the wedding. After the ceremony, he would have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t. And he didn\u2019t buy a policy that would protect you in the event of his death. He only made sure that he\u2019d pocket money if you died.\u201d Law hated stripping away her illusions. She might not love Greg Jansen, but she\u2019d certainly thought well enough of him to marry him and trust her future with him. His guess? Kinley felt guilty for not loving her fianc\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t prove anything. I\u2019m sure after our honeymoon, he would have talked to me about taking out a policy on him. You\u2019re acting like insurance is a crime. I\u2019m sure he just...wanted to feel secure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he needed a ten-million-dollar policy to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She half gasped, half choked the question. \u201cTen million dollars? Why would he need that much money if I died? He\u2019s already rich.\u201d</p><p>Now she was finally listening. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question, one we\u2019ve been asking since we discovered the policy.\u201d Law nudged Riley out of the way and led her to the great room. \u201cI know this is a lot to think about. Sit down and I\u2019ll get you some coffee, baby.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand up to stop him. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to sit down and have a civilized conversation with the men who drugged me and took me to...god knows where. Just because Greg did something that doesn\u2019t make sense to you, you\u2019re casting him in the worst possible light. There must be some reasonable explanation. If I asked him to explain it, I have little doubt it would be perfectly logical. Why are you even telling me this? You\u2019re criminals, men who kidnap innocent women. And I told you to stop calling me baby.\u201d</p><p>Riley was right back to his interrogation. \u201cUse your head, Kinley. We know why you\u2019re marrying Jansen, and it has absolutely nothing to do with love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow would you know that?\u201d</p><p>Riley shrugged a little as though he didn\u2019t really give a shit. \u201cIt\u2019s the way women like you work.\u201d</p><p>Her perfectly plucked brows rose. \u201cWomen like me? What do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m beautiful?\u201d She frowned, then shook off the question. \u201cNever mind. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s stare slid off her, his fist clenching. \u201cYeah. Gorgeous society women like you don\u2019t give a shit what a man is really like. You only care about how much money he has or how he can enhance your public image.\u201d</p> <p>His brother was never going to get over Simone. One lousy woman, one lame relationship, and she\u2019d ruined Riley for all time. God, Law wished he\u2019d never fucking met her.</p><p>\u201cGive Kinley a break,\u201d he told his brother.</p><p>Once again, she seemed intent on defending herself. Law was actually a little proud of her.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea who I am,\u201d she insisted through clenched teeth. \u201cNone. And I don\u2019t want breakfast. I want to go back to the hotel. Greg must be waiting to hear from me and is terribly worried. You ruined my wedding, you bastards. I\u2019m supposed to be on my honeymoon now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Riley got right in her face. His voice was low and grave.</p><p>\u201cRy, tread lightly.\u201d He felt the same way, but there was no reason to piss her off. It was obvious she didn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><p>Kinley didn\u2019t even look at him, preferring to stare at Riley. Hands on her hips, she rose to her tiptoes, but she still couldn\u2019t even reach his chin. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not kidding, and please watch your language. You have a horrible potty mouth.\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s whole face turned red. He wasn\u2019t used to women doing anything but falling at his feet. Law had to admit, it was kind of cool to watch his usually unflappable brother fucking up right and left with a woman. \u201cYou are either insane or stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you are rude!\u201d Kinley screamed right back at him.</p><p>Not only was Riley rude, he also looked hard. His brother\u2019s erection was practically poking her in the belly. If his damn jeans weren\u2019t so tight, his cock would very likely be knocking on Kinley\u2019s stomach right that second.</p><p>He might be acting like the bad cop, but Riley was obviously the horny cop. And that probably pissed him off. He didn\u2019t want to want Kinley.</p><p>Slowly, her body softened. Her lips flushed and parted. She was responding. To his brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to speak really slowly so you can understand.\u201d Sarcasm dripped from Riley\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you don\u2019t know why Jansen asked you to marry him, but I do. Ten million dollars, cupcake. He was going to kill you on your honeymoon and collect the insurance money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am going to use very small words so you can understand. Fuck off.\u201d She slapped her right hand over her mouth. \u201cYou made me curse!\u201d</p><p>Riley growled and rolled his eyes.</p><p>She turned to Law, her shoulders squaring. \u201cYou can\u2019t prove any of this and you\u2019re wrong. Let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually, we will\u2014but not until it\u2019s safe. But you need to listen to us. We do have evidence and we\u2019re going to prove our case to you.\u201d</p><p>All that blonde hair ruffled around her shoulders as she shook her head stubbornly. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to prove that Greg is a criminal because he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so sure, then it won\u2019t hurt to listen. But you can\u2019t listen without eating, sweet...I\u2019m sorry. Kinley.\u201d Law remembered that she didn\u2019t want endearments from him. And it pissed him off. \u201cThat\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>She sighed in annoyance. \u201cI can\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like eggs? I\u2019ll get you something else.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and hesitated, clearly not wanting to admit the reason. \u201cI can\u2019t eat when my dress is so tight. And I can\u2019t get out of it by myself. I tried. I can\u2019t unbutton the back without help.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. He had to undress her. His fantasy and his nightmare rolled into one. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI promise not to touch you. I\u2019ll be careful. I don\u2019t mean to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>She slowly turned around, as if she wasn\u2019t really sure this was a good idea. But if she wanted out of the dress, what were her more appealing options?</p><p>Finally, she showed him the elaborate back. The bodice was snug in a good way, and he couldn\u2019t help but notice how it exaggerated the curve of her waist, the way her skin glowed against the lace, looking creamy and so damn soft. He wanted nothing more than to run his hand down every patch as he exposed it, but he couldn\u2019t. His hands were callused. They didn\u2019t belong touching anything so fine as her flesh.</p><p>Riley sat down on the sofa, shaking his head in an exasperated fashion. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to torture her. That dress already does it. We should leave her in the sucker until she tells us what we need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d Law sent Riley a nasty glare as he stared at the buttons. Would the calluses on his hands snag the silk?</p><p>\u201cCan you not undo it? Is it too tight? Oh, god. Are you going to have to cut me out?\u201d She sounded horrified. \u201cIt really is too small for me. Becks was right; I shouldn\u2019t have picked this dress.\u201d</p><p>Becks was full of shit. The dress was perfect. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely on you. And it fits just fine. It\u2019s supposed to hug your curves, baby.\u201d Damn it. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Kinley looked over her shoulder at him. \u201cApology accepted. I usually like endearments. Just not from my kidnapper.\u201d</p><p>She should have someone in her life who adored her, who called her baby or sweetheart every day of her life.</p><p>He reached for the top button, his hand shaking slightly. \u201cIs it all right if I move your hair so I can reach the buttons?\u201d</p><p>The soft honey strands were everywhere, long tresses of blonde silk that made him want to fist it as he fucked her deep. Law swallowed against his lust.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I would do it myself, but my arms are sore. I think I slept on them wrong.\u201d</p><p>He brushed the curtain of golden tresses to the side and stared at her graceful neck and feminine shoulders. God, he was the horny cop now. What was he doing? Staring at her back and thinking about all the things he wanted to do to her once he got her undressed.</p><p>With a curse, Law forced himself to move. He began to unbutton the dress. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your arms. We tried to make you comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, most of the time you were being held like a baby,\u201d Riley interjected.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She sounded scandalized by the thought they\u2019d been anywhere near her in her sleep.</p><p>\u201cWould you shut it?\u201d Law snapped. \u201cNow she thinks we\u2019re perverts. We have a purpose. Convincing her that Jansen is a creep. Let\u2019s not stray.\u201d</p><p>And as soon as they were alone, he was going to have a long talk with his brother. Especially since Kinley had been softening again, responding to his attempts to be gentle. It worked\u2014except Riley kept pissing her off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrible when I\u2019m under the influence of anything. God, please tell me I didn\u2019t do something I\u2019ll regret.\u201d</p><p>How the hell could Riley or Dominic think she was a manipulative bitch? Here she was being held hostage by three men she didn\u2019t know and she was worried that she had done something wrong.</p><p>Kinley wasn\u2019t a gold digger. She was the perfect sub, sweet and soft. Yet there was a core of strength to her. The people around her took advantage of her kind nature, her desire to please others. She, no doubt, had a hard time saying no. She needed a strong Dominant partner to lift her up and lend his strength.</p><p>But it wouldn\u2019t be him. He just had to make sure Dominic didn\u2019t tear her up while he sought his pound of flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou were very sweet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to marry you,\u201d Riley said with the hint of a grin.</p><p>Her shoulders squared again. \u201cWell, that was obviously the drugs talking. When I wasn\u2019t on a cocktail of god knows what, I showed you how I really felt. I bit you. And I\u2019ll do it again if you try to touch me.\u201d</p><p>Law had half the buttons undone, but now he saw another problem. She was wearing a delicate, lacy white garment with metal boning. Corset. She was corseted and she was lovely. Fuck, she would look so gorgeous walking around his club wearing nothing but that corset, a tiny white thong, and stilettos. And his collar, of course. But he would never leave her in a corset for this long. Never. \u201cCan you even breathe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a corset I see?\u201d Riley loved them on a woman, and he sounded choked that Kinley might be wearing one.</p><p>Her skin flushed everywhere. She wouldn\u2019t be able to lie effectively. The pink of her skin would always give her away. Law counted that as a plus.</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way I could fit in the dress. I think I need to sit down. I\u2019m very dizzy.\u201d She fell back into his arms, her whole body going limp.</p><p>Damn it. She\u2019d starved herself trying to get into that dress, then they had fed her sedatives and failed to remove a device that restricted her breathing. Fucking brilliant. \u201cGive me a knife. I\u2019m getting her out of this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Riley was at his side, handing him his pocketknife and finally looking like he gave a damn. \u201cShould I get her some water?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered back open. \u201cDid I pass out? Was I dreaming? Please let me be back in New York. I\u2019ll click my heels three times and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. This isn\u2019t a dream, and you aren\u2019t in New York. There\u2019s no help for the dress. You need to breathe.\u201d He sliced through the buttons and then made short work of the lacy ties of the corset.</p><p>She breathed a deep sigh of relief. \u201cOh, my god, that feels so good.\u201d</p><p>The corset had left deep grooves in her skin, a map of where it had held her in. He touched one, unable to stop himself, and felt her shiver.</p><p>With distaste? With desire?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter because they were no longer alone. Dominic stormed into the room.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what you two have done?\u201d He was in full-on angry commander mode and the soldier who had never quite left Law responded.</p><p>\u201cSir, no, sir.\u201d</p><p>Kinley held the front of her dress to her chest and tried to scramble away, but she was caught in her skirts. She blinked up, her eyes wide and focused on Dominic.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on in here? Why isn\u2019t she dressed and ready to talk? Law, I swear to god, if you fucked her, I\u2019m going to beat the shit out of you. She is the hostage, not your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s hostage. Let me go!\u201d Kinley demanded, obviously realizing that Dominic held some power over that situation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dominic scowled. \u201cNo. You\u2019re going to be our guest here until we get the information we need. That was the plan, but now we have to step it up because of something your careless suitor did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Law\u2019s head shook. \u201cCrap. The cameras in the hallway of the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDing, ding, ding. Get the man a prize.\u201d Dominic flicked on the television and quickly found one of the national cable news shows. Within five seconds, Law felt his eyes widen as a clip of grainy CCTV footage came over the television.</p><p>\u201cHeiress Kinley Kohl was kidnapped yesterday afternoon from her hotel room in New York City. She was preparing for her four o\u2019clock wedding to controversial tycoon, Greg Jansen...\u201d</p> <p>The news anchor went on, but Law barely heard her because he was far too busy watching the scene play out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Kinley said, watching the screen intently. \u201cOh, I look horrible. Is that when I asked you to marry me? No wonder you said no.\u201d</p><p>Riley snorted. \u201cActually, I had a moment of insanity and said yes. Oh, here it comes.\u201d On the screen, Law turned his face up and was captured right there for everyone in the world to see. \u201cThat\u2019s the twenty-five-to-life shot, big brother.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, how had he done something that sloppy? He hadn\u2019t been thinking at all. He\u2019d been worried about Kinley and forgotten about the cameras. Now he\u2019d screwed everything up. \u201cWe\u2019re on a clock.\u201d</p><p>It could have taken the police days to realize Kinley Kohl wasn\u2019t a runaway bride. He, Dom, and Riley should have had up to a week to really talk to her, to bring her to their side and win her help. With that one image, they were out of time.</p> <p>Dominic kept his eyes on the screen. \u201cYep, and it started the minute you looked up at that camera. So we\u2019re not going to play games anymore.\u201d He turned to Kinley. \u201cYou will get up. You will dress yourself or I will do it for you. And you won\u2019t like what I pick out for you. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>She moved to Law, reaching for him. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><p>He let her take his hand. Just because he\u2019d screwed up didn\u2019t mean Dominic should take it out on her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Kinley. He\u2019s not going to hurt you, either. Can you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, I\u2019ll keep you safe, baby. Just go get dressed. Then we\u2019ll sit down and eat and have a perfectly nice talk. I know I look scary, but I won\u2019t hurt you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back, and he felt the loss of her warmth. Just for a moment, she\u2019d been looking up at him with softness in those eyes. \u201cA-all right. Please excuse me. And you don\u2019t look scary. You\u2019re quite handsome, but I suspect you know that.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic stepped up, towering over Kinley. \u201cDon\u2019t try to run. The whole place is secure and you\u2019ll only get hurt if you run.\u201d</p><p>Her chin came up in a stubborn pout. \u201cI think you would be surprised what I can do. Where are we? Upstate New York? We can\u2019t have traveled too far. Somehow I think I could find my way to a road, Mr. Whatever your name is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dominic Anthony, and this isn\u2019t New York, honey. Welcome to Alaska.\u201d</p><p>For the second time that morning, Kinley fainted, dropping into Law\u2019s arms. He hoisted her up and held her to his chest before turning to Dominic. \u201cI hope you\u2019re fucking happy. She was starting to trust me. You just ruined all of that. I\u2019m going to make sure she gets something to eat. She can\u2019t give you information if she\u2019s passed out or dead.\u201d</p><p>Law carried her out, wondering why he\u2019d ever agreed to this scheme in the first place.</p><p>Dominic walked into the kitchen, well aware that he was completely unwanted there. Law had taken his damn time. An hour had passed since he\u2019d carried her out like a fainting Southern belle\u2019s gallant beau.</p><p>\u201cWow, he\u2019s serious,\u201d Riley had said, then gone thoughtfully silent as they both waited.</p><p>Well, Dominic was serious, too, and it was long past time that he got Law firmly on the same page as him and Riley.</p> <p>He stopped as he caught sight of her. She was sitting in front of the big bay windows, staring out at the expanse of trees and grass and mountains in the distance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a whole lot of nature. Like way too much nature.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cDo you think there are animals out there?\u201d</p><p>Law laughed, the sound of a deeply amused man. \u201cAbsolutely. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many, baby.\u201d</p><p>He needed to rein this thing in. She was beautiful and seemed fragile, but he knew something Law didn\u2019t. \u201cTell him about your charity, Kinley. Tell him about the checks you\u2019ve been writing.\u201d</p><p>She turned, a startled expression settling on her face. \u201cWhat? You can\u2019t have abducted me to talk about Hope House.\u201d</p><p>Luckily, he had everything laid out. He opened the folder in his hand and set the documents Riley had dug up on the table in front of her. \u201cIs that your handwriting?\u201d</p><p>She set her coffee mug down, then picked up one of the copies of the checks. Her face flushed. \u201cYes. That looks like my signature. But why is it made out to \u2018Cash\u2019? I never need cash for the charity. Everything comes through vendors and we use our Tax ID to get exemption. These are the private checks, but they\u2019re just for backup. I\u2019ve never used one.\u201d</p><p>So she was going to play dumb. \u201cOver the last six weeks, you\u2019ve drained almost fifty thousand dollars out of that charity.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand to her mouth. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. You\u2019re lying!\u201d</p><p>And now Riley came in handy. He had his laptop open and ready. \u201cThis is your bank account for the charity. As you can see, over the last six weeks, there have been five checks written for cash, each for nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents. One penny more and you would have been required to fill out forms. Someone knows their banking regulations. You\u2019re down to almost nothing in that account.\u201d</p><p>He saw Law\u2019s face fall as he looked down at the evidence in front of him. Damn, Dominic knew he was to blame for this mistake. He\u2019d allowed Law to focus fully on surveillance and hadn\u2019t brought him into the loop during the investigative portion. All Law needed was firm proof that his honey was involved in Jansen\u2019s organization, and he would stop thinking with his dick and be ready to roll on the mission again.</p><p>Law took a step back from Kinley. \u201cWhen did the money start disappearing? What date? What time was the check cashed?\u201d</p><p>Riley ran his hands across the computer screen. \u201cThe first date was May tenth and the time stamp on the check is two thirty-five pm.\u201d</p><p>Law held up a hand. \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d</p><p>Kinley sank into her chair. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I knew the balance was bad, but I had no idea the account was so close to empty. Greg promised he would write a check for a hundred thousand as a wedding present to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a wedding present or to cover your tracks?\u201d Dominic paced as he talked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! It wasn\u2019t to cover up anything. It was the first part of the fifty million he promised to endow the charity with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Did he ask you to take out the funds?\u201d</p><p>There was a time and a place to be the good cop. He\u2019d be the best cop ever if she could help him pin illegal activities on Jansen.</p><p>\u201cGreg never mentioned anything about it. I know this looks bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis looks criminal,\u201d Riley pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t have anything to do with this.\u201d</p><p>Was she telling the truth? Dominic sat across from her. Sometimes he thought he\u2019d become far too cynical because he saw lies everywhere. Still, he had those checks. She\u2019d signed them. She\u2019d taken the money. Maybe she\u2019d had virtuous reasons. Maybe not.</p><p>Dominic felt a little wave of peace flow over him. He was in control again. This was right where he needed to be. She didn\u2019t know it yet, but he was her best bet to avoid both jail time and her own murder. \u201cThen don\u2019t make me use this. Work with me. Let\u2019s talk about your fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already tried, man,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>He ignored his friend. \u201cThe feds haven\u2019t been able to catch your fianc\u00e9, but I\u2019m going to.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes came up, narrowing as she looked him over. \u201cWhat did you say your name was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dominic Anthony.\u201d There was no reason to lie to her. At the end of the day, she would be grateful he\u2019d helped her. And if her gratitude didn\u2019t keep them out of the pen, then he would blackmail her with the information she was looking at.</p><p>\u201cAre you any relation to Carrie Anthony?\u201d</p><p>His gut turned a little. Had that fucker been talking about her? \u201cYes. She was my younger sister.\u201d</p><p>Those brown eyes turned sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about her death. She was far too young to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she was.\u201d He let a moment of silence pass. \u201cEspecially since Greg killed her.\u201d</p><p>She should fully understand why he had chosen this path.</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is all about?\u201d She stared at him. \u201cMr. Anthony, I am truly sorry about your sister. Greg says she was a wonderful woman. He has a portrait of her that he keeps in the house. She was so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Rage threatened to choke him at the thought of Jansen staring at a picture of his sister and remembering how easy it had been to take her money and her life.</p><p>Kinley leaned forward, her hand almost touching his. \u201cBut she was sick. It wasn\u2019t Greg\u2019s fault. He tried to get her into rehab.\u201d</p><p>Dominic practically saw red. Before he knew what he was doing, he flipped the table over, sending everything crashing to the ground. He was not going to listen to Jansen\u2019s latest piece of ass tell him his sister had been a fucking drug addict. \u201cShe never took a drug in her life. He\u2019s a greedy, murdering prick. Are you really this stupid?\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re obviously very upset. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took out a two-million-dollar policy on my sister. Do you know what he bought with the money he got for killing her? A fucking condo. And two weeks later, he moved his mistress in.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back in her chair as though needing to put space between them. \u201cHe didn\u2019t kill her. He couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Dominic refused to allow the distance she sought. He stood and hovered over her. \u201cWhy would you say that? Because you can\u2019t stand the thought that you fucked a murderer? Or because you\u2019ve known all along what he\u2019s capable of and you hate being caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDom?\u201d Riley ventured, his voice tense. \u201cDown, boy. I think you\u2019re scaring her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s scared enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty scared, but you should know that I won\u2019t let you break me. I might look silly and you can call me stupid all you like, but I won\u2019t allow you to use me against the people I care for. So if this is your best shot, Mr. Anthony, you should know you\u2019ve failed. I believe you dummied up those records. Or you stole the money yourself. You\u2019re a grieving man, and I am so sorry that your sister is dead, but I won\u2019t allow your need for revenge to ruin my life. Make a decision. Let me go or you should just take the revenge you so obviously need and make it fast.\u201d</p><p>He stopped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She was shaking, but she stared up at him with steady eyes. \u201cI mean, I would prefer that you kill me quickly. You obviously can\u2019t let me go, and this would be a great way to get back at Greg if he loved me. You know he doesn\u2019t, though. I think he likes me all right, but he\u2019s marrying me to help his business. I\u2019m quite a good hostess and I can help him in high society. He\u2019ll likely be upset, but I doubt he\u2019ll mourn me for long.\u201d</p><p>Kinley thought he was going to kill her? She actually believed he would take the life of a woman to avenge his sister. Suddenly, he couldn\u2019t think of a single reason why she shouldn\u2019t think he was a killer.</p><p>Dominic stepped back, nausea threatening. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me go home.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do that. He\u2019d put them all in this situation and there was nothing to do except go through with his plans. He had to prove Jansen\u2019s guilt to her. He had to break her down. \u201cNo. You\u2019ll rest for a while. Then we\u2019re going to talk. I know you won\u2019t believe me, but this is for your own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me here forever.\u201d</p><p>He turned and started to walk out. He needed to ready the big guns. He\u2019d hoped to spare her the worst of the knowledge, but she needed to understand exactly who she was trying to protect.</p><p>It made him a bastard, but he had to destroy all of her illusions. He wondered, just for the briefest of moments, if he was really saving her. If she was as innocent as she seemed, what he was about to show her might break her heart.</p><p>Well, he was proof positive that a person could live without one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Kinley looked around her rather nicely appointed prison with Egyptian cotton sheets, solid wood furniture, and a stunning spa-like bathroom. She\u2019d assumed that when Dominic said they could hold her here forever, he\u2019d been exaggerating. Now, she wasn\u2019t so sure. Her \u201ccell\u201d and everything she\u2019d seen of the place certainly looked self-contained enough to make that possible.</p><p>She\u2019d tried all the doors and the windows, even to the point of attempting to break one. But someone had installed ridiculously thick glass. Her puny attempts to break through it had resulted in nothing except sore arms and frustration.</p> <p>She\u2019d finally given up and showered, then slipped on clean clothes. It was practically heaven to be out of that tight dress. Kinley had eschewed her jeans for a cotton skirt and long sleeved T-shirt. They didn\u2019t have any plan to rape her, it seemed. They\u2019d had ample opportunity while she\u2019d been passed out and hadn\u2019t taken advantage of it. Since her skirt wouldn\u2019t be making her ravishment easier for them, why not be comfortable?</p><p>When she\u2019d awakened in her posh prison, she\u2019d been surprised to find all her luggage and then some, including the cases of island wear she\u2019d packed for her honeymoon in the Caymans. With all the sandals, swimsuits, and sundresses, she wasn\u2019t packed for Alaska\u2014and Kinley suspected that\u2019s where she might actually be. She didn\u2019t hear the hum of a fan or air conditioner. If she\u2019d been in upstate New York in summer, wouldn\u2019t they need some cool air by midday?</p><p>The other bit of evidence? The warm clothing the guys had bought her. Law? He seemed like the concerned one. She was struck by the fact that none of the garments were as utilitarian as she would have expected a man to buy. The sweaters were all soft and cheerful, in colors she would have bought for herself because they complemented her complexion. The sweatpants were adorable and stylish with bling running down the pant legs. Even the socks were pink and fuzzy. It was as though someone had shopped with her taste in mind. Why would they care if the clothes they bought pleased her?</p><p>They were unusual kidnappers who apparently didn\u2019t watch TV to see how bad guys should really behave. She should probably be as scared as she\u2019d been when she\u2019d first awakened and realized they had locked her in the unfamiliar bedroom. But that level of fear was hard to maintain when her abductors had done little but feed and clothe her. Someone had even charged her iPad so she wouldn\u2019t be bored. If they were going to give her a diversion, Kinley didn\u2019t imagine they were going to waterboard her or stick bamboo shoots under her nails.</p><p>What they hadn\u2019t done was give her a sense of time. The sun was still up\u2014and didn\u2019t it stay up forever in Alaska in the summer?\u2014but she had no idea how many hours had gone by. They\u2019d taken all the clocks. Without Internet, her tablet wouldn\u2019t tell the time in her current time zone. And she\u2019d never gotten a cellular data plan for it. The rest of the room was bare with the exception of a plush queen bed, an elegant nightstand, one chair, and a lamp that hadn\u2019t proven to be as sturdy as the locked window. One blow and it was broken.</p> <p>Maybe not her best move. When night fell would she be left alone in the dark?</p><p>She gazed out the window at the mountains in the distance, heavily covered by green everywhere\u2014trees, bushes, soft grass, dotted with a few fledging flowers, all surrounding a lake. The views were sweeping, incredible. She\u2019d only been to upstate New York once, so she certainly hadn\u2019t seen all of it, but the bit she recalled hadn\u2019t looked this majestic. Still, she had to hold out hope that she wasn\u2019t too far from civilization to escape, that home wasn\u2019t over four thousand miles away...</p><p>A brief knock sounded on the door before it opened too quickly for her to barricade it.</p><p>The biggest one walked in carrying the one thing guaranteed to make her feel better.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might want her.\u201d He held Gigi in his big, callused hands that had been so gentle when he\u2019d gotten her out of that god-awful corset. He was Law. The name suited him.</p><p>Her sweet Yorkie looked no worse for the wear. Gigi\u2019s little body shook, and she yipped and barked with joy.</p> <p>With tears of relief, Kinley grabbed her sweet little puppy and held her close, filled with a guilty sense of happiness. She hated that Gigi and been nabbed and wondered how she\u2019d been enduring captivity so far. But she was so relieved to have her puppy\u2014one of her most beloved comforts\u2014here with her.</p><p>\u201cThey brought you here? Oh, baby girl. Are you okay? Were you scared?\u201d</p><p>Gigi just licked her nose, rubbing their faces together.</p><p>\u201cShe might have been scared, but she fought back.\u201d A lopsided grin bent Law\u2019s lips. God, when he smiled, her heart tended to stutter in a way it shouldn\u2019t about a man who had kidnapped and drugged her. A criminal shouldn\u2019t have a smile like that. \u201cShe had the good sense to bite the shit out of my brother. He struck out with both the Kohl females.\u201d</p><p>Silently, Kinley cheered on her dog. \u201cGigi is the sweetest little thing to me. Not so much to others. And she can bark like crazy when she doesn\u2019t get her food on time. She\u2019s used to being fed twice a day and she knows when it\u2019s dinner time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that explains a lot. She\u2019s been a little high strung.\u201d He sobered as he looked at the lamp on the floor. \u201cDid you try to break the windows or was the lamp just particularly offensive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to not try to escape.\u201d She turned away. Maybe if she ignored him, he would leave. Being alone was preferable to being with criminals.</p><p>Was Greg a criminal?</p> <p>\u201cThe windows are hurricane glass. A couple of years back, the owners had some trouble with hunters and stray bullets. They have kids and a whole lot of money, so they changed all the windows in the house. They\u2019re very heavy and almost impossible to shatter. The house has a top-of-the-line security system in place as well. We\u2019d know if you somehow managed to even crack a window and we\u2019d be on you very quickly.\u201d His voice softened. \u201cYou can\u2019t get away, Kinley, and you wouldn\u2019t be very happy if you did. We\u2019re miles away from anything you\u2019d call civilization. There really are bears out there. You could get hurt.\u201d</p><p>She clutched her dog. \u201cIf you\u2019re so worried about me, why did you kidnap me from a beautiful bridal suite in Manhattan and bring me to this wilderness?\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the bed, his big frame incongruous against the flowery comforter. He was a masculine beast in feminine surroundings. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe me, but we\u2019re trying to protect you, bab...Kinley.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she was buying that. \u201cThis is about the big guy\u2019s revenge. How did you get wrapped up in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDominic and I stick together through thick and thin. Always have, always will.\u201d</p><p>So she guessed the idea of trying to divide and conquer them wouldn\u2019t get her anywhere. If Law was willing to risk prison time to help Dominic, that said something serious about their bond. The only person she\u2019d do that for was Annabelle, so she knew they must be thick.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry about his sister. But I don\u2019t think I can do anything to give him the...closure he\u2019s looking for.\u201d</p><p>Kinley really was sorry. She couldn\u2019t imagine losing her sister. Becks might not be the most thoughtful sibling on the planet, but she was blood, family. Whatever his faults\u2014and she\u2019d bet there were plenty\u2014Dominic had really loved his sister and grieved her now. Losing her to an overdose must have been terrible.</p><p>\u201cCarrie never took drugs,\u201d Law said softly. \u201cI grew up with her. I was in the same grade as Dominic, but we came from different sides of the tracks, to say the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came from money.\u201d She could tell. He had an air of authority that she\u2019d seen emanate from the wealthiest of men. It came from the world being at their feet.</p><p>\u201cA lot of it. And Ry and I...didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did you two meet Dominic?\u201d Usually kids with such divergent upbringings didn\u2019t meet. She and Annabelle were the exception more than the rule.</p><p>Law shrugged, not like he didn\u2019t know, but like he was uncomfortable. \u201cMy dad ran off when Ry and I were kids. Mom...well, she did everything she could to keep us clothed and fed. I was out hustling kids out of their money at the movie theater one day. Cards, dice, whatever game of chance I could rig. I didn\u2019t beat anyone up for it, but some of the other little pukes did. They started picking on Dominic because he was rich and hadn\u2019t gone through puberty yet, so he was small. I thought three teenagers against a twelve-year-old was crappy and unfair. I was a few months older and had already started my growth spurt...and I liked fights, so I jumped in. Ry helped. Dominic became our best friend after that. Since Carrie was younger than him, I kind of watched her grow up. She didn\u2019t do drugs. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>Had Law been in love with her? She knew she shouldn\u2019t care, but he was being so gentle now, it was easy to imagine that he\u2019d bestowed that tenderness on Carrie in the years he had known her before she\u2019d died. Yet... Kinley hated to admit that Law being in love with Dominic\u2019s late sister bothered her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not as a teenager,\u201d she argued. \u201cBut she was a model. That world is very fast. You can\u2019t know what she did, then. Unless you were with her in New York.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cOh no. We were getting our asses shot off in Afghanistan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, me and Dominic.\u201d</p><p>Why would the rich guy go into a warzone? \u201cDid he go to one of the academies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were nineteen when 9-11 happened. Dominic said he couldn\u2019t sit in a classroom when his country was in danger. He left Harvard to join up. I followed him.\u201d Law shrugged. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let him go alone.\u201d</p><p>Her sister wouldn\u2019t even go to the bathroom with her. Only Annabelle had ever been that kind of friend. She knew the deep connection it had taken for Law to follow his friend into battle. Kinley even had to give Dominic some grudging respect. What kind of courage had it taken for him to leave his wealth and privilege behind to serve his country on the other side of the world?</p><p>Of course, Law could be lying, too, to win her goodwill or sympathy or whatever. Kidnappers were criminals who didn\u2019t normally do good things. \u201cI don\u2019t need to know your history.\u201d</p><p>She just wanted to escape. Maybe she and Greg could rearrange the wedding quickly with the same understanding in place. Certainly, she could convince him to pay for her father\u2019s procedure until they could schedule the ceremony again. The first payment to the hospital was due in a week. Her fianc\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t punish her father by making him skip his treatment because she\u2019d been kidnapped...would he?</p><p>\u201cYeah, you need to know this part. We had finished up our third tour of duty. We were back here in the States for training. Carrie had married Greg while we were gone. By then, we\u2019d moved onto Special Forces and our missions were a matter of national security. We didn\u2019t go to the wedding, but Riley did. He told Dominic and I both that he had serious concerns about how Greg treated Carrie. One night a couple of months later, Dominic got a phone call from her. She left a voicemail because, well, we had the night off and we were taking advantage of it.\u201d</p><p>He flushed just a little, letting her know that they hadn\u2019t exactly been playing charades. Kinley frowned. Had they been taking advantage of someone together? No. Oh. Oh. Were they gay? That was a horrible thought. It was kind of an insult to women everywhere that those two amazing hunks of masculinity would be interested in each other. She would have never guess it, but...</p><p>Why did her hot kidnappers have to be gay?</p><p>Irrelevant. She forced herself off that mental track. \u201cWhat did her message say?\u201d</p><p>Greg had explained that his first wife had suffered bouts of depression. He\u2019d cared for her greatly, but in the end he hadn\u2019t been able to love her enough to save her.</p><p>\u201cShe sounded scared.\u201d Law stared at her, as if willing her to understand. \u201cShe said that she was leaving Greg and needed Dominic to call her. She was perfectly lucid and totally scared. She wasn\u2019t taking drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police found her dead twelve hours later, and I know Greg damn well killed her. Carrie was like a sister to me. He\u2019s my best friend. I can\u2019t just let it lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg was in San Francisco when she died. He couldn\u2019t have killed her.\u201d Dominic\u2019s grief was clouding his logic. Kinley might not love Greg Jansen, but she certainly didn\u2019t picture him actually killing his wife.</p><p>So why was the tiniest part of her relieved that she wasn\u2019t going on her honeymoon today?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about a man named Vincent Dargo?\u201d</p><p>Kinley shivered. He was Greg\u2019s head of security. She couldn\u2019t stand how he looked at every woman who walked by like she was a piece of meat he couldn\u2019t wait to tear into. Brutally. Viciously. \u201cI don\u2019t have much to do with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI believe in my heart that he force-fed Carrie drugs that night under the orders of his boss, Greg Jansen.\u201d</p><p>Law\u2019s words painted a brutal picture that made Kinley shudder and wrap her arms around herself. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have to stretch her imagination to think Dargo capable of that. But Greg ordering him to do it? \u201cWhy? Why should I believe you? And why should you care what happens to me?\u201d</p><p>He stood up and seemed to fill all the space in the room. \u201cI\u2019m not a gentleman, Kinley, but I\u2019m going to be very honest with you because too many people in your life haven\u2019t.\u201d He sucked out a harsh breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching you for months.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back. \u201cYou\u2019ve been stalking me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll probably use that word in court. I had to figure out who you are. I had to know if you were going into this marriage as Jansen\u2019s partner or his victim. And I figured something out about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m sure this is going to be impressive. You don\u2019t know me at all. Taking some pictures from a safe distance can\u2019t tell you anything about who I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to you for the last week certainly has.\u201d</p><p>She froze. What was he saying? Not what she feared he was. Please, no. \u201cI\u2019ve never talked to you in my life before yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you have.\u201d He stared down at her. His voice changed completely, becoming a bit higher and more nasally, the accent flattening out. \u201cYou know it. And it wasn\u2019t all a lie, Kinley.\u201d</p> <p>Tears of complete humiliation flooded her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my middle name, if that helps.\u201d The voice was Law\u2019s again. All hint of \u201cMike\u201d was gone.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d She turned away and paced, unable to look at him. \u201cWow, I\u2019m a complete idiot.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d spoken in a different voice, damn it. And why would she have expected California Mike to be in New York City?</p><p>Regardless, she should have known he was too good to be true, but she\u2019d wanted so badly to believe that someone could like her for her. To escape to a fantasyland were a decent guy just wanted to spend time with her, regardless of her name or lineage.</p><p>\u201cYou are not an idiot! Trusting, yes. But not stupid. And once this whole thing is through, we\u2019re going to talk about your bad habit of insulting yourself. I won\u2019t have it.\u201d His low voice had taken on a sexy growl.</p> <p>\u201cYou must have laughed at me, at how much I told you about myself, the feelings I shared...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, if I laughed at anything, it was the fact that I never talk much. I especially never open up. To anyone. It\u2019s why they felt safe having me talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey? Oh, you mean the other guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to get in, ask a couple of questions, figure you out, and be done. I was not supposed to talk to you for hours, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. God, Kinley, when I heard you laugh for the first time, it was like...I could see color in the world. That sounds dumb. Forget it. I\u2019m not fucking good at this. Riley\u2019s supposed to handle this part.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what he meant. She was still reeling from her own complete na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201cI made this snatch and grab so easy for you. I told you about the wedding and what suite I would be in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me how scared you were and how much you wished your mother was still around to give you advice. You told me I shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of what I wanted in life, even though I knew I\u2019d shocked the hell out of you when I explained I wanted to find a woman to share with my brothers.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d talked about how he\u2019d grown up so poor. How, after his father had left the family, his mother had turned to prostitution to feed them. He\u2019d claimed that he knew what it was like to wear faded, secondhand clothes to school because that was all he and his brother had. She\u2019d cried for him. She\u2019d hung up the phone and cried because she\u2019d felt so much pain for the little boy he had been. \u201cHow could you lie like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of it was a lie, baby. I told you all about my life. My mother died when I was barely eighteen. I worked two jobs so Riley could finish high school, then I followed Dominic into the Army. I only had to work two jobs because Dominic fed us any cash he could. So the three of us have been family for a really long time.\u201d Law put his hands on his hips and blew out a deep breath. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to go for broke and lay it out there, Kinley. I think you could be the woman to complete our family because you showed \u2018Mike\u2019 just how sweet and real you are. God, Kinley. You can\u2019t listen to your sister or the tabloids. You\u2019re smart. You\u2019re loyal. You\u2019re...damn it, you\u2019re just good. And I know that this whole situation is completely fucked up, but I want you\u2014and not just for a few nights. I think I would be a better man with you in my life. In fact, I think you would make us all better.\u201d</p> <p>A million thoughts crashed through her head. Law was Mike, and Mike could act. Such a pretty speech...but what if he\u2019d been sent to win her trust and cajole information from her again. Dominic obviously thought she knew something and wanted the information, but... Was he too angry to ask her the questions himself? Maybe they all just thought she was pathetic enough to fall for the same act twice. Or maybe\u2014</p><p>Law leaned over and brushed his lips against hers, cutting off all thought. And breathing.</p><p>Her heart pounded. Her skin flared with instant heat. What the devil was that?</p><p>He cupped the sides of her face so tenderly, looking at her like she was the key to solving all the mysteries of his universe, so perfect and precious. Kinley found herself standing there in half horror and half anticipation as he took her mouth.</p><p>Soft. She hadn\u2019t expected his lips to be so soft. Or for time to stand still for one amazing moment. She\u2019d been kissed before, sloppy stolen embraces that had done nothing but make her wonder what all the fuss was about. Even her fianc\u00e9\u2019s kisses were casual. A peck here. A peck there. He claimed he wanted her to feel securely married when they first had real intimacy, but she\u2019d known the truth. He didn\u2019t really want her like that.</p><p>The thing was...she\u2019d never cared or thought sex mattered.</p><p>Law was making her rethink that. He treated her like she was a sweet to be savored. Like she was something rich, and he was a man who had never tasted anything so good and might never again. Law held her like she was priceless.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but close her eyes and catalogue the moment\u2014the way his nose nestled against hers, his lips nibbling along her lower lip, making her shiver in delight. She took in every gentle brush of his tongue and the fact that each stroke had some electric connection to her nipples. He smelled good, all clean and minty. He\u2019d brushed his teeth before he\u2019d come in because he\u2019d wanted this to happen. He\u2019d wanted to kiss her.</p><p>Of course, he\u2019d also duped her, abducted her.</p><p>God, she was kissing her kidnapper.</p><p>She jerked away, her lips still tingling. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Law stared at her, his jaw firming stubbornly. \u201cKinley, I know none of this makes sense to you now, baby, but it will. I swear. I\u2019ve been thinking that I\u2019m too rough for you, but I see now that you need a man like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone. I don\u2019t need a criminal.\u201d She backed away, but with every step, her body protested and wanted to run back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou need all three of us,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of you. I won\u2019t let anything bad happen to you. I\u2019m crazy about you, Kinley. We\u2019re going to make sure Jansen can\u2019t hurt you like he did Carrie. Once he\u2019s behind bars, if you want to leave, I\u2019ll let you go. But I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make you want to stay with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaw? If you\u2019re done here, we need you in the office.\u201d</p><p>She gasped and turned. Riley stood in the doorway. She hadn\u2019t heard him come in, but then she\u2019d been the stupid girl kissing her abductor. And enjoying it. Not to mention wondering what it would be like to kiss him back. She\u2019d missed her chance, and suddenly her lips ached at the loss.</p><p>She turned away, refusing to meet Riley\u2019s stare, and clutched Gigi close. She hadn\u2019t been able to press her body against Law\u2019s because Gigi had been in the way. What if she hadn\u2019t been holding the puppy to her chest? Would Law have pulled her close? Would she have felt his erection pressed against her belly? Or not because it was all an act.</p><p>She felt his big hands cover her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll be back, Kinley. Be good. And Gigi, don\u2019t bite Riley again.\u201d</p><p>Her first reaction was to ask him to stay, but she bit it back. He was playing her again. He\u2019d committed a criminal act. She shouldn\u2019t feel safe with him. He was simply a smart, gorgeous man who would use any weapon at his disposal to keep her compliant.</p><p>She had to remember that. Greg\u2014the man who\u2019d sworn to help both her charity and her father\u2014was her future.</p><p>No matter what her heart wanted to believe.</p><p>Riley locked the door behind him before rushing to catch up with his brother. \u201cWhat the hell was that about?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d stood there watching them together, his brother more tender than he\u2019d ever seen with a woman. It was like watching a different human being altogether. Law was...fuck. He\u2019d seemed almost happy.</p><p>His brother turned to him. \u201cI was just talking to her. I returned her dog before Butch could eat it. We don\u2019t have to scare her into helping us. She\u2019ll be a much better ally if she\u2019s happy. I can make her trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked in on more than a friendly chat. You were kissing her.\u201d</p><p>A little smile tugged at Law\u2019s lips. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Riley felt his jaw drop. \u201cYou understand that you sound like a fucking prepubescent boy making out for the first time.\u201d</p><p>Law shrugged, looking almost euphoric. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s how I feel. With her, it\u2019s like...everything is new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is up to her neck in this shit, Law,\u201d he snarled. \u201cYou know that better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that she needs saving. Jansen is using her. I have proof that she isn\u2019t the one cashing those checks. You and Dominic think you were investigating her, but I found some surveillance photos of her when the first check was being cashed. Neither of you asked me before you accused her of stealing from her charity, but she was twelve fucking blocks away. Someone is forging her signature. I\u2019ve got three guesses who it is, and the last two don\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>If what Law said was true, then Riley had a pretty good guess who\u2019d forged Kinley\u2019s signature, too. And if she was innocent...she would soon be devastated. Of course when she inevitably broke Law\u2019s heart, he would be the one devastated. Even if she\u2019d never so much as spoken a cross word to anyone in her life, the girl came from money. She wasn\u2019t going to marry a whore\u2019s son, much less two of them, and take on a third husband for kicks. Her friends and family would be shocked. Their opinions would mean a lot to a girl like Kinley.</p><p>\u201cDo yourself a fucking favor and don\u2019t kiss her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019m not forcing her. I\u2019m being gentle. If she tells me to stop, I will. But she didn\u2019t tell me to stop and she didn\u2019t move away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, for starters, you kidnapped her. You\u2019ve still got her under lock and key. Don\u2019t you get it? She\u2019s terrified of you.\u201d</p><p>Law paled a little. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>His brother had lost his damn mind. \u201cI know so. You outweigh her by at least a hundred pounds. Twenty bucks says that if you\u2019d tried to lay her out, she would have let you because she doesn\u2019t want to piss off the badass. Think about this for two seconds. You\u2019re trying to...I don\u2019t know, ask her on a date. She\u2019s just trying to survive the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I wouldn\u2019t hurt her.\u201d Law seemed to stumble over the words.</p><p>\u201cYou also told her that you were Mike. Did you really vomit up all that shit about Mom?\u201d</p><p>Riley had never told a soul, and now he felt a bit betrayed. He\u2019d left their town and found new friends who didn\u2019t know that he was the son of the town whore. Friends who didn\u2019t know that his mother had died in a car accident with one of her johns.</p><p>Law shrugged like it was no big deal. \u201cShe\u2019s easy to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t feel so easy when she stabs you in the back with that tale of woe and walks away from you. Think, man. A debutante and a prostitute\u2019s boy? Yeah, she\u2019s really going to show you off at all her fancy society parties. I mean, she might take Dominic because he\u2019s got some polish, but the whispers that we all share women are attached to him. People will talk. She won\u2019t be able to take it. And she\u2019ll break your fucking heart then. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t tell you so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinley isn\u2019t like that. When I told her our past, she didn\u2019t judge me, you, or Mom. She said Mom amazed her because a woman had to really love her kids to do something like that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d That didn\u2019t make any sense. Socialites didn\u2019t feel for prostitutes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you. You have to get to know her for yourself. You\u2019re thinking that she\u2019s as snotty as Simone and she\u2019s not, man. Not even close. She\u2019s devoted her whole life to helping others.\u201d</p><p>God, this girl had Law so twisted in knots and thinking unclearly that it terrified Riley. \u201cPull your head out of your ass. You wanting this girl to be the one isn\u2019t going to make it true. Goddamn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget I said anything.\u201d Law\u2019s face closed up.</p> <p>Riley had gotten what he wanted, but for some damn reason, he felt like a bastard. But it was better to point out certain truths now. \u201cC\u2019mon, bro. You have to back off. Otherwise, we don\u2019t get out of this without a criminal record. Do you want us all to go to jail because you couldn\u2019t stay out of her designer jeans?\u201d</p><p>Kinley Kohl was gorgeous and soft, and she was going to bring them all down.</p><p>Law sighed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to work through this the way we would any other mission. What is our goal?\u201d</p><p>Law frowned, but Riley watched as his game face slid into place. An icy coldness overtook his features. \u201cTo gather the information we need to prove that Greg Jansen is laundering money for the mafia. Once we do that, the FBI can take over and toss the fucker in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic stepped out of the office. His face was grave. He looked them over as if he\u2019d heard what had gone on and wasn\u2019t particularly happy about it. \u201cShe\u2019s the key, Law. You\u2019ve always known that. Kinley knows something. She might not know she knows it, but it\u2019s in there. We need her to talk. I\u2019m sorry you feel something for her.\u201d</p><p>Law turned, his face a bitter mask. \u201cYeah? You don\u2019t feel anything for her? Neither one of you? If you\u2019re trying to sell me that shit, you should do a better job of hiding your hard-ons.\u201d</p><p>Riley sighed. \u201cFine, I wouldn\u2019t mind taking her to bed. If she\u2019s what she seems to be, then she\u2019s kind of sweet. At least when she\u2019s not biting me. But man, I\u2019m not going to touch that. She\u2019ll never be what we need. And after we\u2019ve kidnapped her, she won\u2019t ever get past it to be what even one of us needs. There won\u2019t be any dating or romance so we can win her trust or woo her slowly.\u201d</p><p>Dominic put a hand on Law\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI will admit to being attracted to her, but it can\u2019t go further than that. This is for her own good, Law. She\u2019s in bed with a man who has already killed one wife. Let\u2019s focus on keeping her from being victim number two by sitting her down and seeing how fast we can close this case. Then we can all move on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>Law nodded. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll set up the interrogation room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a dining room. We don\u2019t have to be dramatic,\u201d Riley said with a sigh.</p> <p>\u201cI like to call things the way they are.\u201d His brother turned and disappeared down the hall.</p><p>Riley looked at Dominic. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Dominic suddenly looked a decade older. \u201cFor Carrie, yes. Is it really the right thing for Law? He\u2019s in love with that girl. Damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t possibly want him.\u201d</p><p>Dominic stared down the hall. \u201cCan\u2019t she? Sometimes, the sweetest, softest females can prove to have the strongest minds and wills. I wonder what that woman could be if she had a sturdy man behind her, encouraging her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean strong men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t seem interested in that life anymore, Riley. When this is over, I think I\u2019m going to try to settle down for a while. Date a little. Look for the right woman, someone who can handle me and Law. I can\u2019t leave him behind. He\u2019ll never be comfortable on his own. Even with financial security, he would always worry about what would happen to his wife if he died. If we leave him alone, he\u2019ll wither. I can\u2019t do that to him. I owe him too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t owe him, too?\u201d He was painfully aware of how much he owed Law. When they didn\u2019t have enough food, his brother had gone without so Riley would have a full belly. Law had been the one to sit up all night with a baseball bat in his hand when their mother brought clients home.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want a different life now, it\u2019s okay. You need to be free to pursue it. We\u2019ve talked about this since we were kids, but dreams change. Law and I will be fine on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want that life anymore.\u201d Frustration welled. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. And I sure as hell don\u2019t think a socialite who spends all her time lunching is going to be \u2018the one.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. Law gave me a lecture on the rituals and habits of our little blonde bombshell. Neither of us has paid any attention to her except as a potential witness for the feds to nail Jansen. Law has really gotten to know her. I have to concede... she didn\u2019t cash those checks. He has the proof. She works. Apparently she works really hard. Fuck. I don\u2019t know.\u201d He raked a hand through his hair. \u201cI see your side. I see his side. She\u2019s got me confused, and I can\u2019t afford to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear that, man. We just need to do the job. The rest will sort itself out.\u201d</p><p>It had to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about one thing,\u201d Dominic said as he stared at the files in his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaw never stood a chance with her. If he\u2019s wrong about her, then what I\u2019m about to do won\u2019t mean a thing to Kinley, but it will shatter all of Law\u2019s illusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he\u2019s right?\u201d</p><p>Dominic grew grim. \u201cThen I\u2019m about to tear her down and rip her world apart. And after this evening, she\u2019ll never forgive any of us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Kinley kind of wondered why they didn\u2019t just bring in a spotlight and shine it directly into her eyes. The evening had become surreal, like she\u2019d been dumped on the set of Law and Order: Kitchen Edition. In contrast to the sleek, modern room, the three big, alpha men who occupied the space were all displeasure and brute strength.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she swore. \u201cMy charity gives clothes to the homeless. I do not work for the mafia. Unless they could wear husky boys jeans. Then I could likely help them out.\u201d</p><p>She was getting a headache. Worse, Gigi was getting antsy, probably because Dominic had brought in his hulking bulldog, who sat by his master\u2019s feet as though he was a physical extension of the big guy\u2019s bad mood. And the dog growled up at Gigi like she was dessert. Kinley sighed.</p><p>How long had she been in this interrogation? It felt like days, and Dominic just kept asking the same questions over and over again, with occasional help from Riley. Law barely looked at her. It might be ridiculous, but his indifference hurt. When she\u2019d been brought into the room, she\u2019d tried to smile at him. He\u2019d returned a blank expression, his gaze sliding over her like she wasn\u2019t there at all. He hadn\u2019t said a word since Riley escorted her from the bedroom that functioned as her cell, into the kitchen, then sat her down in front of a ream of deeply boring accounting reports.</p><p>Then the rapid-fire questions had begun.</p><p>What do you know about account 433629? Account 775410?</p><p>Tell me about invoice 35249. When was it paid out? Who received the funds?</p><p>What were you doing on May 15th?</p><p>And she\u2019d answered the same way every time.</p><p>\u201cKohl, Kinley. Bride-to-be. 4325510996.\u201d</p><p>Her name, rank, and serial number. Well, her Neiman Marcus credit card number. It was the only number she knew by heart. If they wanted to steal it and buy high-end shoes...well, they were in for a shock because she was at her limit after buying wedding clothes.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to give them anything else, especially answers to questions she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cAre you even going to look at the files?\u201d Dominic asked. He stood over her, placing his hands flat on the table. He was a gorgeous man, even when he frowned, though now that she thought about it, she\u2019d never seen him smile. In fact, no one was smiling now.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point. I don\u2019t know what you think is going on, but someone took funds out of my charity. They didn\u2019t use it to launder money. My accountant would have alerted me to that or any abnormalities.\u201d But why hadn\u2019t Steve told her about all the missing funds...unless he had something to do with it. Come to think of it, he\u2019d been quiet lately. God, none of this made sense, but she wasn\u2019t going to look at these reports when they\u2019d only try to use them to hang her.</p><p>\u201cThen why is all that money missing? And when did you get in bed with Third World manufacturers?\u201d</p><p>She thought about answering, but when she couldn\u2019t tell them what they wanted to know, then what? They kept claiming that they didn\u2019t intend to hurt her, and some hopeful part of her wanted to believe that. They\u2019d probably sent Law/Mike in earlier to butter her up. But she wasn\u2019t falling for it. When it became apparent that she couldn\u2019t fill in the gaps in their information, would they kill her? Or would they extract everything out of her they could, no matter how minute, then off her? Either way, her best shot was to say nothing.</p><p>\u201cKohl, Kinley. Bride-to-be. 43255\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what RICO means?\u201d Riley asked.</p><p>\u201cRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. And the grand jury cleared him.\u201d Greg had explained that there were corrupt people in the government trying to help his competition. After her kidnappers\u2019 accusations that Greg was a criminal, she might at least think it over. Or not. Greg was a pillar of the financial community. The men who kidnapped her were...well, kidnappers. Yes, Greg had been hauled in front of a grand jury, but there wasn\u2019t an indictment. Even more compelling, one of the prosecutors who had tried to indict Greg had been found guilty of fraud himself not a year later.</p><p>Dominic shook his head. \u201cNo, the grand jury doesn\u2019t clear anyone. They simply didn\u2019t have enough evidence to move to trial. Do you know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s not guilty.\u201d From what she understood, the grand jury had convened two years before and had found nothing since. The FBI had given up because there was nothing to find.</p><p>\u201cBecause the prosecution\u2019s primary witness against him was brutally murdered three days before he was scheduled to appear. The man was an accountant. He had three kids. They all died in a house fire. Arson.\u201d</p><p>A chill went through her, but she tried to maintain her logic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for that family, but timing alone doesn\u2019t prove that Greg set their house on fire. It could have been anyone, a pyromaniac out looking for a kick. In the months I\u2019ve known Greg, he\u2019s never been less than a gentleman. I\u2019ve seen no evidence that he\u2019s done any of what you claim. I know you want to take him down because you think that will avenge your sister, but this seems like a witch-hunt. Honestly...\u201d she teared up. \u201cI wish I could bring Carrie back for you. But I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dominic slapped a hand down on the table, making the whole surface shake. Gigi whimpered and huddled on her lap. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this. I wanted to keep everything to business and leave your personal connections out of this, but apparently you don\u2019t give a shit who your fianc\u00e9 kills or if he robs your charity blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a murderer,\u201d she insisted, trying to calm down her dog.</p><p>\u201cIs charity work just something that rich women do to fill the long, dull hours between Botox treatments?\u201d Riley growled.</p><p>It was harder to look at them now that she knew Mike was really Law. He\u2019d probably told the other men the stories she\u2019d told him in confidence\u2014some of her innermost secrets. But he\u2019d also told her stories about his brothers. Dominic was obviously the idealist. Dominic fought for what was right, even when it cost him. The younger brother, Riley, he\u2019d characterized as the brilliant prankster.</p><p>Law had humanized them, given her a basic knowledge of them. So while they fumed and paced, snarled and clenched their fists, she wasn\u2019t quite as afraid as she\u2019d been this morning. Kinley knew that Dominic loved justice, that Riley worried they would never find a woman who wanted them all because they\u2019d had bad luck before.</p><p>Unless it had all been a lie, like \u201cMike\u201d himself had been. She was so confused. The only way to not fall into their traps was to refuse to engage them. She kept her mouth shut, concentrating on her dog. It didn\u2019t matter what they thought of her. It just didn\u2019t. They were the ones who had spied on her, taken her from her life, played with her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not answering your questions. If this was a legitimate investigation, I would be sitting in a police station or an FBI field office. Real law enforcement officials would be asking me questions. You three should think about that. Pretty soon, you\u2019ll be the ones answering the questions, probably from behind bars.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dominic practically stared a hole through her. \u201cSo you don\u2019t care about Jansen\u2019s criminal activity. Maybe you give a shit who he\u2019s sleeping with.\u201d</p><p>He slapped a picture down in front of her. It wasn\u2019t one of those grainy images, taken with a cheap telephoto lens. She didn\u2019t have any trouble at all discerning the focus of the picture. Oh, no. Someone had expertise with a camera and had spent money on superior equipment and photo processing.</p><p>Kinley stared, blinking a few times, as if that would right her eyes somehow and clear the terrible image in front of her. It didn\u2019t work. Every time she opened her eyes, the awful truth was still waiting. No mistaking what the two people in the picture were doing. No way could she fool herself into believing that Greg was just giving the woman in the photo a friendly hug. They were naked, and he was clearly touching her all over, especially inside. Greg had bent the blonde he screwed into what appeared to be a lounge chair by his pool. Kinley had laid in that very chair the last time Greg had invited her family over for a barbecue.</p><p>Nausea threatened to overtake her as she stared down at the damning photo because not only could she clearly see Greg\u2019s face, the woman\u2019s identity was impossible to miss.</p> <p>Becks was sleeping with her fianc\u00e9.</p><p>She looked up at Law. He wasn\u2019t shocked. Instead, he looked grim and closed off, with his arms crossed over his chest. Had he known the whole time he had followed and talked to her that she was being wretchedly deceived by two of the most important people in her life?</p><p>Tears welled up. Not for Greg\u2019s betrayal. She wasn\u2019t even sure she was crying about Becks\u2019s. The truth was, she couldn\u2019t stop berating herself. How stupid and na\u00efve Law must think she was. In fact, all of them must think that. How had she not even suspected?</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>Law didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand, and she appreciated that. \u201cAs far as I can tell they were lovers about six months before he met you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe introduced us.\u201d Kinley hadn\u2019t meant to admit that out loud. It probably made her sound even more na\u00efve. But she supposed she was. She certainly felt that way.</p><p>Law\u2019s right shoulder shrugged up in a negligent gesture. \u201cSounds about right. I believe they\u2019ve been colluding together for a while.\u201d</p><p>I have the perfect man for you, Kin. Don\u2019t screw this up. This is important. This could be your future.</p><p>She\u2019d been so insistent. Becks hadn\u2019t taken no for an answer when Kinley had tried to get out of the date. Nope. Becks had come over to her apartment and helped style her hair and picked out her clothes. It had been nice for her sister to pay attention to her. She\u2019d liked the thought they might grow closer. Becks had said she wanted that, too.</p><p>It had all been a lie.</p><p>\u201cYour sister recently bought a multimillion-dollar life insurance policy on her husband.\u201d Riley placed a photocopy of the paperwork in front of her. No disputing the evidence. Becks had taken out a three-million-dollar policy on her husband, naming herself the sole beneficiary. She would absolutely benefit from his death, just the way Greg would have benefitted from hers once they\u2019d been married.</p> <p>Kinley took a long breath, wishing this nasty position she found herself in\u2014deceived by her sister and fianc\u00e9, and used in a vendetta by the three men around her\u2014wasn\u2019t real. But obviously, she\u2019d been discounting the truth too often lately.</p><p>\u201cWho would run Hope House if you die?\u201d Dominic asked, his voice completely steady as though he wasn\u2019t shattering her world.</p><p>She suspected they damn well knew the answer, but told them anyway. \u201cBecks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bet every last dime I have that she\u2019s already dipping into your funds. I have no doubt she\u2019s the one who cashed those mystery checks from your charity\u2019s account,\u201d Law growled.</p><p>Kinley hated to believe that her sister could be capable of stealing from her. Cheating on her husband, yes. Becks had all but admitted it just before the ill-fated wedding. Sleeping with Greg was crushing enough. But this... It felt like a poison-laced ice pick to the chest. But who else could it be? No one else knew where she kept the paperwork for Hope House. Becks was clever enough to forge her signature, too.</p><p>\u201cOr I guess your dad could have taken the funds. After all, he has all those gambling debts to pay,\u201d Law said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cGambling debts?\u201d</p><p>Dominic dropped a series of photos of her father at the race track and at a poker table, smoking and drinking, his face grim. \u201cRiley took those. He had a camera in his hoodie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour father likes to play deep and he\u2019s horrible at the card table,\u201d Riley added. \u201cHe tugs on his ear or blinks a lot when he\u2019s bluffing. They\u2019re obvious tells.\u201d</p><p>Kinley didn\u2019t even know that her father liked playing cards. \u201cLeave my dad out of this! He\u2019s got cancer.\u201d</p><p>Law knew that. She\u2019d cried to \u201cMike\u201d during a long conversation one night. She\u2019d confessed how scared she was that she would lose her dad the way she\u2019d lost her mom. She\u2019d tearfully explained all the long nights she\u2019d sat up with her mom and how she\u2019d been forced to watch the woman who\u2019d given birth to her waste away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this is a distraction for him,\u201d Kinley spit at them. \u201cIf he needs the diversion to escape a possibly terminal illness, I can\u2019t blame him. I\u2019ll talk to him about not playing in high-stakes games when I get home, but for now, he\u2019s off-limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you told me about his illness over the phone, I had Riley check it out,\u201d Law began. \u201cHe hacked into the patient records of the hospital your dad said he\u2019d be going to. They have no record of him. Neither does a single oncologist on staff. Your dad doesn\u2019t have cancer. It\u2019s all a ruse to bilk you out of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t possibly be true!\u201d Of course it would be great news if her father wasn\u2019t dying, but she could hardly believe that he would scam her for money.</p><p>Law\u2019s face remained like granite, resolved and grim. She had a sudden feeling that the bad news wasn\u2019t going to stop. She forced herself to meet his stare. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her no mercy. \u201cYour father has been coming to you for money so he can pay his bookies. He\u2019s also run up all his credit cards. Someone, probably your sister, forged your name on his new applications as his cosigner.\u201d He grabbed yet another of those seemingly never-ending photos and shoved it toward her.</p><p>Her father, Becks, and Greg were sitting in a swanky restaurant, looking like they were having a grand old time. There was a date and time stamp on the photograph.</p><p>\u201cKinley, this was taken four days ago. The night before you told me that your father had an oncology appointment at noon the next day. You confessed how worried you were that he wouldn\u2019t let you go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t want this to be a repeat of Mom\u2019s illness. He said he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of putting me through it again.\u201d Had it all been a lie? \u201cI begged him to let me go, but he convinced me to just write the check. Greg promised to help pay for Dad\u2019s treatments after we were married. It\u2019s why I agreed to bump the wedding up. Originally, I wanted to get married in the fall.\u201d</p><p>But that hadn\u2019t suited Greg\u2019s or Becks\u2019s plans. Kinley had been stubborn about it because she\u2019d always dreamed of a fall wedding in New York. She had also wanted more time to get to know Greg...and to see if she could pull them out of their financial problems without being forced to marry.</p><p>And then her father had gotten sick. Supposedly. Now she didn\u2019t know what to think.</p><p>Kinley tried to channel her anger toward Law, Dominic, and Riley for spying on her family and trying to crush her illusions. But she couldn\u2019t quite get there. All the evidence pointed to her family and fianc\u00e9 betraying her. Dominic, Law, and Riley were simply revealing it.</p><p>\u201cPoor little rich girl,\u201d Dominic drawled.</p><p>That voice grated on her nerves. She grasped at whatever straws she could find. \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not fabricating evidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would we do that?\u201d Riley asked. \u201cThink for two seconds. Give me one good reason we would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you want revenge on Greg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of revenge would making evidence up give us, Kinley?\u201d Dominic grilled her.</p><p>\u201cYou could release the pictures and cause a scandal. That would be a big story for a long time. He wants to make contacts with society people, businessmen who were close to my mother and grandparents. I have those contacts. If those people think of him as a cheating, swindling scumbag, or I publically malign Greg, they will have nothing to do with him. He won\u2019t make the connections he wants to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is about far more than scandal, Kinley. I firmly believe he\u2019s using your charity as a front for some illegal venture. You should want to know if that\u2019s true yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze strayed back to the pictures of her sister and her fianc\u00e9. Kinley\u2019s whole world was crashing around her. Everything she\u2019d thought she believed about her family and her future was now being called into question. She whimpered.</p><p>Kinley wanted to hate Dominic, but didn\u2019t have the energy. Every bit of her strength right now went into keeping her chest from imploding and not crying in front of him and the other two.</p><p>\u201cNo one tells you the truth, do they?\u201d Law said without any trace of the lover who had held her so tenderly just hours ago and given her a kiss she would dream of for the rest of her life.</p><p>He certainly hadn\u2019t been honest with her. Greg hadn\u2019t either. That rat bastard had told her that he thought she was lovely, that he couldn\u2019t wait for their honeymoon. The whole time he\u2019d been sleeping with her sister. Even her own father had been lying to her. As much as she\u2019d tried to bend for the people in her life, to please them...it had been one giant waste. Apparently they saw her as a target to con.</p><p>All of her insecurities welled, a giant wave threatening to crash over her. Her father had always preferred Becks. Apparently, Greg did, too. Now that she really thought about it, all of the women he\u2019d dated before had been slender and model-like. Had Greg been dreading the moment he had to touch her fat body? Had he put it off all this time until it was absolutely, positively necessary? But why marry her at all if he didn\u2019t want her?</p><p>Ten million dollars. And Becks must have known about the scheme. It seemed far too coincidental that she\u2019d taken out a three-million-dollar policy on her husband at roughly the same time. Which meant Becks and Greg were probably in this scheme together.</p><p>Her sister wouldn\u2019t really let someone kill her...would she? She couldn\u2019t possibly be that cold. The way money wasn\u2019t mysteriously disappearing from her charity? The way Becks hadn\u2019t been sleeping with Greg? Oh dear god. Was it possible Dominic, Law, and Riley were right about everything?</p><p>\u201cYou need to start using your head, Kinley. Read over the accounting reports. Something is wrong at Hope House. Greg, Becks, and your dad have kept you too busy with the wedding for you to notice. Well, guess what, honey? We\u2019ve made sure you have all the time in the world to figure it out now. So look at the fucking reports and tell me your fianc\u00e9 is clean. Because either he\u2019s dirty or you are. One way or another, whoever\u2019s guilty is going to jail.\u201d Dominic stormed out of the room.</p><p>The bulldog stayed, his eyes on Gigi.</p><p>Riley set the accounting paperwork in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t bother trying to escape the kitchen. I\u2019ll be right outside the door. The other entrance is locked. The windows don\u2019t open in this room, and if I hear you trying to break one again, I\u2019ll put you over my knee. No one will stop me from smacking your ass red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were supposed to be the funny one,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>Riley\u2019s eyes strayed back to Law. \u201cIs that what he said? Well, there\u2019s nothing funny about this situation.\u201d</p><p>He sent his brother a long look and left.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand what he meant at all. \u201cCould you please leave, too? I\u2019d like to be alone. I promise I\u2019ll look at this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying in case you have some trick up your sleeve.\u201d</p><p>She was beyond tired. \u201cWhat would I try, Law? Everything I try fails. I try to be a good sister, and Becks sleeps with my fianc\u00e9. I try to be a good bride, and my fianc\u00e9 plans on killing me once I\u2019m his wife. I try to do good in the world, and apparently everyone just uses me, including my father. In fact, everyone I\u2019ve loved and trusted just might be plotting to kill me. Hell, I even tried to make a friend, but it turned out that even you lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you about anything except my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you cared.\u201d Why was she harping on this? She hurt so badly, and somehow the thought that Law had fabricated a bunch of crap to placate her only made her feel twenty times worse. Why? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His face softened for a moment. \u201cKinley, I...\u201d His jaw firmed. Then he closed his eyes and pulled back, and she knew she\u2019d lost him. \u201cI did what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen leave, and I\u2019ll get through this stuff faster. Like I said, I won\u2019t try anything. I would just fail.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, and for the briefest of moments she thought he would insist on staying with her. \u201cFine, but know that if you try, I will let Riley spank you. When he\u2019s done, I\u2019ll have you over my knee, too. And I won\u2019t let you up until we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrutalizing women. Very nice.\u201d</p> <p>He stopped in front of her, his stare holding and drilling into hers. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you wouldn\u2019t like it, baby. I just said we would be on the same page.\u201d He frowned. \u201cHow do you do this to me? How do you make me forget everything I planned? Come on, Butch. She doesn\u2019t want you anymore than her owner wants me. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Butch slowly padded toward the door, his doggy eyes lingering on Gigi.</p><p>Law left with the big animal, the door swinging behind them.</p><p>Kinley stared down at the photos and reports, the brutal proof that her whole life was a lie. Her tears began to flow in earnest.</p><p>Law walked out of the kitchen feeling like the lowest fucking piece of shit on the planet. He crossed the hall and stalked into the office he, Dominic, and Riley were using as their base of operations. \u201cI really hope you two are happy.\u201d</p> <p>Had ruining Kinley\u2019s life been worth it? Maybe if he had tried again, he could have figured out a way to put Greg behind bars without wrecking all her illusions.</p><p>I would just fail. Her big brown eyes had been filled with tears. Pain had been etched onto her sweet face.</p><p>He\u2019d caused that. Maybe he hadn\u2019t been the fucker cheating on her or planning to kill her, but he\u2019d helped to expose it all. And he\u2019d done it coldly because he knew his feelings for her were hopeless. Dominic was right. Hell, even Riley was probably right. Even if he hadn\u2019t abducted Kinley, how would a woman with her class and sweetness ever survive a relationship with him, a brooding Dominic, and a smartass Riley? It sounded impossible, and he was such a stupid ass for fighting that realization.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cI\u2019m not happy. And we have a problem. Annabelle is on the line. Riley, can Kinley hear us?\u201d</p><p>Riley crossed the room and shut the door. \u201cNo, the doors are thick, and we\u2019re far enough away. I can see her through the panes if she tries to come out of the kitchen. I secured the other doors, and the windows won\u2019t break. We\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Law was happy about that because the last thing Kinley needed was to know that her best friend had been in on this plot from the beginning. One more betrayal, and Kinley might not survive, even if Annabelle had participated with good intentions.</p> <p>Dominic pushed a button on the phone. \u201cAnnabelle, tell us what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg is freaking out.\u201d Annabelle\u2019s voice was hushed. \u201cHe suspects you. I overheard him talking about it with that goon of his, Dargo. At first he thought that Kinley got cold feet. He was really upset about the luggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he want her luggage?\u201d Law asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s designer,\u201d Riley explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse my brother. He\u2019s not into designer anything. We\u2019re lucky he doesn\u2019t still wear his BDUs.\u201d</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t let him or he would. He\u2019d spent so much time in uniform it felt weird to be in civvies, even years later. The Army had been simple. No need to pick out his clothes. No wondering if he looked like a douchebag. Kinley probably liked a man who knew how to dress.</p><p>Annabelle sounded thoughtful over the line. \u201cI know a full set of Louis Vuitton is expensive, but her engagement ring cost far more, and he didn\u2019t give a damn about it. I overheard him talking to Becks, and he was pissed. He told her that she needed to find Kinley and get that luggage back or she would be the one in trouble.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been through her luggage. Law hadn\u2019t found anything but her clothes, makeup, and an iPad. He\u2019d put the tablet in airplane mode, and she didn\u2019t know the password for the Internet, so Riley had declared it harmless, but maybe he should look at it again. All he\u2019d seen was a bunch of games, pictures, and her e-reader app, which was completely full of romance novels. Unless Greg liked cross-dressing in private or needed to catch up on his reading, Law wasn\u2019t sure why he would want anything she\u2019d packed for her honeymoon.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go through it all again. Something\u2019s not right there,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on Kinley, but I can\u2019t tell if she simply doesn\u2019t know anything or she doesn\u2019t want to tell us.\u201d</p> <p>Law was pretty fucking sure she didn\u2019t know. \u201cCome on. You saw her face. They\u2019ve kept her out of the loop, and we just crushed her with all that information. She\u2019s looking over everything we left her now. Maybe once she\u2019s convinced, she\u2019ll start thinking about what she knows. One thing about Kinley I\u2019m sure of, it\u2019s that she has a good heart. She wants to do what\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Dominic sent him a sigh that was somewhere between thoughtful and contrite.</p><p>\u201cSpare me.\u201d Riley rolled his eyes.</p><p>He got in his brother\u2019s face. \u201cYou spare me. Why don\u2019t you stop assuming she\u2019s just like Simone and fucking get to know her before you jump to all kinds of assumptions?\u201d</p><p>Dominic cleared his throat. \u201cHas anyone been able to find the accountant she uses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Riley muttered. \u201cTate found Steve a few hours ago. I hadn\u2019t had a chance to tell you. He claims Greg fired him eight weeks ago. Since he worked from home, he rarely saw Kinley. Imagine Steve\u2019s surprise when he found out that he was supposedly still employed. Tate showed him the reports someone had filed on his behalf since he was fired. He claims none of the work is his. So we have to assume that Greg has been quietly putting his own people into position.\u201d</p><p>And isolating Kinley from anyone who could help her. \u201cThe bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no question about that,\u201d Annabelle replied, then her voice became even more grave. \u201cWe have another problem. When he couldn\u2019t find Kinley, he called the police. They found a surveillance tape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeen it.\u201d Riley sounded long-suffering. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the news. Not our shining moment.\u201d</p><p>Law groaned. He was never going to live that shit down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Annabelle ignored him. \u201cThe police identified Law as the man on the tape.\u201d</p><p>Law\u2019s chest tightened. Just as he feared, he would likely be going to prison. And that brought up more than one problem. \u201cIf I turn myself over, do you think they\u2019ll let Riley and Dominic off? I can say they had nothing to do with it, that I had a different crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare.\u201d A male voice came over the line. He wasn\u2019t trying to be quiet at all. \u201cThis is Kellan, and I need to hear you verbally authorize Annabelle to pay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Law asked.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Dominic ordered in that CO voice of his.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Pay the man, Annabelle,\u201d Law said.</p><p>\u201cLaw, I\u2019m giving Kell a dollar as a retainer,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe\u2019s now your lawyer. As such, he can advise you, and everything he says is protected under attorney-client privilege. Everything you tell him is covered as well, with the exception of knowledge of crimes being currently committed. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>So he was supposed to lie. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Kell\u2019s voice came back on the line. \u201cI\u2019m a very smart man. I can guess what happened if the police come to ask me about anything. Let\u2019s see if I have this straight. You and Kinley have been having a whirlwind affair. She didn\u2019t have the courage to face Greg, and you carried her away from her wedding because she had gotten very emotional and taken a sedative. She was so incapacitated that she couldn\u2019t walk. You knew she would be horribly embarrassed, so in an attempt to save your lover\u2019s peace of mind, you had your brother help you carry her out. You disguised yourself and hid her in the laundry cart because you were avoiding the paparazzi.\u201d</p><p>Kellan shouldn\u2019t be a lawyer. He should be a fiction writer. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two will come home after all the chaos has died down. Can we get Kinley to support that story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, she\u2019s still emotional and feeling the aftereffects of the medication designed to calm her nerves. Well, call me when she\u2019s better. With so much going on, I understand it could take a day or two. Whatever you do, I would advise you not to confess to crimes. How is the investigation going? Has Kinley explained where the invoices are coming from?\u201d</p><p>If they could come up with evidence that would make the RICO charges stick, the feds would take up the case again. The whole idea had been that if Kinley saw how she was being used, she would forgive them for abducting her. He\u2019d been so sure of that. He wasn\u2019t anymore. \u201cShe\u2019s not talking yet, but then we just hammered her with the fact that her fianc\u00e9, sister, and father have all betrayed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she all right?\u201d Annabelle asked, obviously concerned.</p><p>\u201cHow would you be if you found out your family was lying and planning to off you?\u201d Law couldn\u2019t imagine it. Riley, for all his sarcasm, was such a part of Law, he couldn\u2019t fathom not having his brother around. For all of Kinley\u2019s privileged upbringing, other than Annabelle, she was utterly alone in the world.</p><p>Law wanted her to know that wasn\u2019t true, that someone was willing to fight for her. She needed a man who wasn\u2019t so self-absorbed or insecure, who would stand up for her, risk himself to keep her safe and happy. The woman Mike had met deserved that.</p><p>\u201cKinley\u2019s stronger than she knows. Let me talk to her. Maybe if she knew that I believe this is best for her, she would cooperate,\u201d Annabelle said. \u201cShe knows I don\u2019t have any motives other than saving her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a horrible idea,\u201d Kellan said. \u201cIf Kinley even once said where she was or explained that she wasn\u2019t, in fact, still recovering from her emotional bout, then Annabelle would become an accessory after the fact if she didn\u2019t go to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it, Kell,\u201d Annabelle insisted.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life, baby. You\u2019re not doing this. You\u2019re lucky we allowed you to be involved in this in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllowed?\u201d Annabelle wasn\u2019t trying to keep her voice down now. She was practically screeching. \u201cAllowed! You don\u2019t own me. She is my best friend. I brought this case to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re out of it. If you don\u2019t obey me, we\u2019re going to have a long talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not one of your club subs, Kell. I will talk to my friend if I want to. And I will lie to the cops all day long if the mood strikes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentleman, my assistant and I are going to go and have a brief discussion. I am so happy to hear that Law and Kinley are settling into their future as a couple. I will advise any law enforcement that comes my way to that effect. Unfortunately, I was not given the whereabouts of your love nest. And Annabelle isn\u2019t privy to any of that information, nor will she be. Oh, and unfortunately Annabelle has dropped her phone and stepped on it, rendering it utterly useless for finding the phone numbers of her most recent calls. So sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Riley explained. \u201cThis is a burner. We have about fifteen in our possession. No names are attached to the numbers, everything was paid for in cash, and they come from completely different parts of the country. We\u2019ll call in again. And we\u2019ll get rid of this line. Talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>As Riley pressed the End Call button, Law could hear Annabelle arguing. He wasn\u2019t sure what was going on at that law firm, but Annabelle was going to be in trouble. He\u2019d seen Kell, Tate, and Eric watching their administrative assistant like she was a fluffy bunny and they were lions who had gone without a meal for far too long.</p><p>Rather like he watched Kinley.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go to the kitchen and talk to her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cShe needs time to process all we\u2019ve told her, and we\u2019re probably the last people she wants to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should at least check on her.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to leave her alone in there with all the evidence of betrayal around her and no shoulder to lean on. Law knew to his core that she was a good person whose only sin had been in trusting the people she should have been able to.</p><p>Law turned and walked back into the kitchen, ready to talk to her, to try to make her understand what was really going on. And he froze because she no longer sat in the chair in which he\u2019d left her.</p><p>His heart nearly stopped, but then Gigi was at his heels, whining up at him. He looked around the kitchen and saw her. Her body was facing the large pantry door, her hands covering her face. Though she wasn\u2019t making a sound, her body shook with the force of her tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Law felt something break inside him.</p><p>Fuck this. He was done pretending he wasn\u2019t in love with her. He was done acting as if this scheme was just something he\u2019d agreed to in order to help Dominic. He was done lying to himself that he didn\u2019t need her.</p><p>He\u2019d spent a lifetime being the badass, being the guy who didn\u2019t feel a thing. He was fucking done with that, too.</p><p>Law stormed across the room and did what he\u2019d been dying to since the moment he\u2019d seen her. He wrapped his arms around her and offered her his strength. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, baby. I can\u2019t stand it when you cry. I\u2019m here for you. I\u2019ll make it better.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Kinley knew she should pull away, but Law was so warm, solid, and strong. She felt so in need of human comfort. The minute the door had closed behind them, she\u2019d stared at the photos they\u2019d stuck under her nose and seen her life laid out for her. Then the wedding, the abduction, the interrogation, the kiss, the mess her life had become\u2014all crashed down on her.</p><p>The fact that she\u2019d been alone and crying her eyes out only magnified her sense of loneliness. Until Law had arrived and given her someone to hold on to, an anchor so that she wouldn\u2019t continue drowning in shock and sorrow, confusion and hopelessness.</p><p>Sheer need propelled her into his open arms. She\u2019d spent a solid week getting to know him. He might have used a different name, but she\u2019d learned about the goodness of his heart. Yes, and his goodness deep down had her clinging in his embrace.</p><p>Then the memory of their kiss made her lift her face to him and silently beg for another.</p> <p>Law\u2019s mouth descended, slanting across hers, claiming her lips and giving her blessed moments of respite. Kinley didn\u2019t have to think. She didn\u2019t have to worry. His kiss obliterated everything else. She only had to feel.</p><p>Her heart raced as she breathed him in\u2014a hint of his aftershave, the mint on his breath, the masculine scents of leather and coffee and man that seemed uniquely Law. She ran her palms up the muscled slab of his torso, covered only by the thin material of his T-shirt. Everything about this man was hard with the exception of his lips.</p><p>And his words as he broke their kiss and cradled her face in his hands, his mouth just over hers. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking sweet. You shouldn\u2019t ever have to cry. Jansen doesn\u2019t deserve to have you in his life.\u201d</p><p>Law sank his hands into her hair, sweeping it from the loose bun she\u2019d created to keep it off her face. He tugged at it, lighting up her scalp. He forced her head to tilt up, and his mouth closed off any protest.</p><p>As his tongue traced the seam of her lips, she felt a tug in her womb. He held her still as he explored her mouth. She parted her lips wider for him, unwilling to let go of this heady, consuming feeling. She\u2019d been kissed before, sloppy brushes of lips in awkward embraces that had made her shudder with discomfort. Kinley felt none of that with Law. Everything about being with him was completely different. Totally arousing. His gentle comfort and rough insistence created an intoxicating demand she fell into and hoped would never end. He held her as though she was precious, as if he savored her. His kiss made her feel hot and happy and restless for more.</p><p>Kinley wasn\u2019t about to end this embrace with the same regrets as the last. This time, she clutched him tight and slid her tongue along his. He growled into her mouth, and she felt the sound vibrate just under her skin.</p> <p>Encouraged, Kinley moaned and opened wider for him to deepen the kiss. Law didn\u2019t hesitate to take advantage of her offering. For the first time, she felt her feminine power. Always, she\u2019d waited, allowed life to come to her on its terms, never even asking for what she wanted. But as Law kissed her, she suddenly understood the \u201cmore\u201d she\u2019d been yearning for in the bridal suite. She ached to make him growl and moan. To sweat and burn. To make him hungry for her\u2014like he was making her hungry for him. Kinley gloried in simply feeling.</p><p>She pressed her chest to his. Law stood so tall that he towered above her and nearly had to bend in half just to kiss her, and she loved feeling petite.</p><p>Then a kiss wasn\u2019t enough for him anymore. Law surrounded her, pressing her against the pantry door with an indrawn breath and a groan. Again, he seized her mouth. Kinley\u2019s nipples sparked to life, and her head reeled as he took the kiss even deeper, leaving her dizzy and feeling out of control.</p><p>She\u2019d always been the good girl. Her mother had taught her that she had to be the responsible one because her father and sister just didn\u2019t have it in them. After her mother\u2019s passing, the never-ending job had fallen to her. She\u2019d taken care of her family because it was her nature.</p><p>But this wild gush of emotion felt natural, too. It felt right to be with Law.</p><p>It was probably stupid. She would likely regret the hell out of it because he would ultimately use her passion for him against her to coerce her to cooperate with Dominic\u2019s plans. But right now was for her. Kinley wasn\u2019t thinking about what anyone else would think or say. For the first time ever, she was living in the moment and refused to stop because she wanted to feel adored, like a beautiful, desirable woman just this once.</p><p>Suddenly, he lifted her like she weighed nothing. She gasped. No one had picked her up since she was a child.</p><p>\u201cI need you higher, baby. Maybe you should always wear those heels of yours. Have I told you how fucking gorgeous you are? Have I told you that I\u2019ve been hard for you since the minute I laid eyes on you? My cock has been in hell.\u201d He stopped, his eyes flaring. \u201cShit!\u201d He let her slide down gently, making sure she was balanced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t talk to you that way. I should be gentle.\u201d</p> <p>No way was she ready to stop yet. She pulled on his shirt with a little whimper. Didn\u2019t he understand? She didn\u2019t want to think or talk or be gentle. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare. You can\u2019t kiss me like that then ignore me again. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t face that possibility or all the other crap on her plate now. She wanted to forget, at least for a while. Just a few kisses. Just for a few precious moments. Then she could return to the real world where no one wanted her and figure out how to cope as everything fell apart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be gentle with you, like I want to be.\u201d He smoothed her hair back, staring down at her. His eyes were so blue...</p><p>\u201cJust be you. No more lies. No more pretending.\u201d She wanted that more than anything. She wished that she could simply be Kinley, without the everyday responsibilities that caused her to shove down her wants and needs for everyone else. She could be herself and Law could be the tenderly rough soldier who took her to a place where only they mattered. She wanted to be free, even if it was temporary. Even if it wasn\u2019t real.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care that I\u2019m too rough?\u201d He tugged on her hair, seeming to hold his breath as he waited for her answer.</p><p>\u201cHow would I know what\u2019s too rough for me?\u201d Nothing he did felt overly forceful or physical. Every touch felt just right. Kinley peppered kisses up his neck, across his jaw, clutching his T-shirt in her fists. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you asked for it.\u201d His growl resonated in her ears low, sexy.</p><p>Then she was in the air again. He picked her up, wrapping his arms around her waist. She had to hang on to his shoulders as he turned and walked toward the huge island in the middle of the kitchen. He set her on the sleek black granite countertop and immediately stepped between her legs, making a place for himself there.</p><p>\u201cI was a soldier. Special Forces. You can\u2019t imagine the things I\u2019ve done. I didn\u2019t go to college. I don\u2019t deserve you, Kinley, but I fucking want you. So bad.\u201d</p><p>She had the urge to wrap her legs around his lean hips and get as close as she could. Her whole body felt like it was softening, warming up, aching to be even closer.</p><p>He pulled her in, aligning their hips, making it impossible to mistake just how hard Law was. His penis nearly pressed out of his pants, he was so erect. And big. Feeling just how much he wanted her made Kinley restless. She writhed to relieve the ache as her heart tried to beat out of her chest.</p><p>Law Anders truly, genuinely wanted to have sex with her. He wasn\u2019t paying her lip service. As far as she knew, men couldn\u2019t fake erections. He actually desired her.</p><p>And she wanted them.</p><p>Oh, god. She\u2019d just thought the word \u201cthem.\u201d As soon as she had, a vision of herself in the middle of Law, Dominic, and Riley had seared into her brain. They would surround her, maybe even crowd her. They\u2019d boss her around...but in her fantasy world, they would also adore her. Because they were all so big, she would feel small and feminine against them. Their hands would explore her body, caressing and stroking her. It might not be love, but she could hold onto the memories during the long and lonely days that were sure to follow her into her future.</p><p>What was she thinking? How could she have sex with three men? The notion was ridiculous. Scandalous. And so arousing that she could barely breathe.</p><p>Law captured her lips before she could think another word. His tongue surged in, and he made love to her mouth\u2014deep, ferocious, lacking all restraint. Kinley was lost.</p><p>He slipped a hand down her neck and shoulders, curving his palm over her breast. His touch seared her. She melted into him, giving herself over to the delicious burn.</p><p>Law kissed her neck, nipped at her ear. \u201cDo you know what you want? Where you like to be touched? What gets you hot? Just tell me, and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what I like besides your kisses.\u201d Beyond that, Kinley had no way of knowing. She\u2019d spent her high school years studying and trying to be the perfect daughter. When college had come, her mother had fallen sick. As she\u2019d slowly wasted away, years had passed. All she\u2019d known then was duty\u2014to her family, her schoolwork, her community, then her mother\u2019s legacy.</p><p>Never once had she ever simply let go and explored.</p><p>\u201cDear god, you\u2019re a virgin?\u201d</p><p>They both pulled away, shocked at the low, masculine voice cutting through their thick passion.</p><p>Dominic Anthony stood not three feet away, watching. He\u2019d taken off his jacket and now stood dressed in a button-down shirt, gray form-fitting slacks, and designer loafers. Open at the throat, the white dress shirt contrasted with his olive complexion. Dominic stood as tall as Law, but he was built leaner. With jet black hair, fathomless dark eyes, and a jaw that had been cut from granite, everything about him screamed savage.</p><p>She remembered what California Mike\u2014no, Law\u2014had told her about him. Dominic was the idealist. He\u2019d left behind a pampered upbringing to protect and serve his country. He\u2019d loved his sister and wallowed in guilt because he hadn\u2019t stopped her murder. Because Dominic was also a protector, he couldn\u2019t forgive himself for not saving Carrie. He wanted a woman he could share with his friends because he\u2019d found a part of his family, and now they were all waiting for the woman who would complete them.</p><p>\u201cI came to check on you, to say I\u2019m sorry for bombarding you with so much at once,\u201d Dominic croaked out. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault that Jansen is a murdering asshole. But I really need your help.\u201d He swallowed \u201cI need...\u201d</p><p>He watched her in Law\u2019s arms, and Kinley couldn\u2019t miss the loneliness and longing as they carved themselves into his face.</p><p>Without thinking, Kinley reached a hand out to him to help him...somehow. Immediately, horror flooded her. Dominic would likely reject her. He wanted a woman for them all, but not her. She had to stop remembering what \u201cMike\u201d had said about the man and use her head. Dominic had orchestrated her abduction. She shouldn\u2019t care if he hurt.</p><p>She started to jerk her hand back, but Dominic grabbed her like a lifeline, his fingers threading through hers as he used the grip to drag himself closer.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, I shouldn\u2019t do this, but you\u2019re too sweet.\u201d Dominic\u2019s feral snarl zipped right to the moist folds between her legs. And they curled around her heart. \u201cTell me to stop. Tell me to walk away. I need you to because I fucking can\u2019t. And if I stay, something is going to happen. The fact that you\u2019re a virgin won\u2019t matter at all. Knowing you\u2019re innocent just makes me want you more. It makes me want to stake a claim. That is not what I came here to do, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Right. Dominic had come here to smooth talk her into aiding his justice against Greg Jansen. He didn\u2019t really want to get close to her, not logically. But Kinley could also tell that he didn\u2019t have the strength to walk away from her. The knowledge made her swell with power and need. For whatever reason, he desired her. He needed her to ease the hurt he bore like a scar.</p><p>She pulled on their joined hands, and Dominic didn\u2019t hesitate. He wrapped his arms around her, pressing against her everywhere as his lips crashed over hers.</p><p>He dominated. Where Law cajoled, Dominic simply commanded. He took full control of her mouth, his tongue surging in. She melted. As he devoured her, Law\u2019s fingers moved from her waist to her hips to her thighs. Fingers tickled across her skin, dipped into her panties, then thrust inside her swollen, slick folds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Every cell in her being nearly imploded. Nope. She didn\u2019t have a problem with rough\u2014except that she wanted more. Could see herself coming to crave it.</p><p>Dominic\u2019s tongue surged as Law\u2019s fingers played. Fire licked along her skin. Her knees actually shivered. Pleasure threatened to overtake her. She felt dizzy and stunned and euphoric. She\u2019d never known anything like this, never realized her body could tighten and quake from the inside.</p><p>\u201cMake me stop,\u201d Dominic pleaded, his lips playing along hers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, baby,\u201d Law said, kissing her temple. \u201cDon\u2019t make us stop. Can\u2019t you feel how right this is? How much we want you?\u201d</p><p>She could feel a number of things. From freedom to pride to a sense of herself as a woman for the very first time. She practically drowned in pleasure. Law\u2019s fingers still played in her pussy, and he could have no trouble discerning how wet she was. It would be embarrassing...except that the lubrication helped his fingers move against her. And it made him groan in her ear. Which made Dominic kiss her even more feverishly.</p><p>Hot. She was so hot. In fact, she\u2019d never been this hot\u2014not even close. Her skin sizzled. There was nothing gentle about Dominic, even the way he kissed. He took over. He ruled. She found her body arching toward him in offering and aching to give into his demands. Though he felt different than Law, he felt so very right, too.</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s sexy.\u201d Law\u2019s deep voice conveyed his satisfaction. \u201cYou look good together.\u201d</p><p>She was kissing another man, and he was happy. Because she was enjoying it? Because it fulfilled her? Or because his \u201cbrother\u201d was getting what he needed while he was a part of the experience? Probably all of the above. Their way of looking at the world might be completely different, but it was still desire, need...and maybe more.</p><p>All the while Law\u2019s clever fingers played inside her. He parted her labia, sliding through her folds, to find the little nubbin that suddenly seemed to control her whole being. Her clitoris was filling up with blood. Urgent desire spread through her. With every flick of his fingers, he lit her up until she panted and moaned in Dominic\u2019s mouth. The way they played her should embarrass her or make her feel uncomfortable. But no. Just a searing, soul-freeing desire filled her.</p><p>Dominic tugged her shirt free from her skirt, and she felt his warm palm against her skin. He released her lips, kissing her nose and cheeks. \u201cSpread your legs for Law.\u201d</p><p>Vaguely, Kinley figured she should at least ask why, but her thighs seemed to have a mind of their own. They obeyed Dominic\u2019s command without question, spreading wide for Law until he stepped between them.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s wearing panties,\u201d Law said. \u201cThose white cotton things. I don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to stop that. That\u2019s one of our rules, Kinley. No panties. Nothing covers your pussy except our hands, our mouths, and our bodies when we fuck you.\u201d Dominic\u2019s voice was a dark rumble. \u201cDo you understand? If I find a pair, I\u2019ll throw them away. You\u2019ll get a spanking if you try to wear more.\u201d</p><p>Every word that came out of his mouth seemed to ratchet up the temperature\u2014and her arousal\u2014another notch. She ached and burned and needed. But his words confused her. Why did he have rules? And why did the idea of him or Law smacking her backside make her feel antsy and restless\u2014and not in a bad way?</p><p>\u201cYou guys talk about spanking a lot,\u201d she managed to say in between kisses.</p><p>Riley had talked about putting her over his knee and not letting up until she understood, too. At the very thought of him, Kinley wished for his sharp wit and hard body. Then she shoved the thought away. Law and Dominic wanted her. Riley had cast her as a villainess. If he didn\u2019t want her, then she didn\u2019t need him. She\u2019d played that game for too long to continue.</p><p>\u201cThese panties are in my way,\u201d Law groused.</p><p>Kinley frowned. How? He didn\u2019t seem to be having any trouble. He\u2019d just pushed them to the side and shoved his fingers deep in her pussy to work magic on every one of her sensitive spots. Her blood heated, her heart raced, her pleasure swelled, her breath caught. He pressed one big finger inside, against some nerve-laden spot she\u2019d only ever read about. Kinley gasped.</p><p>\u201cMake her come, Law,\u201d he growled against her ear, his teeth nipping at her lobe in a sharp little bite that flared into something beyond pain. She shivered against him.</p><p>Dominic reached under her shirt and bra until he cupped her breast, plucked at her nipple. Heat flared. \u201cYou\u2019ve never come, have you? Tell me, and don\u2019t you lie. I know you haven\u2019t had a man inside you. We\u2019re going to change that, but I want to know everything you\u2019ve experienced so far. Have you ever brought yourself to orgasm with your fingers? Have you ever rubbed yourself until you screamed, until your eyes rolled back in your head and your whole body shook? Tell me. I want to know if this is your first.\u201d</p><p>Kinley could barely find her breath. Law\u2019s finger still caressed her insides, massaging that deep place, while his thumb rolled over her clit. She couldn\u2019t stop her hips from rolling against his hand. She wanted more friction, more of that heating, building sensation that was firing urgently between her legs. She wanted to figure out where this road led.</p><p>Dominic tweaked her nipple. The sharp pain brought her back from the brink of something new. She keened in protest and need.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d Dominic demanded. \u201cWhen you do, Law will use his hand to make you come for us. Do you understand?\u201d</p> <p>She managed to gasp. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sweet begging. I\u2019m going to watch you come and hear you scream. And I will watch your pussy clench around Law\u2019s fingers. But you answer me first. I\u2019m the top here.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t on top. She was on top of the counter, but she didn\u2019t have time to wonder about his odd phrasing because he pinched her nipple again.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she panted. \u201cI\u2019ve never come before. I tried a couple of times, but I don\u2019t think my body works that way.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d touched herself in the middle of the night a couple of times, but found every incident both embarrassing and frustrating. More than once, she\u2019d tried to find the magical spot that would send her soaring to sexual Shangri-La. If the whispers she\u2019d heard were true, other women seemed to be able to get themselves there. Kinley had never even come close.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s gonna work. Your pussy is so wet, baby.\u201d Law pressed in a second finger as he stared down at her. She felt helplessly impaled, his stare, stretched and wanting and poised on the edge of something she desperately needed.</p><p>She groaned low as he shoved those two fingers inside her as deep as he could. He packed her so full. She liked the slight burn of him stretching her.</p><p>Law\u2019s entire focus was right between her legs, watching his fingers disappear inside her before he pulled the slick digits nearly free, then shoved her full again. \u201cI know who and what you are, Kinley. You just need something extra, and we can give it to you. Dominic, tell her to come. Order her to do it.\u201d</p><p>His words made her heart thump in her chest. Yes. She wanted to be told, to be commanded. She wouldn\u2019t have to think, just obey\u2014and feel. That demand would compel her, remove the stress of wondering if she could and how she would from her mind.</p><p>\u201cFuck his fingers, pet. Hard. Move your hips against him. That\u2019s right.\u201d Dominic continued to toy with her nipples, twisting and pinching, sending crazy little beams of pleasure all through her system. His words clouded her brain. \u201cDo it now.\u201d</p><p>Everything made sense then. Kinley gave herself over to his words and just obeyed. Every cell in her body responded to them, to their actions and words, to the sound of their deep voices. Something important lay just within her reach, hovering right before her... And now she had permission to take that pleasure for herself because pleasing her would please them.</p><p>She shoved aside any self-conscious thoughts and thrust against Law\u2019s hand. His thumb circled her clit, pressing down and around. Over and over. With a cry, she writhed, taking his fingers even deeper than before.</p><p>Dominic tangled his hands in her hair and jerked, snapping her gaze up to fall into the snare of his. \u201cBeautiful, pet. That\u2019s exactly what we want from you.\u201d He looked back to where Law\u2019s fingers disappeared into her body. \u201cDo you feel how wet your pretty pussy is? That\u2019s perfect. We want you sopping and desperate for our cocks. Then we\u2019ll fill you up.\u201d</p><p>His words made her whimper. She couldn\u2019t form a coherent reply.</p><p>Dominic\u2019s smile was both triumphant and wicked. \u201cListen to me and listen well. You\u2019re going to come for me and Law\u2014all over his hand. Let it go, pet. Now. We\u2019ll catch you.\u201d</p><p>Law stroked her again, the sensation igniting inside her. His fingers pressed up, circling inside, his thumb scraping over her clitoris. Dominic drank from her lips.</p><p>And she fell over the edge with a smothered scream.</p><p>Pleasure bloomed across her flesh, a wild rush of energy and pounding sensation that had her gasping for breath and shaking, gyrating against Law and holding onto Dominic for dear life. Her body burst, her soul opened, and she surrendered to the moment completely.</p><p>As the sensations crested then slowly lulled from electric to tingling, then finally to lazy satisfaction, Dominic\u2019s hand softened at her breast. His kisses became sweet and gentle. \u201cBeautiful, pet. So fucking gorgeous. That\u2019s what I wanted. Tell me how you feel.\u201d</p><p>She felt free. She felt open. She felt incredibly alive.</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d A happy little grin tried to stretch across her lips.</p><p>Law smiled back, his face more open than she\u2019d ever seen it. His eyes were lit with something that looked a lot like joy, and Kinley warmed at the thought that she\u2019d contributed to his pleasure.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be so tight, Dom. I could barely fit two fingers inside. We need to prep her. As soon as possible. God, I can\u2019t wait to fuck her.\u201d Law withdrew his hand. The digits were soaking, and he didn\u2019t care. In fact, he licked his fingers, sucking the cream from them. He let loose a sexy groan. \u201cHmm, she tastes as sweet as she looks.\u201d</p><p>Her whole body throbbed with residual sensation and a new flare of desire. Her heart still chugged, even as languid pleasure coursed through her. Time slowed.</p><p>Law\u2019s hands had been inside her body. Now he was tasting her essence and he seemed to love it. He\u2019d known exactly how to please her. Both of them had, actually. Now just looking at them both amazed and aroused her. Though she\u2019d been kidnapped, dragged away from her wedding\u2014albeit one that she deeply suspected would have ended in her death\u2014and she sat on a kitchen island with her legs spread for the men who had ripped her life apart, Kinley was happy.</p><p>What was wrong with her? What would people think? Magazines wrote about her family. Her kidnapping would be all over the news. If anyone learned what had just happened, the fact that she\u2019d allowed her captors to touch her would be plastered all over America.</p><p>Horror flooded her system.</p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dominic jerked back, yanking his hands to his sides. His face closed down. Just seconds before he\u2019d been flushed with desire. Now he looked stony cold again. Though they were still standing close together, there seemed to be miles between them.</p><p>\u201cChanged your mind, huh, pet?\u201d</p><p>She closed her legs and scrambled away from them, trying to regain some form of dignity. Her hands were shaking. What had she done?</p><p>\u201cKinley?\u201d Law reached for her. \u201cBaby...\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t listen or trust herself at the moment. She was too emotional to make any decisions now, much less one to surrender her virginity to two of the men who had whisked her across the country against her will.</p><p>No matter how sweet they had been to her. No matter how they were very likely saving her life. No matter how much pleasure they had given her.</p><p>No. No! She couldn\u2019t listen to those voices. She couldn\u2019t trust them. Like all of her female parts, they screamed that being with these men was right. That she would be safe with them.</p><p>Her clitoris had Stockholm syndrome.</p><p>\u201cI need to be alone for a while.\u201d She had to think. Figure out how to put this embarrassing catastrophe behind her and never fall prey to the lust they roused in her again. What kind of woman fell for her captors?</p><p>If she stayed here, she would make a complete fool of herself. They wanted information, assistance. They didn\u2019t really want her. She was nowhere near their league. They were gorgeous and undoubtedly good in bed. She was plump, na\u00efve, and inexperienced. If she slept with them, she would forever be the debutante who\u2019d been dumb enough to spread her legs for her kidnappers.</p><p>\u201cKinley, let\u2019s talk about this, baby.\u201d Law stepped up, his big, masculine, oh-how-hot-would-he-look-naked body blocking her way to the door.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMove. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her be, Law,\u201d Dominic warned. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give her any reason to say we forced her. It\u2019s exactly why we should have stayed away. I lost my fucking head.\u201d Dominic gathered the papers from the table she\u2019d sat at earlier, before Law carried her to the island and nearly seduced her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And darn it, she\u2019d liked being seduced.</p><p>\u201cStudy these. You have tonight. In the morning, we\u2019ll talk again. I hope you understand that what just happened here was consensual.\u201d Dominic thrust the papers at her, his voice so matter of fact. She missed the way he\u2019d whispered passionately to her.</p><p>Everything had been consensual. He\u2019d even begged her to stop it, and she hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d wanted what they could give her and hadn\u2019t stopped to think about how she would feel afterward until it was too late. She couldn\u2019t be the woman who completed them. Fate had merely placed her in their way. They wanted someone, and she happened to be in their path. End of story.</p><p>She held the files to her chest. She really did need to review them, figure out if Greg was using her charity for criminal purposes. She needed to piece together the evidence and decide if her sister and her father were truly plotting to kill her. But mostly, she needed distance to figure out what had just happened to her body. Her will. Her heart. She\u2019d nearly given everything to a couple of men she barely knew. She wasn\u2019t ever rash or irresponsible. Why them? Why now? And why did she want to put her arms around Law? Why did she want to brush against Dominic and see if she could arouse him again?</p> <p>Why did she feel as if Riley was missing and ache to invite him in?</p><p>The conflicting thoughts and wants in her head were making her crazy, dizzy. She was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cGigi, come on.\u201d She turned to look for her dog, but her little Yorkie was gone.</p><p>\u201cShe took off with Butch. Sorry, but he\u2019s been nosing around her all day,\u201d Dominic supplied. \u201cIs she in heat?\u201d</p><p>Oh, god. Probably. She\u2019d been intending to breed Gigi once before getting her fixed. After all, her puppy was a pure bred, and Kinley knew plenty of other AKC Yorkie owners whose pets could sire. But Gigi and Butch were totally off plan...just like her ill-fated tryst with Law and Dominic had been.</p> <p>Damn it, her dog was likely in heat, and so was Kinley. She\u2019d gone so long without sex that she\u2019d been desperate to do it with anyone. Except that she\u2019d never really wanted to before. And she definitely hadn\u2019t wanted Greg. In fact, she\u2019d kind of decided she was asexual\u2014until a few minutes ago. Now she couldn\u2019t get her mind off sex.</p><p>\u201cIf your dog forces himself on mine, I will hold you responsible for doggy rape.\u201d Even as she said the words, she realized just how silly and righteous they sounded. No court would uphold human laws for nonconsensual canine violation. It was irrational, but Kinley was irritated and hurt that her only comfort in life now was apparently off somewhere trying to become pregnant by some overgrown hound.</p><p>Just the way she\u2019d narrowly missed the chance to be knocked up by a pair of Special Forces soldiers.</p><p>The thought was mortifying. She stomped toward the kitchen door. Riley stood in the hallway, a stark look on his angled face. He\u2019d been leaning against the wall, his head down. He masked the expression quickly, his eyes narrowing on her. How much had he heard?</p><p>\u201cYou want to try me, cupcake? Now that you\u2019ve had some of the big brothers, do you need more? Or is this your way of trying to gain the upper hand, disarm us all with pussy? If so, you played the virginal card with just the right amount of innocence. Bravo.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d heard everything. Shame filled her. \u201cI want to go to my room.\u201d</p> <p>Riley stood in her way. \u201cAre you planning to cry rape now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t raped. Not in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know that, but you seem like the kind of woman who\u2019ll use every tool in her arsenal to get her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me! And you\u2019re a jerk. Your brother is wrong about you. He told me how kind and funny and smart you are, but you\u2019re just a big bully. I\u2019m away from home, I\u2019m scared, and I\u2019m totally out of my element. Yet you enjoy kicking me when I\u2019m down. Get out of my way so I can go back to my cell. Then you can go to hell for all I care.\u201d</p><p>Law approached her from behind. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find my way there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I doubt you\u2019ll lock yourself in.\u201d</p><p>The quip made her fume, but she still marched off without another word, down the hall, ignoring the men behind her. She zipped into her room and slammed her door. Immediately, she heard them lock her in.</p> <p>She was alone again. Alone with the evidence against her family. Alone with a million questions. The fears and doubts started to sink in once again.</p><p>A moment later, Law opened the door, and Gigi padded in, her pink bow askew. He slammed it once more, locking her in with her furry little harlot.</p><p>Gigi stood at the door, whining a little, probably crying for her lover.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I kind of want to do that, too.\u201d But for now she would settle for taking a shower. Maybe when she was clean she wouldn\u2019t feel their hands on her, stroking her, making her want more of what she couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>She walked into the en suite bathroom and turned the shower to hot. All her favorite products had been placed there, from her razor to the shampoo she used every day. Greg probably didn\u2019t even know what color her eyes were, but one of these men knew that she preferred lavender soap.</p><p>What was her next move here? What should she do? What did she believe?</p><p>She looked up at the window beside the shower enclosure. It was high on the wall, but she could see that the glass in the bathroom wasn\u2019t nearly as thick as the panes in the bedroom.</p><p>Kinley climbed on the toilet and was able to just grasp the handle. Holding her breath, she inspected the window. It wasn\u2019t sealed shut and didn\u2019t have a lock. It should actually swing open and let her free.</p><p>She had to swallow her shout of surprise. She\u2019d found a way out! In a few hours, she could have her bags repacked and a plan in motion. The sun would be coming up, and they\u2019d probably still be sleeping. She could be long gone before they even knew she was missing.</p><p>All good news. But Kinley couldn\u2019t help but wonder if, now that she\u2019d found a way to escape, should she take it?</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Riley stretched and looked out over the vast expanse of green. From the wide front porch, he got an eyeful of mountains rising up like the sun.</p><p>Dawn had come, though it didn\u2019t really mean much this time of the year. Summer days in Alaska were seemingly endless. His system hadn\u2019t quite adjusted from East Coast time.</p><p>The smell of coffee filled his nostrils. He hadn\u2019t slept much. Whether that was because the sun barely dipped below the horizon or the fact that he couldn\u2019t shut his brain off didn\u2019t matter. It was all Kinley\u2019s fault in the end. He\u2019d thought about her all damn night. Over and over during the long hours, his mind had played out the memories of Kinley as he\u2019d stood outside the kitchen door and listened to her shudder and gasp and scream as she came. Under his brother\u2019s hand. And apparently for the first time.</p><p>How the hell had a woman who looked like that managed to stay a damn virgin? He hated Greg Jansen for various reasons, but he\u2019d never thought the man was an idiot. Any straight male who could be engaged to Kinley Kohl and not keep her in bed for days and days was obviously a complete moron.</p><p>But then Riley knew he wasn\u2019t exactly smart either. None of them were if they believed she could really want them.</p><p>\u201cSo she turned away from you?\u201d Riley asked, looking at his brother who sat in a rocking chair not five feet away.</p><p>\u201cShe got scared.\u201d Law sipped his coffee, not looking at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not so surprising. She has very little experience. We have to be careful with her, but she\u2019s coming along.\u201d</p><p>Had his brother lost his ever-loving mind? \u201cShe ran from you. She couldn\u2019t get out of the kitchen fast enough.\u201d</p><p>Law\u2019s face bunched up in consternation. \u201cNo, Kinley was afraid, not of me or Dominic. She enjoyed the way we touched her. A lot, in fact. What she felt scared her. Put yourself in her shoes. If her own family is willing to betray her, she\u2019s going to find trusting anyone, especially the guys who kidnapped her, really hard. But she wants what we\u2019re dying to give her. She won\u2019t be able to hold out for long.\u201d</p><p>Law sounded more confident than Riley had ever heard, assassinations excepting. His brother never worried that he wouldn\u2019t be able to take out a target, but when it came to women, he often seemed dead inside. Or maybe Law\u2019s attitude had stemmed from the fact that he hadn\u2019t cared about the females they\u2019d shared in the past. Maybe he\u2019d always just gone along with what Riley and Dominic wanted. After all, Law had never brought a potential female to them. Sure, he\u2019d enjoyed the sex, but he\u2019d never fought for a girl the way he was fighting for Kinley now.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever care for Simone?\u201d He\u2019d never asked Law before. Now Riley realized that once he\u2019d fallen for Simone, he\u2019d assumed his brother would too...eventually.</p><p>Law shook his head. \u201cI find it hard to really care about a woman who\u2019s completely cold. Now, as a beer cooler, she worked perfectly. I could set a brew down next to that woman and it was chilled in three point five seconds.\u201d</p><p>Where had the sense of humor come from? \u201cCould you be serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Here\u2019s the truth: Simone was interested in you because she liked having a Harvard-educated man on her arm. She wanted Dominic for his social connections and his millions. She put up with me because fucking me was the price of admission if she wanted to keep you two. And she never let me forget it.\u201d</p><p>Simone had said that to his brother? Why had Law never told him? \u201cWhen shit got serious, she didn\u2019t want me either.\u201d</p><p>Law sighed. \u201cWhen she turned your proposal down, she claimed it was because she couldn\u2019t live an openly perverted lifestyle because everyone would call her a whore. I call bullshit. Everybody already knew she was a whore. I firmly believe she would have been more than happy to spend the rest of her life in bed with both you and Dominic. And she would have put up with me. Your trouble was the marriage proposal didn\u2019t come from the right person.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Law had spoken, Riley realized there was a lot of truth to his brother\u2019s words. God, he\u2019d been so fucking dumb. \u201cShe wanted to be legally married to Dominic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney wins over brains,\u201d Law said, sympathy in his voice.</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d He felt like he\u2019d been kicked in the gut all over again.</p><p>His brother shrugged. \u201cLook on the bright side. Your brain still won out over my brawn.\u201d</p><p>Despite that, if Simone had said yes, Law would have sacrificed his heart to make him and Dominic happy. \u201cWhy did you let me propose to her, knowing what she was? Why would you have stayed in a relationship with a woman you didn\u2019t even like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond the extra freezer space?\u201d Law took a sip of his coffee and sat back. \u201cYou were in love with her. Or you thought you were. I\u2019ve never felt that way before and I thought at the time that I was incapable of it. So I played along. And, to be honest, I didn\u2019t think it would work in the long run anyway because I knew Dominic wasn\u2019t going to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding and sharing one woman is never going to work, is it?\u201d The family they had talked about didn\u2019t make sense in the real world. Legalities aside, no woman wanted to deal with three men. Not even if she realized it meant she\u2019d never be alone, that she would always have someone to care for her. That she would never end up like his mother.</p><p>\u201cI think it can, if we handle her in just the right way. Our strategy has to be stealth. We have to point out all the great things about having three guys around, reel her in with the sex, downplay the cooking and laundry, then maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop imagining that Kinley is our dream girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t in there,\u201d Law argued. \u201cYou were outside listening. You didn\u2019t see how Kinley reached for Dominic. No hesitation. She saw him and she grabbed on. If you had walked in, she would have grabbed you, too.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and Dominic joined them on the porch for the chilly morning, steaming mug in hand. \u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Law\u2019s eyes rolled. \u201cGod, when did you two turn so whiny? It wasn\u2019t a mistake. It was the first thing we\u2019ve done right with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious, Law? She was horrified. She pushed us away.\u201d Dominic looked fresh from a shower. He\u2019d changed into sweatpants and an Army T-shirt. It was odd to see Dominic out of his usual suit, and made Riley realize that the last few years had been a never-ending series of jobs. None of them had actually relaxed in forever.</p><p>\u201cYeah, after she had her orgasm.\u201d Law\u2019s lips curled up again. \u201cIt was a perfectly natural time for her to run. She\u2019s a virgin, and I think she feared what came next. We have to put her at ease. And I think we can all agree she\u2019s a greedy girl who needs to learn her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer place? Law, we kidnapped her. We can\u2019t just tie her up and spank her ass. In a way, she holds our fate in her hands. If she tells the feds we raped her, we\u2019re going down even harder.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dominic was right, and Riley knew damn well just how fast a woman could turn on them.</p><p>The tablet next to Law chirped, and all three heads snapped toward the device.</p><p>\u201cIs that our security system?\u201d Dominic asked.</p><p>\u201cStay calm.\u201d Law was always cool under pressure. \u201cNone of the locals know we\u2019re here. Riley, you deal with this thing.\u201d</p> <p>He took the tablet from his brother\u2019s hand. Well, thankfully they still needed him for something.</p><p>Mind racing and fingers flying, Riley tapped in the passcode. He\u2019d modified the tablet to meet their needs, connecting it to the wide band of security cameras he\u2019d placed throughout the house. They all fed into Riley\u2019s computer, which then communicated with the tablet.</p><p>He moved swiftly through the protocols and discerned the issue. \u201cSomeone tripped one of my motion detectors on the west side of the house. Probably an animal.\u201d</p><p>There was always something walking around the grounds since the forest wasn\u2019t far away.</p><p>\u201cOr Butch, I let him out a couple of minutes ago. He\u2019s been scratching at Kinley\u2019s door all morning.\u201d Dominic leaned in, looking at the screen. \u201cCan you bring up the cameras? Kinley\u2019s room is on the west side. I just want to be sure...\u201d</p> <p>He quickly brought up the perimeter camera. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>Dominic squinted, his brow furrowing as he peered at an unfamiliar, out-of-place brown square on the grass, visible on the tablet screen. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of her roller bags.\u201d</p><p>Another item dropped, hitting the roller bag, then listed to the side.</p><p>\u201cIs that her purse? How is she getting out?\u201d Law demanded.</p><p>Riley forced himself to remember every inch of the suite they\u2019d put her in. He\u2019d checked it over himself. And then he remembered... \u201cShit. The bathroom window!\u201d</p><p>When the owners of the house, the James brothers, had given them a tour, their wife Hannah had mentioned they\u2019d had the window specially placed there. It had come from her great grandmother\u2019s home. Hannah had wanted a piece of her history here, so her men had made it happen. Because it wasn\u2019t hurricane glass, it actually opened. And Kinley had figured that out.</p> <p>\u201cThat window is supposed to be decorative. It\u2019s eight feet up,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>The biggest grin lit up Law\u2019s face. \u201cDamn, she\u2019s resourceful. I appreciate that in a woman. How is she going to get the dog down?\u201d</p><p>Gigi\u2019s body came into the frame, her eyes bugging out and those little paws shaking as she was lowered down.</p><p>\u201cDid she tie a sheet around the rat thing?\u201d Dominic asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk bad about your dog\u2019s baby mama. Oh, look she\u2019s got her bow back on straight.\u201d Law didn\u2019t seem upset that their prisoner was attempting escape.</p><p>The minute the dog hit the ground, Butch came into view as though he\u2019d been sitting just outside the camera\u2019s edge, waiting for his true love.</p><p>As Butch rather clumsily attempted to mount Gigi, Dominic cursed. \u201cGoddamn it. I\u2019m going to get his ass fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think his ass needs fixing. His dick on the other hand seems really interested in Gigi. Aw, look. He\u2019s frustrated. He can\u2019t get it in there with that sheet wrapped around her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a fucking comedian?\u201d Dominic groused.</p><p>Law sent him a deprecating shrug, then shot to his feet with a frown. \u201cDamn it, how is Kinley planning on getting out? That window is too high. She\u2019s going to break her neck. I\u2019ve got to stop her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Dominic stayed Law with a tap on the arm. \u201cWould you look at that? I\u2019ve got to hand it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she manage to not only get herself through that window, but fashion a rope from the rest of the bed sheets?\u201d Riley was stunned. \u201cShit! She\u2019s rappelling down the side of the house in heels.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to run away from her kidnappers in stilettos. Riley couldn\u2019t see their color on the black and white feed, but he imagined them as fire engine red. And damn, he couldn\u2019t focus on anything but those heels. They would make her legs look a million miles long as he spread her wide for his cock. Well, when someone else did all that. He wasn\u2019t touching her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and look at that ass in those jeans. Damn.\u201d Law sighed and adjusted his fly.</p><p>His brother was right.</p><p>On the screen, Kinley hit the ground and immediately tried shooing Butch away from Gigi. She scooped her dog up, but Butch just barked happily like it was all a game. They could hear the commotion coming from around the side of the house.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Kinley hissed in a whisper that he heard clear as a bell. \u201cNice dog. Hush. Go find your master.\u201d</p><p>Dominic groaned. \u201cDoes she know what that word does to my cock? Fuck, yeah, I could master her.\u201d</p><p>Riley had kind of thought the same. Except he refused to be led around by his dick like the dog and his brothers by some female destined to leave them. He was too smart for that. \u201cAre either one of you going to stop her?\u201d</p><p>Dominic and Law just stared at the tablet like it held all the secrets of the world.</p><p>\u201cSoon. I want to see what she\u2019s going to do. I\u2019m at a complete loss with this girl,\u201d Dominic admitted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to get away,\u201d Riley pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDude, she can\u2019t even get rid of Butch. I doubt she\u2019s going to make it very far, especially in those heels. They\u2019re sexy but fucking impractical.\u201d Law pointed to the screen where she was shoving Gigi into her oversized purse and pulling at her roller bag as she pleaded with Butch to stay. \u201cDo you see her trekking miles to civilization in those shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s if she even knows where to go.\u201d Dominic started around the end of the porch. \u201cBut it looks like she\u2019s trying to head north. Why is she going toward the forest?\u201d</p><p>Riley followed him with Law trailing after. \u201cMaybe she just wants to find cover.\u201d</p><p>Law snorted. \u201cShe should want to find a road. I don\u2019t think she really believes she\u2019s in Alaska. I bet she thinks she\u2019ll walk a mile or two and find a town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let her get that far, right?\u201d Riley prompted.</p><p>Kinley wouldn\u2019t do well out in the wilderness. She would be all alone, and he\u2019d bet she had zero outdoor skills, like starting a fire or building shelter, much less knowing what plants were safe to eat. In fact, she might have negative skills since she seemed to think that her heels were proper footwear for mountainous terrain.</p><p>Law left the porch as she hobbled to the side of the house, giving them a clear line of sight. Kinley shoved her hair aside with one hand and tried to shoo Butch using her roller bag with the other.</p><p>\u201cNah, I just want to see how far she\u2019ll go before she runs back here,\u201d Law said finally. \u201cShe\u2019s being impulsive. She does this a lot. In the end, she\u2019s always sensible. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Law was the subject matter expert when it came to Kinley Kohl. Just as he said the words, she stopped, and Riley watched as her shoulders rolled and she drew in a deep breath. She seemed to be having an argument with herself.</p><p>\u201cSee, Kinley is telling herself that she\u2019s being stubborn,\u201d Law explained. \u201cShe did the same thing when she went to the spa to get a bikini wax earlier this week. She stood outside that damn building for twenty minutes telling herself that she was being dumb and that most women didn\u2019t shape their pubic hair into a style. Finally, she made the right decision and got a full Brazilian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI listened in on her conversation with Annabelle,\u201d Law explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a coffee shop right next door. She sat down at one of the tables. I was beside her. At first, I was pissy that she waxed for that douchebag, but then I didn\u2019t care why her pussy was soft and ready to eat. I just appreciated that it was. She might have been thinking of him when she did it, but I\u2019ll be the one reaping the reward. Oh, look, she\u2019s not ready to make the right call yet.\u201d</p><p>She started walking again. Butch was still following along, but now Gigi had decided she wanted dick more than designer luggage since she was trying to climb free of her carrier.</p><p>Kinley\u2019s blonde hair bounced with every wobbling step she took. Heels in soft earth just didn\u2019t make a stride easy. She\u2019d put on a sweater, but it didn\u2019t cover her ass. That luscious, gorgeous backside swayed, and Riley couldn\u2019t seem to pry his stare from her juicy cheeks. That was an ass made for a man\u2019s hands. The rhinestones all over her butt glittered in the sun, a veritable Get It Here sign right across her tush.</p><p>She turned slightly as though she felt eyes on her, but she didn\u2019t see them under the shadow of the porch.</p><p>God, she was an adorable bundle of chaos, Riley admitted. Definitely not someone who overthought everything, the way he tended to. Kinley lit up a room with just her smile. She fucking glowed. Okay, so she was na\u00efve and didn\u2019t always make the most rational choices when she let her emotions rule. Because she used her heart far more than her head.</p><p>Riley stared with a thoughtful sigh. She needed a man. Or two. Or three.</p><p>Damn, but she was getting to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d Dominic pointed to the edge of the tree line where the forest started ahead.</p><p>A massive moose lumbered along. Kinley focused on Butch barking behind her.</p><p>\u201cKinley! Baby, watch out!\u201d Law yelled as he jogged toward her.</p><p>Butch started growling at the moose. Kinley finally turned around\u2014and her whole body went rigid. She gasped.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt you!\u201d Law yelled.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t charge her, but it might kick her if she got too close.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an herbivore!\u201d Dominic promised, laughing. It had been months and months since Riley had seen Dominic even crack a smile. \u201cDo you think the moose likes designer luggage?\u201d</p><p>Kinley let out a little scream, then turned and staggered as fast as her heels would take her. She didn\u2019t just run from the moose. She darted straight toward Law, dumping everything on the ground except Gigi and her carrier, then practically jumped into his arms, wrapping her legs around him.</p><p>Law\u2019s whole body shook with the force of his laughter, but he held her like he meant to protect her, no matter what. He didn\u2019t even seem to mind that Gigi\u2019s head poked out of the purse and that she seemed intent on licking every inch of his arm.</p><p>\u201cLaw is in love with her,\u201d Riley muttered. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Dominic sobered. \u201cAnd Law\u2019s only going to fall once. If this doesn\u2019t work out, he\u2019ll mourn her for the rest of his life. I can\u2019t fix it, man. If this was another time, another place, I would be all in. I like her. She\u2019s a little impractical and stubborn at times, but she\u2019s also loyal and so damn sweet that I almost can\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we have to help ourselves because this isn\u2019t going to end well.\u201d Riley couldn\u2019t stand the thought of his brothers being hurt. But unless Law changed course, it was inevitable. And if Dominic hopped on the bandwagon, too...shit.</p><p>And Riley hated the ache that split his chest as he watched Law turn and head back to the house, still carrying Kinley. His brother\u2019s face was completely open and happy. She said something, looking both terrified and animated. Law howled again, then leaned in to brush his lips against hers. She met him halfway. When the kiss was over, she didn\u2019t try to retreat, but simply buried her face in his neck and held on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It probably won\u2019t end well,\u201d Dominic admitted, his prior joy draining from his face. \u201cBut I think you should be ready to let Law make his own mistakes. If she wants him, then let him be happy for however long it lasts. Not every woman plays with a man like Simone,\u201d he reminded. \u201cI\u2019m going to go grab her bags before the moose decides to take a dump on them. We need to get a lock on that window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much nature, Law. It\u2019s everywhere!\u201d Kinley insisted as Law carried her to the porch. \u201cWhy is there so much of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Alaska, baby. Nature is a big selling point here. No one comes to this part of the world expecting a Neiman\u2019s around the corner.\u201d Law glanced his way. \u201cI\u2019m going to sit her down and feed her some breakfast. Do you want anything?\u201d</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t want food. He was shocked to realize that, deep down, he wanted to feel the way Law felt now. Some dangerously yearning spot inside him railed that she didn\u2019t cling to him\u2014or even look his way. He wanted to know her, feel like he had a place beside her.</p><p>He had to stop thinking this shit.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve got some work to do. Come on, Butch. Let\u2019s go look at that window.\u201d</p><p>The dog utterly ignored him, following Law, Kinley, and Gigi inside.</p><p>Everyone had a crush it seemed.</p><p>He watched through the window as Law sat Kinley at the table and poured her a cup of coffee. She peeked at Law from beneath her lashes and bit her lower lip, her eyes downcast until he handed her the mug. Then her brilliant smile damn near lit up the whole house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Riley took a step back. He was not falling for a woman to try to share with his brothers again. He couldn\u2019t. She was Law\u2019s. Dominic could flirt with sharing a corner of their sheets or whatever. Not his problem, and Riley knew he had to let this go. If the other two didn\u2019t care about getting burned again, that was their call. They\u2019d see the light when she used her charm to escape, this time for good. Kinley didn\u2019t really want them, and the fairy tale complete with the picket fence Law was envisioning would never happen. The sooner he and Dom figured that out, the better.</p><p>With a sigh, Riley went back to work.</p><p>Kinley took a long swallow of her wine and stared at the accounting books spread across the table in front of her. Hours and hours had gone by since she\u2019d escaped, only to turn around and run back into her captor\u2019s arms.</p><p>Moose shouldn\u2019t be that big. Like huge. Enormous. And slobbery. That thing could seriously put out the mucous.</p> <p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Riley Anders stood in the doorway, leaning negligently against it.</p><p>He was heartbreakingly gorgeous, and it was so obvious that he wanted nothing to do with her. He was the only one who never invaded her space, who stayed as far from her as possible.</p><p>She knew these men considered themselves so close that they were all for one and one for all. If Riley didn\u2019t want her, she was screwed. Or not screwed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Except that she was dumber than dirt, and the evidence in front of her proved it. The last six weeks showed a series of payouts that she couldn\u2019t account for. And apparently her accountant wasn\u2019t doing his job anymore for whatever reason. Someone had been keeping the books, but nothing like meticulous Steve.</p><p>And she was a fool because she just knew she was falling for the men who had kidnapped her.</p> <p>Nothing in the world had felt so right as running toward Law this morning. Even as she\u2019d crawled out the window, something inside her kept insisting she was making a huge mistake. But logic told her that she should want to escape her abductors, so she\u2019d kept walking. Very quickly, Kinley had realized that she knew absolutely nothing about surviving in the woods. And obviously, they hadn\u2019t lied about the whole Alaska thing. The sun didn\u2019t stay down for very long. She\u2019d managed to sleep a little, but the lack of darkness threw off her whole system.</p><p>So did they.</p><p>Riley stood in the doorway, almost staring a hole through her. \u201cHow about the rat thing?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she liked them referring to her dog as a rat. \u201cGigi is fine now that\u2019s she\u2019s been fed.\u201d</p><p>Riley frowned. \u201cIs that what all the barking was about? For such a little thing, she can be awfully loud.\u201d</p><p>Gigi was simply a dog who knew what she wanted. \u201cShe\u2019s used to a certain feeding schedule. The whole kidnapping thing threw us off. If she starts up again, she\u2019s likely hungry so if you want her to stop, feed her a little something. And she\u2019s smart. She knows where the food is. She\u2019ll come running into the kitchen at least twice a day barking up a storm now that she knows where the food bowls are kept.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d Riley said. He looked back at the door as though he was contemplating walking back out, but then he seemed to come to a decision. That straight-line jaw of his firmed. \u201cAre you going to run again?\u201d</p><p>After the whole snot-nosed moose incident? \u201cNo. Now that I\u2019ve seen what\u2019s out there, I feel much safer here. You\u2019re not going to murder me and leave my body in the woods, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He took a single step toward her. \u201cWe really are trying to help you. Your boyfriend meant to kill you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d just about accepted that fact. \u201cHe was never my boyfriend, just my fianc\u00e9. That may sound weird, but a boyfriend is someone who wants you. A fianc\u00e9 can be bought. I should know.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d bought Greg with her name, her connections, and apparently her charity.</p><p>Riley stared at the floor. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know about that. I\u2019ve never had enough money to buy one.\u201d</p><p>She heard the bitter tone of his voice. \u201cYeah, well, I would tell you to hold out for someone you love. The whole sacrifice thing tends to go wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you saw it? A sacrifice?\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d been sacrificing her whole life. She\u2019d given up so much time, energy, and love. She\u2019d always thought that, while her sister and father meant well, they struggled with self-discipline and showing affection. But now she knew they simply didn\u2019t have any kind of a conscience.</p><p>\u201cYes. I was marrying Greg because I firmly believed my father had cancer and my charity was going under. The economy has been bad. Donations are way down. Hope House was the work of my mom\u2019s heart. I couldn\u2019t let it die. And the thought of my dad having cancer and no insurance nearly killed me. Mom was the one who worked. Dad, uhm...he didn\u2019t think about practicalities like paying bills and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he was too busy gambling to send his check in.\u201d</p><p>She started to protest and stopped. Because it was true. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were marrying Greg to save your dad and your charity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd because I was lonely.\u201d Her heart ached, and she was too tired to lie. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-five and I\u2019ve never had a lover. I was lonely, and I wanted a family before it was too late.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a long moment. \u201cYou want a family? Like a husband and kids and a white picket fence?\u201d</p><p>That had been the dream, but... \u201cI think I would take love any way it came to me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but it was a bitter thing. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a woman like you to care about love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPampered. Rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney doesn\u2019t buy happiness, Riley. And we\u2019ve already covered that it can\u2019t buy love. At the end of the day, I\u2019m just a woman. I can\u2019t speak for all of them, but me? I just want to have a good life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would a good life be?\u201d</p><p>That idea hadn\u2019t changed in the years since she\u2019d first understood what the word family meant. \u201cSomeone who loves me. Someone I could love back. Children. A purpose that\u2019s meaningful. I\u2019m not talking about fame. I don\u2019t care if anyone knows who I am. I just want to make a difference. I want to make other people\u2019s lives better because I walked the earth. I want to make the people who love me proud. Is that too much to ask? I guess it is, because I don\u2019t seem to be able to do it.\u201d</p><p>He stared, a long moment passing before he spoke. \u201cI hope you find it. I came in here for a reason. Uhm, Jansen is on TV right now. Look, Law doesn\u2019t want you to watch this, but I think you should. You\u2019re strong enough to handle the truth. Greg is holding press conferences and telling people you were taken. He\u2019s trying to make a case for you to return to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, if you married Jansen, you wouldn\u2019t be compelled to testify against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d She wanted to see whatever Law sought to protect her from. It was sweet that he didn\u2019t want her hurt or upset, but she needed to know. She was quickly realizing that she wanted what these men could give her. Law offered utter devotion. He would try to shield her with every ounce of his being. Dominic challenged her. He wanted her to be smarter, better than she thought she could be.</p><p>And Riley was an equal, who supposedly appreciated life and humor and the people he shared them with. Which was why it hurt so much that he wasn\u2019t interested.</p><p>He turned on the TV hanging on the opposite wall and changed the channel to a twenty-four- hour news network. Greg\u2019s face immediately came up. He was wearing a perfectly pressed suit as he spoke to the camera. It didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d missed any sleep.</p><p>\u201cSomeone took my fianc\u00e9e. I can only pray they treat her well. She\u2019s my heart. She\u2019s the better half of me. I\u2019m begging for Kinley\u2019s swift return.\u201d</p><p>A voice came from the audience. \u201cHow do you reply to Kellan Kent\u2019s assertion that Kinley Kohl is a runaway bride who fled your wedding with her lover?\u201d</p><p>She had a lover? Oh, this story was way more interesting than her actual life.</p><p>Greg frowned. \u201cMy bride isn\u2019t interested in lovers. This is pure libel. She\u2019s an innocent. Kinley is one of the world\u2019s most true and pure souls.\u201d</p><p>Meaning an idiot who couldn\u2019t get a guy\u2014or see when the one in front of her was trying to profit from her death.</p><p>Greg droned on. \u201cKinley would never abandon her family without a word. She values her loved ones and knows that her sister misses her. That her father needs her. I pray she\u2019ll find a way to survive this because my everything depends on her coming home.\u201d</p><p>He stared into the camera, giving her that same look he\u2019d given her when he\u2019d offered to save her charity. It made her feel dirty and selfish because she had to choose between throwing caution to the wind for what she wanted and whoring herself for the people who needed her.</p><p>Becks was in the background, her face shining in the sunlight as she stood behind Greg. She had on her best suit, the one that showed off the ten grand she\u2019d spent on her boobs. She kept her left side to the camera because she\u2019d always told Kinley that was her good side. It was so comforting to know her sister was concerned with how hot she looked on camera.</p><p>Kinley loved her niece and nephew. She\u2019d never understood how Becks could send them off to boarding school, especially so young, but it was all there in her sister\u2019s plastic face. The woman didn\u2019t feel anything. Something was deeply and profoundly wrong with Becks. She was missing her heart, possessed an empty soul. She didn\u2019t care about anyone but herself.</p><p>Same with her father.</p><p>Her mother had been so lovely, but she\u2019d accepted less than she\u2019d deserved. Would her mother have wanted her to do the same? What did Kinley want for herself? What was she willing to accept? How much was she willing to risk?</p><p>A plan started to germinate in her head. Law, Riley, and Dominic had kidnapped her...</p><p>\u201cHe sounds sympathetic.\u201d Riley frowned at the screen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to press charges.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d decided that before she made her one escape. When she\u2019d been wrapped around Law\u2019s body, his arms holding her close, she\u2019d known she didn\u2019t want freedom. Freedom had kind of sucked because it couldn\u2019t love you back. \u201cI\u2019m not going to press charges. I\u2019ll go along with what Kellan said. You were smart to involve him. He\u2019s Annabelle\u2019s employer. She cares about him. I\u2019m not going to take him down any more than I would the three of you, so I\u2019ll go along with his cover story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell the press that you took medication for your nerves and were sleeping it off while you let Law whisk you away to a secluded lovers\u2019 retreat?\u201d</p><p>Why not? What did she have if she went home besides a life of taking care of people who would never thank her and always want more? And that was provided Greg didn\u2019t kill her first. Here was a totally different tale. Nice accommodations, good food, sure. Law had actually asked her for her preferences before they\u2019d cooked dinner. Dominic had even asked what kind of wine she\u2019d like. Before these guys, no one had ever given a damn what she wanted. And now that she thought about it, she was pretty sure Riley had been the one to pick her warm clothes.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not. I\u2019m just a bride gone wild. This sweater is a little scratchy.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his blue eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s one hundred percent pure cashmere. It can\u2019t be scratchy.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Riley had picked her clothes with care, like she was important to him. Law carried her around like she didn\u2019t weigh a thing. Dominic looked at her like he wanted to eat her up.</p><p>And her fianc\u00e9? The man she\u2019d been ready to marry was sleeping with her sister and planning to murder her so he could take over her business.</p><p>She\u2019d played by the rules for far too long. The rules hadn\u2019t gotten her anywhere. These ridiculous ideals had left her a virgin, completely and utterly alone. They had placed her in a position where everyone lied to her. Getting kidnapped had brought her clarity, shown her a place where at least a couple of men wanted to bring her pleasure.</p><p>Pleasure was better than the nothing she\u2019d had before.</p><p>\u201cCould you call Law and Dominic in?\u201d An idea had been brewing in her brain all day, a way for her to get something out of this. Determination had replaced mildness in the last several hours. She wanted something beyond just getting to live and keeping her charity. She wanted something for her.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Riley asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to them.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to explain it to Riley. He wouldn\u2019t understand. He would probably be horrified. But she hoped that Dominic and Law would grasp her meaning immediately. They had kissed her, held her, brought her pleasure. Dominic had gone cold only after she\u2019d pulled away. And Law had just been hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kinley supposed that some would argue that Law had hurt her by abducting her. But he hadn\u2019t. In his head\u2014and heart\u2014he\u2019d really believed he was saving her. She kind of had to agree. Because of that, she didn\u2019t like hurting Law in any way. The idea that she had made her feel anxious inside.</p><p>She wanted more than that unfinished experience in the kitchen and she was willing to give in order to get. If Riley didn\u2019t want her, fine. She would go into the situation knowing that whatever passed between her, Dominic, and Law wouldn\u2019t be long term. But she would finally ask for what she wanted. If they turned her down... she had no idea what she would do.</p><p>Riley turned and exited, leaving her alone with the cable news channels who questioned everything from her whereabouts to her morality. There was a short story on Annabelle\u2019s law firm and how they were handling the case Greg was trying to build against the \u201cunnamed suspect.\u201d</p><p>So Annabelle had a hand in this. Kinley wasn\u2019t sure of her exact role, but she smiled anyway. Of course some people would be deeply disturbed by a friend\u2019s involvement in a criminal act, but Kinley had looked at all the evidence now. Belle had done her damnedest to persuade her to not marry Greg...and Kinley hadn\u2019t listened. If she had been in Annabelle\u2019s shoes, she would have fought like hell to save her friend, too, including having her kidnapped.</p> <p>So Law had a good lawyer who had floated the story that she was overwrought and medicated. Legally, it was a good play. The story wasn\u2019t totally implausible. It bought them all some time.</p><p>The doors opened, and her heart rate tripled as all three men strode into the room. Law was at least six and a half feet tall with stark blue eyes that pierced right through her. Dominic was so gorgeous and commanding, he made her heart stop. Slightly taller than Law, he was just as broad, his body lean and strong. And Riley\u2019s face could be on a movie poster. He was stunning, not to mention blazingly smart, which was a kind of sexy all its own. Three amazing men.</p><p>She could only really make a play for two.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you want something?\u201d Law asked.</p><p>He\u2019d been so easy to connect with. She\u2019d fallen for him so quickly. He\u2019d held her when she was scared, when she felt alone. Law was the kind of man who did what it took to protect the people he cared about. Kinley couldn\u2019t deny she admired that.</p> <p>\u201cI have an idea and I\u2019d appreciate you listening.\u201d Her heart was pounding out of her chest, and she was surprised she couldn\u2019t hear it. But she couldn\u2019t shy away. She was done being the good girl. She was done playing by anyone\u2019s rules but her own. She was more than ready to find out who Kinley Kohl really was and what she was capable of. \u201cI want to trade.\u201d</p><p>Dominic stepped closer, scowling. \u201cTrade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need my help with your case against Greg. Fine. I\u2019m willing, but I want something in return.\u201d</p><p>Law\u2019s mouth turned down. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowledge.\u201d</p><p>Dominic turned to both of his partners with a shrug, then back to her. \u201cWhat kind of knowledge?\u201d</p> <p>Kinley bit her lip. Was this stupid? Maybe, but she was still going to do it because she wanted\u2014needed\u2014this. \u201cAbout sex.\u201d</p><p>The words dropped inside the room like a bomb, and the silence that followed in the aftermath seemed to go on forever.</p><p>\u201cSex?\u201d Riley finally asked, his tone intimating that she had to be kidding.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Kinley dragged in a rough breath. \u201cI would like to trade information about my charity and Greg for information about sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to watch a video?\u201d Riley asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Law shot his brother a dirty look. \u201cShe\u2019s not asking for a porn flick, idiot. She wants to talk about sex.\u201d</p><p>There was a bit more to it than that. Were they really going to make her say it? \u201cI want to maybe, probably...a-almost certainly actually have sex.\u201d</p><p>Kinley resisted the urge to slam her eyes shut and pray they didn\u2019t laugh.</p> <p>Instead, Dominic stared a hole through her. \u201cLet me see if I\u2019ve got this right. You want to trade information for a good fucking?\u201d</p><p>God, when he put it that way, she felt two feet tall. And she was done feeling like crap about herself. \u201cIf I\u2019m not putting you out too much or making you do something against your will, yes. I would like to exchange what little I understand about what\u2019s happening with Hope House for first-hand sexual knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just ask us if we want to go to bed?\u201d Law asked, arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cI want to have sex with men who know what they\u2019re doing. And I don\u2019t expect something for nothing. I know that everything comes with a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said men.\u201d Dominic emphasized the word with a hard edge.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She needed to make herself clear. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about sex. It seems to me that I wouldn\u2019t have been deceived by the people who are supposed to love me if I wasn\u2019t so na\u00efve. Maybe if I\u2019d been more worldly, I would have realized that my sister was sleeping with Greg. Maybe if I knew what good sex was, I would have admitted to myself sooner that I had no interest in him and stopped fooling myself that marriage between us would work. Maybe if I wasn\u2019t a na\u00efve little virgin, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>Those weren\u2019t her only reasons, but the ones the guys needed to hear. Kinley ached to know what it felt like to be in their bed. God, she wanted that so badly. The days she\u2019d been with them seemed surreal. She\u2019d been terrified, then surprised. They\u2019d confronted her with realities that had broken her heart. Before she could go back and deal with the real world\u2014where she faced the likely loss of her family and her charity\u2014she needed a few moments of pure fantasy.</p><p>\u201cYou read the evidence?\u201d Dominic remained still as a statue, his eyes cold on her.</p><p>\u201cYes. I still don\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019s doing, but it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s using Hope House for something nefarious. If you ask the right questions, we might be able to find answers. I suspect you don\u2019t want to go to the feds until you actually know what he plotted.\u201d</p><p>Dominic nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give him any wiggle room or loopholes to jump through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough he\u2019s likely covering his ass right now,\u201d Riley explained. \u201cHe would have started the minute the police identified Law on that tape. I know the media is keeping his identity quiet because Kellan is handling it, but Greg knows who Dominic works with, so he knows who has you. It\u2019s another reason we moved your accountant. He\u2019s under watch at Black Oak Oil offices. We have some friends who can make sure he doesn\u2019t have a convenient accident or house fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can see just how serious all of this is?\u201d Dominic asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>He huffed, an oddly aristocratic sound. \u201cAnd yet you want to negotiate for sex? You want to sell your body to us, like you tried to do with Greg? Is that all you know how to do?\u201d</p><p>Shame flooded her. Somehow she\u2019d expected them to jump on the offer. It was just sex, after all. Men were supposed to really enjoy it. Kinley didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t barter for sex, so I\u2019m going to have to turn your offer down.\u201d Dominic scowled. \u201cI happen to believe that you will cooperate because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Kinley had always had the impression that he\u2019d do anything to avenge his sister, so his refusal was a blow to the gut. \u201cAre you saying no because I don\u2019t have any experience or because I don\u2019t arouse you?\u201d Actually, she didn\u2019t need to hear them explain all the reasons they didn\u2019t want her. She could guess. \u201cForget I asked. In fact, forget I said anything at all.\u201d</p><p>Kinley closed her eyes in mortification. She wasn\u2019t experienced, and they were men who had likely taken a lot of women to bed...as well as on sofas, across tables, and against walls. She wasn\u2019t beautiful enough for them and knew next to nothing about being sexy. She lacked grace and height and the ability to look really good in a short skirt. Not that they were so shallow as to want only those traits. But Kinley knew that she often wore rose-colored glasses, wasn\u2019t a fan of adrenaline, and probably didn\u2019t seem level-headed enough. She was all the things men like them wouldn\u2019t want in a woman.</p><p>Kinley gathered up the folders and clutched them tight to her breasts. Time to retreat and not emerge from her room again until she\u2019d figured out what Greg was doing. After that, hopefully she could go home. She might just go to Annabelle\u2019s and start over again. But she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to beg these men for anything again. She needed to salvage whatever shards of her pride she could.</p><p>\u201cKinley,\u201d Law began. \u201cBaby, why don\u2019t we all sit back down?\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked at her eyes, but she was determined to not shed them now. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather go back to my room. I promise no more running. Dominic, you\u2019re right. I will do what I can to help you. It\u2019s the right thing to do. Please forgive me for what I said earlier. I was just joking, badly it seems. If you have any questions, of course I\u2019ll answer them.\u201d</p><p>She turned away from them, acutely aware of their silence, and walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cKinley!\u201d Law finally called.</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, simply fled to her room and closed the door as the tears began to fall.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>A flaming fury kindled in Law\u2019s gut as he stared at Dominic. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s whole body stood stiff, defensive. \u201cI should be asking you that. Have you forgotten about Carrie? I guess so, since you\u2019re completely willing to toss this operation away for a couple of orgasms with a woman who wouldn\u2019t talk to you in the real world.\u201d</p><p>Law scoffed. \u201cShe talked to me just fine for a week, and you know what? Never once did she hang up on me because my bank account wasn\u2019t fat enough or because I wasn\u2019t \u2018good enough\u2019 for her. She always treated me like a human being worthy of concern. You\u2019re the one with the serious problem, Master Dominic.\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s eyes flared. \u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Riley moved between them, his hands up as though he could stop them from fighting. \u201cLet\u2019s take a breather, guys.\u201d</p><p>Law didn\u2019t want a breather. He wanted to have it out. \u201cGet your head out of your ass. You introduced me to this lifestyle. And the first thing you told me was to treat submissives with the respect they deserve. All you\u2019ve done is treat Kinley like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my sub,\u201d he pointed out, tossing his hands in the air. \u201cHell, I doubt she even knows what the word means. If I\u2019d taken her up on her offer, my need for her submission would probably send her running and screaming.\u201d</p><p>Dominic was being purposefully ignorant. \u201cMaybe not. She is a sub, and you know it. You knew it the minute you saw her. Just like you know the way you\u2019re treating her now is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to respect the fact that she wanted to trade sex for information that will bring down my sister\u2019s killer? Not going to happen. Besides, if I\u2019d said yes, she just would have regretted it later.\u201d</p><p>Law glared at his friend. \u201cWhen did you get so stupid? Or are you just lying to yourself so you don\u2019t have to face the fact that you want her? Kinley was asking for what she needs and hoping you would help me give it to her. She was willing to give you something in return. That was her way of negotiating with us. Why are you acting like this is something foreign? Insulting? We always negotiate our encounters with subs. You\u2019ve never made a single one of them feel like a whore\u2014until Kinley. Congratulations. How does it feel to be an asshole?\u201d</p><p>Dominic sighed, then rubbed at the bridge of his nose. \u201cShe caught me off guard. Besides, this is a fling, at best. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think we have meaningful relationships with the subs we pick up in clubs for a night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just... Once we\u2019ve put Jansen away, Kinley won\u2019t have anything more to do with us. You\u2019re kidding yourself if you think otherwise, Law. And I\u2019m not sure if she can handle a short-term affair. Why give her another reason to hate us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know her like I do.\u201d He had Dominic on the ropes. \u201cBut you need to make up your mind. Is she a whore or an innocent we need to protect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack the fuck off and stop thinking with your dick for two seconds. We\u2019re close to nailing Jansen. I\u2019ve worked for years to get Carrie justice, and I can\u2019t let Kinley stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your whole life about revenge, man? I\u2019m not telling you to give up on bringing Jansen down. He deserves it. But isn\u2019t there more to life? Are you really such an empty shell that you can\u2019t see Kinley is everything we could possibly want. She offered herself to us on a platter, dumbass. Look me in the eye and tell me you don\u2019t want her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dominic stayed silent, his stare holding Law\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re willing to admit it or not,\u201d Law grumbled. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t want her, you should\u2019ve let her down easy. Goddamn it, I\u2019ve seen you handle women for years. You know how to treat them kindly even when they\u2019re rude. Kinley tried to play by your rules and negotiate because she didn\u2019t feel that she had the right to simply ask for what she needed. And you treated her like crap.\u201d</p><p>Dominic opened his mouth, then stopped. Sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make her feel bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t hold back, did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did what I thought I needed to do,\u201d he shot back between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cTo protect yourself, yeah. And you didn\u2019t care if you hurt her in the process.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. It was the truth.</p><p>Law was done He couldn\u2019t seem to get through Dominic\u2019s thick skull, and Riley had built up a fortress around himself that Law wasn\u2019t sure anyone would ever get through. Was he willing to give up Kinley because his brothers wouldn\u2019t give her a chance?</p><p>No one ever put her first. If he was going to be her man, Law knew he needed to think about her above all others.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done here,\u201d Law said. \u201cI\u2019m going to Kinley. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not too dumb to see the future possibilities with her. I\u2019ll take care of her from now on. If she figures something out that will help you put Jansen behind bars, I\u2019ll let you two know. But starting now, she\u2019s mine. I make any decisions that concern her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell, Law? You can\u2019t just take ownership of her like she\u2019s a stray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking responsibility for her. And I\u2019m going to get a collar around her neck as soon as I can. Once I do, I expect you both to respect my rights. I was more than willing to share her, but I can see I\u2019ll have to do this on my own.\u201d</p><p>He turned and stalked out, frustration welling. He\u2019d finally found the right woman and they were too stubborn to see it. How could something so right go so fucking wrong?</p><p>He stopped outside Kinley\u2019s door, hesitating for the first time. Would she even want to talk to him? Or would she put him in the same category as Dominic? Law could almost forgive his brother. Riley had been deeply hurt by Simone. But Dominic? He\u2019d known the relationship with that bitch wouldn\u2019t work out, yet he still hadn\u2019t treated Simone half as badly as he\u2019d just behaved toward Kinley.</p><p>That was past. Time to forge his future. Law took a deep breath and knocked on her door.</p><p>\u201cGo away. I\u2019m not trying to escape.\u201d</p> <p>He turned the knob and walked in, standing over her as she stared out the window, attempting to hide the fact that she\u2019d been crying. In fact, they\u2019d made her cry far too much for his liking.</p><p>It was past time to take charge.</p><p>\u201cI know you aren\u2019t,\u201d he assured.</p><p>\u201cGood. I said I\u2019ll help you. And I\u2019m not going to press charges when this is over. So you can leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the tears in her voice, and they tore at him as he approached her. Damn, he wished he was better with words. \u201cBaby, I won\u2019t do that. In fact, I won\u2019t ever leave you alone again.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders shook, and she sniffled. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAww, baby...\u201d Law pulled her into his arms, and she buried her face in his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Dominic isn\u2019t usually so harsh with women. I think he\u2019s confused. He\u2019s caught between wanting you and avenging his sister. You have to understand that he\u2019s been trying to implicate Jansen for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about what he said. I meant the whole situation. I finally find a man who seems to really want me, but his two best friends don\u2019t. And that\u2019s a deal breaker for you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he could solve that problem for her.</p><p>Law hooked a finger under her chin and nudged her head up. \u201cDo you want me, Kinley? Do you want me to teach you about sex? Because I will. I don\u2019t need Dominic and Riley to do it.\u201d</p><p>She bit into her lower lip, and his cock ached. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, what the other two want doesn\u2019t matter. I want you. I can\u2019t wait to teach you everything, but before we go any further, you should understand that I\u2019m a rough man. I have certain...needs.\u201d</p><p>How did he explain to a virgin that he would want to tie her up until she was completely helpless and, oh yes, he was definitely going to want to fuck her ass well and often.</p><p>Sexy pillow talk. He wasn\u2019t good at it. Dominic was. Sometimes the man wouldn\u2019t shut up about how much he wanted a woman and what he intended to do to make her scream down the roof.</p><p>But Dominic wasn\u2019t here now. Neither was Riley to smooth things over. He\u2019d made the choice to have Kinley on his own, so he had to try to make this right.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of needs?\u201d</p><p>He could start out with the basics. \u201cI need you to listen and obey me in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Though her eyes were shining with tears, a little smile curved her lips up. \u201cSince I don\u2019t know anything, I think I can handle that. I\u2019m really not completely idiotic, you know. I mean it\u2019s not like you have to teach me what sex is. I took the class in high school.\u201d</p><p>What he wanted to teach her, no classroom sex ed course would have covered. But thoughts of every wicked thing he intended to do to her ran through his imagination. His cock was already rock hard and straining against his jeans.</p><p>Law couldn\u2019t help himself. He had to kiss her. He talked between sweet brushes of their lips. \u201cTell me what you know. You\u2019ve been kissed before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it didn\u2019t feel this good. It didn\u2019t make me...antsy.\u201d She caressed her way up his biceps, to his shoulders, then wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><p>Antsy. He liked making her feel that way. He could keep her on the edge for hours, licking and sucking and playing with her. In fact, he was dying to. \u201cBefore Dominic, has a man ever played with your breasts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, but I didn\u2019t like it. In high school, my biology lab partner kissed me and grabbed my breasts. It kind of hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was rough, and you weren\u2019t aroused, baby. Trust me, I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re ready for some rough play eventually. You liked when Dominic touched you. He was gentle, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when he pinched my nipples.\u201d Her skin flushed a pretty pink. \u201cI liked that, Law. It hurt at first. Then it felt good.\u201d</p><p>Because she was at least a bit of a masochist. A man like Jansen would use that against her, but Law wanted to set her free. The pain he intended to give her would only intensify her pleasure. If she didn\u2019t have it, if she forced herself to live a vanilla life, she would always be missing that deep surrender that only a Dom could coax and command from her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s honest. I needed to know that. It\u2019s great that you need more bite to the sensations I give you. We\u2019ll go slow, though. I promise.\u201d He rubbed their noses together.</p><p>Law had never reveled in the physical. Sex had been a bodily function, pleasurable for sure, but he hadn\u2019t ever had the impulse to lose himself in a lover the way he did with Kinley.</p><p>He brushed his hand across her breast, and she shivered. \u201cGoing slow will make getting to the end so much more special. You deserve a lover who takes his time with you, Kinley. You need a man who will protect you and cherish you. One who worships you. I\u2019m going to fulfill all your needs.\u201d</p><p>She looked both hopeful and a bit skeptical. \u201cNo ploys? No front to help your buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019ll still help Dominic. Losing Carrie nearly crushed him. But I won\u2019t let him hurt you to do it. You trusted me before. All that\u2019s really changed is my name and a few minor details. Everything else was real. I\u2019m that same guy.\u201d</p><p>Kinley chewed on her lip, considering. \u201cWhat you\u2019re describing\u2014taking care of me\u2014that wasn\u2019t how it worked in my family. My mother took care of my father, but he didn\u2019t give her much in return. I see that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be that way between us. Your men should adore you. Your men should think you\u2019re the sun in the sky.\u201d He closed his eyes briefly. Man, not men. It would take him a while to give up that fantasy. And he\u2019d have to figure out how to ensure her safety and future in case something happened to him. But for Kinley, he would. \u201cYour man, I mean. And I\u2019m going to put you first. Do you understand me? Kinley, if you let me have you, you\u2019re going to be above everything else. When I make a decision, it will be with you in mind.\u201d</p><p>It struck him suddenly that he was being too open. He was putting everything out there\u2014his heart, his pride, his soul\u2014and maybe he shouldn\u2019t. Kinley had only asked for sex, not commitment. She might reject him.</p><p>He had no idea what the fuck he would do if she did. Or worse, if she laughed at his devotion.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take it back.\u201d She reached up and cupped his jaw. \u201cI see you hesitating and... You can\u2019t say those things to me, then change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Kind of what Annabelle had told him, too. Kinley was a forever kind of girl. Law was ready to devour the cake.</p><p>Peace settled over him. This was the right woman. The timing might be shitty, but that didn\u2019t matter. He wasn\u2019t giving her up.</p><p>But damn it, even if his head had given up on Dominic and Riley, his gut refused to do the same. \u201cCan we give the others some time? They might come around.\u201d</p><p>Maybe when they saw that Kinley wasn\u2019t going anywhere, that being with her didn\u2019t have to mean the end of Dom\u2019s justice or be the start of another heartbreak for Riley, they would give her a fair chance.</p><p>\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t want me?\u201d she whispered. That clearly worried her.</p><p>\u201cThey do. Oh, baby, I know them. Dominic might not be blood, but he\u2019s my brother in all the ways that count. Trust me, he\u2019s practically dying from hunger. It\u2019s why he\u2019s acting like such an ass. Riley is just...\u201d God, he didn\u2019t want to bring up Simone now during a time that was supposed to be about Kinley and her needs. \u201cHe\u2019s being a pussy. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>He had to stop cussing like a fucking sailor in front of her.</p><p>\u201cStop apologizing, Law. I like you the way you are. Will you...kiss me? Touch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d He covered her lips with his and got ready to teach her everything. She deserved all he could give her and more.</p><p>Kinley really deserved better than him, Dominic decided. He stomped to the liquor cabinet and poured himself three fingers of Scotch. Thank god the James brothers had excellent taste in liquor.</p><p>He downed it without really tasting it and poured a second glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Riley asked, his voice tight.</p><p>Because the guy thought he\u2019d just lost his brother. Dominic conceded that he might be right. \u201cWe do what Law asked. We respect his rights.\u201d</p><p>Law meant to claim Kinley and become her rightful Master. He would be the one to take her hand and her virginity, then lead her into the world of Dominance and submission they\u2019d all come to crave.</p><p>God, once Law took her under his wing, even if he forgave Dominic, the woman would probably still drive a wedge between them. He hated that fact. And he saw only one way to avoid it. Give in.</p><p>Law also had damn fine instincts. Did he sense that Kinley could handle what they all needed? Dominic paced, his thoughts racing before he paused to pour more Scotch. Instead, he put the bottle down and stared out the door, toward Kinley\u2019s room. Had he made a mistake? Had he just thrown away something precious?</p><p>\u201cLaw is going to regret this, right?\u201d Riley\u2019s stare, too, trailed to the hallway where Law had just disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Dominic wasn\u2019t sure what to think. He\u2019d been so certain earlier what path to choose. Now, he was at a loss. All because he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about one blonde\u2014who just happened to be the key to the revenge he\u2019d made the cornerstone of his life for years. If he embraced one, did it necessarily mean he had to give up the other?</p><p>\u201cYou want to join them, don\u2019t you?\u201d Riley\u2019s tone came out almost like an accusation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d Dominic turned on him. He could see plainly that Riley was struggling as well. He\u2019d seen how Riley looked at Kinley, the way his eyes kept straying to her mouth, her breasts, and that luscious ass of hers. He\u2019d noticed how Riley hung on her every word.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if Law\u2019s right?\u201d Dominic argued. \u201cYour brother is no fool. What if she\u2019s the one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your head out of this fucking fairy tale. There\u2019s no such thing as \u2018the one.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Riley was probably right, but Dominic couldn\u2019t stop wondering. \u201cWhat if Kinley could be happy at the center of a m\u00e9nage, at least for a while? It\u2019s more than we have now.\u201d What if she really was strong enough to handle them and could hold them all together? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWomen don\u2019t want what we have to offer. Kinley might seem open at times, but only because she\u2019s too innocent to understand what a future with three men would be like. She\u2019s got a high profile. She\u2019s giving in now because she\u2019s scared and doesn\u2019t know how else to feel safe.\u201d</p><p>Dominic turned Riley\u2019s words over in his head. Kinley hadn\u2019t seemed scared when she\u2019d bartered with him, almost boldly telling him what she wanted. That didn\u2019t seem like an innocent looking for shelter from a terrifying situation.</p><p>Shit, Law was right. Kinley had been negotiating, offering him something for what she wanted in return. He\u2019d taken it as a play for control, a way to shut down the investigation into Carrie\u2019s murder\u2014and he\u2019d been dead wrong.</p><p>He\u2019d spent years building a business with one thought in his head: avenging his sister\u2019s death. Nothing else had mattered. Law had followed him to freaking Afghanistan and nearly lost his legs. And Dominic wasn\u2019t willing to give it a shot with the girl his brother so obviously loved? A girl he couldn\u2019t get out of his head?</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s just going to take what she wants and walk out in the end.\u201d Riley grabbed a glass. It looked like Dominic wasn\u2019t drinking alone tonight.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d But maybe not. How would he know if he never took the chance?</p><p>Then a terrible truth hit him like a bolt of lightning. He\u2019d never really intended on sharing a woman with them forever. Law and Riley had probably been searching for one, and Dominic had been utterly content to just have sex. Law was right. He made himself seem like a stand-up guy because he ensured all the subs he used got a few orgasms. He could be gracious with them, kind even, because nothing was at stake. For too long, the only abiding love of his life had been fucking up Greg Jansen\u2019s.</p><p>How proud would his sister be of that? Dominic grimaced as the question rolled through his head.</p><p>He glanced over at the bed he\u2019d laid out for his dog. Butch was the only responsibility he\u2019d really taken, and then only because the damn thing had shown up on his property half starved and refused to go away. He\u2019d fed the poor mutt out of pure pity, and Butch had just kept following him around until Dominic got used to having him underfoot.</p> <p>And now his dog was cuddled around the rat thing, his bigger body shielding Gigi from anything that might come their way. He was contentedly asleep, having given up the softest part of his bed to whatever the hell one called a damn dog\u2019s true love.</p><p>Even Butch knew how to care for a female. And Dominic had done nothing but kidnap Kinley and use her for his own ends, while offering her absolutely nothing in return. Oh, he\u2019d paid lip service to protecting her, but he wasn\u2019t really offering protection. Once Jansen was behind bars, the press would eat Kinley alive. Dominic planned to be long gone.</p><p>That was a hell of a hand he\u2019d dealt her.</p><p>He\u2019d walked in and torn her life apart. When she\u2019d asked for the one thing she needed, he\u2019d repaid her with insults. Kinley was supposed to have had a wedding night. Wasn\u2019t it just good manners to offer her another replacement...or two?</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to deal with this when it\u2019s over?\u201d Riley asked. \u201cWe live together. Is Law just going to move Kinley in?\u201d</p><p>Riley wasn\u2019t thinking straight. He needed to get all his anxieties in order. \u201cI thought she was leaving him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe probably will, but what if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>If she didn\u2019t, then they both would have missed out on what they claimed they\u2019d been seeking. What he\u2019d damn well knew he\u2019d wanted before Carrie\u2019s murder.</p><p>How much was he willing to let Jansen take from him? He\u2019d already snuffed out Carrie\u2019s life. Was Dominic willing to let Jansen rob his, too?</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t, then you\u2019re going to have to listen to a whole lot of sex,\u201d Dominic pointed out.</p><p>Would Law and Kinley even stay? Or would Law move them out? Hell, maybe they\u2019d even move to New York. That pissed Dominic off because it filled him with a vague panic. He\u2019d lived with Law most of his adult life. He didn\u2019t want Law to leave any more than he wanted to give Jansen his future.</p><p>Kinley was everything he looked for in a woman. He\u2019d been hard since he\u2019d first seen her, every photo making him fall just a little more in lust. And watching her in person had made him rethink his whole position. Hell, his whole life.</p><p>Since bringing her to Alaska, Dominic had seen how sweet and kind she could be. She\u2019d stood up to him when she was scared. But she\u2019d used her head when presented with the hard evidence. Kinley hadn\u2019t curled into a ball and cried when she realized she\u2019d been abducted. She\u2019d fought. Hell, she\u2019d even dropped herself and half of her belongings out a window, trying to escape. Life with her would never be dull.</p><p>Dominic wanted her and her trust. And he hated the thought that she might fear him. Damn it, he wanted her to give him the information she knew because she trusted him, not because they\u2019d made a deal. But how was she supposed to trust him when he\u2019d put his own crap into her innocent plea for help and pleasure, then thrown it back in her face?</p> <p>\u201cI need to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Riley asked like he was out of his mind.</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to Kinley.\u201d</p><p>He needed to be in that bedroom with her and Law. Or try to be. She might slam the door in his face, but he would take it with good grace as long as she allowed him to apologize first.</p><p>Without another word, he strode down the hall and found the door, unlocked now because Law was inside with her.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t lock her in again. She\u2019d said she would stay. If they had a shot at any sort of forgiveness or future with her, he had to learn to trust her, too. He knocked.</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d Law\u2019s deep growl sounded through the walls.</p><p>He was cock blocking his best friend. Dominic winced, then he knocked again because he wasn\u2019t going away. \u201cI want to talk to Kinley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Damn it.</p><p>Someone wrenched the door opened. Law. He\u2019d already tossed his shirt off and was breathing heavily, scowling Dominic\u2019s way. \u201cCan\u2019t it wait? Or has something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I decided I was wrong and I want to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Law\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou interrupted us to say that you\u2019re sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless I can convince her to take more than just an apology. I\u2019m sorry, Law. I don\u2019t know how to make this right. I don\u2019t know what any of this fucking means. I just don\u2019t want to miss out. I think you might be right. She might be important.\u201d He felt like an idiot. He\u2019d never been in this position, on the outside, practically begging to be let in. It wasn\u2019t a feeling he liked.</p><p>Kinley stepped up behind Law, peering out from behind his back. \u201cAre you sorry you kidnapped me?\u201d</p><p>He had to be honest with her. \u201cNo. If I hadn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t be here. I\u2019d be a lot sorrier about that. I think you would, too.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cAre you sorry that your dog raped mine?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to take that. \u201cNo, your dog led mine into sin. He has a thing for bows. She used it against him.\u201d</p><p>He caught the faintest hint of a smile from her. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, she\u2019s a flirty thing. So if you\u2019re not apologizing for kidnapping me or very likely turning my dog into a single mother, what are you sorry about?\u201d</p><p>So many things. \u201cFor being rude to you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s probably rude to offer sex in exchange for putting away a dangerous criminal. I\u2019ve already told Law that I\u2019ll help out. I\u2019ll give you everything I know.\u201d</p><p>Kinley curled her arms around his buddy\u2019s torso as though she found comfort in being close to him. They were already bonding as a Dom and sub should. And Dominic almost choked, wondering if he was too late.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be. He wanted to worry about her, be responsible for her. Comfort and care for and pleasure her. He and Law should be a team when it came to Kinley. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven.\u201d</p><p>Just like that? God, how good was this woman?</p><p>Law had a shit-eating grin on his face. \u201cBaby, I think he\u2019s sorry about a whole lot of other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to make him beg. I forgive him and I hope we can be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s what he\u2019s most sorry about,\u201d Law explained. \u201cHe\u2019s really fucking sorry he\u2019s on the wrong side of this door. He wants in and he\u2019s not sure how to ask since he\u2019s never had to.\u201d</p><p>Kinley stared at him, her eyes wide, her lips parted. He wanted to kiss her desperately. \u201cDo you truly want to come in, Dominic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I want to give you the knowledge you asked for. I want to teach you what it means to submit to a man, to trust him enough to place your body and your pleasure in his hands. I want to help show you just how high you can soar. And I want to share you with Law and Riley, though Riley might not come around. Even if he doesn\u2019t, I want to be a part of your training, Kinley. For as long as we\u2019re here, I want to be your Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t exactly hit her with the kinky stuff yet, Dominic. Let\u2019s start with sex before we get to the spankings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d He could wait until tomorrow to tie her up as long as he was in her bed tonight. \u201cI want in, Kinley. Will you let me?\u201d</p><p>She shared a glance with Law, then stepped back. For a second, he thought she would decline. Then she opened the door wider. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Law eased away, allowing Dominic to enter the room. He stared at the woman he wanted more than his next breath.</p><p>\u201cCall me \u2018Sir,\u2019 Kinley.\u201d With gnawing hunger and hope, he reached for her hand, ready to start her lesson and see where their future led.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Kinley took Dominic\u2019s hand, her heart thumping in her chest. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a quirk of mine, pet.\u201d He stood over her, looking down into her eyes as he tangled his fingers in her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking soft.\u201d</p><p>Law moved in behind her, his chest brushing her back. The thick line of his erection pressed against her backside. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, man. You\u2019re better with the whole talking thing than I am. I was struggling with how to explain what we want.\u201d</p><p>Sex. They wanted sex, right? \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Kinley knew what she wanted\u2014to be right where she was, crowded by them. They took all the space surrounding her, as they enclosed her, protected her, covered every inch of her skin with theirs. She reveled in the sensation.</p><p>Dominic frowned. \u201cLaw?\u201d</p><p>Law\u2019s hand cracked against her bottom. A sharp pain flared across Kinley\u2019s butt.</p><p>\u201cDamn, those little rhinestones are hell on a man\u2019s hand,\u201d he complained.</p><p>She whipped her gaze over her shoulder and blinked at him. He\u2019d spanked her. Actually spanked her. Then after he slapped her backside, he\u2019d cupped and felt it.</p><p>And heat burst across her skin, making her tingle and aware.</p><p>Dominic cupped her chin and brought her attention back to him. \u201cWhat do you call me in the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d She answered him readily because all she could think about was how her bottom practically hummed. \u201cIf I forget to call you Sir, Law will spank me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re getting the gist.\u201d Dominic\u2019s eyes darkened, his skin flushing with desire. \u201cYou obey or there will be punishment. But understand, this is a game, pet. It\u2019s meant to be enjoyable for us all. If you\u2019re truly scared or if something hurts beyond what you find pleasurable, say the word \u2018red\u2019 and everything stops. If you get anxious and want to slow down, just say \u2018yellow.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want you to be happy, baby,\u201d Law said, still palming her butt. \u201cWe want you to crave this type of play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, but we take it as seriously as we take your pleasure. Yesterday in the kitchen we gave you your first real orgasm. But we intend to train your body to expect that pleasure every time we touch you. When we\u2019re done, we\u2019ll merely look at you, and you\u2019ll remember how it feels to have an orgasm overtake your whole body. You\u2019ll know what it means to be completely possessed. You should never accept less from a lover.\u201d</p><p>His words were making her antsy again. Hot. \u201cCompletely?\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s lips moved to her forehead, planting a sweet kiss there. \u201cYes, pet. I want you to understand what\u2019s going to happen. How do you expect to take more than one man into your bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not talking about taking turns, are you?\u201d The realization stunned Kinley so deeply, she could barely breathe.</p><p>Of course she\u2019d read some books, heard some friends talk about...that. Annabelle sometimes confessed her fantasies after a couple of glasses of wine. More than one man would require a certain amount of flexibility. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t be taking turns. Tonight, we will because you\u2019re not ready for more, but we\u2019ll require that you allow us to prepare your body to accommodate us both at once.\u201d Law\u2019s hand slid around, cupping her intimately through her jeans. \u201cOne right here in your sweet little pussy.\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s hand found her backside. \u201cAnd one in your ass.\u201d</p><p>Heat flared everywhere they touched, everywhere they whispered along her skin. Every place they pressed their two hard erections against her. What would it feel like to have both of them deep inside her? She would be caught, immobile, with absolutely no escape. Not that she would want it. What would it be like to have these men moving in and out of her body as she took Riley in her mouth?</p><p>She forced herself to concentrate on the situation at hand. Riley wasn\u2019t with her, but Dominic and Law were. It might not be forever, but while she had them, she was going to explore a whole world she\u2019d never dreamed of. She\u2019d lost so much in the last few days. She\u2019d lost her family and the future she\u2019d thought would be hers, but maybe she could find a new version of Kinley Kohl in their arms. A better, more confident version. Maybe she\u2019d meet the Kinley who didn\u2019t let fear keep her from trying something new or shrink away from pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d As much as she\u2019d feared them in the beginning, she realized that she trusted them now. They\u2019d risked prison time to remove her from a dangerous situation. Yes, they\u2019d done it for Carrie, too. But they\u2019d cared for her since bringing her to Alaska. Kinley was self-aware enough to know that she would have resisted believing anything if they had merely tried to talk to her. She would have gone straight to Greg and demanded answers. For that, he might have killed her then and there. Method of transport notwithstanding, they had treated her better than any other men in her life.</p><p>Her heart would probably break if this didn\u2019t work out, but she refused to be too scared to take a chance anymore. She would rather mourn the loss of them than never have them at all.</p><p>Dominic shook his head with a sigh. \u201cLaw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir! I\u2019ll do it, Sir.\u201d She was going to have to get used to that.</p><p>It was too late. Law smacked her backside again as he chuckled against her ear. \u201cKeep it up, baby. I could do this all day. I enjoy spanking your ass.\u201d</p><p>And she was starting to enjoy the feeling, too. It hurt...but then it didn\u2019t. Then only heat licked through her.</p><p>Dominic stepped back. \u201cUndress for us, Kinley.\u201d</p><p>Just like that all her self-doubts pushed to the forefront. They were so magnificently masculine. Obviously, they worked hard to stay in peak physical condition. She\u2019d been starving herself for weeks and had barely managed to lose one dress size. And she wasn\u2019t sure that her boobs looked so great without the support of a bra.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem, pet?\u201d Dominic settled into the wingchair on the far side of the room with a dark brow raised. Somehow he made the comfortable leather piece look like a throne. His black hair was slicked away from his angular face, and he was dressed casually, but there was no way a T-shirt and sweatpants could detract from his regal air of authority.</p><p>\u201cCan we turn off the lights?\u201d</p><p>Law turned her to face him. \u201cAre you looking for a serious spanking? No, we are not going to turn off the lights. We are not going to huddle under the covers and fumble around so everyone\u2019s modesty is preserved. There is zero place for that here. We\u2019re going to fuck. It\u2019s going to be dirty and nasty, and it\u2019s going to feel so good. And when we\u2019re done, I\u2019m going to hold you all night long. But now you\u2019re going to obey, and that means you\u2019d better strip off every garment and show us what you\u2019re offering.\u201d</p><p>Tears threatened. She turned slightly so she could see them both. \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t want me after I\u2019m naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will not happen,\u201d Law promised.</p><p>Dominic\u2019s stare delved into her, his will apparent in the intensity. \u201cKinley, you wanted to trade your business information for knowledge about sex. I\u2019m going to give you a little of that advice up front. Be brave in life. Accept that there\u2019s always a chance you won\u2019t get what you want. On the other hand, you\u2019ll never have what you seek unless you ask for it. Sex is the same. If all you ask for is a man to climb on top of you and try to get you off, then that\u2019s likely what you\u2019ll get. But if you want more, if you want real intimacy and connection, then offer it. Offer yourself to us.\u201d</p><p>Offer herself? Hadn\u2019t she been doing that for years? She\u2019d offered her love and devotion to her sister and father. She\u2019d offered her future to Greg. She\u2019d done it all without any thought to her own needs beyond being a dutiful daughter, of doing what was expected. In fact, she\u2019d done everything society thought was proper and right. She\u2019d sacrificed for her family because that was what a good woman was supposed to do.</p><p>Being good had gotten her nothing. She was alone and empty-handed. She would always be if she didn\u2019t change something.</p><p>Starting with being brave.</p><p>Kinley pulled at her sweater, dragging it over her head and handing it to Law. Dominic sat back, fingers steepled, an air of satisfaction humming around him. He said nothing, merely watched her with hot eyes that never strayed from her body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great, baby. Take off the jeans. I\u2019ve been wanting to see your ass for months.\u201d Law stood behind her. His hands encircled her waist as he undid the snap on her jeans. Like all the jeans Greg had given her, it was encrusted with little rhinestones. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d</p> <p>He eased the zipper down and then his warm hands met her flesh. She nearly sighed at the sizzling connection.</p><p>He pushed the waistband down and helped her step out, leaving her in nothing but her plain white support bra and cotton undies.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the underwear, pet. I thought I made myself clear.\u201d Dominic frowned.</p><p>He looked gorgeous when he frowned. And when he smiled. He was just entirely perfect.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir. That was before I tried to escape. I thought it would be easier to get away with underwear on.\u201d</p><p>Dominic looked as if he repressed a smile. \u201cI assure you it won\u2019t be any easier to get away because you\u2019ve covered your pussy. If you try to leave us again, expect a spanking and some other punishments that will be...uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019ve decided to stay. Especially once I found out you have a guard moose on the payroll.\u201d She\u2019d known escaping into the wilderness was a stupid move, but she\u2019d been trying to protect herself. Kinley didn\u2019t want that now. If the heartache was going to come, she wanted to have a damn good reason for it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best. We can protect you here while we figure out how to put Jansen in jail,\u201d Law said.</p><p>She held up a hand because she didn\u2019t want that to go any further. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about Greg now. I don\u2019t even want the thought of him to come between us.\u201d</p><p>This was their time to bond. Greg couldn\u2019t be allowed to ruin it.</p><p>\u201cThen take off his rock,\u201d Dominic demanded with a firm jaw and uncompromising stare.</p><p>Rock? As Kinley brought her hand down, the light caught her engagement ring, the four-carat diamond glittering.</p><p>Kinley stared at it. How was she still wearing Greg\u2019s ring? For the last month, it had just become an extension of who she was: Greg\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Not anymore. The ring had to go. She didn\u2019t care that it was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. She just wanted it off her finger. Though she pulled and yanked, it wouldn\u2019t budge. She hadn\u2019t taken it off since the day he\u2019d placed it on her finger. Now it was stuck.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Dominic held a hand out.</p><p>She went to him, trembling and wondering if she was about to get another spanking.</p><p>Gently, Dominic took her hand, his fingers sliding over the ring. \u201cYou want to be rid of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything.\u201d</p><p>Very slowly he brought her hand to his mouth. He kissed the tips of her fingers, the sensation soft against her flesh. He sucked her finger into his mouth. Heat sizzled through her, all the way between her legs, as his tongue played against her skin. He enveloped her whole finger in the heat of his mouth. His teeth skimmed her flesh, the little bite sending a jolt of need through her body before he anchored them around the band. Then very slowly, he dragged the ring up her finger, freeing her.</p><p>He spit the bling from between his lips and placed it on the nightstand. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>Kinley nodded, eyes glued to him.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now hand me your bra and panties. I want to see all of you.\u201d</p><p>Her body was starting to hum. Despite the fact they were standing apart, his gaze felt like an allover caress.</p><p>Swallowing down her nerves, she pushed the bra straps off her shoulders, then reached behind and unhooked the band. As soon as the garment slid free, Law\u2019s big hands cupped her. Kinley closed her eyes in pure pleasure.</p><p>He and Dominic had seen her naked breasts. And they weren\u2019t turning away.</p><p>\u201cNow the underwear, Law,\u201d Dominic said, his voice low.</p><p>Law\u2019s palms skimmed her body and settled on her hips. Then he slid his fingers under the elastic of her panties and dragged them down her legs.</p><p>Dominic sat back in his seat again, his eyes darkening as his stare drank her in. \u201cYou\u2019re lovely, Kinley. You\u2019re womanly and beautiful. Being naked doesn\u2019t take away an ounce of your innocence.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, but it had been the perfect thing to say. \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s satisfied smile made her heart do little flip-flops before he turned to his friend. \u201cLaw, how is that backside of hers you\u2019re so deeply interested in?\u201d</p><p>Law groaned behind her. \u201cSo fucking perfect. Round and delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>Law turned her, and her heart softened as she looked up into his eyes. Dominic was dangerous and sexy, and Kinley was falling for him fast. But she\u2019d already tumbled over with this man.</p><p>She rested her hands on Law\u2019s perfectly ripped chest and looked up at him, melting into him a bit.</p><p>\u201cNow that is a luscious ass,\u201d Dominic said.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is a sweet, smooth pussy.\u201d Law leaned out and stared down, grazing her nipples as he worked his way down her body. \u201cSpread your legs. Don\u2019t hesitate. Just obey me.\u201d</p><p>Kinley moved her feet apart. Cold air brushed her sensitive folds, and she felt exposed with Law\u2019s eyes on her. But it wasn\u2019t an unwelcome feeling. In fact, she liked being on display and seeing the appreciation in his stare.</p><p>Suddenly, Law\u2019s hot fingers cupped her mound.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. This skin here is so fucking soft. And you\u2019re getting wet, baby.\u201d</p><p>She was. Kinley could feel how easily his fingers slid over her labia. It took everything she had to not moan and jump and plead for more.</p><p>\u201cI want a taste. You\u2019ve already had one.\u201d Suddenly, Dominic stood behind her. He turned her to face him, then his lips descended on hers.</p><p>She opened for him, giving him complete access to her mouth. As he groaned, his hand found her pussy, caressing her possessively. Law\u2019s ran over the curves of her ass. It was so decadent to be naked when they were still mostly dressed. The roughness of Law\u2019s denim gently chafed her skin, while the soft cotton of Dominic\u2019s shirt brushed her nipples almost like a feather. The distinct sensations made her tingle. She was so aware, so completely alive.</p><p>Dominic pulled back, his hand leaving her pussy and going straight to his lips. He sucked her cream off his flesh, his eyes closing in a pleasurable little smile. \u201cShe tastes so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Law agreed, skimming his lips up her neck.</p><p>\u201cLie down on the bed and spread your legs, Kinley,\u201d Dominic commanded. He tugged at his T-shirt, pulling it over his head and revealing a gloriously cut chest. His sweatpants rode low on his lean hips. The longer she stared, the more the notches on the sides made her mouth water.</p><p>\u201cPet?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>Law tugged on her hand, gesturing her toward the bed. \u201cLie down. It\u2019s time to get you ready. We\u2019re going to make sure you\u2019re so wet and soft that we\u2019ll slide right in.\u201d</p><p>They were going to take her body, her virginity. They were going to merge with her and give her an experience\u2014a knowledge\u2014she\u2019d never had before.</p><p>Kinley climbed onto the bed and opened herself to them.</p><p>With eager fingers, Law tore at his jeans, shoving them down. His thick cock came into view. Kinley stared, wide-eyed, as she took in the sight. It wasn\u2019t that she\u2019d never seen a penis before. She certainly had. Not in person, but she\u2019d seen pictures. Law went so far beyond those flat, almost inanimate pictures. Thick and fully erect, his member stood against his belly, nearly touching his navel. His whole body looked like a work of art, every muscle lovingly chiseled and handcrafted.</p><p>He climbed on the bed beside her. \u201cDon\u2019t just stare, Kinley. Touch me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Law laid himself out for her, as open to her as she was to them. He offered himself to her. Kinley couldn\u2019t wait to take him.</p><p>With a shaking hand, she reached out to touch him, sighing as she wrapped her fingers around his velvety yet hard shaft. But more, she felt the connection between them with just that one touch.</p><p>With hot, hooded eyes, Dominic watched them.</p><p>And Kinley felt as if she\u2019d finally found her place.</p> <p>Riley took a long swig of Scotch. Nothing was going to make him sleep tonight. Summer nights in Alaska were brutally short, but it wasn\u2019t the lack of darkness keeping him in the kitchen now. It was the fact that if he wanted to get to bed, he would have to walk right past Kinley\u2019s room where Law and Dominic were undoubtedly relieving her of her virginity right this freaking second.</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t want to walk by and overhear that...and know he could be in there. His brothers were claiming her, no doubt. They were going to fall in love. While it lasted, he\u2019d be left out in the cold.</p><p>What the fuck was he going to do?</p><p>Sometimes he felt like Dominic was completely content to just wander through life, while Law was looking for the fantasy that didn\u2019t exist. Riley wasn\u2019t sure what to do, but he knew he wanted more than one casual fuck after another. He wanted a family. He wanted kids to shelter and protect, who never had to endure the poverty and desperation he had growing up. He wanted to make up for everything he\u2019d lost out on by giving his own children a great life.</p><p>Riley flicked on his computer and turned to one of the news feeds. His system was fully set up to catch the news channels from Black Oak\u2019s satellite system. The feed wasn\u2019t as clear here as it would be inside the work compound, but it was enough to keep Riley in the loop.</p> <p>But having the news drone on in the background didn\u2019t distract him. Why the hell couldn\u2019t he let go of the crushing, wretched feeling of rejection Simone had handed him years ago?</p><p>Until her, no one had ever hurt him. He\u2019d never given anyone that power. But the first time he\u2019d tried to open up and trust, the one time he\u2019d come really close to getting what he wanted, she\u2019d cruelly slammed the door in his face.</p><p>Simone had been well educated. She\u2019d seemed so free and open. He\u2019d decided it was time to take the next step, and she\u2019d been right there. Dominic liked her, and since Law never really liked much of anyone, Riley was content that his brother seemed able to put up with her.</p><p>He\u2019d even picked out a house for all of them to live in.</p><p>But she\u2019d laughed as she\u2019d said \u201cno.\u201d Riley had figured out in that moment that no woman would willingly tackle society\u2019s opinions to be with them. Dominic had tried to let him go his own way with no fuss, and Riley knew he stood a better chance of having the future he sought if he took a woman of his own. Deep down, that wasn\u2019t what he wanted, but he\u2019d been trying to resign himself anyway.</p><p>And then Kinley waltzed in with her damn chocolate-colored eyes and those bouncy honey curls he wanted to sink his fingers into. If he had a redo, he\u2019d be in her room right now, fucking the living hell out of her...except for one small problem.</p> <p>Kinley was the kind of woman men fought wars for and sang songs to. And there was no way that woman married three men.</p><p>No.</p><p>Fucking.</p><p>Way.</p><p>She was too good, too sweet, too kind. She\u2019d made it her life mission to help the damn poor, for god\u2019s sake. He would fall for her in a way he\u2019d never fallen for Simone, and inevitably she would either laugh in his face when he asked her to marry him or crumble the first time some society bitch or a tabloid called her a whore for having three men. Either way, she\u2019d be gone.</p><p>At most, she would probably really want Dominic because they came from the same world. Or she would only want Law because he had that brooding quality that made a lot of women want to fix him. Why the hell would she want him?</p><p>A flash of color caught his eye, and he turned the sound up. Shit. There she was, on the news. A picture of Kinley dominated the screen with a headline underneath: Runaway Bride or Victim? He turned up the volume.</p><p>Socialite Kinley Kohl remains in the news as we enter the third day following her disappearance from her wedding in New York to controversial shipping tycoon Greg Jansen. The entire scandal is made even more mysterious by lawyer Kellan Kent\u2019s claim that he is representing the man seen taking Ms. Kohl away with his unknown associate. This program has positively identified the man as Law Anders, a former Special Forces soldier who is being sought for questioning in the alleged kidnapping.</p> <p>Riley groaned. Well, the cat was sure as fuck out of the bag now. And he was a little miffed that he\u2019d been demoted to \u201cunknown associate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Kohl is not a victim of anything but love.\u201d Kellan flashed a wry, likely practiced smile for the cameras. \u201cMy client rescued his lover from a marriage she didn\u2019t want. Kinley Kohl was afraid of telling Greg Jansen she refused to marry him, and I think there is ample evidence that she was right to do so. His first wife died under mysterious circumstances, and that is all I\u2019ll say about that. When Kinley is ready, she\u2019ll contact her family, but for now she is in seclusion. My client would appreciate it if you would respect their privacy at this time.\u201d</p><p>It was a good play, but without Kinley to support the story herself, it would only work for a day or two. Then, no matter how much they tried to hide her location, the authorities would hunt them down or Jansen would ferret it out. Then he would either try to kill her or take her back.</p><p>Speak of the devil. Jansen\u2019s face popped on screen. It was obviously a previously taped interview. He stared at the camera and poured out his staged plea. \u201cKinley, darling, if you\u2019re out there and you can hear me, your father, your sister, and I just want you home. If there\u2019s any way to escape, please do it. As to the men who took my wife\u2014sorry, I think of her as my wife\u2014I will pay any ransom. Just send me a sign of life. Send me back her luggage to prove you actually have her. Please. I\u2019ll give you money just for that one little sign.\u201d</p><p>Riley paused the feed. Luggage wasn\u2019t proof of life. Jansen knew the way this whole thing worked. So what the fuck was he talking about? Proof of life was actual physical evidence that the person was alive at a certain time. He should be asking for a tape of Kinley talking while holding up today\u2019s paper or a phone call that included actual vocal contact.</p><p>But no. Jansen wanted her luggage. Again.</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t understand. He\u2019d been through all of her belongings at least ten times. She didn\u2019t have a laptop here, so he had no way to search that. The only things on her tablet were games and books and a ton of pictures.</p><p>What was he looking for? What was more important about that luggage than Kinley herself returning home? It had to be something if Jansen was willing to pay for her luggage.</p><p>Which meant that, more than likely, Kinley herself couldn\u2019t help them.</p><p>Time was running out. He needed connections.</p><p>Riley turned the news feed off and settled in. It was all there, hidden somewhere in the charity\u2019s files. He just had to find it.</p><p>Since he couldn\u2019t be in her bedroom, telling her how beautiful he found her or how much he wanted her, this was all he could do for her now.</p><p>\u201cMore. Touch me again.\u201d Law wanted her hands on him more than anything he could remember.</p><p>Kinley rolled to her side, looking down the length of his body. Law held in a groan. He\u2019d never been so fucking hard. He was practically shaking. He hoped he didn\u2019t blow the minute she started stroking him.</p><p>Dominic stood at the edge of the bed, and Law wondered if he was going to be a hard ass. The little light spanking they\u2019d already given her had been flirty and playful\u2014a good way to begin introducing Kinley to the lifestyle. But Law wanted tonight to be all about her.</p><p>\u201cYou should touch him, Kinley. He looks needy.\u201d A smile played at Dominic\u2019s lips.</p><p>Thank god his brother understood. \u201cI am. So fucking needy.\u201d</p><p>She touched his chest, her fingertips drifting down his skin. Law drew in a shuddering breath, trying to force himself to calm. He\u2019d keep it together and take it slow and easy with her, even if it killed him.</p><p>She brushed her hand over his cock again, and it twitched with need. \u201cThe skin is so soft.\u201d</p><p>But he was fucking granite. \u201cGrip me, baby. You won\u2019t hurt me. Wrap your fingers around me and stroke hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d Kinley enclosed him in her palm. He couldn\u2019t hold onto his moan. It tore from his chest when he felt the heat of her touch.</p><p>\u201cTighter,\u201d he managed to grit out.</p><p>She did as he asked, and of their own volition, Law\u2019s hips pumped up. His whole focus shifted to his cock. No way to stop it.</p><p>He\u2019d never made himself really vulnerable before. Sure, he\u2019d had women give him hand jobs, but that wasn\u2019t the point of this exercise. He wanted Kinley to explore, so he opened himself to her as she\u2019d done for him.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d Law wanted her to understand the power she had. Even though he planned to take her as their submissive, she should know that her lovers would give themselves to her, too.</p><p>Her hair fell like a waterfall around him, locking out the rest of the world until all he could see was her sweet face coming toward him. She closed her eyes. Closer, closer, her lips came until she pressed them down on his own. Her soft whisper of a kiss made him crazy. Her tongue skimmed along his bottom lip, light as the brush of a feather. The gesture was almost hesitant, but when he shuddered and groaned, she seemed to gain confidence. Her hand tightened around his cock, then she moved her lips more forcefully on his own.</p><p>Kinley needed this time to learn and grow. She was shy and naturally a lady. But once she came into her own as a woman, she would be able to move mountains. He and Dominic could give her that.</p><p>Riley could, too, but he was being a chicken-shit pansy ass.</p><p>Law opened to Kinley and let her in, her tongue sliding sensuously against his own, so silky and smooth. He couldn\u2019t help but drag his fingers into her soft hair and draw her closer.</p><p>As he did, her nipples touched his chest, hard little pebbles that signaled her arousal. Soon, she would be ready. And he couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>Though he didn\u2019t want to, Law broke off the kiss. If she kept up the intimate press of their lips, along with the slow grind of her hand, he was going to come. No way was he ready for that. \u201cNow touch Dominic.\u201d</p><p>He looked up to find that his partner was more than ready. Dominic had shed his sweat pants and now stood at the end of the bed, watching and dragging his cock through his fist in long strokes.</p><p>With a little gasp, Kinley let go of him and turned her sultry gaze to Dominic, focusing on his rhythmic movements over his cock.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you guys done this?\u201d Kinley asked, reaching toward him.</p><p>Dominic took her hand and helped her up, then dragged her closer. He hissed a little when her fingertips skated over the sensitive head of his dick. \u201cFor as long as I can remember.\u201d</p><p>Kinley was staring at the little bead of opaque liquid seeping from the slit of Dominic\u2019s cock. She swiped at it with the tip of one finger.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done this since we were old enough to have sex,\u201d Law explained. \u201cActually we probably weren\u2019t really old enough. I was barely seventeen, and Dominic was sixteen. Mrs. Landers. We were both really hot for teacher.\u201d</p><p>Kinley\u2019s free hand drifted toward his cock. She flicked him a little glance before she began stroking Dominic with her right hand and him with her left. She was a fucking natural. \u201cYou lost your virginity to the same woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, pet.\u201d Dominic\u2019s voice had deepened with every brush of her palms. \u201cI went first and I am deeply ashamed to say that Law went about two minutes after I started. I was young and very inexperienced. I will not have the same issues with you.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t. When did you bring Riley in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he was ready, about a year later,\u201d Law replied.</p><p>Fuck, she gripped him like a pro, bringing him closer and closer to the edge with every sweeping caress. It was easy to see that Kinley was getting more comfortable with the intimacy of being naked in front of her men. Her earlier shyness had evaporated, and her natural curiosity had taken over.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDominic and I were dating a woman. Jayne. Sweet little thing. Looked like a librarian, but she had the single filthiest mind I\u2019ve ever known. She didn\u2019t even blink when I asked if we could invite my little brother in. She just smiled and said \u2018pool party.\u2019 She could do some crazy things underwater.\u201d</p><p>Dominic slapped him upside the head, and Law winced. Shit! He was talking about other women. What was he thinking? Oh, he wasn\u2019t. He needed to say something and fix the situation quick. He needed to bring up feelings and shit.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t care about her the way I do you,\u201d Law swore.</p><p>\u201cSmooth, Law. Very smooth.\u201d Dominic rolled his eyes, then brushed her hair from her face with a gentle hand. \u201cPet, what my partner is trying to explain very badly is that we had easy relationships with women we liked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t an easy relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven that most of America thinks we kidnapped you, no,\u201d Dominic explained. \u201cI should walk away but I can\u2019t. That should tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis willpower is usually iron,\u201d Law added with a nod.</p><p>\u201cBut we want you to understand that our sharing you isn\u2019t going to stop. It\u2019s what we do. You could very likely make a play for one of us. Perhaps you could even take him, but he would always miss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven after the people in your life start to tell you it\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it wrong?\u201d Kinley countered. \u201cWe aren\u2019t hurting anyone. If we want to make each other feel good and we share some affection and respect, I really don\u2019t see how our bedroom activities are anyone else\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>Dominic gripped her wrist, stopped the stroke of her palm. Instead, he dragged it to his lips and laid a tender kiss in the center. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. Now, lie back. It\u2019s our turn to touch you.\u201d</p><p>Kinley practically floated back to the mattress. She looked so warm and feminine lying there. Law covered her breast with his hand, loving its round weight and lush curves.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have talked about other women.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI asked because I want to know you. You talk about those other women fondly. You didn\u2019t just use them and toss them away. You actually liked them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly,\u201d he admitted. \u201cSometimes I went along because Dominic or Riley wanted someone, but that\u2019s not the case with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not with you simply because Law wants me here.\u201d Dominic settled on his knees. \u201cI\u2019m here because I can\u2019t fucking resist you. And I won\u2019t wait another second to get a real taste.\u201d</p><p>As Law kissed his way down her neck, he admitted that he was already completely addicted to her. And now it was Dominic\u2019s turn.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Kinley was drowning in pure sensation. From the soft comforter at her back, to Law\u2019s warm hands on her body, then Dominic\u2019s fingers wrapped around her ankles\u2014all of that combined to overload her senses.</p><p>Law kissed his way down to her breasts. She could feel her nipples engorging and beading, straining for his attention.</p><p>Dominic spread her legs wide. The cool air stroked her overheated pussy just before he did. \u201cIt seems you enjoyed touching us, pet. You\u2019re creamy and wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, Sir.\u201d In fact, she\u2019d loved touching them.</p><p>Kinley had been surprised at how silky the skin covering their cocks felt, but the flesh underneath had been rock hard, proof of their desire for her. It had seemed a bit unreal for these two beautiful men to stand still and allow her to explore their bodies. It had been the single most erotic experience of her life.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Dominic breathed in her scent like it was an intoxicating perfume. With a firm grip, he lifted her thighs, spreading her open even more.</p><p>\u201cAnd you smell delicious.\u201d His low voice rumbled with passion, with possession.</p> <p>Kinley doubted that.</p><p>The thought had barely cleared her head when Dominic descended, his mouth covering her mound, his tongue delving past her slick folds to her most sensitive, nerve-rich spots. She bucked against the electric jolt of desire that seared her veins and screamed.</p><p>Law tightened his grasp on her immediately, holding her down and still. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Dominic is eating your pussy like you\u2019re his favorite dessert, baby. Let him. Don\u2019t interrupt a man who\u2019s enjoying his sweets.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine half the women she knew allowing this. They\u2019d call it dirty. So why did it feel like heaven? Nothing in her life had ever felt as pleasurable as Dominic suckling her clitoris and laving her affectionately with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby,\u201d Law murmured against her skin. \u201cJust lie back and let us have you.\u201d</p><p>She was giving herself over to the very men who had kidnapped her. Though that should seem terribly wrong, it felt so perfectly right.</p><p>What would people say if she gave her virginity to two of her captors? The press was covering this story. Who knew what they\u2019d dig up and air in the name of journalism and truth?</p><p>Kinley forced herself to relax. There would be plenty of time later for self-recrimination, probably a lifetime of it. Now, she wanted pleasure, to feel like a woman, to make her own choices. She wanted to know why her friends blushed when their husbands or lovers entered the room, be able to share in their talk about passion. Because chances were, when her time with these men was over, she\u2019d probably return home alone. There would be no more passion, and she would have to figure out how to be the same old Kinley again\u2014the one who served those around her without much thought to her own wants and needs. What she did today wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business but hers.</p><p>She set all of her worries aside. For now, there was only the heat and joy of touching Law and Dominic.</p><p>Law\u2019s mouth closed over her right nipple in a caress of wet heat while his hand covered her left breast. He licked and tongued her nipple, every now and then giving her a hard nip that sent her eyes rolling to the back of her head with a whimper.</p><p>Dominic gently pulled at her labia, parting her pussy for the long slide of his tongue. He licked her everywhere, sucking the petals of her sex into his mouth, then settled over her clit.</p><p>Nothing had ever filled her with this much euphoria, not rollercoasters, nor her favorite candy, not the funniest movie she\u2019d ever seen. Not even family holidays when she was a child. This feeling was like pure, breathless happiness tingling through her veins.</p><p>Between Dominic\u2019s tongue spearing inside her and Law\u2019s sweet play at her breasts, the tension, the greedy need for more, built toward something, a bigger, more explosive version of what they had given her the day before in the kitchen. That moment had been a revelation, but now they were forcing her higher. She gripped the comforter in her fists, fighting to stay still, but it was so difficult. She wanted to buck against Dominic\u2019s mouth, force him to go faster, harder, deeper.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d Law lifted away from her breast and stared into her eyes. Tell me you like having Dominic eat your pussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it, Law,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI like it so much.\u201d</p><p>Helplessly, she looked down her body where Dominic\u2019s dark head was moving as he brought her such amazing pleasure. She arched, digging her heels into the mattress, and cried out.</p><p>\u201cYou want more?\u201d Law demanded.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t he see the answer? Her every muscle had gone tense. She panted. Perspiration broke out across her body. Blood rushed just under her skin. He had to know that she did.</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Kinley.\u201d Law pinched her nipple, and she moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou like that bite of pain?\u201d</p><p>She should probably deny it. Lie. But Dominic\u2019s tongue driving her closer and closer to a climax that she so desperately needed didn\u2019t leave any room for coyness. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m going to have your nipples pierced so I can play with them. A little flick here, a little suck there...\u201d</p><p>His words made her burn hotter, shoved her closer to the edge of orgasm. She writhed and thrashed, on the brink of pleading for just that little something more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll run a chain through the rings,\u201d Law continued thickly. \u201cWhen you misbehave, I\u2019ll tug on it and bring you back in line. But for now this will have to do. Hold still.\u201d</p><p>He twisted her nipple, the pain flaring, snapping her back to attention, hurtling her body into confusion. She sent Law a beseeching glance. His brilliant blue eyes were sharp, fixated on her as he stared with obvious desire. He didn\u2019t look like a man having casual sex. He was connecting with her, trying to build trust with her. This felt like far more than intercourse.</p><p>Not only that, Law had mentioned the future\u2014again. He\u2019d seen her naked and he still wanted to talk about sharing a tomorrow? Dominic hadn\u2019t said anything, but the way he ate her intently and kept at her didn\u2019t exactly signal his indifference.</p><p>She stared up at Law. God, she had a lover, and it gave her the oddest sense of strength. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I will. I just...love what Dominic is doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means so much that you\u2019re here to share it with me.\u201d She fell into Law\u2019s blue eyes.</p><p>As Dominic nipped at her clit and another shard of pleasure scraped its way up her spine, Kinley realized that she wanted them all. She didn\u2019t care what that made her. Law, Dominic, and maybe someday Riley, if he would have her. She would do her best to make them happy\u2014like they would undoubtedly make her. Who else\u2019s opinion really mattered except their own?</p><p>\u201cI need...\u201d She bunched the sheets in her fists again and tried to focus on staying still, but the lash of Dominic\u2019s tongue kept pushing her harder, higher.</p><p>\u201cWe know what you need, baby,\u201d Law assured. \u201cI think you should give it to her, Dominic. I want to watch her come.\u201d</p><p>With a thick finger, Dominic circled the opening of her pussy, coating her folds. Another joined the first, stretching her wide before sliding inside.</p><p>\u201cHmm, that\u2019s sexy. He\u2019s fucking you with his fingers,\u201d Law said, his voice husky. \u201cBut in a minute or two, it will be my cock pressing deep inside you, Kinley. I\u2019m going to take you like a man takes a woman. I\u2019m going to make you scream. Are you ready for that? We\u2019ll go slow if you need.\u201d</p><p>Slow? She\u2019d gone about as slow as a woman could go. \u201cNo. Now. I want it.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand another night passing without knowing how it felt to be taken by these men.</p><p>\u201cGive it to her, Dominic, so we can get on with this. I\u2019m fucking dying here.\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s head came up briefly. He smiled slyly. \u201cI\u2019m more than ready, brother. So is she.\u201d</p><p>He speared his fingers deep inside her, rubbing at a spot that made her arch and shiver and want to climb the walls. Then he sucked her clitoris into his mouth gently.</p><p>Sensation rolled over her then crested, tossing her into the raging abyss of pleasure. Kinley merged her stare with Law\u2019s as she came, her body flying higher than before. His eyes darkened, heated, then he captured her mouth and swallowed her cries.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted, baby. So gorgeous. But now it\u2019s my turn to make you scream.\u201d He rolled off the bed and walked to where he\u2019d dropped his pants.</p><p>Dominic stood tall above Kinley as she tried to drag air into her lungs and recover. She couldn\u2019t stop staring at him in all his glory. Tight muscle roped his body all the way up his arms, across his broad shoulders, down his chiseled chest and that six-pack to die for. She swallowed.</p><p>He held out a hand to her. \u201cLet me help you up.\u201d</p><p>Why was she leaving the bed? Before she could ask or protest, Dominic gripped her hand and hauled her to her feet. Her whole body was so languid, her legs almost didn\u2019t support her.</p><p>Then he eased back on the bed, taking her down with him, her back against his chest. She could feel his hard cock prodding her backside.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but melt into Dominic\u2019s chest. She was so relaxed...yet she wanted to entice him more, tempt him to touch her. Kinley writhed against him.</p><p>It worked. Dominic cupped her breasts as he spoke in her ear. \u201cHold on to me. It won\u2019t hurt for long. You\u2019re ready, pet. We both want to fuck you. We can\u2019t take your delectable ass tonight, so we\u2019ll each have a turn at your pussy. But you can stop us at any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop.\u201d She wanted them both. Hell, she wanted Riley, too. She yearned to revel in these sensations and share her love. What was so wrong with that?</p><p>\u201cJust know that you can. We don\u2019t want you afraid.\u201d She\u2019d never heard Dominic\u2019s voice sound so concerned, tender.</p><p>She smiled, then sent him a saucy stare over her shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you felt a couple of days ago.\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened on her, bringing her closer as if he was afraid she would run. \u201cForgive me. I thought I was doing the right thing, pet. I let vengeance blind me. I don\u2019t want you scared. I don\u2019t like knowing you thought I would kill you\u2014even for a moment. You\u2019re precious, and I would never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He might break her heart, but she believed him when he said that he\u2019d never physically harm her. \u201cI know, Sir. I won\u2019t hurt you either.\u201d</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t. Not physically or emotionally. She feared she would fall in love with him and want him forever. But that was her problem, not his.</p><p>\u201cYou could, you know,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cHurt me, I mean. I can\u2019t tell you how much that scares me. It\u2019s been a very long time since I\u2019ve allowed myself to be vulnerable to a woman.\u201d</p><p>She believed him. Yes, he could be lying, but why? She\u2019d already said that she would help his case against Greg. What else could he want? She\u2019d already said yes to sex, too. Dominic seemed like the most self-possessed man on the planet. He wouldn\u2019t give her any power over him unless it meant something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan we hurry?\u201d Kinley wanted to feel them so badly.</p><p>Dominic scowled. \u201cLaw, have you forgotten how to roll a condom on?\u201d</p><p>She turned to find Law stroking his cock, a small foil packet in his other hand. He ripped it open and held the tip of the condom as he shoved it down his massive cock. Once he completed the task, he looked up at her, his face softening as he climbed up on the bed.</p><p>Law spread her legs wide. \u201cI\u2019m so honored, baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe both are.\u201d Dominic kissed her ear. \u201cYour trust is not only imperative. It\u2019s everything. Do you know what it does to me? To us?\u201d</p><p>With fierce blue eyes, Law drilled into her soul as he settled his body on top of her own. He eased his cock against her swollen opening. He felt very large, while she...did not. At least not there. Her breasts might be big and she was still a little overweight, but that didn\u2019t translate into anything else being more sizeable than average.</p><p>Kinley whimpered in both anxiety and anticipation.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Dominic soothed her with his whisper and his touch. \u201cIt will all be fine. You were built to take your men. Relax and give yourself to us.\u201d</p><p>Law loomed above her, his stare fierce. \u201cHe\u2019s right, Kinley.\u201d</p> <p>Pushing back apprehension, she reached for him. \u201cI\u2019m not hesitating. I want you, Law. And I want Dominic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He held himself above her, body tense, as he carefully began probing his way inside her, a prod, a nudge, a shallow stroke. It all added up. Pressure climbed one slow inch at a time and threatened to overwhelm her.</p><p>When panic began to encroach, Dominic soothed her with a whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, pet. We want you so much. Do you have any idea how happy we are that you waited for us?\u201d</p><p>She gripped Law\u2019s shoulders and let Dominic\u2019s voice sink into her as Law began to penetrate. His hips held her legs wide so his flesh could stretch her own. He moved in and out of her slick folds, gaining ground with each thrust. Over and over, he entered and retreated, inch by inch probing her deeper until she felt him stop.</p><p>The pressure and the anxiety overwhelmed her. Law exercised all his restraint. It was obvious he wanted to shove himself inside her in one agonizing thrust. Instead, he shook and cursed under his breath, clearly holding back. Dominic kept soothing her, whispering that she was so sexy and lovely, he couldn\u2019t stand it. He played with her breasts, brushing and pinching her nipples.</p><p>With a shove of his hips, Law breached her barrier and groaned. Kinley felt something tear inside her. She gasped and froze, impaled and in pain for a moment. In the next, he held himself still, his cock buried completely inside her. Then he waited, giving her time to adjust to the feel of him. The pain evaporated.</p> <p>Heaving a ragged sigh, Law touched his forehead to hers. \u201cYou\u2019re ours now, baby.\u201d</p><p>Kinley sank into the moment and gave herself over to them. Nothing had ever felt so right. They had treated her with more affection and kindness than anyone else. Besides being crazy about them, she was making love with them for the right reasons.</p><p>Law kissed her for the longest time, tangling their tongues together until she was utterly limp. \u201cAre you ready for more?\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him tightly as her legs encircled his waist. She was willing to give them everything. Yes, when he\u2019d first pressed inside her, she\u2019d felt a momentary flaring pain, but it paled next to the breathtaking intimacy of the connection they all shared with Dominic behind her and Law on top.</p><p>She belonged to them now. Maybe not for always, but for these moments, she was completely and utterly theirs. And they were hers.</p><p>Law began to thrust, gently at first, then gaining power and speed as she rocked with him. Dominic held her too, his big body acting as her pillow, though nothing about him was soft. He made her feel utterly safe, grounding her even as Law sent her flying. She could go as high as she wanted because Dominic was right behind her, hugging her tight.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so fucking good.\u201d Law\u2019s face was a mask of tension, every muscle tight as he used his whole body to push inside her before he pulled back again. Over and over, his big cock slid across a sensitive place high inside her passage. With each thrust, every bit of friction, she moaned and thrashed. Pleasure was right there. That ecstasy she\u2019d felt before shimmered just out of reach.</p><p>Determined to have it, she tightened and arched up to meet Law\u2019s next stroke, then sank her nails into his back. Law thrust harder, his pelvis crashing against her clitoris. He growled and ground down, then thrust up hard until she couldn\u2019t take another second.</p> <p>Orgasm flowed over her. Kinley cried out, screaming his name as she came.</p><p>Law\u2019s big body shuddered. He growled out in pleasure, holding himself tight against her. His arms shook as he pumped out his release. His excitement sent her into another frenzy, and she shook with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy about you,\u201d he managed to say through long breaths a moment later.</p><p>She nuzzled his cheek, caressing his hair as her body came down from the high. Sweet peace flowed through her.</p><p>Dominic was so hard he could barely breathe, but he watched as Law nestled his face in Kinley\u2019s neck. She caressed his head, keeping him close, coveting him. The moment seemed almost sacred, as though they had both been washed clean of their past pain by their emotional joining.</p><p>God, this was far more than sex or a mere exchange of pleasure. Kinley was truly giving herself. Once she\u2019d made the decision to surrender, she\u2019d done it perfectly, without hesitation. She wasn\u2019t someone he would be able to forget once he hopped out of bed and had a shower. If he slid deep inside her body and claimed her, he would have a responsibility to her for the rest of his life.</p><p>Was Riley the smarter one here? Dominic wasn\u2019t sure he was ready to be this woman\u2019s Master. Her husband. That was the direction this was heading. Was embracing someone with such close ties to his sister\u2019s killer a betrayal of Carrie\u2019s memory?</p><p>Law sighed and looked down at Kinley. He smiled, an open expression of pure joy that Dominic had never seen his friend give to anyone but her. It made Law look younger, freer, than he\u2019d ever seemed.</p><p>Maybe in her heart, she belonged to Law alone. Dominic wondered if he was making too much of taking Kinley to bed. The woman already had a forever sort of man that she was clearly half in love with. If Dominic really wanted to, he could just have sex with her. Law would take care of her and be her Master, leaving Dominic to be her occasional Sir. He could simply visit and spice up their sex life. No fuss. No muss. No worry if he was shitting on Carrie\u2019s memory. Just hot sex with a beautiful woman.</p><p>Kinley turned her face up to him, her smile both a glow from the inside and pure invitation. Dominic nearly stopped breathing.</p><p>He\u2019d heard men describe their wives as the most beautiful women in the world. He\u2019d never been able to see it or understand. But Kinley lit up from the inside, and it wasn\u2019t just for Law. She gave that to him, for him. No doubt in his mind that right now she was more beautiful than every other woman on the planet, at least in his eyes. When she was old and gray with a load of grandchildren around her, he would still see her like this, in a golden aura of passion he couldn\u2019t resist. For him, she would always be the sun.</p><p>Was he willing to walk away because the timing was terrible, because he worried what Carrie would have thought? She\u2019d been the one who told him that love was all that mattered. She would weep at the thought of him choosing revenge over joy. She would be disappointed in him if he chose punishment over love.</p><p>Carrie would have wanted his happiness more than anything.</p><p>Was he willing for Kinley\u2019s grandchildren to belong exclusively to Law? Did he want to be the footnote in their relationship, the perverted little secret from their past?</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he commanded almost involuntarily, as though his body knew what he needed more than his mind. But he wouldn\u2019t take the words back.</p><p>Law chuckled and rolled off her. \u201cKiss Dominic, baby. He needs it.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head back onto his chest and lifted her face up for his kiss. She reached over her head to cup his cheek with her palm, and he could have sworn a jolt of electricity charged his body the moment she touched him. Her lips were still warm from Law\u2019s, but that was fine with Dominic. That meant she\u2019d been recently loved and by someone he considered a partner. A friend. Law backed him up. They shared a brotherly rapport. Law was his family.</p><p>He remembered that moment so long ago when Law had risked everything for him, protecting him, though they\u2019d had nothing in common. Dominic had been afraid. He was the poor little rich boy who had no friends, and he\u2019d realized even at a young age that caring about a person was a choice that required courage. They could leave him. They could stop caring about him. They could use his affection against him. They could trap him in something loveless and bland like his parents\u2019 marriage.</p><p>Or they could support him, give him roots yet set him free. They could make life richer. They could surround him in so much peace he would never want to leave.</p><p>Kinley could be family, too. She could add light and love to his life. If he just let her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t restrain his urge to kiss her again. Instead, he sank his fingers into her silky hair and tangled his tongue around hers.</p><p>Dominic was done questioning everything. The future wasn\u2019t certain. God, Carrie had taught him that. But the very thing he\u2019d thought had wrecked his life had led him to Kinley. In one moment, he felt his sister\u2019s love, her caring spirit. She\u2019d been snuffed out by a monster, but it had all led him here, to his salvation from a life of hatred and vengeance. Now, he had a shot at saving Kinley, the woman he was pretty sure was meant to be his. He would only dishonor Carrie by rejecting Kinley for stubborn reasons.</p><p>She separated from him, dragging in oxygen with a shuddering breath. \u201cI should go and clean up.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she had so much to learn about the way this worked. He put his hand under her chin and pulled her up to his lips again. \u201cYou\u2019re not dirty, pet. I want you now.\u201d</p><p>He wanted her in every way. The fact that Law had just taken her didn\u2019t make her dirty. It made her theirs. It made her the center of their circle.</p><p>Kinley turned in his arms until they rested chest to chest. Her breasts were crushed against him. She lay between his legs and his cock surged with need. He\u2019d barely managed not to come when he\u2019d heard her cries, felt her move against him as Law had taken her virginity. But in so many ways, she was still innocent. No one could take that from her. She was simply one of those souls who would be innocent until the day she died.</p><p>And when he left this earth, he wanted to be holding Kinley\u2019s hand.</p><p>Why this woman?</p><p>He kissed her again and realized it was a combination of fate and his own needs. Everything about her seemed to align just right with him. With her sweetness, she balanced his cynicism. With her femininity, she tempered his sometimes too-aggressive nature. With her love, she would lift the darkness from his heart. She would always stand beside him.</p><p>Riley was wrong. This woman wouldn\u2019t falter. Nor would she refuse them. Kinley would take everything that came her way because she treasured love. And she could teach them all to love deeper and more unconditionally.</p><p>\u201cI need you so badly, pet.\u201d God, that sounded selfish. He shook his head. \u201cIf you\u2019re too sore, tell me no. I\u2019ll understand.\u201d He could because he\u2019d just realized that this woman\u2019s happiness and comfort meant everything to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Dominic.\u201d Kinley\u2019s hands cupped his face, and suddenly he felt precious. It was probably dumb, but just for a moment, he was important to the one woman he held above all others. \u201cI need you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me.\u201d He\u2019d never had sex with a female on top. He\u2019d always been the aggressor, climbing above a woman or fucking her from behind. But he wanted Kinley rising above him now like a goddess, taking him in as she took her pleasure.</p><p>He shifted, easing his legs close together so she could straddle him. His cock strained up, the pearly evidence of his desire surging from the tip.</p><p>Kinley gasped and her whole body moved, shivering around his. \u201cWhat do you mean? You want me to be on top?\u201d</p><p>Law was suddenly beside him, handing him a condom. They didn\u2019t have the right not to use one yet. But the three men had made a promise to each other. When they all agreed, they would toss out the birth control. That meant the woman with them was the one. Foregoing condoms would be a collective contract, a blood vow, to take care of any children that came from the union. Law and Riley had their reasons, of course. But Dominic had his, as well.</p><p>He wanted his kids to have at least one loving parent. His own childhood had been devoid of that. He\u2019d considered Carrie, Law, and Riley his family, and he counted his blessings for them. But he wanted more for his own children. With Law and Riley beside him, he knew he could promise a child a good life.</p><p>And Kinley would die before she allowed her child to know a loveless existence. God, she\u2019d given up nearly everything for people who didn\u2019t deserve her. What would she do for a baby she delivered? There would be no limits. She would never stop sharing her heart with her little ones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered her, his tone low, husky. He wanted her to take as much or as little as she could. There would be time enough later for her to service him. Tonight, he wanted to give to her. He wanted to be a part of her first night as a woman.</p><p>The Dom inside him chafed to mark her with some symbol of his ownership, but the man simply needed to feel her with him, around him. He needed to know that, good and bad, she wanted and accepted him.</p><p>Hell, he needed a wife. He hadn\u2019t realized it until the moment he\u2019d held her. He\u2019d been waiting for so long for the right woman to bring him closer to the brothers of his heart and make them all an official family.</p><p>He needed Kinley.</p><p>She moved over him, awkwardly at first. She spread her legs wide, straddling him, dropping her gaze to look at that place where she would take him inside her luscious body. Kinley took a long breath, then gripped his cock, holding it up.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby, condom first. Until we\u2019re ready.\u201d Law passed her the little foil wrapped package.</p><p>She took it with the faintest hint of a smile on her face. \u201cYes, Law.\u201d</p><p>Dominic gritted his teeth as she opened the condom and placed it on his cock with a bit more finesse than expected.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn that, pet?\u201d he rasped out.</p><p>\u201cI was getting married, so I took a class.\u201d She pinched the tip and started to roll the rest down his length. \u201cBut we used bananas. You\u2019re bigger than my banana.\u201d</p><p>God, he hoped so. She was killing him. He had to close his eyes as she stroked him, rolling the rubber down his length. She was so careful, taking her time and easing it down his screaming flesh inch by torturous inch. He gritted his teeth to stop himself from coming in her hand like a damn teenager.</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d She sounded so proud of herself, and all he wanted to do was force her down on his cock and pound every inch inside her.</p><p>It took everything he had not to move as she positioned herself over him. Her little hand caressed his cock again, ensuring the condom was in place. He tightened every muscle of his body to stave off the mind-blowing feel of her touch.</p><p>And then she was poised on top of him. She closed her eyes for a moment, then her lashes fluttered up, opening those vibrant eyes to him as she lowered herself. He looked right at her as he gripped her hips and began to surge up, a promise, a vow to always care for her.</p><p>Heat and pressure gripped him. He\u2019d been right. Law hadn\u2019t taken her innocence, and he couldn\u2019t either. She was still as sweet as she\u2019d always been. Anyone who tried to take that purity from her would find himself flattened by Dominic Anthony. He would defend her innocence to his dying day.</p><p>She took him in bit by delicious bit. He watched, not wanting to forget a moment of the experience. He memorized the tiny changes in her expression as she worked her way down his cock. He noticed how her breasts moved with every breath and gasp, the feel of her hips in his hands when she spread them wide to accept him. And he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her pussy. The sight was burned into his brain. Her pink flesh opened for him, sinking on to him as his cock disappeared inside her heat.</p><p>Tight. She was so fucking tight. He had to grit his teeth against the pleasure as she gripped him hard.</p><p>He would never last. Feeling Law take her virginity had nearly been enough to send him off. Actually being inside her was just about to kill him.</p><p>\u201cHe never does this, baby.\u201d Law was watching, his eyes slightly hooded with desire.</p><p>Kinley started to move in small slides. Up and down, going deeper each time. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably done this a lot, Law.\u201d</p><p>His friend chuckled. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s never given up control like this. Not once in all the years I\u2019ve known him. You\u2019re special.\u201d</p><p>Kinley stared down at him, her eyes going soft. She caressed his cheek, her palm sliding across the bristle of his five o\u2019clock shadow. \u201cYou\u2019re both special to me. I won\u2019t ever forget you.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have to. He\u2019d be as slow as she needed, but Dominic intended to introduce her to an entirely different world. He would make sure she understood the joy of submission.</p> <p>He reached down to toy with her clit, his fingers finding slick cream there. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you can\u2019t forget me, pet. And by tomorrow, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>By then, he would be her Master. There was no going back now. He would have her collared and at his side before she realized what was happening. She would belong to him and Law. If Riley finally pried his head out of his ass, he would be welcome to join them.</p><p>Law had been right; she was the one.</p><p>Her eyes widened as he pressed down on her clit, working that sensitive nubbin of flesh. \u201cI can\u2019t. Not again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Again. You\u2019ll come as many times as I tell you to. You\u2019ll take as much pleasure as we can give you, pet. Come for me now.\u201d</p><p>He pressed down hard even as he thrust up, forcing her onto his cock completely.</p><p>Kinley\u2019s mouth opened. Her eyes widened. She came on a keening cry, pulsing around him, her skin flushing magnificently. She was a sight to behold, and knowing that he\u2019d given her this pleasure only ramped him up more.</p><p>And then Dominic couldn\u2019t stop himself. He flipped her over to her back, gripping her hips, and pistoning deeply over and over like a man possessed. Whatever soreness she experienced, he would make it up to her. But damn it, he needed to be inside her completely now. He needed to fuse himself to her.</p><p>Holding her close, he meshed their mouths together as he fucked her. He went as high as he could go, turning and twisting to find the right spot, then her nails sank into his back. Her breath hitched. Her whole body tensed.</p><p>She came again, her pussy clamping down on his cock, sending him straight over the edge into a drowning pool of pleasure he never wanted to be rescued from.</p><p>Dominic\u2019s spine tingled. His balls drew up close to his body and the heat swelled, overtaking him, finally firing off in a burst so supernova he\u2019d never felt anything like it. His whole body coalesced, every cell alive in that moment.</p><p>He collapsed on top of her, his head in the crook of her neck, his cock still embedded deep in her pussy.</p><p>Dominic had decided; he was never going to let her go.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>After crawling over the foot of the bed so she didn\u2019t disturb either Law or Dominic, Kinley stretched and eased out of the bedroom door. The guys were still asleep and darkness had finally fallen, but she couldn\u2019t seem to drift off. Jet lag, the time zone change, and the sun\u2019s abbreviated absence each night had thrown her body into confusion.</p><p>She should be comatose\u2014or at least at rest. After more orgasms than she could count, Dominic and Law had gotten her into a hot tub with Epsom salt to help ease her soreness. The warm water had relaxed her, but as they\u2019d all fallen into the bed, sleep hadn\u2019t come for her. Instead, her stomach rumbled, sending her looking for a late night snack. All the vigorous activity had added to her appetite.</p><p>Despite the fact that no one was looking, she blushed as she walked down the hall wearing nothing but Dominic\u2019s T-shirt. As she rounded the hallway to the kitchen, Kinley caught sight of the faint glow of a monitor and the sound of a familiar voice talking.</p><p>My wife is missing. I don\u2019t have time to talk about something as ridiculous as that lawyer\u2019s claims. I\u2019m going to sue him for defamation of character. If he really knew Kinley, he would know that she would never walk out on her family. She\u2019s too pure to be interested in torrid affairs.</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t have any interest in torrid affairs. I didn\u2019t know what I was missing. And I am not his wife,\u201d she grumbled to herself.</p><p>It turned her stomach that Greg preened for the cameras while pretending to care about her. And what the devil did he mean by \u201cpure?\u201d What century was he living in?</p><p>As she stepped into the room, Riley zipped his stare in her direction, his blue eyes raking her from head to toe. \u201cDo you need something, Kinley?\u201d</p><p>She turned on the light. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m not the only one who can\u2019t sleep. Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to disturb you. I just came to make myself a sandwich and check on Gigi.\u201d</p><p>Riley stood, his face guarded. He\u2019d taken a shower recently and now wore nothing but his low-slung jeans and a pair of socks, baring every muscle and corrugated ripple of his torso. His hair was still wet. He\u2019d brushed it away from his face. It hung longer than Law\u2019s or Dominic\u2019s, curling around his ears. Riley was beyond masculine and so beautiful standing in shadow that Kinley had a hard time breathing.</p><p>\u201cUhm, I think they tired themselves out.\u201d He nodded toward a comfy-looking dog bed in the corner. Gigi\u2019s head was resting on Butch\u2019s shoulder and the bigger dog was wrapped around her.</p><p>Kinley herself had been a little like that, all cuddled up with Law and Dominic. Every time she\u2019d turned, one of the men would wrap her up in his arms so she felt warm and safe. Until hunger and restlessness had sent her from the cozy bed.</p><p>\u201cI guess I should get used to mutts. I can\u2019t imagine Gigi coming out of this without a litter.\u201d Butch and her Yorkie looked so cute together, she couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019re used to mutts by now after a couple of hours with Law. Dominic\u2019s a thoroughbred, but you should know that my brother and I come from nothing.\u201d His handsome face was a complete blank, but he spoke the words like a taunt.</p><p>\u201cWow. That is a mighty big chip you have on your shoulder. Who was she?\u201d Because no man got that cynical without a woman being involved.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just being honest.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>The way Riley sneered at her got her back up. \u201cYour brother is one of the kindest men I\u2019ve ever met. I won\u2019t let you call him that. Besides, there\u2019s nothing wrong with mutts. I\u2019m going to love every pup from Gigi\u2019s litter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you will, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had just about enough of his attitude. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>His brows rode up sharply. \u201cWhy not? Law calls you \u2018baby\u2019 and you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>In the past she would have just taken his crap. But having sex seemed to have had a positive effect on her self-confidence. Now, she refused to put up with his snide comments, especially because he was the one standing in the way of any sort of tomorrow with Law and Dominic. It couldn\u2019t work without Riley.</p><p>If she could convince him to tone down the douchebag routine, that would be a start. But if she wanted any shot at keeping her men, she was going to have to fight for it. What had Dominic told her? She couldn\u2019t get what she wanted if she never went for it.</p><p>\u201cI am Law\u2019s baby. And apparently I\u2019m Dominic\u2019s pet. I wouldn\u2019t have said that \u2018pet\u2019 could be a sexy endearment, but I love when he says it. You don\u2019t get to call me sweetheart because you don\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d He took a long breath and walked to the fridge. \u201cSo you really like my brother?\u201d</p><p>She was pretty sure she was madly in love with his brother. \u201cI do. I like Dominic, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would like Dominic.\u201d He yanked open the refrigerator and looked in. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a sandwich. We have ham and turkey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurkey, please. With mustard if you have it. And why would you automatically assume that I\u2019d like Dominic? He was kind of scary at first. But I\u2019ll confess that my affection for him has grown since he stopped threatening me.\u201d And started kissing her. And giving her crazy-good orgasms. Just the thought of his deep voice had her shivering again.</p><p>Riley grabbed the turkey, some mustard, and veggies, then walked back to the island. \u201cI knew you would like Dominic because you come from the same world. He\u2019s got money and all.\u201d</p><p>She was getting a little sick of Riley\u2019s attitude. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You were marrying Jansen for his bank account. You might lie, but your actions don\u2019t, sweet...Kinley.\u201d He grabbed a loaf of whole wheat bread from the nearby pantry, then slammed the door.</p><p>Just like that, the glow from her lovemaking with Dominic and Law vanished and reality crashed back in. \u201cBecause I thought my father was sick. I thought he needed treatment. And my charity was going to go under. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of Hope House being shut down after my mother worked so hard to build it up. The homeless community depends on it. I wasn\u2019t marrying Greg for shopping sprees and trips around the world. I was doing it to help my family.\u201d</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t look up as he started slicing tomatoes and spreading mustard. \u201cI\u2019m sure it makes you feel better to think about it that way.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to win with him. Not ever. There had been a moment when she\u2019d felt like she could have it all, but she should have known it was just a fantasy. Riley wanted something else in a woman. Kinley didn\u2019t know what, but it wasn\u2019t anything she could offer. She wasn\u2019t the girl people loved. Even her own family had cared so little, they\u2019d been willing to kill her off for a buck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not hungry anymore. I\u2019ll see you in the morning and maybe we can figure out what Greg is doing. And we need to call a press conference or something because I\u2019m sick of Greg telling lies about me. I promise I\u2019ll clear everything up, then you won\u2019t have to see me anymore.\u201d</p><p>So he could move on with his life. And she could try to find a new one.</p><p>Kinley turned away, but he was suddenly beside her, gripping her wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t go. I\u2019ll stop being an asshole. Sit down and let me make you something to eat. Please. It\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she considered stomping out of the room for effect, but she didn\u2019t really like fighting. Ducking out might only confirm her guilt in his head. Not that he had much doubt, but why make it easier for him to cast her as the villainess? Besides, she really was hungry.</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about the press conference, Dominic, Law, and I. It\u2019s not a good idea. Right now, Jansen doesn\u2019t know if you\u2019re cooperating with us, so he\u2019s in a holding pattern. If he realizes that you\u2019re helping our case, he might destroy all the evidence or simply disappear. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d ever convict him then. That would leave him roaming free...and he might come back for you. You don\u2019t want to be one of Jansen\u2019s loose ends.\u201d</p><p>Riley had some good points.</p><p>He towered over her, his eyes soft for once. \u201cMy brother is crazy about you. I...it would be better if we could be friends.\u201d</p><p>Friends. Law wanted more. Dominic wanted more. And Riley just didn\u2019t. That deep connection she wanted so desperately was a puzzle, and she only had two of the pieces.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, hoping he couldn\u2019t hear the defeat in her tone. \u201cDo we have any tea?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and gestured to the cabinet over the sink. \u201cAll kinds. The James family keeps this place stocked. And the kettle is already on the burner.\u201d</p><p>He released her wrist. The momentary sense of intimacy between them ended when he broke physical connection. Now, Riley was so far from her in all the ways that counted. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>As she went to study the collection of tea, he resumed fixing the sandwich. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I really don\u2019t mean to hurt you. We\u2019ve just tried this before and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>She filled the kettle and set it on the burner, flicking the gas on. \u201cTried what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole \u2018We-all-love-you-so-let\u2019s-get-married\u2019 thing.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019d been engaged before? She staggered back. She knew she didn\u2019t have a right, but jealousy stabbed its way through her system.</p><p>Kinley tried to keep her tone casual. \u201cReally? Why didn\u2019t it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to marry me, not legally. She wanted Dominic\u2019s rock on her hand while she kept me and Law on the side. She had no intention of acknowledging the two of us in public.\u201d</p><p>That had to have hurt his pride. \u201cShe wanted to have her cake and eat it, too.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cShe wanted a normal social life, I guess.\u201d</p><p>There was so much more to that small statement than his manner suggested. Kinley picked out a packet of chamomile tea and set up two mugs. She\u2019d bet Riley needed some sleep, too. \u201cMaybe, but having it at the expense of you and Law wasn\u2019t right. Besides, what\u2019s normal?\u201d</p><p>He huffed incredulously. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about. Normal. One man. One woman. A couple of kids and a white picket fence.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI think that\u2019s overrated. I\u2019ve known gay couples who stayed in love so much longer than straight ones. And all the \u2018normal\u2019 couples I used to admire are cheating or splitting up. I assumed I would have a normal marriage with Greg. He\u2019s one man and I\u2019m one woman, right? Well, he turned out to be a criminal jerk who\u2019s screwing my sister and plotting to kill me. The two guys I have are wonderful. Our relationship might not be traditional, but they make me feel special.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re done thinking about yourself, cupcake, consider Dominic and Law. If you stay with them, everyone will assume they\u2019re gay.\u201d His stare met hers, a challenge rife there.</p><p>Where was he going with this? \u201cAnd we\u2019ll know they\u2019re straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Well, okay. I guess it\u2019s not that bad, being considered gay and all.\u201d He focused on the sandwich again.</p><p>Something had rubbed him raw. Kinley knew she should probably let it go, but his words niggled at her, telling her that understanding Riley was too important to give up. Even if he never joined their relationship, he was an integral part of Law and Dominic. They had to get along.</p><p>\u201cSo...your fianc\u00e9e was worried that it would seem like she was sleeping with gay guys?\u201d</p><p>Riley let out a low chuckle, but it held no humor. \u201cNot exactly. She was more concerned about what people would imagine went on if they knew she was sleeping with brothers.\u201d</p><p>It took Kinley a moment to process what Riley was saying. Once she did, her jaw dropped with shock at what this mystery woman had insinuated. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! You and Law would never... She\u2019s a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Kinley never used that kind of language, but it seemed terribly appropriate now. How dare she?</p><p>Riley stared at her for a moment, his face impassive. \u201cI share women with my brother. It\u2019s not the average, so a lot of people let their imaginations go wild. If I was also involved with you, we\u2019d all get tainted by the whispers. How are you going to get people to donate to your charity when everyone calls you and the men you consort with perverts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, not everyone would. A lot of people wouldn\u2019t think that at all or care about my personal life. The ones who want to presume that sort of crap behind my back, I don\u2019t care about.\u201d At least she didn\u2019t anymore. She\u2019d wasted too much time trying to please other people.</p><p>\u201cYou say that now, but once we get back to the real world, you\u2019ll change your story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley, I\u2019ve lived my whole life being worried about what people will think of me. I grew up in high society where a woman\u2019s reputation is everything. My sister has a sterling reputation. She\u2019s considered one of the finest women in the city. She\u2019s a selfish liar who cheats on her husband and thinks her babies are just a way to control him. She\u2019s planning on letting someone snuff out her only sister, and her parting shot to me was \u2018ta-ta.\u2019 She lives that so-called \u2018normal\u2019 life brilliantly, but I think she must be one of the most miserable human beings on this planet to behave the way she does. If that\u2019s normal, it\u2019s pretty crappy. And I want no part of that.\u201d</p><p>Riley shook his head. \u201cYou say that now, but wait until you don\u2019t have your stellar reputation anymore. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have the whole world look down on you.\u201d</p><p>He was completely missing the point of life. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to have one person lift you up? Because I might not have had the world look down on me, but I haven\u2019t had anyone really love me either. I think I would risk almost anything to have that in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully na\u00efve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told that before, but I think you\u2019re awfully cynical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat happens fast when you\u2019re the kid of the town whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you call her that.\u201d No matter who he was, Kinley wasn\u2019t about to let someone talk about Law\u2019s mother that way. When he\u2019d talked to her as California Mike, Law had been completely open about his mother. Though she\u2019d been flawed and damaged, he\u2019d loved her.</p><p>Riley shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s what she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t define who she was,\u201d Kinley argued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being realistic, the same way Simone was. She wanted Dominic\u2019s connections to climb the social ladder, using my back and Law\u2019s as the rungs. Keeping him separate from us in public was the only way she could hope to achieve that because a woman who slept with two brothers and their friend...who knew what went on there? Speculation would always run rampant, and she\u2019d always be a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in love with her.\u201d Nothing else explained his bitterness.</p><p>Riley hesitated, then shook his head. \u201cI was in love with the idea of her. I was in love with the idea of having the relationship I wanted. Simone showed me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Simone showed you what a horrible person she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted what all women want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think that is? In my book, it\u2019s love and companionship. To be desired and needed.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cTry money, respect, and a place in society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. She did a number on you. I\u2019m surprised. I wouldn\u2019t have expected you to just lie down like that and take it. You either loved her with every ounce of your soul or you\u2019re not the person I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>He frowned her way. \u201cI didn\u2019t love her.\u201d</p><p>If that was true, he sure seemed willing to give up an awful lot for a woman who didn\u2019t have his heart. \u201cBut are you going to let her dictate the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>His cynical smile was back. \u201cOh, please. Are you going to try to tell me that you\u2019re not going to let what Greg Jansen did affect you? You already have. You just tossed out twenty-five years of saving yourself for marriage to give Greg a big old \u2018fuck you.\u2019 So I wouldn\u2019t say too much about not bowing to bitterness if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I slept with Dominic and Law because I wanted to get back at Greg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Greg was going to be your husband, and you saved yourself for him. Spreading your legs for my brother and Dominic probably made you feel powerful. Was revenge sweet?\u201d</p><p>It had been, but not for the reasons he thought. \u201cI didn\u2019t save myself. I just never cared enough about anyone to sleep with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you came to care for my brothers in the couple of days since we drugged and kidnapped you, then ripped your world apart? Yeah, I believe that.\u201d</p><p>But she had. And she was starting to think that maybe her love and future were worth fighting for.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you believe, Riley. I know who I am. I know what I\u2019ve done and what I feel. I\u2019ve absolutely come to care a great deal about your brother and Dominic. Sleeping with them had nothing to do with revenge and everything to do with moving on with life. You can\u2019t understand that because you\u2019re clinging to the past. Some woman hurt you, and now you won\u2019t let it go, so you\u2019ll take it out on me. Fine, but stop and think about the fact that I\u2019m not you. Greg hurt me. Becks hurt me. My dad hurt me. Guess what? I won\u2019t let them ruin my life. I won\u2019t allow them to change me. I might be na\u00efve and stupid, but I will keep trying to find love. I don\u2019t care how it comes to me. If it comes from one or two or three men, I\u2019ll take it. I don\u2019t care what the rest of the world thinks because no one there cared that my fianc\u00e9 was going to kill me. You, Dominic, and Law cared. That\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t care because of you.\u201d The words came out on a harsh rasp.</p><p>That hurt, but then he seemed determined to make her see his twisted truth. \u201cThey do now. I can\u2019t change how you feel.\u201d</p><p>And Riley didn\u2019t get to choose her reality either. From now on, no one ever got to decide who Kinley Kohl was or what she would do. No one got to change that deeply held part of herself that kept trying to fill her heart, despite all the evidence that it wouldn\u2019t work. She refused to believe that she would end up alone.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about the fact that we\u2019re just isolated here in Alaska and they\u2019re horny? Or that they feel sorry for you?\u201d</p><p>Hurt flared again. It was time to leave. If Riley wanted to be mean, she needed to stay away from him. That woman had damaged him, and he didn\u2019t even want to recover.</p><p>But the question haunted her. Did Law feel sorry for her? When she thought about it...no. She\u2019d felt his caring. It might not be love, but Law felt something for her. It wasn\u2019t strictly pity or desire. And Dominic Anthony would never sleep with someone because he felt sorry for her.</p><p>Riley was glaring down at her, challenging. Some beast trapped under his skin wanted her to fight with him. He just kept poking at her, then pulling her back when she tried to walk away. He behaved like a kid who didn\u2019t know how to emerge from the dark corner he\u2019d put himself in.</p><p>Anger fled in a rush of sympathy. Riley had loved and lost, and he didn\u2019t know how to find his way back. It was sad, and railing at him wouldn\u2019t help.</p><p>His deep disconnect would likely cost her everything, but again, she wouldn\u2019t allow that to change who she\u2019d become or what she believed.</p><p>Kinley didn\u2019t hesitate. She simply stepped closer and wrapped her arms around him, resting her cheek on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He tensed around her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffering you what Simone didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t deserve the three of you. I know you miss her, but you need to let her go and find someone who will love you. The three of you deserve a woman who will stand at your side and proudly be wife to you all. Don\u2019t compromise or settle, Riley. This is your forever. You have to fight for it. I just learned that. Don\u2019t let anyone take it away from you.\u201d</p><p>Riley blinked at her in silence, his expression incredulous.</p><p>She eased back enough to look into his eyes. \u201cFind someone who makes all of you happy. I know I\u2019m not her because you\u2019re not interested in me, and when the time comes, I\u2019ll step away quietly. Just let me have a few days with them. Let me know what it means to have a lover. By the time we have to return to the real world, I know it will fall apart, but can\u2019t you and I be kind to one another until then?\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up, shoving himself out of her embrace. \u201cWhat are you doing? I\u2019ve been horrible to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being true to myself. You\u2019re hurting, and I\u2019m not the kind of person to ignore that. So I\u2019m offering you comfort.\u201d</p><p>She slid against him, her eyes downcast because she didn\u2019t think she could stand to see censure in his stare. To her shock, when she pressed closer to him, she discovered that his cock was stone hard.</p><p>A little voice inside her prodded her. If Dominic and Law were interested in dominating a woman and they usually all took her to bed together...maybe Riley wanted some control, too. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Suddenly, he wrapped one arm around her, yanking her against him in a tight embrace. The other hand wound through her hair, his fist closing around the strands. When he tugged and forced her to meet his stare, she hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re insane, Kinley. It won\u2019t work. It can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She could feel his heart pounding against her, his cock hardening even more against her belly.</p><p>Her heart rate tripled as she met his gaze with beseeching eyes. \u201cIt can. Don\u2019t give up. The right woman, one you all can love, is out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if that woman couldn\u2019t possibly love me? What if I\u2019m the one who fucks everything up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Just believe and give her a chance.\u201d She wanted to be that woman so badly. Her whole body was softening for him.</p><p>Riley said nothing for what seemed like an eternity. He just stared into her face, as if trying to read her heart and mind. The tension drew tight, thick. Her belly coiled up. Excitement throbbed inside her body. \u201cWill she give me a chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s smart, she will.\u201d Kinley forced herself to close her eyes. He didn\u2019t mean her, and she needed to extricate herself from his embrace and step away or she was going to make a fool of herself.</p><p>He swallowed thickly. \u201cGive me a chance, Kinley.\u201d</p><p>His mouth descended toward hers.</p><p>Time seemed to stop just for a moment as Riley covered Kinley\u2019s lips with his and kissed her for the first time. It would probably end badly. He\u2019d avoided the pull between them for as long as he could, but now he felt utterly helpless. He\u2019d completely lost his resistance the moment she\u2019d wrapped her arms around him and called him Sir.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t possibly know what that did to him, the place that sent him to. Dominic might have introduced Law to that world first, but Riley had come to crave it. As a kid, everything had happened to him. He\u2019d had no say for so much of his life that being in control now was paramount. He could cede some decisions to his brother and Dominic, but he needed to feel like he was in charge of his own destiny.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t liked the truths Kinley had pointed out.</p><p>Need raged inside him. He had to take charge of it. Of her. Conquer this desire so it didn\u2019t control him for another second.</p><p>Riley crushed his mouth against hers, his cock twitching the minute she softened underneath him, accepting him.</p><p>He\u2019d been awake all fucking night, studying her. He\u2019d read articles about her, watched the newscasts about her kidnapping, stared at pictures of her\u2014anything to get his mind off the fact that she was in a bedroom with his brothers, making love.</p> <p>When she\u2019d walked in, he\u2019d used all his restraint to keep himself from hauling her into his arms and taking his fair share. He\u2019d tried to anger her, scare her away, but she\u2019d seen right through the smoke screen, through to the core of him. Instead, she\u2019d given him compassion.</p><p>How the fuck was he supposed to resist that?</p><p>He cupped her lush breasts. Damn, he loved these. She tried to hide them away in punishing bras held up by metal wires. Even so, they were achingly soft and weighty in his palms. Though she wore a cotton T-shirt, he couldn\u2019t escape how warm and luscious she felt through the fabric, how her feminine curves moved against him.</p><p>Riley delved beneath her shirt, desperate to get his hands on bare flesh. Now that she was in his arms, he couldn\u2019t make himself stop.</p><p>He found her breasts, palming them in turn as he crowded her against the kitchen table, plunging his tongue deep inside her mouth. Her nipples were hard little pebbles against his hands and her skin so damn soft that he groaned.</p><p>Kinley wasn\u2019t turning him away. In fact, she clutched him, filtering her fingers through his damp hair like she still wanted him. Like he still had a chance. Right now, he didn\u2019t even want to question whether he wanted that chance. It didn\u2019t matter. He just wanted her.</p><p>He skimmed his hands around her to find the cheeks of her perfect, round ass and dragged her up against his cock. He rocked against her, loving the way she gasped into his mouth. His whole body pounded with arousal. He couldn\u2019t even remember the last time he\u2019d wanted a woman this way. But Kinley eclipsed everyone else in his memory. With Simone, there had been a desire for sex, a hope for something lasting\u2014nothing more. With Kinley, he felt a pulsing lust he couldn\u2019t deny. And a pang in his chest he couldn\u2019t ignore. Riley didn\u2019t even bother trying.</p><p>\u201cGet ready, sweetheart. I\u2019m going to lay you out on the kitchen table and fuck you. If it breaks under both of us, I\u2019ll just fuck you on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Kinley pulled back, her lips swollen from his kisses, her chest heaving. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He felt as if the floor dropped out from under him. She couldn\u2019t? Yeah. Not with him at least. What the hell had he been thinking?</p><p>Riley jerked out of her arms. The damn teapot started to whistle. She\u2019d come here for a sandwich, not to be fucked again. He\u2019d totally misinterpreted the situation and made a complete idiot of himself.</p><p>He forced himself not to look her way, to concentrate on the task at hand. As quickly as he could, he\u2019d get her something to eat, then retreat to his own room, masturbate, and wonder if he would ever be able to look her in the eyes again.</p><p>After pouring her tea into her mug, Riley ignored the cup she\u2019d prepped for him. He didn\u2019t need fucking tea. He needed a metric shit ton of Scotch.</p><p>Drawing in a shuddering breath, he steadied himself and turned. \u201cYour tea is...\u201d</p><p>Kinley knelt on the floor before him, minus the shirt she\u2019d been wearing. Her creamy skin was on full display. In the low light of the kitchen, she practically glowed, a pearl that shone in the night. Her honey hair flowed around her shoulders, and her eyes were steady on him. \u201cI don\u2019t want the tea. I want you, but I\u2019m too sore for sex on the table. Your brothers really did a number on my, uhm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPussy?\u201d The word slipped out without thought. In fact, all he could think of was her, naked, luminous, and presenting herself to him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She blushed. \u201cI need a day or so before I take you there.\u201d She glanced at his fly, then licked her lips nervously. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this, but I want you to be my first.\u201d</p><p>Riley damn near dropped her cup. He had to steady his hands and put it down. Was she saying what he hoped? He didn\u2019t want to assume and make an ass out of himself again. Time to be smooth, romantic. \u201cAre you talking about a blow job?\u201d</p><p>Really fucking smooth, moron.</p><p>Her luscious lips curled up. \u201cI believe that\u2019s what people call it. I might not have a ton of experience, but I know the words, Riley. Blow job. Fellatio. Hummer. I want to take you in my mouth and swallow you down.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, his cock got so hard it hurt. \u201cKinley, you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p><p>God, he hadn\u2019t meant that\u2014at all. Actually, he hadn\u2019t meant a damn word he\u2019d said all night. \u201cYes! I want you to. I want you to so bad I just might die if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed slightly, then bit her lip uncertainly. \u201cI might not be good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can teach you.\u201d The idea that she\u2019d never had a cock in her mouth made his spine tingle. His brothers might have had her first, but they hadn\u2019t taken everything. This first of hers would be for him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be good at it, Kinley. You\u2019re good at everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just spent all night really studying her. \u201cYou are. When you want to do something, you do it. You feed and clothe the homeless. You\u2019ve made my brothers smile. You arouse the hell out of me.\u201d He moved closer. \u201cI want you to take my cock out.\u201d</p><p>Kinley blinked up at him, then her hands fluttered to the waistband of his jeans, those perfectly manicured fingers working on the button of his fly. She was awkward at first, but her earnestness was so sweet. Nothing about her was artificial. Every bit of apprehension and desire to please she felt was written all over her face.</p><p>So was her submission. She was offering him something that always aroused him, and not just physically. Something about watching a woman take him in her mouth brought out all of his dominant instincts. And with Kinley, he wanted nothing more than to tangle his fingers in her hair and feed her the hard length of his dick, inch by inch, and claim this part of her.</p><p>Slowly\u2014so slowly he thought he would scream\u2014Kinley unfastened the button and started to ease down the zipper. His cock pressed against his boxers as if trying to get closer to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing underwear,\u201d Kinley said with a little frown. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to wear underwear. I don\u2019t think you should either.\u201d</p><p>Little sub thought she got to make the rules? \u201cYou don\u2019t know it yet, but if you keep talking that way, there will be spankings in your future.\u201d</p><p>How would she handle a true spanking? The thought of her naked body over his lap made his groin tighten again. Jesus, so much of the blood in his body had rushed south that he felt dizzy.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose and sent him a saucy stare as she pulled his boxers down his hips. \u201cI can handle it. Law gave me a couple of swats earlier because I forgot to call Dominic \u2018Sir.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Dominic was insistent on protocol, but that wasn\u2019t Riley\u2019s thing. \u201cI like to hear my name, Kinley. And I won\u2019t just give you a couple of swats to make your ass blush. I know this will surprise you, but Law is the soft one when it comes to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me. He\u2019s very sweet.\u201d</p><p>Sweet? Law had killed more men than she could imagine. He\u2019d done it in service to his country, but... \u201cHas he talked to you about his military service? If not, you should know that he\u2019s only soft with you. Law is a trained killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested. \u201cHe\u2019s a trained protector.\u201d She pulled his boxers down and wrapped her fingers around his cock\u2014finally. The softness of her touch nearly undid him.</p><p>And he kind of loved that she saw them through different eyes. In fact, he liked being with her, just talking to her when no walls stood between them. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, sweetheart. Maybe we should all take a second look at how we view the world, but you should understand that I\u2019m more like Dominic than Law when it comes to sex. I\u2019ll get you over my knee. I won\u2019t let you up until you beg me to stop. Even then, I\u2019ll make you come before you\u2019re allowed to leave. You\u2019ll feel my hand on your ass all the next day. Just like you\u2019ll feel my cock in your pussy.\u201d</p><p>Eventually, yes. But for tonight, he would be satisfied with her mouth. And with being the man who taught her.</p><p>Her face had flushed, a sure sign that his words had either embarrassed or aroused her. Given the fact that she was still there and still staring at him with wide brown eyes, he was banking on the latter. But he had to be sure. \u201cTouch yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flared with surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself, Kinley. Drag those fingers down to your pussy and touch yourself. Play with your clit until I tell you to stop. I want to watch you.\u201d She was so prim and proper, and Riley couldn\u2019t wait to strip that veneer right off her and get to the woman under the surface. \u201cOr I could show you my version of a spanking.\u201d</p><p>He was okay either way. In the end, she would do what he wanted because she wouldn\u2019t be able to help herself any more than he could. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was tentative at first, the tiniest bit awkward as she slid her hand down her body until her fingers found her clit. He stroked his cock as he watched her, running his hand from base to tip. She trained her stare on him as she touched herself, and his blood surged.</p><p>\u201cLike this, Riley?\u201d</p><p>A wave of approval surged over him. This was where he felt most comfortable. \u201cExactly like that, sweetheart. Rub your clit, then slide your fingers into your opening.\u201d</p><p>Her breath shuddered as she found her sweet spot, and he loved that she was a very obedient girl. After two strokes of her clit, she slid her fingers deep. When she withdrew them, the digits were coated in her cream.</p><p>She wanted him. His harsh words hadn\u2019t scared her off. And she wasn\u2019t doing this out of pity or because Law and Dominic had told her to.</p><p>He snagged her wrist in his grasp and pulled it to his lips. The sweet scent of her arousal flooded his nostrils. Kinley was creamy and ripe. He might not be able to feel that pussy around his cock tonight, but he sure as hell could learn her taste.</p><p>He sucked her fingers inside his mouth, reveling in her essence. Tangy and sweet and so very Kinley. He licked every ounce off and still wanted more.</p><p>\u201cWhy does watching you do that excite me?\u201d Kinley\u2019s eyes were hot with desire. \u201cIt was the same when Law did it and when Dominic...\u201d</p><p>He could guess what Dominic had done. \u201cDid Dominic shove his face in your pussy and not leave until he\u2019d had his fill?\u201d</p><p>There was that gorgeous blush again. He adored making her color rise. \u201cHe kissed me there. At first, I thought it should make me uncomfortable, but then I just loved it. It\u2019s more than the sheer pleasure. There\u2019s something very intimate about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lover likes the way you taste, Kinley.\u201d He touched her chin and moved closer, his cock almost against her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be. Your lover should want to eat you up twice a day and three times every night. I\u2019m going to tongue you and love you and make a meal out of you when I can. But I need you right now.\u201d</p><p>She stared at his dick, then leaned closer, her hot breath on him. Then she swiped at his cock with her tongue, licking it up and tasting him. On a little moan, she closed her eyes as though she was cataloguing the sensations and flavors. \u201cYou\u2019re salty and rich. I like the way you taste.\u201d</p><p>And she had no idea what such innocent words did to him. His lovers in the past had all just talked dirty and told him what they would do to him. Not a one had just looked at him and told him they liked him\u2014his body, his taste. They hadn\u2019t really cared about him or his happiness.</p><p>He was in deep and saw no path out. He wasn\u2019t even sure he wanted to find one. Regardless of what Dominic and Law thought, chances were high she would walk away in the end. Or he would be forced to leave her for her own good. Kinley might try to stay, despite all the bad things that would come to her for loving them. He might well have to protect her in the end.</p><p>But they had tonight and perhaps a few more after that. Maybe it made him a greedy son of a bitch, but he was going to take them.</p><p>\u201cLet me give you more. Run your tongue all over me.\u201d He held his cock out, but soon her hand replaced his.</p><p>She explored him, her tongue like a darting hummingbird lighting him up everywhere she licked. She paid special attention to the sensitive V at the back of his shaft, and his eyes nearly rolled into the back of his head as she worked that spot over and over.</p><p>\u201cGod, sweetheart, you\u2019re a natural.\u201d She didn\u2019t need anyone to tell her what to do.</p><p>\u201cSince you gave me permission to explore, I wanted to taste and know all of you.\u201d She sucked the head of his cock into her mouth, heat surrounding him.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart. That feels good. So good.\u201d He closed his eyes and shoved his hands into her hair. \u201cTake more.\u201d</p><p>She obliged, enveloping his cock in her hot mouth. Her tongue whirled around, a tease, a taunt. Then she sucked hard on him, thickening the sensations, drawing out the anticipation. He could feel his cock pulsing in time with his rapid heartbeat as she sucked him deep.</p><p>Over and over she worked his hard flesh, drawing on him, taking him fully into her mouth. She worked tirelessly as she moved herself up and down, taking a little more each time, her whole body swaying with effort.</p><p>She reached up and caressed his thighs through the denim of his jeans. Slowly, he felt her fingers journey up until she found flesh. As she sucked his cock, she cupped his hips and ran her palms over his abs, a lover\u2019s tribute, a silent expression of her desire. Finally, she caressed her way down to the base of his shaft and held him there as she raked his cock with the gentle edge of her teeth.</p> <p>He looked down to find her cupping his balls with her free hand. All her shyness seemed to have evaporated the minute he\u2019d given her permission to play with him, as though she\u2019d just been waiting for the opportunity to indulge.</p><p>She rolled his balls in the palm of her hand, eliciting a deep groan from Riley. He was going to lose his fucking mind.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t last long if you do that, sweetheart. Are you sure?\u201d He didn\u2019t want to flood her mouth if she wasn\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>She hummed around his cock, the vibration charging through his veins and making him shake. She\u2019d worked him all the way in, almost to the base of his dick and now played with his balls. Holy hell, he could feel the back of her throat. Her tongue coated him, a consistent caress that drove him up, higher and higher.</p><p>Until Riley gave in.</p><p>\u201cSwallow me.\u201d He growled the command as the orgasm took him, ecstasy pulsing deep inside him as the head of his cock exploded, spewing into her lovely, waiting mouth.</p><p>And she took every drop, swallowing all he had to give her. As her head bobbed over him, she licked him, laving up one side, then down the other, not leaving a drop behind.</p><p>Riley was floored by how giving she\u2019d been, how open and honest. He smoothed her hair back as he withdrew slowly from her mouth. He drew her up to her feet, then dragged her against him until he could kiss her. He didn\u2019t give a shit that his jeans had fallen down around his knees. He just knew he wanted his mouth on hers, his arms around her body.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart. That was incredible.\u201d He\u2019d never thanked a lover before. He\u2019d bought them flowers, trinkets, but never just appreciated the gift they\u2019d given him. He\u2019d never thought of it that way until now.</p><p>Kinley was different.</p><p>\u201cIt was okay?\u201d</p><p>He had to laugh because her fears were understandable but completely unfounded. Joy lit over him like a happiness sparking inside him. He held her close, not yet ready to let her go. \u201cIt was the best. And I\u2019m not just saying that to make you feel better. I\u2019ve never felt anyone\u2019s desire to please the way I felt yours.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, fusing their mouths together, tasting the intimacy between them. For now, it was enough. Of course he wanted to get deep inside her. Tomorrow he would. Then he would revel in her and take mental pictures that would never fade, even after she was long gone. That way, he\u2019d have something to hold back all the darkness that would encroach when everything fell apart. He wanted his memory to be full of her, like a computer that had been filled to capacity. He wanted to be full of her until he couldn\u2019t put anything else in. Like her tablet, even. Its memory had been full, as well. He\u2019d noticed that when he\u2019d disabled her Internet capabilities.</p><p>And it had bugged him.</p><p>\u201cHow many gigabytes of memory does your tablet come with?\u201d An idea played in his brain. Riley began to suspect that what Jansen wanted from Kinley\u2019s luggage was tied to that tablet, and he doubted it was because the douche was dying to read the latest romance.</p><p>But he might want the photographs. Kinley had hundreds of pictures on her device. If he was right, the pictures would take up the majority of the storage capacity\u2014though they shouldn\u2019t. That tablet had been designed to hold thousands of pictures. Yet it was oddly full.</p><p>Kinley looked up, met his stare. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, sweetheart. I need to look at your tablet again. I need it now.\u201d He kissed her again, trying to soften the quick jump in subject. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Sometimes my brain has to think about things for a little while and I need something to jar me before I figure out a puzzle. Or maybe I just need the best hummer of all time to make me a genius.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBut I think I figured out what Jansen is desperately trying to get his hands on. Wake up Dominic and Law, then bring me that tablet.\u201d</p><p>She reached down and grabbed the shirt.</p><p>Riley snatched it away. \u201cYou don\u2019t need clothes to wake them up.\u201d</p><p>Her face contorted in the sweetest little frown. \u201cI thought we were switching to business mode.\u201d</p><p>She was under some mistaken impressions. \u201cBusiness mode does not mean clothes for you, sweetheart.\u201d He grabbed the shirt. \u201cI think better when you\u2019re naked. Look at what playing around did. Hell, if you\u2019re naked all the time, I might solve world hunger.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cSolve mine, at least. I\u2019ll do everything you ask if you just finish making that sandwich. I\u2019ll be back, but I can\u2019t say I won\u2019t be dressed. It\u2019s Alaska. If you want me walking around in my birthday suit, next time kidnap me and take me to Hawaii.\u201d</p><p>She turned away, and he watched the hottest ass on earth sway out of the room. His cock leapt right back to attention, but he tucked himself into his jeans because he had a job to do.</p><p>As she turned down the hall, it hit him that if he was right, though his time with her had just started, it was almost over. He would have to go back to the real world. And he would lose her there.</p><p>Sometimes it wasn\u2019t so great to be smart.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Law looked down at the tablet. There was a perfectly sweet photograph of Kinley and Annabelle. They were standing in a gazebo, each smiling and holding wine glasses together as if toasting one other. Kinley was in a yellow sundress, and Law couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her.</p><p>How was this photograph on Kinley\u2019s tablet the key to nailing Jansen?</p><p>\u201cWho took this, sweetheart?\u201d Riley asked her.</p><p>Law looked between the two of them and wanted to ask some questions of his own. When Kinley had come into the bedroom to wake him, she\u2019d been completely naked. He\u2019d reached for her, intent on drawing her back to bed, but she\u2019d explained that Riley wanted to talk to them because his righteously geeky brother had figured out some computer stuff.</p><p>He was pretty damn sure she hadn\u2019t gotten dressed, talked to Riley, and then taken off her clothes just to wake them up. His brother might like technology, but he also liked their women naked. Something had happened between Riley and Kinley, and Law wanted to celebrate.</p><p>But now he had to deal with a bunch of techno crap he didn\u2019t really understand.</p><p>On the bright side, Kinley was naked. His brother had totally called that right.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure I shouldn\u2019t wear a robe or something?\u201d Kinley asked, crossing her arms over her breasts.</p><p>Dominic sat at the kitchen table, crossing one leg over the other as he looked at her with approval. He, like Law, had put on a pair of sweatpants. \u201cYou don\u2019t need clothes. I turned the heater up. If you need someone to warm you, you\u2019re welcome to sit on my lap while Riley gives us his very likely to be long and technological explanation. It will be boring. We need something to liven up the discussion. Your breasts will do nicely.\u201d</p><p>A surprised little grin brightened her face. \u201cThose will enliven the discussion?\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes. \u201cBaby, your everything livens up the discussion. Now answer Riley and stop hiding your breasts. When you put your hands over them, we just look at your pussy and that fabulous ass of yours.\u201d</p><p>Kinley gave an embarrassed laugh and rolled her gorgeous brown eyes. But it worked. She visibly relaxed as she leaned over and glanced at the picture on the tablet. \u201cGreg took that one. What\u2019s evil about that picture?\u201d She frowned. \u201cHuh. I don\u2019t remember adding that one, actually. Can you scroll through them all? I didn\u2019t load this tablet.\u201d</p><p>Riley gave her a little \u201cgotcha\u201d smile. \u201cJansen did, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt was a gift from him. I\u2019m kind of technologically idiotic. I can use my phone to make calls and text, but other than that, I\u2019m lost. Greg bought my phone, too. Do you think my emoticons are evil?\u201d</p><p>Law stifled a laugh. When he\u2019d been California Mike, Kinley had texted him many times. She ended every single message with a flurry of smiley faces and thumbs-up symbols. He\u2019d kept every single one.</p><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s a readily available app, your emoticons should be safe. So Jansen loaded the photos?\u201d Riley asked.</p><p>\u201cHe loaded everything. I gave him a list of the books I wanted. After I\u2019d read those, I figured out how to buy more, but the last time I tried, the device gave me a message that I didn\u2019t have room, so I had someone in my office teach me how to archive my books. Do I have a virus?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Law sent his brother a long look. He had a feeling Riley was on the right track. He wasn\u2019t the technophile Riley was, but even he knew that it was damn hard to fill up a tablet with nothing but forty books, a couple of games, and some photos. There should be tons of space left. She didn\u2019t have any video on the system to eat up her memory. No audio, either.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a virus, but you do have a rat fink bastard,\u201d Law growled. He hated Jansen more and more every single minute.</p><p>Riley nodded at him, then turned to Kinley, reaching out for her. She took his hand, and he tugged lightly, pulling her into his lap.</p><p>Yeah, something had definitely happened. Kinley seemed awfully comfortable naked in Riley\u2019s lap, and he wrapped his arms around their bare bundle of femininity with an air of familiarity. Law might not have to worry about losing his brother after all.</p> <p>He glanced over at Dominic, who looked both as surprised and pleased as he was.</p><p>\u201cPet, you amaze me.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>Dominic nodded at her perched on Riley\u2019s lap. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Kinley blushed, and Riley utterly ignored him, though he tightened his arm around Kinley\u2019s waist, pulling her closer.</p> <p>Then Riley was all business again, pointing at the screen with his free hand. \u201cIt\u2019s all about these photographs. Everything we need is in here. It\u2019s called steganography.\u201d</p><p>Kinley frowned. \u201cLike stegosaurus?\u201d</p><p>Dominic shook his head, his affection for Kinley visible. \u201cNo, pet, it\u2019s not a dinosaur. Quite the contrary, this is on the cutting edge of criminal practices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill that fucker,\u201d Law snarled.</p><p>Jansen was willing to let Kinley carry his fucking criminal banking information? He was going to die and slowly. Technology might be Riley\u2019s forte. Dominic might be the money behind their operation. But Law was the muscle, and that meant he got to kill Greg Jansen. He knew just how he\u2019d do it, too. He was going to eviscerate the son of a bitch, but not so much that he died immediately. Oh, no. He wanted to make sure Jansen suffered for a nice long time.</p><p>\u201cKilling aside,\u201d Riley interrupted Law\u2019s vivid fantasy, \u201csteganography is the act of hiding secret messages in seemingly innocent data. You see this picture as a whole, but the computer sees it as a series of data bytes. What criminals do is imbed their information in the very fabric of whatever they\u2019re corrupting. In this instance, Jansen is hiding his financials in these photos.\u201d</p> <p>Kinley frowned at Riley. \u201cAll I see is a picture.\u201d</p><p>Riley clicked a few keys and an entirely different screen came up. \u201cThat\u2019s because you have to know how to extract the code. And there it is.\u201d</p><p>Kinley gasped. \u201cThat looks like an accounting report. Like one of my accounting reports.\u201d</p><p>Dominic cursed. \u201cWell, now we know where he put the second set of books to Kinley\u2019s charity. What does it say, Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Hope House is doing just fine. He\u2019s had a mole in your organization for about a year as far as I can tell. He\u2019s the one who made you think your charity was going under. You have an employee named Fred Buck who sent through these records.\u201d Riley scrolled through the files with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cYes. He was in charge of my donations. Are you saying I have more than I thought I had?\u201d Kinley put a hand to her mouth. \u201cI feel so stupid.\u201d</p><p>Law reached for her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t stupid. Baby, they played you. You couldn\u2019t have known. He sent this guy in before you had even met him. He selected you as his target, and you didn\u2019t have a chance. I bet Jansen swept you off your feet, then arranged one distraction after another from the charity.\u201d</p><p>He knew how Jansen worked. He\u2019d seen a ploy like that before. The last thing he wanted was for Kinley to beat herself up with guilt.</p> <p>\u201cHe absolutely swept me off my feet. Two days after I met him, he took me on a date to Paris. We spent a week there. In separate rooms, but I\u2019d never been. I\u2019d never taken the time before. It was so different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew how to dazzle you,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cI understand that Alaska isn\u2019t Paris, but we brought you with us for the right reasons. I want you to think about that when the tabloids start gossiping about us.\u201d</p><p>Law followed Dominic\u2019s line of thinking, and he was in complete agreement. \u201cYes. We didn\u2019t play you properly at all.\u201d</p><p>Kinley smiled slightly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. You took off your shirts.\u201d</p><p>Dominic and Riley laughed.</p><p>Law couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of losing her now. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that we\u2019ve been real with you because what we wanted from you in return is real.\u201d</p><p>Panic had flooded his system when Riley had shown him the crap Jansen had put on her computer. Everyone else had seemed happy to find some concrete evidence, but Law had known it was the beginning of the end. He\u2019d thought he would have more time with her. He\u2019d thought he could take a week or two to bind her to them, so that when Jansen was behind bars, she\u2019d stay.</p><p>Now... Well, fuck. He didn\u2019t see how it was going to work.</p><p>She leaned over the table, her breasts swaying enticingly. She reached out and cupped his face. \u201cIs it real? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s real anymore. I thought those were just harmless pictures. Now I have to question every one of them. Everything. Annabelle tried to tell me, didn\u2019t she? I was stubborn, and I didn\u2019t want to listen.\u201d</p><p>Law knew that story. \u201cShe tried to explain her suspicions about him to you, and you nearly walked out on her. She was terrified of losing you.\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in Kinley\u2019s eyes. \u201cI was afraid of everything and everyone falling apart around me. She sent you to save me, didn\u2019t she? I know it sounds dumb, but if I can keep Annabelle, I think I might be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, she loves you. And we approached her. She wanted us to talk to you, but we couldn\u2019t tell how you would react. If we had, and you\u2019d confronted Greg... We were worried for you. And given that you\u2019d been a bit upset when Annabelle tried to talk to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a raging bitch,\u201d Kinley acknowledged. \u201cBut I felt wretched for marrying a man I didn\u2019t love and didn\u2019t want to admit it because I thought I didn\u2019t have a choice. I thought my family would collapse if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven all that, we decided to take a \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 approach,\u201d Law explained.</p><p>\u201cUntil Jansen took out that policy on you two weeks before your wedding,\u201d Dominic continued. \u201cThen all bets were off. We couldn\u2019t allow you to marry him and we didn\u2019t exactly have the proof we needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a desperation play.\u201d Riley admitted, cuddling her against him and stroking her hair. \u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t think Law would let your marriage to Jansen happen. When we decided to kidnap you, he practically did his happy dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dance,\u201d Law retorted. \u201cBut I was happy. Kinley, I know the way we saved you was unorthodox, but we really were thinking of you. I truly believe he planned to kill you on your honeymoon. And I think that tablet proves it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was using me to take his information to his contact?\u201d Kinley frowned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my guess.\u201d Riley tapped on a few more keys. \u201cAnd it looks like he\u2019s using your charity to smuggle something into the country. I can\u2019t tell what. It\u2019s in a numeric code. Stock 2445. That\u2019s all the description I\u2019ve got. Damn, that is some expensive shit if I\u2019m reading this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what is it?\u201d Kinley looked totally puzzled.</p><p>\u201cIt could be anything,\u201d Dominic explained. \u201cIt could be cash, bonds, drugs...anything, but he\u2019s moving it through your charity. I suspect it has something to do with the new manufacturers he found for you. They\u2019re shipping him something in those boxes. Not a lot of people look through charity donation shipments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard.\u201d Kinley looked ready to spit nails.</p><p>Riley soothed her with a caress. \u201cWe\u2019re getting closer to nailing him. This strongly suggests that he\u2019s using your U.S. based nonprofit to move funds offshore so the mafia can use it for their purposes. I think this is what we\u2019ve been looking for so we can get him on RICO charges. A forensic accountant should be able to take him down.\u201d</p><p>Dominic sighed. \u201cI would love to know what kind of product he\u2019s moving. Please let it be drugs.\u201d</p><p>Because that might up the time the fucker spent in the can. Except Law wanted to make sure Jansen never saw the inside of a jail cell. A morgue was a better place for scum like him. \u201cLet\u2019s see what the feds say. We can call them in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Dominic nodded and turned to Kinley. \u201cWe have some inside contacts at the FBI and the Department of Justice. We\u2019ll get them out here. I\u2019m hesitant to send them the information. I would rather talk to them in person. Explain.\u201d</p><p>Kinley reached for Dominic\u2019s hand. Already she was looking to them for comfort, seeking out her men. He just hoped her burgeoning trust was enough to make her stay after the dust settled.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we go to Washington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere I can\u2019t control the meeting? Where Jansen has hired scumbags who might try to pick us off and take you back?\u201d Law asked. \u201cNot on your life\u2014and that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake. No. The feds will come here and look over the evidence. We\u2019ll call our lawyers in the morning and set up a meeting. Until then, we stay put.\u201d</p><p>And after everything had gone down? Law didn\u2019t know. There would be a ton of questions, of course. From reporters, from the feds, from freaking society. It would come at them from all sides. They would be tested.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure they were strong enough yet.</p><p>Could he handle it if Kinley walked away?</p><p>He needed more time to bind her to all three of them, to make her understand exactly what they could offer her.</p><p>But time had just run out.</p><p>\u201cDid you make the call?\u201d</p><p>Dominic turned to Riley, who had just asked the question. Sunlight filtered into the office, showing off the deep, rich hues of the mahogany and leather furnishings. \u201cYes. I talked to Kellan. He and Eric will call their contact at the DOJ. Someone from the FBI will call us soon about arranging a meeting. It could take a day or two before anyone can get here. Kinley signed an affidavit for the feds stating that she was never a hostage. Kellan is making sure the FBI sees that before he proceeds. Hopefully, that will keep them from arresting us.\u201d</p><p>Kinley was sitting on top of the large desk and had been for some time. She stared over her shoulder at one of the computers Riley was working on, her hand on his shoulder as he typed. It seemed she always had a hand on one of them now. She was an affectionate woman, showing her caring with frequent hugs and handholding. She\u2019d curled against them most of the night. Dominic smiled fondly at the memory of her in his lap this morning, eating breakfast from his plate.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that will satisfy the feds?\u201d Kinley asked, straightening to look at him.</p><p>Law left his place on the couch and walked to her. \u201cI don\u2019t know, baby. I suppose they could assume that we forced you to sign it, but I\u2019m counting on Kellan to smooth it all over. There\u2019s no way to know until we actually meet with the FBI.\u201d</p><p>Dominic hoped it was enough. He\u2019d been playing through the scenarios and he didn\u2019t like a few of them.</p><p>\u201cBut all that information was on my tablet. How can I prove Greg loaded it on there?\u201d Kinley asked, neatly summing up at least one of the ways they could get fucked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on that.\u201d Riley looked up briefly from his place behind the massive desk that dominated the room. He\u2019d spent most of the morning with computers around him, all cluttering the top of the desk. \u201cThankfully, the last two of these photos were sent in e-mail. I\u2019m almost sure I can trace them straight back to Jansen\u2019s computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got busy with the wedding. He insisted that he needed to update the tablet\u2019s software before we went on our honeymoon, but I couldn\u2019t find the time to figure out how since I\u2019d never done it. But I didn\u2019t give him the tablet to update until the last minute. Maybe that\u2019s why he had to e-mail them,\u201d Kinley explained.</p><p>\u201cWhatever the reason, he got caught in his own trap.\u201d Riley never looked up. \u201cHe tried to keep you so busy with the wedding that you couldn\u2019t see straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding planner had me on this crazy schedule.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cDamn it. I\u2019m an idiot. The wedding planner was in on it, too. Greg insisted we use her. Becks said she was the best. Becks was in charge of the charity for most of the last couple of months because I was dealing with wedding details. I just walked right into their trap, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Law wrapped an arm around her. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. Jansen is very good at what he does. And he had a lot of help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She frowned. \u201cAnd I turned into a bridezilla who wouldn\u2019t even listen when my best friend tried to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to get spanked for that,\u201d Dominic said.</p><p>\u201cAnnabelle? Why on earth would you spank her?\u201d Kinley asked. \u201cShe meant well. Besides, I don\u2019t think Eric, Kellan, and Tate would like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Annabelle I\u2019m planning to spank. But to your point, we went to visit her on the job because we thought her help would be valuable. Having lawyers on our side was a perk, too. You wouldn\u2019t believe what those three put us through before we were even allowed to sit down and talk to Annabelle.\u201d Dominic shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just go straight to her?\u201d</p><p>Law scowled. \u201cBecause we honor the rights of other Doms, and it was obvious they\u2019re planning to stake their claim on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoms?\u201d</p><p>Riley finally looked up. \u201cDominants. BDSM. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBS what?\u201d Kinley asked, wearing a look of pure confusion on her face.</p> <p>Dominic raised a dark brow, almost amused. \u201cI thought you read romances. Doesn\u2019t every female walking the face of the earth have a deeply romantic vision of BDSM by now? It\u2019s a catch-all term for bondage, dominance, submission, and masochism. It\u2019s what we started teaching you yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the submissive. And you three are the Dominants. And Annabelle is a submissive, too? Does she know that? Because I think she would have told me. I know she would have told me if she had three Doms. She tells me everything. She called the other day to let me know she was out of sugar. I was three states over so there was nothing I could do, but she told me anyway. She would have mentioned if there was some backside slapping going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, something\u2019s going on there,\u201d Law swore. \u201cThey haven\u2019t claimed her yet, but they\u2019re definitely watching over her. In our world, that means they have certain rights. One of those is the right to protect her. After we took you, they completely forbade her from doing or saying anything that might give the appearance that she was an accomplice. Annabelle was allowed to talk to us shortly after we arrived here only because she was beyond worried about you and about to lose her mind. Other than that, the lawyers made sure to leave everything to us. Her men don\u2019t know you well enough to trust that you wouldn\u2019t want a little revenge and throw Annabelle to the wolves if everything went bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend. God, she\u2019s just about the only person in my life I can trust now.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cAfter everything that\u2019s happened, she\u2019s my only family. I would never hurt her. And if those three lawyers think they can take all kinds of rights and stuff without giving her anything back, then they should know that I have a shotgun. I don\u2019t know how to use it, but I can take a class. In fact, I just might shoot my sister first. I\u2019ll need a little practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, there, warrior princess,\u201d Law said with a laugh. \u201cIf we do this right, your sister is going to jail. You\u2019re going to have to be satisfied with seeing her in an orange jumpsuit. Is your sister bisexual by any chance?\u201d</p><p>Kinley threw up her hands. \u201cI have no idea. I wouldn\u2019t put anything past her at this point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, she should think about shifting her orientation if she\u2019s not because I suspect she won\u2019t be lonely in prison.\u201d</p><p>Dominic watched Kinley, studying her. She looked so young and innocent without a hint of makeup on her face. She was wearing a light sweater and a pair of those blinged out jeans she\u2019d brought with her. She\u2019d obviously foregone the bra, and since Law had been supervising her all morning, Dominic assumed she\u2019d followed the no-underwear rule. Otherwise, they were going to spank her and hard because he had no notion how else to defuse the tension clogging the room.</p><p>The anxiety blended with the light hum of sexuality and hung over all of them. The hard truth was they would soon have to leave this place and reenter the real world\u2014where Kinley had a completely different life and they worked all over the globe. Dominic had no idea how\u2014or if\u2014their relationship could work, and he was pretty sure that neither Kinley nor Riley did, either. Law, he suspected, would tender his resignation before leaving her, but he wasn\u2019t thinking of the long term. Kinley was actually about to be out of money. Her charity\u2019s funds would be tied up in court for years most likely, and she would be involved in a whole lot of legalities. Law couldn\u2019t take care of her and all those expenses if he was working as a mall cop.</p><p>They had to convince her to come with them.</p><p>Starting now.</p><p>\u201cThe other day, you asked me for an exchange, pet. Are you still interested?\u201d</p><p>Kinley turned to him, frowning. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn exchange. You offered information for sexual knowledge. I want to teach you about our lifestyle and what it can offer you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the time, Dominic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything else to do while we wait on the feds, unless you want to watch Riley play with his keyboard all day.\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s middle finger shot up. \u201cI\u2019m doing more than playing with my keyboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Dominic conceded. \u201cTell me, what can you really accomplish by examining all these files now?\u201d</p><p>Riley groaned. \u201cNot as much as I\u2019d like. I need to get into Jansen\u2019s systems, but he\u2019s protected himself. They\u2019re shut down right now. I hope to fuck he\u2019s not destroying them as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do anything about that until the feds get back to us. So we need some way to occupy our time,\u201d Law drawled. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d</p><p>He thrust his hands in Kinley\u2019s hair and lowered his lips to her, kissing her hard. He winked at her as he came back up for air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can figure out what he was transporting with the information in front of me.\u201d Riley sounded really disappointed about that.</p><p>Dominic understood. \u201cBut we\u2019re not leaving here until we\u2019ve pieced everything together with the feds and we think the case is pretty tight. Until then, we\u2019re holed up, pet, and I can\u2019t think of anything I would rather do than take you up on your offer.\u201d</p><p>Law rubbed her arm, his whole body relaxing. \u201cYou gave us the information we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. Riley found it,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOn your tablet. So now it\u2019s our turn.\u201d Dominic had some very specific things he wanted to teach her. \u201cUnless you\u2019re still sore. If that\u2019s the case, we can simply talk for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Her voice was a soft, breathy tone. Instinctively, her gaze dropped to the floor. \u201cAre you a Dominant, Sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A smile played at his lips. Hearing her call him that would never get old.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a submissive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Law whispered in her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re the sweetest little sub I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>A grin curled her mouth up. \u201cSo I call you my Doms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, pet.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened until she looked as if she was trying to keep a straight face. \u201cYou\u2019re Dominic, the Dom.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYes, pet. I think I was aptly named.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Dom Dominic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile true, that\u2019s not exactly how you should phrase it.\u201d He frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Dom Dom.\u201d The smile zipped across her face. \u201cI get to call you Dom Dom.\u201d</p><p>Kinley burst out laughing. Law and Riley joined in.</p><p>Dominic was not about to spend the rest of his life being called Dom Dom. \u201cPet, every time you call me that, I\u2019ll give you twenty swats. They will not be for pleasure. You may call me Sir for now. If you accepted a collar from me, you would call me Master. I am your Dom. It\u2019s a status, not a title.\u201d</p><p>She pouted. \u201cBut Dom Dom is so much fun.\u201d</p><p>The girl was begging for it. \u201cSo is reddening your ass. Off with the clothes, pet. That\u2019s twenty over my knee.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Law, and Dominic couldn\u2019t miss the high-pitched squeaking sound as she wiggled that fabulous backside on the glass top of the desk. Everyone in the room winced at the noise.</p><p>\u201cHe has no sense of humor,\u201d Kinley complained.</p><p>Law shook his head. \u201cNot a lot, but I think this time he really just wants to smack your ass. Have I told you how good those jeans look on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a great sense of humor,\u201d Dominic insisted. \u201cBut I will not allow my submissive to call me Dom Dom, even if she does look like sex on two legs in those jeans. I confess, the fuzzy pink socks distract a bit from the vision.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose adorably, obviously happy with the compliments. \u201cIf you want bare feet, don\u2019t take me to Alaska.\u201d</p><p>Law moved between her legs, dragging those pink clad feet up around his waist as Kinley laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think the socks are easier on my back than a pair of stilettos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving my socks on when we\u2019re in bed.\u201d Kinley held on to Law for balance, looking breathless, flushed, and excited.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to bed, pet,\u201d Dominic explained.</p><p>\u201cBut I kind of thought by \u2018explaining,\u2019 you meant you were going to teach me some naughty bedroom things.\u201d She was blushing again and obviously hoping she was right.</p><p>\u201cThis relationship will not be relegated solely to the bedroom. Your first rule is that we will take you anywhere, anytime, and in any way we wish. I want to see you in the sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, ah, ah. Don\u2019t protest. There\u2019s no one out here, except perhaps the moose. And we\u2019ll protect you from him.\u201d</p><p>Riley chuckled. \u201cI can think of so many places to play with you, sweetheart. We\u2019re going to have fun walking you through a dungeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dungeon? Like a medieval torture chamber?\u201d</p><p>Law sent his brother a dirty look. \u201cNo, baby. It\u2019s not scary like that. A dungeon is just what we call a play space. We have a nice big one back home. It\u2019s got all kinds of toys. We have plenty here, too. The James brothers are...well, we know them from a private club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re all Dommy, too?\u201d</p><p>Law groaned. \u201cOh, baby, we\u2019re going to have to teach you a little respect. Hand over the sweater. I think Dominic\u2019s just about at the end of his rope after the Dom Dom crack. If he doesn\u2019t get you over his knee soon, he\u2019ll pull out the big guns. Delayed gratification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds horrible,\u201d she grumbled as she pulled the sweater over her head. \u201cWe have to work on his sense of humor. I hope Annabelle\u2019s men aren\u2019t so stuffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not think I have a sense of humor, but I assure you, I possess a fine sense of decorum, pet. I expect that what happens between us stays between us. There is a very big difference between Annabelle running out of sugar and you treating our relationship like fodder for the gossip rags.\u201d</p><p>Kinley stood naked from the waist up. Now, she didn\u2019t try to hide, but merely placed her hands on her hips and stared him down. She seemed more comfortable with her own body now than she had last night, and that pleased him immensely.</p><p>\u201cIf you think I am not going to talk to my very dearest friend in the world about the fact that I finally made love, you really don\u2019t understand women,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Dominic had to school his expression to something properly masterful because all he wanted to do was grin. She was utterly adorable. And fuckable. Though he would probably have to correct her sassy tone, he loved the fact that she felt safe enough to try using it with him. She wouldn\u2019t have two days ago. \u201cI would think women, especially a woman raised the way you were, would be a bit circumspect.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and looked to Law. \u201cDoes he watch TV? He has to know that if Annabelle was actually sleeping with those men\u2014which she isn\u2019t because I would know\u2014but if by some miracle she is, then we will be comparing notes, if you know what I mean. So if that\u2019s one of the rules, then you should just start spanking me now. This is the most interesting thing that has ever happened to me. All of my life, all I\u2019ve had to contribute to the conversation was things like, \u2018Hey, I got a great deal on a ton of used clothes and after I finish washing them, I\u2019m going to hand them out.\u2019 Once I get home, it\u2019s possible that everyone will just want to talk about how pathetic I am because my family and fianc\u00e9 wanted to kill me. So I will totally be switching topics to talk about my suddenly crazy sex life with three hot guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she has a point,\u201d Riley commented. He suddenly wasn\u2019t so interested in his computer. In fact, Dominic didn\u2019t think he could get his friend\u2019s stare off Kinley\u2019s breasts even with a crowbar. \u201cThough she\u2019s crazy if she thinks no one will talk about her sex life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kinley giggled. Dominic\u2019s hand started to itch.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what the tabloids write anymore. They\u2019ve never been kind, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll start now. And I didn\u2019t say I would talk to the press about what happens in freaky dungeons, just Annabelle. But I might lay it on thick with a couple of Becks\u2019s friends who have never been nice to me, the ones who used to say that I couldn\u2019t snag a man to save my life. Maybe the three of you could show up at the country club without your shirts on. That\u2019ll drop some jaws and make some ladies faint.\u201d Kinley grinned.</p><p>Riley had wrung his hands about Kinley accepting them? Dominic shook his head incredulously. Hell, she was ready to parade them around. And that wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>\u201cThe pants, pet,\u201d he barked.</p> <p>She unbuttoned the fly of her jeans and stood. Riley was right there to help her pull them down. He made sure to cup her every curve as he dragged them off her body.</p><p>\u201cI probably won\u2019t go back to the country club,\u201d she admitted as she pulled off her socks. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to afford it. I didn\u2019t like it, anyway. Maybe I\u2019ll just move to Chicago and live with Annabelle.\u201d</p><p>Not if he had anything to say about it. \u201cCome here. There will be time to decide all that later, but at first I think it\u2019s best if we either stay here for a while or hole up at my place. It\u2019s gated, and we\u2019ll want to keep the reporters out.\u201d</p><p>Kinley sent him a cautious stare. \u201cI thought you would just send me home.\u201d</p><p>Understandable assumption since they hadn\u2019t worked anything out yet, but she definitely wasn\u2019t going home or in any way leaving them. \u201cNo, pet. You still won\u2019t be safe. You\u2019ll need one of us with you at all times until Jansen is permanently in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Or dead.</p><p>\u201cI could hire a bodyguard.\u201d She frowned. \u201cMaybe I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can obey your Masters and everything will be fine. I know there\u2019s an awful lot to think about and discuss\u2014later. Now is for us. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Dominic didn\u2019t want her to worry. It would be easy for her to do, and she had every right, but he\u2019d rather have her here in the moment with all of them together...just in case their meeting with the feds didn\u2019t go as he hoped. He wanted to forge a bond that would be difficult to break.</p><p>She squirmed a bit, looking pensive. Then she relented. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Law, would you see if the James brothers have a few essentials in their playroom while I take care of our sub\u2019s discipline?\u201d</p> <p>Law hesitated for a moment then nodded decisively, as if he\u2019d just reached the same conclusions Dominic had. \u201cOn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she ready?\u201d Riley asked.</p><p>\u201cI just want to be equipped in case she is. And there\u2019s always prep work to be done. We might as well begin opening her to us in all ways now. Unless you were planning on taking turns forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to rush her,\u201d Riley argued.</p><p>Dominic disagreed. Riley had spent less time with Kinley, so he didn\u2019t know her capabilities yet. Hopefully, today would rectify that. It was vital that they all begin functioning as a unit\u2014as a family\u2014in case their tomorrow was put on hold by the feds, the press, her family...whomever.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait,\u201d Kinley protested. \u201cI\u2019ve waited all my life. I\u2019ve been careful, and the one time I did something crazy, well...that was the happiest night of my life. Too many things can happen, Riley. I want all my men.\u201d</p><p>Riley nodded and brushed a gentle kiss across her lips. Law beamed a proud smile her way, then strode out the door.</p><p>Dominic patted his lap. \u201cI think we\u2019re up to forty now, pet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForty? What the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recommend finishing that question unless you want sixty instead.\u201d He was going to love disciplining her.</p><p>Kinley shook her head mutely.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were a smart girl. Remember how fun you thought it was to call me Dom Dom? Well, now I get to show you my version of fun. Then we\u2019ll move on to the orgasm-denial portion of the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Kinley stifled the argument he saw on her face and practically jumped across his lap. They would have to work on her form, but he appreciated the enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019m ready, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you are. Riley, are you joining me? I suspect that despite your attempts to be standoffish, you\u2019ve already given in.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d looked too satisfied the night before, and it hadn\u2019t been merely because he\u2019d figured out Jansen\u2019s secrets. The other big clue had been the easy way Riley had been touching her.</p><p>\u201cI did, and let me tell you, she is a natural at oral.\u201d Riley sauntered over to Kinley and palmed the fleshiest part of her ass. \u201cBest blow job I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I get points for that?\u201d Kinley twisted around and asked Dominic hopefully.</p><p>Riley knew what to do. He brought his hand down on her ass with a sharp smack. \u201cYou get my eternal affection, but rules are rules, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Dominic agreed. \u201cIf anything scares you, Kinley, all you have to do is say stop.\u201d They would find a more appropriate safe word when they had adequate time to establish the dynamics between them, but for now he wanted her to know that any negative word would work.</p><p>\u201cWhat scares me is that Riley hits like a girl.\u201d</p><p>Dominic sucked in a sharp breath. Oh, god, he was in love with her.</p><p>And Riley was at least in lust. He smacked her ass with a stinging crack three more times. The sound pinged through the air, mingling with her little gasps.</p><p>She shuddered across his lap but didn\u2019t try to move off. \u201cThat was better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to top from the bottom,\u201d Riley said, shaking his head.</p><p>She would try. And he would allow it from time to time, when it suited him. But not today. \u201cThat was four. Where are we, Kinley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting antsy, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Her word for aroused. He liked it when she was antsy. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can move this along, then. I prefer aroused begging.\u201d</p><p>They took turns smacking her gorgeous ass, each carefully spreading out the slaps. Over and over, keeping careful count, they turned her backside pink and hot.</p><p>Kinley moaned and cried out. She flailed a bit, her legs moving restlessly, but made no move to get away. She strained for breath, her chest sawing up and down with effort. Her skin turned a delicious rosy red.</p><p>Dominic ran a hand down her heated backside. \u201cYou\u2019re doing quite well, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I like this?\u201d She wrapped her hands around his calf, holding on to him, her voice thick with both bewilderment and arousal.</p><p>How should he explain? He\u2019d never had to before, as they tended to play with experienced submissives.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you feel right now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPain. Excitement. A weird sense of pride. Pleasure. I don\u2019t know. It feels like...everything.\u201d</p><p>He bounced a glance up at Riley. \u201cAnd you were worried she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle our needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe really does like it.\u201d Riley sounded almost astounded as he knelt down to her. \u201cSweetheart, what you\u2019re feeling, besides arousal, is the connection between a Dom and a sub. You could get it with a lover in other ways, but this is how we find it. We play. We grow together. We share these parts of ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about honesty.\u201d Dominic ran his hands over her ass. \u201cI want to know how you feel. I want to know what you like and what you don\u2019t. So many people don\u2019t talk about their sex lives\u2014or anything else important. We\u2019re going to talk, pet. We\u2019re going to communicate often. We take this seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it to be serious,\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>\u201cGood to hear.\u201d They hadn\u2019t been quite so serious with any of their other subs, but everything was damn serious with her. Kinley was a woman who needed sex to mean something. He\u2019d enjoyed the women who didn\u2019t, but everything was different with her.</p><p>Law walked back in the room carrying a large leather case. He stopped and stared down at Kinley\u2019s ass. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>Dominic smiled with a deep satisfaction. She\u2019d been magnificent. \u201cForty. And she could take more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now,\u201d Kinley shouted. \u201cI need something else. Can someone touch my pussy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. She was so damn open. There wasn\u2019t a bit of artifice about her. She simply said what she meant and didn\u2019t embellish. Dominic repressed a grin but sent her a fond glance. Her honesty made him feel...safe, like she would always be exactly who she was with them. Riley, especially, should be relieved. No more nasty Simone-like surprises.</p><p>Though Kinley\u2019s ass was a beautiful flushed shade, he had a deep instinct to push her. Law\u2019s thumbs-up told him that he\u2019d brought all the instruments to further their intimacy. When Dominic tried to gesture back, he found Law\u2019s stare was glued to her ass.</p><p>\u201cPass me a plug and some lube,\u201d Dominic requested.</p><p>Kinley gave a little moan, a singular sign that he was in tune with her body and her wishes. Pleasure surged through him. Dominic realized how far gone he was for this woman.</p><p>She gave him pleasure by the simple act of agreeing with him. They were in sync. He could call himself the Dom, but he\u2019d spent his life looking for the woman who could move him and make him want to surrender his heart.</p><p>Kinley was that woman, and there wouldn\u2019t be another after her. He and Law were similar in that respect. He would love once, and it was brilliant kismet that he and Law loved the same female. She wasn\u2019t at all what he\u2019d imagined when he\u2019d thought of his ideal. She wasn\u2019t always easy to handle. She wasn\u2019t always controllable. Then again, she embraced Law, reassured Riley, and made him laugh. Who else would call him Dom Dom while pushing him to be a better man?</p><p>\u201cI have everything.\u201d Law dropped the bag on the desk and stood over Kinley\u2019s prone body. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s so rosy.\u201d He traced the line of her ass with gentle fingers.</p><p>Law was right, and Dominic wasn\u2019t sure how to keep her with them\u2014to bind her to them\u2014completely. He needed more time to draw her in. More time to bring them together.</p><p>But their time might end once the FBI arrived. They would likely separate them all and interrogate each of them while they studied the evidence. Once that was behind them\u2014and who knew how long it would take\u2014then the media circus would begin. Kinley might well want privacy and some time to herself. Here in Alaska, the concept of her father\u2019s betrayal and her sister\u2019s possible jail time were almost theoretical. But once home, she would be confronted with those realities. They would hit her hard. She might find trust difficult then. If she couldn\u2019t count on the people who shared her blood, how could he, Law, and Riley expect her to cleave to them after only a few days? Without reality pounding on their door, the rapport and sex had been relatively easy. But it wouldn\u2019t be long before all of that could change...</p><p>For the first time, Dominic hoped Jansen stayed out of jail long enough to win her trust, her love. Maybe if they proved how good they could all be together, she would stay.</p><p>\u201cTouch her pussy. Give her a taste.\u201d He was in charge now.</p><p>Law dropped to his knees, obviously willing to give her what she needed. He moved between her legs, shoving them wide and spreading her cheeks. \u201cWant me to prep her now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There was no reason to wait. They needed to move on her as quickly as they could. Kinley was an affectionate woman. The sooner they had taken her in every way possible, the sooner she would feel surrounded by their devotion. The sooner she would give them her heart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to prep her. It\u2019s time to take her,\u201d Dominic insisted. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Kinley stayed perfectly still as she tried to figure out exactly what Dominic meant by \u201cprepping her now.\u201d She was pretty sure it had something to do with her backside, because they\u2019d been paying special attention to that.</p><p>After her spanking, the cheeks of her ass were throbbing, and she kind of liked it. But that wasn\u2019t the only thing she enjoyed about being with them.</p><p>Connection. Riley had used that term, and Kinley understood immediately. She needed the connection that came from this kind of sex. They said it was serious, and she felt the gravity as they surrounded her and communicated with her through pleasure. Dominic had assured her that they would talk about sex precisely because it was important. Kinley was beginning to understand why.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Most likely, she would have been silent in the past and simply accepted whatever they gave her. Perversely, despite the fact that they intended to dominate her, Kinley wanted to know their plans because being the one to accept them would make her feel more powerful.</p><p>\u201cBluntly put, I\u2019m going to open your asshole up for our cocks,\u201d Dominic explained. He held up a small, oddly shaped piece of plastic. It was tapered at the end, then flared out to form a bulb that rounded into a graceful oval. There was a long flat piece at the end that seemed to be some kind of handle. \u201cI\u2019m going to take this plug that Law sterilized and sink it deep inside your ass. If it acquiesces, then we can take you now. If you have a stubborn little anus, it could take a week or two.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wanted them today, not later. A lot was happening very quickly, but she understood clearly that she might not have a week or two with them. She only hoped her body would cooperate with her wishes.</p><p>How did one convince their sphincter to open up and get with the program? \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Because Kinley wanted more than the sex. She wanted the connection with all of them. She wanted to know what it meant to be the center of Dominic, Law, and Riley\u2019s universe. She wanted to be the sun in their sky\u2014even if just for a while.</p><p>Her backside pulsed with tingling anticipation. Every single one of those forty smacks had impacted her, showing her exactly what she needed, revealing the part of her she\u2019d denied for twenty-five years.</p><p>This was the truest Kinley she\u2019d ever known, the most comfortable she\u2019d ever been in her own skin. Heavens, she never wanted this exultant feeling to end.</p><p>She relaxed, giving them her trust, allowing them the control. Oddly, Kinley felt not only a freedom, but a certain power in giving herself over. She had only to tell them that she didn\u2019t like something and they would stop. That made relaxing and allowing things to happen so very easy.</p><p>Because she trusted them.</p><p>It occurred to her that she\u2019d never really trusted anyone this deeply. Not boyfriends or family. Not even Annabelle. She\u2019d never just allowed herself to relax and wait for whatever came because she knew it would be pleasurable.</p><p>Now, she could.</p><p>Collectively, they stroked her, both soothing and arousing her as they explained what would happen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start with the small plug,\u201d Law suggested.</p><p>Dominic grunted. \u201cNo, the medium one. She can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust use your fingers,\u201d Riley added to the argument.</p><p>Strong fingers pulled her cheeks apart, cool air hitting her opening. She\u2019d never been touched like this. Never been parted and inspected.</p><p>\u201cLook at that.\u201d Law whistled.</p><p>\u201cFucking gorgeous.\u201d Dominic sounded like he really meant it.</p><p>Riley sighed happily. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be so damn tight.\u201d</p><p>For long minutes, they fondled her, told her how gorgeous she was and how much they couldn\u2019t wait to sink their cocks into this one untried hole she\u2019d never imagined a man using, except in her wildest dreams. Maybe it should have been odd or off-putting, but she just felt utterly wanted, as if they couldn\u2019t wait to feel every part of her. The thought made her shiver.</p><p>Their hands roamed every inch of her skin until she couldn\u2019t tell who was touching her where. Kinley only knew that they all had a hand on her. The experience felt both intimate and thrilling. Her men. Touching her. All at the same time.</p><p>How many women had to choose the sort of lover they wanted? How many had to give up pieces of their heart that completed them in order to receive affection?</p><p>Gruff Law could be so gentle. He understood her wholly, gave her affection without asking for anything in return. Perversely, it made her want to give him every bit of herself. She also found comfort in knowing he would protect her without question or fail.</p><p>Dominic, whom she would always call Dom Dom in her head, challenged her. He held her hand as he stripped away the veneer of the girl she used to know and showed her the woman beneath, all the while giving himself fully in return. He offered her trust and honesty.</p><p>And Riley...he had been so scarred emotionally. But once she\u2019d reached him, he\u2019d simply asked her to give him a chance. He was so smart, so capable, so interesting...but less sure. She could see herself learning from him each and every day. She could see them growing together.</p> <p>She was taking a chance with them now, and the terrified part of her that had been betrayed before knew it. That part shouted at her to walk away. Kinley silenced the insidious voice. After a lifetime spent avoiding risk, she was now throwing herself in their path, at their mercy. She didn\u2019t want to go through life suspicious or cynical. Of course she could get hurt again. But her past proved that life without risk was also a life without rewards.</p><p>A finger slipped between her cheeks, and something cold coated that intimate, previously untouched entry, jolting her from her ruminations. She shivered at the chilly, foreign sensations.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lubricant, Kinley,\u201d Riley explained. \u201cIt\u2019s going to help with insertion.\u201d</p><p>Of the plug. Right.</p><p>Then once her body was ready, they would insert themselves in her ass. She couldn\u2019t imagine how that would feel\u2014or how she would feel about opening herself up this way.</p><p>Sex was intimate, yes. But it was also sometimes awkward and sweet, often blisteringly hot...and yet oddly pure.</p><p>A weird, jangly feeling took over as something warm made its way through the lubrication and began to penetrate her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my finger, pet,\u201d Dominic said as he circled her, pressing in a bit more. \u201cRelax. I know that\u2019s difficult. Just think about breathing out and letting me in.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a long breath and released it, then felt Dominic\u2019s finger sink deeper. It didn\u2019t hurt at all. It was different. She felt pleasantly filled. Most of all, the nerves he awakened there with just a touch aroused her. Kinley let herself go completely limp and trusting in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Law was kneeling at her side, his big hand stroking her back. \u201cSo pretty, baby. Your trust is gorgeous. Let us take care of you.\u201d</p><p>They had been taking very good care of her. She\u2019d never had anyone care so much about her feelings and experience as these three men. They made sure she had what she needed, from clothes to food to affection, then they gave her more. Understanding, safety, concern, guidance. They thought of her first.</p><p>Relationships should be like this, Kinley realized. Her mother had been so in love with her charming father. He\u2019d been good at making her mother love him, but he hadn\u2019t shared his heart in return. She saw now that her father had simply taken everything her mother had, as if she owed him, and never given anything back in return. Becks was like that. Her husband loved her, and she cheated on Brian as if he didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>But what Kinley shared with Law, Dominic, and Riley\u2014this was the way it should be. They put her first. For as long as it lasted, she would do the same with them.</p><p>Dominic submerged his finger completely inside her, and Kinley clenched around him.</p><p>That earned her a smack that made the already tender skin of her ass tingle. \u201cDon\u2019t try to push me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him have his way, baby,\u201d Law advised.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be so full, sweetheart,\u201d Riley vowed. \u201cYou\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>A second finger joined the first, stretching even wider little by little. She hissed at the slight burn, but then let loose another breath, relaxing her muscles. Dominic\u2019s second finger penetrated her completely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tight, pet, but I think we\u2019ll fit just fine.\u201d A wealth of satisfaction resounded in Dominic\u2019s voice.</p><p>Anticipation filled her.</p><p>Gently, he pulled his fingers free, and Kinley felt the loss\u2014but not for long. Almost instantly, something harder filled the empty space. \u201cThis is a training plug. While we play a bit more, I\u2019m going to leave this inside you to stretch you for us. Don\u2019t lose this plug or we will have to start all over again and I\u2019ll do so with another spanking.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d loved the forty slaps they\u2019d given her, the primal heat that it churned inside her, but was more than ready to move the experience along.</p><p>She dragged a breath in as the plug began to breach her. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s only the starter size? Because it feels really big.\u201d</p><p>Pressure, insistent and unrelenting, jammed her as the plug scraped her nerve endings. Kinley forced herself not to clench, but to simply let Dominic press the plug in farther. Finally, it popped past a tight band of muscle inside her and slid in all the way. Kinley felt no pain, just a fullness that made her gasp and writhe with a shocking curl of want. That plug filling her made her ache and perspire and need. A little thrill of pride lit her up, too. She\u2019d taken everything they\u2019d given her so far. Now she couldn\u2019t wait to give back.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, it\u2019s smaller than me,\u201d Dominic said as he worked the plug in and out, simulating the way they would take her ass for their own.</p><p>\u201cGood, sweetheart. Now hold that plug in, Kinley,\u201d Riley said as he helped her to her feet.</p><p>She clenched and had to concentrate on not letting the bit of silicone slip free.</p><p>Dominic stared down at her, obviously already in that mental place he found when he spanked and commanded her. It made him stand taller, made his voice deepen. It was so sexy, she could hardly stand it. \u201cI\u2019ll be back after I clean up. I think it\u2019s time to torture our little submissive a bit. Law, Riley, you can handle that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Law had taken off his clothes when she wasn\u2019t looking. His cock thrust out, reaching up nearly to his navel.</p><p>Riley just smiled in a way she didn\u2019t find comforting, but it was sexy as hell.</p><p>Once Dominic had left her alone with Law and Riley, they circled her like two predators sizing up particularly juicy prey.</p><p>\u201cYou did so well, baby.\u201d Law\u2019s stare roved hot all over her body. \u201cYour ass looks beautiful all pink and hot, and you\u2019re getting ready for us.\u201d</p><p>Kinley was aware of her body like never before\u2014the rushing of her blood, the goose bumps breaking out across her skin, her shortness of breath, the fullness deep inside her, and the tingles dive-bombing her from every direction. She\u2019d never felt more awake or vibrantly alive.</p><p>Riley shrugged out of his shirt and stepped close to her, caressing his way down her body and making her nipples tighten. \u201cClench your cheeks together, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She did as he asked, and he dropped to his knees.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I want.\u201d Riley nuzzled his face to her belly. \u201cYou see, when you clench like that, it makes this little jewel stand out. I really like to play with this.\u201d</p><p>He barely touched her clitoris, which was pulsing now. A shiver wound through her. She wasn\u2019t completely sure what he was planning next, and Kinley found a deep excitement in not knowing. In being at his mercy. She didn\u2019t know if he would give her the bliss of pleasure or a sweet bite of pain\u2014or both.</p><p>Riley dragged a finger through her labia then slid it back up, rounding her clitoris but not quite touching it. Taunting her.</p><p>Then Law was at her back, moving her hair aside and placing little kisses on her nape that made her shiver. His hands brushed around her torso and molded to her breasts, lifting them as he pinched her nipples. Kinley gasped as her whole body clenched.</p><p>Riley finally slid the pad of his thumb over her clitoris, just as Law pressed down on her nipples. Their timing was perfectly in sync. Pleasure mingled with a bite of pain, bringing her nerves into a crazy harmony she couldn\u2019t understand or deny.</p><p>\u201cWe like this game, baby,\u201d Law whispered in her ear. \u201cWe like to figure out exactly what trips your trigger then parse it out slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only when you\u2019re good,\u201d Riley added. \u201cOnly when you beg sweetly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Law agreed, laving his way up her neck, bestowing on her a warm, fuzzy sensation that made her shiver and writhe. She adored it.</p><p>Riley\u2019s nose was suddenly buried in her labia, his head moving back and forth. And then Law nipped her, just a little bite as Riley\u2019s tongue bathed her pussy in pleasure.</p><p>Pain and pleasure, each one complementing the other.</p><p>\u201cI brought something fun.\u201d Dominic returned carrying a small silver bucket in his hands. There was a bottle of champagne chilling there, but he ignored it. His fingers slid into the bucket and came back with a small cube of ice. \u201cAllow me.\u201d</p><p>As he slid the ice down her spine, she shivered again, the chill of the cube blending with the heat of their flesh to make something new and intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cThis is sensation play, pet. It\u2019s meant to arouse you, to engage you.\u201d Dominic trailed the ice around her body and slipped it over her nipple. She sucked in a breath against the freeze, but then Law bent to take that same nipple into his mouth, heating her up again. Dominic played with the second nipple before they exchanged positions, chilling and heating her over and over. She gripped their shoulders as her knees seemed to melt underneath her.</p><p>Riley pulled away from bathing her clit with his tongue while Dominic selected another cube and touched it to that very spot. Kinley groaned and dug her nails into them.</p><p>\u201cOur ice won\u2019t last long.\u201d Dominic chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019ll melt it very quickly. And I\u2019ll help her. God, I love the way she tastes.\u201d Riley buried his head between her legs again as if he couldn\u2019t stay away.</p><p>As Dominic\u2019s ice trailed all over her skin, settling on her nipples again, Law pulled on them, sucking and defrosting them and making them ache all at once. Kinley\u2019s senses felt so overloaded, her blood sizzling with need, that she thought she might scream.</p><p>Riley pulled her clitoris into his mouth again and began to suckle, the tip of his tongue raking her bud just where she needed it most. Just as her clit swelled and need began to coalesce between her legs, he pulled back. Dominic slid the ice over her sensitive pearl again. Her head reeled with sensation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour orgasms belong to us, pet,\u201d Dominic explained. \u201cWe want you so used to coming for us that you can do so on command. And we don\u2019t want polite little orgasms. We want to make you scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to scream now,\u201d she panted out.</p><p>They were killing her. She was so close to the edge, but they kept pulling her back. It was torture of the sweetest kind. She felt beloved and worshiped and adored...but denied what she needed most.</p><p>Dominic took her nipple between his fingers and twisted. \u201cDo you want to come, pet?\u201d</p><p>She wanted it more than she wanted her next breath. \u201cYes! Yes, please. I need it...\u201d</p><p>He tightened his hold. \u201cAsk me. Or rather ask Riley since he\u2019s the one currently in charge of your pussy. And when you ask, be very polite, pet. Maybe he\u2019ll oblige.\u201d</p><p>She could do polite. \u201cPlease give me an orgasm, Sir. I would be so grateful.\u201d</p><p>A sexy, sinful smile slid across Riley\u2019s face. \u201cWell, now, I do aim to please, sweetheart. And since you asked so sweetly.\u201d</p><p>He put his face to her pussy, then licked and suckled before he slipped a finger between her slick folds, reaching for her sweet spot. She was still clenching tightly to keep the plug in place, so that finger felt huge in her pussy. He foraged deep while he sucked on her clit, and Kinley lost it.</p><p>Screaming, she went over the edge, all the previous play making her ripe and ready to give her entire being over to it. She let the wave of ecstasy sweep her away, gratefully taking what Riley was so generously giving her.</p><p>\u201cVery good, pet.\u201d Dominic\u2019s silky voice played along her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re soft and wet and you held the plug well. But I think you need to prepare your men to fuck you. On your hands and knees.\u201d</p><p>Law and Dominic helped her down to the soft carpet. She nearly melted into it, her body was so languid after the orgasm, but they had rewarded her. Now, they were counting on her. They\u2019d given her such pleasure, and she wanted to give it back.</p><p>Dominic remained behind her, forcing her knees wide. She could hear the soft shuffle of him removing his clothes. He settled himself between, placing his hand on her back.</p><p>After shucking off his pants, Riley scrambled in front of her. On his knees now, he aligned his cock with her mouth. \u201cYou know how to do this, sweetheart. Get me hard enough to fuck you. I want inside your pussy. I want it so fucking bad I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p><p>He looked really hard, but Kinley was more than game. She loved the way he\u2019d tasted the night before, how he\u2019d shaken and moaned as she\u2019d sucked him down. Now, she licked at his cock, laving the head with affection, moaning around his flesh.</p><p>Law knelt at her side and she felt his hand slip under her body, finding her clit again. \u201cBe good, baby.\u201d</p><p>She got the idea. As long as she sucked Riley attentively, Law would play with her. And she loved Law\u2019s touch. Despite the fact that she\u2019d just come, her body was already building again.</p><p>She drew the head of Riley\u2019s cock into her mouth, laving her tongue all around. She loved the power she felt when his whole body went still, as though he didn\u2019t want to do anything to take himself out of the moment.</p><p>\u201cKeep sucking, pet. I\u2019m going to play, too.\u201d Dominic laid a hand on the cheek of her ass.</p><p>And then she was moaning again. He spread her cheeks apart, and Kinley felt him press at the plug. Pressure filled her pelvis.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck that feels good, Kinley.\u201d Riley\u2019s hands tangled in her hair, drawing her closer. \u201cWhatever you did, Dominic, do it again. It feels so fucking good when she moans around my cock.\u201d</p><p>Dominic tugged and prodded the plug again, and Kinley couldn\u2019t stop the helpless sounds escaping her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s taken this plug quite nicely,\u201d Dominic assured the others.</p> <p>That plug was threatening her sanity. He moved it in and out of her, starting in small jaunts\u2014a tiny bit out, then back in\u2014before he withdrew it further, only to press in harder. He was penetrating her ass with the plug the same way he would soon take her with his cock. If just the idea and this much sensation was overwhelming her, she could hardly wait for the real thing.</p><p>Kinley tried to concentrate on sucking Riley, but blocking out the pleasure Dominic and Law were giving her proved impossible.</p><p>Law\u2019s hand stilled as he stopped toying with her clit. \u201cKeep sucking, baby.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered but complied. As soon as she did and Riley emitted a long, low groan once more, Law continued swiping that relentless caress over her clit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn next,\u201d he murmured low and intimate in her ear. \u201cDo you know how we\u2019re going to work this? How we\u2019re going to take you? Because we are definitely going to take you. Here and now. In the light of day. All together.\u201d</p><p>She listened, Law\u2019s words arousing her as much as their touches.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to shove my cock past those sweet lips of yours,\u201d he swore, his voice husky. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck your pretty mouth and make you take me until there\u2019s no place to go except down your throat. I\u2019m going to watch your lips as you devour me. And when I come, I\u2019m going to fill your mouth, then you\u2019re going to suck me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m finally going to get inside your pussy,\u201d Riley groaned as he shoved his cock into her mouth another inch. \u201cI know you\u2019re going to be so wet and soft around me. And you\u2019re going to take every inch. I\u2019m going to fill you up. I\u2019m going to make you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to take your virgin ass,\u201d Dominic said with a tug on her plug.</p><p>He eased it nearly free of her body, the pressure letting up. Kinley held her breath, waiting, suspended, dying. Then Dominic ruthlessly fucked it back into her. She cried out in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cGood, pet. But even though you\u2019ve done well with the plug, I\u2019ll have to fight my way in back here. Carefully, of course. But every inch I take is going to be pure pleasure. You\u2019re going to be so tight around my cock. I intend to teach you to love this, pet. I want you to crave it. By the time we\u2019re done, you won\u2019t feel full and happy unless you have all your men. I promise you.\u201d</p><p>She already felt incomplete when they weren\u2019t all touching her.</p><p>Riley pulled out of her mouth abruptly, his face contorted with effort. \u201cFuck, I can\u2019t last much longer like that. I don\u2019t want to come until I get inside your pussy, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ready.\u201d Dominic removed the plug.</p><p>Again, Kinley felt empty without the fullness and pressure back there, and she couldn\u2019t wait for Dominic to take his rightful place inside her, filling her up once more.</p><p>The men moved quickly, Law lifting her and carrying her toward the sofa. Riley threw himself down on the cushions first, his cock straining up. He covered it in a condom in record time and reached for her. \u201cCome on, sweetheart. Ride me.\u201d</p><p>Law eased her over Riley\u2019s prone form. He was so beautifully masculine and he was all hers. For now, they all belonged to her.</p><p>She straddled him, taking his cock in her hand to guide him home. She sank onto his waiting inches and threw her head back with a groan. The feel of him inside her was pure pleasure.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget me, baby.\u201d Law stood in front of her, stroking that massive cock of his with a rough fist. Even the sight of it turned her on.</p><p>All she had to do was lean forward to take him in her mouth, his length filling her as he worked his way in. She ran her tongue across his cock, reveling in the masculine taste even as Riley pumped his way into her pussy without restraint.</p><p>Then Dominic took his place behind her. \u201cStay still, just for a moment, pet. Tilt your hips back and push down. I\u2019m bigger than the plug, but you can take me.\u201d</p><p>He dribbled more lube on her, then began to probe her ass. She felt her eyes widening because Dominic was right. He was much bigger than the plug. His cock began to breach her hole. She whimpered, the pressure was so great.</p><p>Law stroked her hair. \u201cYou can take him. Don\u2019t fight him. Baby, it\u2019s going to feel so good once he gets inside.\u201d</p><p>She concentrated on Law\u2019s cock. She sucked hard, drawing back until he almost popped out of her mouth. She kept him there, whirling her tongue around the head, playing with the little slit there, eliciting a curse and a groan from him.</p><p>Riley ran his hands across her skin, soothing her. \u201cJust relax. I know that\u2019s hard, but it will be worth it. I promise. Do exactly as Dominic said. Let him in.\u201d</p><p>She wanted so much to give back to these men. Kinley tilted back a bit. Dominic sank a little deeper, and she took a long breath. She could handle the pressure. It wasn\u2019t real pain.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so tight,\u201d he hissed. \u201cKinley, pet, you have to tell us now if you want this to stop.\u201d Dominic\u2019s voice shook with desire. His hands tightened around her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do as I say. Push down on me.\u201d</p><p>After a few seconds, she drew back and dislodged Riley halfway. Then she managed to tilt higher and pushed down. Dominic tunneled inside her until she felt every inch of him filling her ass. He pressed against her, holding her tight.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck me. You feel so good.\u201d Dominic ground against her.</p><p>Heat threatened to overwhelm Kinley. She was packed full of them all, stretched to the limit. But she never wanted to escape.</p><p>Riley shoved his way back in, and Kinley gasped. Pleasure raked across her every nerve, screaming with tingling need. The ecstasy was robbing her breath, her mind. All the pain and heartache it had taken her to reach this place was suddenly worth it because she didn\u2019t just feel amazing bliss with these men. She felt warmed and surrounded and loved.</p><p>\u201cTake me.\u201d Law pulled her close again, his cock against her lips. \u201cNone of us is going to last very long. Suck me hard, baby. Take all your men.\u201d</p><p>She did as Law demanded while Riley and Dominic started to move in perfect harmony. Riley filled her pussy as Dominic pulled out of her ass, exciting every cell, every nerve. As they settled into a pounding rhythm, she moved with them, still sucking hard on Law. He swelled against her tongue. His flavor turned salty.</p><p>\u201cGet ready, baby. I\u2019m going to come.\u201d Law\u2019s pace quickened as he dragged in deep, heaving breaths and anchored his hands in her hair. \u201cFuck! I need you, baby. Take me.\u201d</p><p>As she nodded, his cock pulsed then burst. He covered her tongue with his seed. Kinley drank from him, sucking gently as his essence coated her throat. Then she swallowed.</p><p>Dominic gripped her hips tighter and dragged her back on his cock. \u201cLaw, help us out.\u201d</p><p>He did, kneeling beside them and working a hand in between her and Riley. He pressed on her clitoris as Riley thrust up and hit a spot inside her that had her wailing. Orgasm swept her away, engulfing her. She thrashed between Dominic and Riley, mindless in her pleasure, seeking nothing less than everything from her men.</p><p>Riley joined her in ecstasy next, pumping his hips frantically as he called her name, prolonging the stunning pleasure still rolling through her. Kinley thought it couldn\u2019t get better until Dominic ground against her and his cock pulsed deep inside her. He dug his fingers into her hips and howled.</p><p>As their movements slowed, then stilled, she dropped onto Riley\u2019s chest. Dominic carefully balanced himself over her, whispering soothing kisses along her nape.</p><p>Peace. She felt complete blessed peace now, so thick she imagined that absolutely nothing could touch her. Her men surrounded and engulfed her. She hoarded this moment in her memory, just in case the future ripped these three out of her grasp.</p><p>Law kissed her cheek. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m going to start up the hot tub. We can all relax in there while we wait for the feds to call.\u201d</p><p>She felt a little smile cross her face. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>As Law stood, Kinley nuzzled against Riley\u2019s chest once more.</p><p>\u201cShit. I just figured out what Jansen is moving.\u201d Law\u2019s voice broke through her languor. She looked up to find him staring at the desk in the middle of the office.</p><p>Kinley frowned, panic beginning to penetrate her perfect peace.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Law hated to break up the moment. Three minutes ago, he\u2019d felt like the fucking king of the world. Now he jumped into his sweat pants because they had a job to do.</p><p>And it had just gotten harder.</p><p>Dominic helped Kinley to her feet, pulling her in for a hug as though he needed to protect her from the truths he knew were coming. \u201cThis can\u2019t wait until we take care of our sub?\u201d</p><p>Riley was on his feet, getting dressed, and there was no way to mistake just how irritated he was. \u201cI told you there\u2019s no way to know unless I can break whatever code he\u2019s using. It\u2019s all in numbers. I know it sounds simple, but it\u2019s actually quite difficult without some form of reference. Let\u2019s get Kinley settled, and I\u2019ll explain cryptography to you.\u201d</p><p>God, his brother could be a smartass prick at times. \u201cI don\u2019t need cryptography. I have eyes. And we\u2019re not leaving her out of this discussion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kinley shook her head as she shrugged into Riley\u2019s oversized T-shirt. It practically hung to her knees. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not leaving me out. If Law figured out how my ex is using Hope House, then I want to hear it. Could someone pass me my jeans?\u201d</p><p>Those jeans were the problem. Law picked them up, but held the denim in his hand. \u201cHow many pairs of these did Jansen give you?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cAt least ten I think, all with slightly different designs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you taking ten pairs of jeans to a tropical island in the summer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreg said he wanted a fashion show... What a load of crap. Greg never gave a crap about seeing me in anything. I should have known. What\u2019s weird about the jeans?\u201d She walked over to him as though to inspect the pants, but her eyes caught on the desk. \u201cOh, no. Did I do that by sitting on the glass? It wasn\u2019t scratched before.\u201d</p><p>Dominic hustled across the room and stared down at the desk. The massive mahogany desktop was covered in a thick layer of glass, a precaution against damaging the wood. The glass could be replaced. Normally, it would protect against ink stains, heavy machinery, and someone being too rough on the wood.</p><p>This time it had taken the cutting brunt of the stones sewn onto Kinley\u2019s pockets.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Dominic touched the grooves etched into the glass. \u201cThe feds suspected Jansen was transporting blood diamonds, but no one could prove it. It looks like he found someone to cut them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiamonds?\u201d Kinley asked. \u201cThose are just rhinestones. Most women are wearing a little bling on their pockets these days.\u201d</p> <p>Riley held out his hand, and Law passed him the jeans. As Riley held the pockets up to the light, they sparkled, creating a glorious little light show. \u201cA little bling? This must be a hundred thousand dollars right here. He was going to have Kinley walk right out of the country with a million dollars worth of blood diamonds in her suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d Kinley asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to study them? Have a gemologist\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, rhinestones can\u2019t cut glass. The proof is right there on the desk.\u201d Law pointed to the scratches she\u2019d left when she\u2019d sat on the desk. He\u2019d kissed her while there, then dragged her toward him, leaving the scratches behind.</p><p>\u201cConflict diamonds come from war-torn countries right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, usually from rebel-held territories in either Liberia or C\u020fte d\u2019Ivoire in West Africa. Reputable buyers won\u2019t touch them because of the brutal methods of their mining. So men like Jansen act as intermediaries. He would have smuggled them out and had them cut somewhere, maybe even in Africa. Somehow, he got them here. I\u2019ll bet every dime I\u2019ve got that Jansen has a buyer he planned to meet in Bermuda on your honeymoon,\u201d Dominic explained.</p><p>\u201cHe was going to have you walk them right across the border. No one would question jeans. Airports look for guns and explosives and drugs. They don\u2019t look for diamonds, so they would very likely see what Jansen wanted them to see\u2014a girl who likes bling on her pockets,\u201d Riley said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if he got caught, he would just say it was all mine.\u201d Kinley sat down. \u201cI was the one with all the cryptic stuff on my tablet. I was the one with conflict diamonds on my ass. Hell, I\u2019m a regular criminal mastermind. I guess he was using shipments of new clothing from Africa, supposedly for Hope House, to smuggle his diamonds in.\u201d</p><p>Law put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cVery likely. That\u2019s why he pushed you to start using Third World manufacturers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t because I was helping out emerging economies, huh?\u201d Her face had gone a deep pink, and she closed herself off.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you can\u2019t think this is your fault.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes came up, and a hardness lurked there he hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cOh, I think I can safely blame myself. I was so na\u00efve. I\u2019m sure he laughed. He probably sat around cackling about what an idiot I was. I really believed him. He said he had contacts with clothing manufacturers who were hiring women at a decent wage, but a decent wage in Africa is different than here. He played me, knowing I wanted to help everyone. I believed every lie he told me because I was too busy getting ready for the wedding to do the research myself. Oh, and worrying about my father, too. Who apparently wasn\u2019t wracked with cancer, just busy at the track. God, you must all think I\u2019m a moron.\u201d</p><p>He tried to reach for her, but she stepped away. \u201cKinley?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t. Just give me a couple of minutes. I\u2019m going to go take a shower.\u201d</p><p>Dominic got in her way. \u201cKinley, pet, no one thinks you\u2019re stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d She refused to meet his eyes. \u201cPlease, can I just have a minute to myself?\u201d</p><p>Riley frowned her way. \u201cThe security system is on and I\u2019ll be monitoring the outside cameras. I\u2019ll know if you try to crawl out the window again.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to run, but I can see where you would think that. I obviously make very poor decisions. Now, can I go to my room for a while? And I\u2019m putting the rest of those jeans in the hallway. Please do something with them. I never want to see them again. I\u2019ll keep this pair, but only until I can get a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ll buy you new jeans, pet,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cAs soon as we can. Go and take a couple of minutes for yourself, but we\u2019ll have lunch in an hour, and I expect you to be there.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word, simply walked out without another glance.</p><p>Law started to follow her, but Dominic gripped his arm, staying him. \u201cGive her some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crying.\u201d Law couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it kills me, too, but she wants to be alone. Her pride is aching, and you seeing her in tears won\u2019t help that. She was already on emotional overload, and this pushed her farther.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us meant to hurt her with the truth,\u201d Riley defended, looking to the door Kinley had just darted through.</p><p>True, but Law wished he\u2019d kept his damn mouth closed. He\u2019d never imagined she would react that way.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, but all we can do now is give her a little time and space, then let her know she\u2019s not allowed to pull away from us now,\u201d Dominic said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let that fucker win.\u201d Law clenched his fists in fury at the thought. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let him take our woman away from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinley belongs with us, whether she knows it or not,\u201d Dominic said firmly. \u201cAnd Jansen is an idiot if he actually thought anyone would believe that she was behind this. I think he was counting on not getting caught, then sliding her skinny bitch sister into the role after Kinley\u2019s \u2018untimely accident.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg and Becks would have control of Hope House. They would install all their own people and start smuggling anything they wanted. Son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd those island nations are the perfect place to commit a little murder. Jansen probably already had it staged. He\u2019d probably bribed an official to call it an accident. She would have drowned on her honeymoon.\u201d Riley banged his fist on the desk. \u201cWe have to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, but I\u2019m a little worried.\u201d Since the moment Law figured Jansen\u2019s scheme out, a thousand scenarios had played through his head, all of them crappy. \u201cHe had a buyer for these stones. It wasn\u2019t like he planned to transport them to the islands and set up a storefront.\u201d</p><p>Dominic shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s had this planned for a while, which means he probably has a buyer all lined up. He has to get Kinley and the jeans back. He\u2019s probably already taken at least a portion of the money. Now he has to deliver the goods. If he\u2019s laundering money this way, then he\u2019s probably doing it for the mob. They won\u2019t like him missing his appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be desperate by now.\u201d Riley moved to his computer. \u201cSince he can\u2019t go through with the transaction without Kinley and the jeans, maybe we should just wait it out here and let his mob connections take him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll go to ground first. Then we\u2019ll spend the rest of Kinley\u2019s life waiting for him to show.\u201d Dominic summed up their problems neatly. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t have her looking over her shoulder. We have to be sure he\u2019s in jail. Or I want to see his body for myself. It\u2019s the only way to protect her. Otherwise, he\u2019ll come after her because he\u2019ll want revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t we gotten that call from the feds to make arrangements so we can turn over our evidence?\u201d Law asked, feeling itchy. He didn\u2019t like this. \u201cIs there any way Kellan hasn\u2019t called the feds yet?\u201d</p><p>Riley sat down in front of his keyboard. \u201cNo. He swore he\u2019d do it as soon as he and Dominic hung up. Kellan only knows about the encrypted files I found, but still... You\u2019re right, Law. I thought we would hear something by now.\u201d Riley frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of burner phones left if you want me to make some calls.\u201d</p><p>Law had a bad feeling\u2014and it was only growing. He\u2019d learned over the years to trust his instincts, and every single one of them was telling him to regroup. \u201cNo. We need to move her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Riley asked.</p><p>Dominic grabbed his shirt. \u201cAnywhere. Law\u2019s right. We grab her luggage and the dogs and we take off. We\u2019ll get in touch with some of our friends when we\u2019re in the air. Some of our friends who live in Bezakistan are in the country. Perhaps it\u2019s time we visited again. If we can get Kinley on a plane with Princess Alea, we can be sure she\u2019s safe. Not even Jansen has men inside the royal palace. But I\u2019m beginning to suspect he has a few at the FBI. It\u2019s the only explanation for why we haven\u2019t at least received a call. They should be all over this.\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline started pumping through Law\u2019s system. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the hanger and get the plane ready. Riley, contact Dane Mitchell. See where he, Landon, and Cooper are visiting with Alea. We\u2019re going to need help finding a place to land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the dogs.\u201d Dominic grimaced. \u201cGod, I hope the rat thing cooperates. It\u2019s time for her walk and her feeding. You know how much she\u2019ll bark if she doesn\u2019t get her food on time. I\u2019ll take her and Butch out after I move the jeans out of the way. I don\u2019t want them to upset her again.\u201d</p><p>Dominic set off to complete his task.</p><p>Riley was already pushing away his keyboard and jumping to his feet. \u201cI just sent Dane a note. He has my cell. Let\u2019s hope he calls before we take off. Otherwise, I\u2019m calling Dex James, and we can head for Dallas to wait for Dane there.\u201d</p><p>Getting Kinley out of the country seemed like a damn fine plan.</p><p>\u201cTell Kinley what\u2019s going on and to get her cute butt in gear because I want to take off in the next hour.\u201d The silence from the feds was not a good thing. The quicker they took off, the safer he would feel.</p><p>He passed a harried Dominic who was carrying a stack of jeans in one hand and a very excited Gigi in the other. Butch lumbered along behind them. \u201cI\u2019m going to put these in the office before I take the dogs out. I swear Kinley\u2019s turned me into her butler.\u201d</p><p>Despite the adrenaline coursing through his body, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little. Dominic growled at Gigi, who no longer seemed afraid of the big bad Dom.</p><p>Law jogged through the house, disarming and rearming the security system\u2014and grabbing his SIG as he left. The small private landing strip was two hundred yards away from the house, and he wasn\u2019t about to run out in the open with no way to defend himself, just in case.</p><p>He settled into his preflight checks after gassing up the small jet. Minutes passed in perfect silence.</p><p>That\u2019s when he heard the gunshots.</p><p>Kinley turned on the shower and shrugged out of Riley\u2019s T-shirt.</p><p>What was she doing? She should probably still be with her men, but she\u2019d walked away to lick her wounds. She didn\u2019t want them to see her cry or to watch them reevaluate their relationship. They all had to be wondering whether they really wanted a woman who could cause so much trouble.</p><p>Greg had used her and he\u2019d done it with a smile on his face. And why shouldn\u2019t he smile? She hadn\u2019t given him any trouble at all. He\u2019d just walked in and offered to solve her problems, so she\u2019d stopped asking questions. Brilliant.</p><p>When he\u2019d told her to pack ten pairs of jeans for a vacation she normally wouldn\u2019t even pack one pair for, what had she done? Exactly as he\u2019d asked because Greg had told her he wanted to see her in them. Like he\u2019d ever stared at her butt before. She snorted.</p><p>Now Law, he stared at her butt. She caught him all the time. At this moment, her butt was sore after the spanking and even more thorough fucking. Why did she love the soreness? Why did every little ache remind her of Dominic and the gently forceful way in which he\u2019d taken her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What was he thinking at this point, that she didn\u2019t have a brain in her head?</p><p>They would dump her as soon as the feds had Greg in custody. And she couldn\u2019t blame them. How much had her actions already cost people? She was transporting diamonds that had been mined by slaves. She was working with factories that probably used child labor.</p><p>A sharp knock on the door brought her out of her thoughts. She didn\u2019t need anyone to see her like this. \u201cI\u2019m in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinley, let me in.\u201d Riley\u2019s voice sounded through the door.</p> <p>He was the last one she needed. He was so smart. Riley had resisted his physical attraction to her. Now he probably wished he hadn\u2019t given in. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she could compose herself by then.</p><p>There was a slight rustling sound, then the door popped open. Riley had his driver\u2019s license in his hand. \u201cInterior doors are a breeze. And you lied. You are not in the shower.\u201d</p><p>But she was naked. She grabbed a towel. \u201cPrivacy please.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, his eyes on the towel. \u201cWhy? You didn\u2019t want privacy before. You were perfectly happy to be naked in front of me. Or is it only Dominic and Law you\u2019re comfortable around? What happened, Kinley? You decide you didn\u2019t really like three men?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, you are so damaged. That\u2019s where you go? Everything has to be about you?\u201d She was just about done with his attitude. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that I just figured out how much of a fool I am? No, we have to go back to your problems and your issues. Go away, Riley. I\u2019ll be out when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him, brutally aware she\u2019d just been a complete bitch.</p><p>Riley\u2019s arms wound around her waist and pulled her back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It didn\u2019t occur to me because I don\u2019t think you were a fool. I think you\u2019re sweet and loving, and had no way to see this coming. You\u2019re far too good for the likes of Jansen...and me. But I\u2019m going to ask you to overlook that little flaw because I\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to be alone. She wanted to wail and blame herself for everything and Riley wasn\u2019t going to let her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, sweetheart.\u201d He said the word like he really meant it, his hand smoothing back her hair as he cuddled her close. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You made a mistake, but it was an honest one. You did it because you were hopeful. He took advantage of your giving nature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust like it happened to you.\u201d If she could get him to understand that what Simone did wasn\u2019t his fault, maybe all the pain would be worth it. \u201cThere was nothing wrong with you or Law or what the three of you want. Simone had the problem.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her. \u201cAll right, Mary Sunshine. I\u2019ll go with it, but only if you promise me one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let this change you. Stay as sweet and hopeful as you\u2019ve always been, and I\u2019ll try to find the positive guy inside me.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m warning you, though. He\u2019s buried deep. It might take me a while.\u201d</p><p>She could wait. \u201cOkay. It\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>Kinley tilted her head back, looking up at Riley as he kissed her, sealing their deal.</p><p>Reluctantly, he pulled back. He reached into the shower, turning the water off. \u201cWe need you to skip the shower. No cause for alarm, but we\u2019re thinking it might be a good idea to change locations. You know, stay safe, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the FBI? Aren\u2019t they coming to see us?\u201d</p> <p>Regret skipped across Riley\u2019s face. Then the lights flickered and died.</p><p>His whole body stilled. When she began to ask about a generator, he shoved a hand over her mouth. His eyes bored into her as he whispered. \u201cNo talking. Give it a second.\u201d</p><p>The lights came back on. And died seconds later. A loud buzzing followed, an alarm signaling something.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Riley paled. \u201cListen to me very carefully. The security system is offline because someone cut the power to it. The generator is top of the line, and so is the backup. We have to assume someone took both of them out.\u201d</p><p>Shockwaves pinged through her system. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s FBI agents working some sort of sting? They\u2019ve been looking for me.\u201d She\u2019d signed the affidavit that she wasn\u2019t a hostage, but who knew if they\u2019d believe that or assume she\u2019d been made to sign under duress.</p><p>\u201cThe feds would announce themselves, and the feds know what we\u2019re doing. I\u2019m starting to think that Jansen has someone on the inside, and we\u2019re screwed. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Jansen wants the diamonds. I have to hide them. If he gets his hands on them, he\u2019ll kill us all. My gun\u2014 Damn it, my gun is back in the office. Law is out at the hangar, and Dominic should be rounding up the dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg is here?\u201d Oh, god, if he was in this house, he was coming after her. And he wouldn\u2019t come alone.</p><p>Suddenly, she heard an odd popping sound.</p><p>\u201cGunfire. Shit. Sweetheart, I need you to hide. I\u2019m not sure where that gunfire came from, maybe the back of the house.\u201d</p><p>Kinley grabbed the clothes she\u2019d brought in with her. She\u2019d picked them up without thinking. She was holding a pair of jeans covered in blood diamonds. She never wanted to see another pair of jeans again.</p><p>An idea struck her. She quickly opened the medicine cabinet. There was a nail file, the metal kind with a nice pointed end. She went to work on the stitching in the back pocket. After a couple of good twists, it was easy to pull the heavy scrap of fabric apart from the rest of the pants. \u201cWe need to hide the diamonds, but the actual jeans are bulky and it would take too much time to pry each stone off individually.\u201d She reached for the bottle of her favorite shampoo. She dumped half of it into the shower and then stuffed the pockets in one at a time.</p><p>Riley kissed the top of her head. \u201cI will spank you if ever call yourself dumb again. You\u2019re brilliant. He needs them all. Every single diamond.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAll right, but I think Dominic took the rest of them. I don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. He took them to the office. He was going to put them in a bag or something so you didn\u2019t have to look at them.\u201d Riley\u2019s face tightened. \u201cI need to get to those jeans.\u201d</p><p>Riley hesitated, but Kinley knew his brothers could be out there dying right now. Her men were in danger, and she would do anything she could to stop it. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll stay and be exactly what Greg expects me to be\u2014a hostage. He won\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that, Kinley.\u201d</p><p>No, but... \u201cYou have to leave. Greg and his goons could be here any minute.\u201d Her hands were shaking as she pushed him away. \u201cGo. If you can find a way to get to the jeans, hide more of the diamonds. Hurry. We\u2019re running out of time. He won\u2019t kill me until he has them all. Can you get out the bathroom window?\u201d</p><p>Riley drew her close, kissing her hard. \u201cI can get out of it. You stay alive. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>With a nod, she dashed into her room, the damaged jeans in her hand. She folded the jeans neatly, so the damage didn\u2019t show. Her heart pounding, she retreated to the bathroom where Riley was just disappearing through the high window.</p><p>She was alone.</p><p>\u201cKinley!\u201d Greg\u2019s voice floated from down the hallway, inciting a sharp pang of terror. She bit her lip. Being brave didn\u2019t come naturally to her, but she had to find that within her now. \u201cCome out, you bastards. There\u2019s no place to hide!\u201d</p><p>He was getting close. She had seconds to decide how to play this.</p><p>Hide in plain sight. Like the diamonds.</p><p>She turned the shower on again. There was really only one thing to do. God, she didn\u2019t want to do it, but she pulled his shirt over her head and stepped into the shower. Cold water sluiced down her skin. She shook but forced herself to soap her hair.</p><p>The door shook as it came open.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, you assholes? Are you going to rape me now? Trust me, the cold shower is working just fine to soften me up. I swear when my fianc\u00e9 gets ahold of you, you\u2019re going to be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinley?\u201d</p><p>She hated the very sound of Greg\u2019s voice, but she forced herself to gasp in surprise and poke her head out of the shower. \u201cGreg?\u201d She asked the question tentatively as though utterly hopeful. \u201cOh, my god. Is it really you?\u201d</p><p>He was standing there wearing dark pants and a black turtleneck. It was elegant, but now Kinley saw why he\u2019d chosen it\u2014black wouldn\u2019t show the blood he intended to spill. He was a well-dressed viper, waiting to strike.</p><p>He was also a damn fine actor. His face softened. \u201cOh, my sweetheart. I thought they had killed you.\u201d</p><p>He reached out his hand. With her stomach in knots, Kinley took it.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Dominic hid behind the west wall of the house, moving as silently as he could across the deck. The key was to stay close to the wall. He edged along, stopping every few seconds to listen and ensure that no one was sneaking up behind him.</p><p>Surely someone had heard the gunshots. One of Jansen\u2019s men would walk out any minute now and see the dead body on the lawn, but Dominic didn\u2019t have time to hide it. He needed to get into the house and get Kinley out. Unless Riley had already done it. He\u2019d been the only one in the house with her. Dominic prayed that his brother had heard the gunshot and spirited her out to the hangar with Law. They had weapons there\u2014and a radio. With any luck, Riley, Law, and Kinley were holed up and formulating a plan, just waiting for him to reach them.</p><p>Or his brother could be dead, and Kinley could be at the mercy of a man who had none.</p><p>What the fuck had gone wrong? This was all his fault. He should have moved her once a day, but no. He\u2019d been so sure that no one would find them in the wilderness. Breaking Kinley down had been more important than protecting her from the monster she\u2019d nearly married.</p><p>Dominic cursed under his breath. Guilt threatened to overwhelm him. He should have thought of her first. He should have put his revenge on hold and simply helped an innocent woman.</p><p>But then he would never have known what it was like to hold her, to watch her laugh, to love her.</p><p>God, he was in love with her, and now she might die.</p><p>Gigi yipped as though barking at him to move him along.</p><p>He looked down at the two dogs following at his heels. If he hadn\u2019t been in the woods while they ran around and did their business, he might have heard Jansen\u2019s SUV coming up the road himself.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he hissed as quietly as he could.</p><p>Butch sat back on his haunches, looking up. He was a good little soldier, the mutt. But Gigi was one high-strung rat thing. It was probably getting close to meal time for her. And she was going to get him killed if she didn\u2019t shut up.</p><p>\u201cHandle your woman,\u201d he muttered to Butch as he continued his slow, creeping steps toward the back door.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d Kinley\u2019s voice was soft, but he could hear her through the thick pane of glass. He was standing right beside the window to her bedroom. His heart threatened to leap out of his chest when he realized who was in there with her.</p><p>\u201cI have my ways, darling. I\u2019m just so glad that I got here in time. You have no idea what the last few days have been like.\u201d Jansen\u2019s voice was deep with emotion. Dominic would hand it to him for that Oscar-worthy performance. \u201cTell me, Kinley, did they hurt you?\u201d</p><p>He heard her sniffle a little. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>What game was she playing?</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey scared me, Greg. They drugged me. They threatened my dog. They kept me awake for long periods of time. They tied me up. And then, just when I thought they were letting up because they allowed me a shower, they made it ice cold. They were going to make me as uncomfortable as possible. I don\u2019t know why. Why does that man hate you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was so going to smack her ass for ever calling herself stupid.</p><p>Law was in the hangar. Kinley was with the enemy. Where was Riley? God, he had to pray his brother wasn\u2019t in there with Kinley.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s who I think it is, darling, then he hates me because I was married to his sister,\u201d Greg said. \u201cYou know how I felt about Carrie. I loved her. It took me years to find another wife I felt I could care for as much. She was just...well, she was broken. I\u2019ve kept this secret for far too long, but she told me her brother sexually abused her. He\u2019s insane, Kinley. Which is precisely why I need you to gather all of your things so we get you out of here. He could hurt you. He would do it because he knows it would kill me.\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s vision nearly went red. He wanted to throttle that fucker. How dare he?</p><p>\u201cYou mean, he isn\u2019t in custody?\u201d Kinley asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you come with the police?\u201d</p><p>Dominic calmed slightly because he could hear the worry in her voice. Greg would think she was worried for herself, but Dominic knew the truth. His brave and smart sub was worried for her Master. She was doing such a good job. He couldn\u2019t let his temper get them all killed. For the first time in years, he\u2019d found something he needed more than revenge. He\u2019d found Kinley Kohl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Greg hesitated. \u201cDarling, I have some men looking for him now, but the police wouldn\u2019t come and arrest him because you signed that affidavit.\u201d</p><p>The one Greg could only know about because he had a source inside the FBI, just as Dominic had suspected.</p><p>\u201cThey made me sign,\u201d she said quickly, putting just the right amount of tears in her voice. \u201cI think they were trying to buy time. Surely, the police are still looking for me. I-I was worried they would kill me if I didn\u2019t sign. I was so afraid.\u201d</p><p>Dominic needed to figure out how many men Jansen had brought with him. He\u2019d killed one, but there were surely more. He\u2019d caught the one coming out of the building that housed the generator. He\u2019d seen the SUV as soon as he emerged from the woods. It could likely hold up to eight people.</p> <p>One down, potentially seven to go.</p><p>And he still didn\u2019t know where his brothers were.</p><p>Looking up and down the deck, Dominic tried to decide which direction to go. The front would surely be guarded, but the house was rambling and massive. He probably had the best shot at getting in around the back.</p><p>Dominic started easing in that direction. Leaving Kinley was hell, but he couldn\u2019t shoot the fucker through the windows. The James brothers were paranoid about their wife and kids. The glass was damn near bulletproof.</p><p>He started to work his way down the porch.</p> <p>And then he heard the creak that told him someone else was walking on the wooden structure as well. He stilled, holding himself perfectly quiet.</p><p>Gigi ran forward, yipping like a maniac.</p><p>The minute Gigi pranced off, Butch darted after her. They ran toward the back, barking all the way.</p><p>A gunshot split through the air.</p><p>Gigi yipped, and Butch growled. Then the motherfucker showed himself.</p><p>Dominic took the shot. The man in black went down.</p> <p>Two down, possibly six to go. But, fuck, he was going to invest in a silencer or he would get caught because it was so damn quiet out here. If they were in New York, no one would notice him defending himself.</p><p>But they were in the fucking wilds of Alaska, and the sounds of birds chirping did nothing to muffle the sound of a gun going off.</p><p>\u201cHold it!\u201d A voice called out.</p><p>Dominic heard another shot, felt a bullet whiz by his left arm.</p><p>\u201cI got him, too!\u201d A voice from behind him yelled.</p><p>He could shoot one, but then the other would take him out, no problem. He could try to fight but he would lose. Once upon a time, that wouldn\u2019t have bothered him. He would have died simply to avenge Carrie.</p><p>But then he\u2019d met Kinley. He\u2019d held her and loved her. He\u2019d dreamed of a future with her and his brothers. She\u2019d accepted him for the good and the bad and the kinky. She\u2019d taken everything he had to give her.</p><p>He could fight and die. But that\u2019s not what Carrie would have wanted. She would have expected him to live for Kinley.</p> <p>Now he just might die for her, too.</p><p>Dominic let the gun drop. \u201cYou won\u2019t find the diamonds without me.\u201d</p><p>He would take the beating, the humiliation that was sure to come, in order to give his brothers and their woman some time to escape.</p><p>He dropped his gun, opening himself to simply being killed on the spot. Thirty-one years into his life, and he\u2019d finally found his true weakness: A sweet submissive with honey blonde hair and a smile like the sun. His love. His wife.</p><p>He would die so she could have a chance to live.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t die without a fight. \u201cI know where the diamonds are. You need those, don\u2019t you? Your boss will be very upset if you kill the only man who can lead you to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. Don\u2019t shoot him yet. Jansen needs to hear this.\u201d The one on his right kicked the gun out of the way.</p><p>The one on his left moved in. \u201cPut your hands over your head.\u201d</p><p>Dominic held his hands up, though it pained him. In the distance, he saw movement by the hanger. A single figure shifted, as though taking in the danger before hiding himself again.</p><p>Law had seen him. Law knew what had happened. Law would do what it took.</p><p>Even if he died, Law would come for Kinley. If both he and Riley died, Law would kill them all and then take care of Kinley.</p><p>As lousy as the situation was, this was exactly why he\u2019d sought a m\u00e9nage. No one had been there for Carrie. When Greg had seen her as a paycheck, she\u2019d been all alone. Three men were fighting for Kinley. She had three chances to live because every single one of them would die for her. He could relax because his brothers had his back.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck are the diamonds?\u201d The man on his right shoved the barrel of his gun to his temple, jarring his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying anything to you. I\u2019ll only talk to Jansen.\u201d He needed to give Law time to do his thing. There was no doubt that Law was taking in everything, his brilliant battle mind deciding how to kill these assholes most efficiently and lethally. Law knew how to take down the enemy. He only needed time.</p><p>A foot kicked the middle of his back, and Dominic fell to his knees. Jansen\u2019s goon tucked the barrel of his gun between Dominic\u2019s neck and brain stem. One shot and he was done. \u201cTell me now or I shoot.\u201d</p><p>A vision of Kinley reaching for him wafted across his brain. She\u2019d smiled slightly, like a beneficent goddess. She\u2019d drawn them together, accepting them all. Happiness might have been short lived, but while it lasted, it had been glorious.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m only talking to Jansen.\u201d Dominic closed his eyes and waited for whatever happened. It was so far from his usual behavior that he laughed.</p><p>\u201cGet up, then.\u201d Someone roughly grabbed him and jerked him to his feet. \u201cYou want to talk to the boss, fine. But we\u2019re tying your hands first. I have some zip ties in my bag. We cuff him then take him to the boss.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they had bound his wrists behind him, Dominic began the long walk to the back door, every step bringing him closer to Kinley. At least he would get to see her one last time.</p><p>Law watched as two assholes hauled Dominic along, forcing him to walk to the back of the house.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a shot. If he\u2019d had a sniper rifle on him, he could blow them away, but he didn\u2019t. He had his SIG Sauer and two hundred yards between him and two moving targets. And whichever one he didn\u2019t nail first would run and warn the rest of his crew, no doubt.</p><p>He had one chance to get back in that house.</p><p>Where was Riley? God, where was Kinley? He hoped they were together. He prayed Riley had holed up with her and hidden them well.</p><p>A thousand questions ran through his head, but in the end he didn\u2019t care who had come or why. He only cared that he killed every fucker who had walked into that house, threatening his family. He would kill and kill and kill until he got to their woman. That was his job now.</p><p>He moved from the right to the left, hugging the hanger, keeping his body low as they walked Dominic along the west wall of the house to the back door. All their attention was on Dominic. He disappeared inside with a gun poking the back of his neck.</p><p>And someone was moving from the east side of the house, his body close to the walls.</p><p>Riley. His brother was alive.</p><p>Law moved along the building, trying to reach the shortest distance between him and that back porch. Two hundred yards. He had to get there without taking a bullet.</p><p>Adrenaline rushed through his system.</p><p>Riley looked out over the space between them. He stilled, his body going utterly motionless.</p><p>Law\u2019s prayers were answered as Riley saw him. He glanced behind him, before motioning Law on.</p><p>Law took off, his feet darting across the ground in utter silence. All his years of training rushed back to him, making his every move a graceful leap of faith. He stalked the distance between him and Jansen\u2019s thugs. He\u2019d marked them for death. He would find them.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is Kinley?\u201d Law asked between gritted teeth as he caught up to his brother.</p><p>Their backs were against the wall, each looking in the opposite direction, waiting for the threat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Jansen.\u201d</p><p>Law was going to kill his brother. \u201cYou were supposed to stay with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJansen isn\u2019t going to kill her,\u201d Riley quietly explained. \u201cHe wants his diamonds too badly, so he\u2019s letting her think that he\u2019s rescuing her for now. This gives her time and a chance. I heard some of their conversation, and she\u2019s pretending that she\u2019s still afraid of us. If I had stayed, Jansen and his goons would probably have threatened to kill me. The truth would have come out, and they would have used me as leverage against Kinley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but now he\u2019ll take off with her.\u201d God, Jansen was probably getting ready to do that right now.</p><p>Panic threatened to overwhelm Law. He was an ice man, always cool under pressure, but the thought of his wife being taken hostage was just about enough to give him a heart attack and to send him running straight into that house like a madman.</p><p>Wife. She was their wife. It didn\u2019t matter that they hadn\u2019t taken vows. It didn\u2019t matter that he\u2019d never told her he loved her. She was theirs, and he refused to let her go.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t go anywhere without these.\u201d Riley pulled a piece of denim out of his pocket. \u201cWith the security system off, I managed to sneak in the side door before that asswipe put a guard on it. I snagged a pair of scissors and pulled the pockets off seven pairs before I heard them coming. I had to leave the rest there. I just managed to creep out. Between what I have and what Kinley hid, we\u2019ve managed to tuck away about eighty percent of those diamonds. He\u2019s not going anywhere without them.\u201d</p><p>So they had some kind of leverage. But so did Jansen. \u201cHe has Dominic.\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s eyes flared. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>Law shook his head. \u201cNo. We\u2019re all off our game, and we need to get the fuck back on it. Do you know how many men Jansen brought with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know there\u2019s a dead body near the front lawn. I\u2019m pretty sure that was Dominic\u2019s work. Inside, there\u2019s Jansen, Dargo, whom we saw in the elevator in New York, and at least one guy on all three of the doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think one left his post to bring Dominic in, maybe two.\u201d They needed to get in the house. He pulled his spare piece and handed it to his brother. \u201cTake an extra clip.\u201d</p><p>Riley flipped the safety off his handgun and slid the extra clip into his pocket. \u201cLet\u2019s head to the side door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we can take them down quietly, let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Jansen might be able to guess that Dominic had two accomplices since he and Riley had kidnapped Kinley. And because Jansen was Dominic\u2019s former brother-in-law, the asswipe probably knew a thing or two about who Dominic shared a sex life with. Given that, Jansen probably knew how much manpower Dominic had. So taking these fuckers by surprise would be tough but critical.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do we do if they threaten Kinley?\u201d</p><p>Eventually, they would do just that to force her to tell them what she knew. When she refused, they would kill her. \u201cWe have to take them out first.\u201d</p><p>Or die trying.</p><p>There was a high-pitched yipping from the other side of the house. Gigi ran around the corner, her tiny body darting through the grass. She yipped and howled and jumped as though trying to get their attention.</p><p>They didn\u2019t need that.</p><p>Gigi ran onto the porch and right to the back door, clawing at it in an attempt to get in.</p><p>Someone would come to investigate. Shit. He had mere seconds.</p><p>Law crossed the space and put his back to the outer wall.</p><p>The door swung open. A man leaned out, his whole focus on Kinley\u2019s little dog.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d the suited-up criminal asked.</p><p>Suddenly, Butch gave a low growl as he made his appearance. Jansen\u2019s tool stepped onto the deck and stared at the dogs. It was just enough of a distraction for Law to slide behind the man. Before Jansen\u2019s guard could lift his gun or fight back, Law had his head in his hands. With a vicious twist, a neat crunch filled the air as he broke his opponent\u2019s neck and released him. The goon slid to the ground.</p><p>The dogs both stepped around the body as they trotted into the house. Thank god the rat thing was an inside princess.</p><p>\u201cGigi, stay.\u201d He kept his voice down. Butch obeyed, so Gigi sat beside him. It wasn\u2019t exactly obedience, but at least she wasn\u2019t interested in biting the males in her mistress\u2019s life anymore.</p><p>And she was a creature of habit. Once they\u2019d settled in here in Alaska, he\u2019d noticed that. Kinley had that dog on a schedule. It was past her damn feeding time and Gigi would run through the house barking until someone fed or killed her.</p><p>Law looked down the hall. No one. He looked back and gave his brother the go sign.</p><p>\u201cRemind me to be more polite to you in the future,\u201d Riley whispered.</p><p>\u201cPut the dogs outside.\u201d Kinley would kill them if some prick shot her dog.</p><p>His brother stepped over the dead body and entered the house, shaking his head. \u201cI have a better plan. It\u2019s about time that thing earned her keep. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>Law followed, praying they were in time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kinley tried to give Greg her best blank expression. \u201cWhy would they do that to my gorgeous jeans? I loved them.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled a little. The tears were real. She was scared out of her mind, but she wasn\u2019t about to show him that. She would let him think that her eyes were watery because she couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her clothes being damaged.</p><p>Greg had turned red as he held the jeans up. He seemed to visibly take control of his reactions. \u201cDarling, I need you to tell me where the men who held you are. And where they\u2019ve stashed the rest of your luggage.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. He\u2019d allowed her to get dressed in pajama bottoms and a tank top, but she\u2019d felt utterly humiliated at being naked in front of him. It wasn\u2019t right. Her body was meant for Law, Riley, and Dominic. She\u2019d felt dirty with Greg\u2019s eyes on her. \u201cI don\u2019t know. This was all they left me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd where did they go?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the way his tone kept dropping. \u201cI have no idea. They told me I had ten minutes to shower, and then they closed the door and left me in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cKinley, the door was unlocked when I opened it. Why wouldn\u2019t your kidnappers lock you in?\u201d</p><p>They had, at first, but since she\u2019d started sleeping with them, the trust had built. But she wasn\u2019t about to tell Greg that. \u201cI thought it was locked. I guess they just think I\u2019m too dumb to run.\u201d She took a shaky breath. \u201cI\u2019m really just too afraid. There are wild animals out there.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief knock on the door, then Greg\u2019s right-hand, Vincent Dargo, opened it. \u201cBad news, boss. I just found Benny on the front lawn. He wasn\u2019t the shooter, but the one getting his ass shot. Alan isn\u2019t responding to my radio calls. We got trouble and we should move out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t found Anthony? He probably has those two fuckheads with him. Make sure there\u2019s a guard on every door. You check through every room of this house. I want that luggage.\u201d</p><p>Vincent grimaced. \u201cAlready found it. Uhm, some of the jeans are there, but I only found two pairs with the dia...pockets attached.\u201d</p><p>Greg held up the ones in his hand. \u201cThe rest are like this?\u201d</p><p>Vincent nodded. \u201cYeah. Anthony and whoever he\u2019s with probably got away with them. I think they took the product and ran. They could be in the fucking woods by now.\u201d</p><p>Greg turned his focus on her, but the sweet act was gone. His voice became darker. \u201cWhat do you think, darling? Do you think they\u2019re in the woods?\u201d</p><p>What had she forgotten? Kinley\u2019s mind raced with possibilities. Because he was obviously not buying her act anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give you one more chance, Kinley. First, explain the red handprints on your ass. You told me they simply scared you so I have to assume the spanking was consensual. Do you think I\u2019m an idiot? Do you think I don\u2019t know what that fucker Anthony and his perverted friends are into? I might have been able to believe you if I hadn\u2019t seen the proof of it myself. So try again, you fucking whore.\u201d</p><p>There was a certain freedom in being able to let go of her ruse. \u201cSo I take it you\u2019re willing to admit that Dominic didn\u2019t abuse his sister. You killed her. The same way you planned to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Greg\u2019s whole demeanor changed, the concern sliding off his face and revealing the snake that resided under his skin. \u201cOh, my darling girl, I\u2019m going to be so much rougher with you. I let Vince put Carrie down easy, but then she wasn\u2019t a whore. She simply heard too much one night and was going to tell her brother everything. Now, tell me where my diamonds are.\u201d</p><p>If she told him, she was dead. He very likely had a plan in place to frame Dominic for her murder and call it his sadistic revenge. So she couldn\u2019t tell Greg what she\u2019d done. She had to hope that Riley had gotten away and found Law and Dominic, and that they wouldn\u2019t leave her.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Greg slapped her right across the face. Kinley was shocked at the pain that lashed through her system. Within seconds, her skin began to swell, her flesh aching.</p><p>He tossed the jeans aside. \u201cYou stupid whore. Do you know what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound out how good sex with three real men can be?\u201d</p> <p>He wound his hand in her hair, pulling it until her scalp screamed. \u201cYour sister told me you were cold as ice. I believed her. I should have known that a woman always thinks with her cunt. Now, I can beat the holy fuck out of you all day long and everyone will blame your kidnappers. I have friends in the FBI. How do you think I got out of the first RICO charge? They managed to intercept your little lawyer friends\u2019 messages. They also found Anthony\u2019s ties to a company called Black Oak Oil. I thought it interesting that Black Oak had a company jet leave from New York the same day you were taken with a flight plan filed for Alaska. And that they also own this compound. It didn\u2019t take much to put two and two together when you can get a federal wiretap going. So you should know that I intend to visit your little friend Annabelle after I take care of you. I\u2019ll pay that bitch back and make sure the lawyers who helped Anthony never work again.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Greg taking revenge on Annabelle and her employers chilled Kinley, strengthened her resolve. She just had to survive, to take whatever he dished out. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so because I think whoever we were meeting in Bermuda will get to you first. I think that person is going to want their diamonds, and, oh, how sad, you seem to have lost them.\u201d</p><p>She braced herself, but he merely tightened his grip in her hair and started to drag her along.</p><p>Pain exploded along her scalp as he walked toward the center of the house.</p><p>\u201cVince, I think it\u2019s time we showed little Kinley here what we\u2019re capable of. She got herself kidnapped, but those dipshits haven\u2019t really hurt her. I think we should make up for that. I wouldn\u2019t want her to miss out on the full hostage experience.\u201d</p><p>Vincent was behind her, pushing her along when she stumbled. \u201cI agree. And though I know you like your women a little less chunky, I never minded fucking one with some meat on her bones. I can handle the rape portion of her experience.\u201d</p><p>Nausea welled. The thought of anyone else touching her made her stomach turn.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that. I definitely preferred fucking her sister.\u201d He turned to face Kinley. \u201cDid you know your sister is the one who offered you up to me? She\u2019s going to be my wife after you\u2019re dead. She\u2019ll be thrilled to know that I had one of my employees fuck you. Or you can tell us where the diamonds are and we can kill you quickly.\u201d Greg shoved her toward the couch in the main living room. To her left was the kitchen, in front of her the hallway that led to the office, and to the right were the massive bay windows that showed Kinley just how isolated they were.</p><p>No sign of anyone except Greg\u2019s hired muscle.</p><p>She was all alone. The feds weren\u2019t coming because the corrupt officers would stop them. Annabelle\u2019s bosses were thousands of miles away, and Kinley had no idea where her men were.</p><p>Vincent reached into his boot and brought out a wicked looking knife. It was black, and she had little doubt what it had been made for\u2014killing. \u201cI like playing games, too, you little whore.\u201d</p><p>Greg stared down at her. \u201cIf I had known you were into the kinky shit, I would have let Vince fuck you before the wedding. You\u2019re nothing but a piece of ass to a man, including the ones who kidnapped you. Do you really think Dominic Anthony gives a shit about you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, simply stared out that window, praying for a glimpse of them.</p><p>\u201cAnthony just wants revenge,\u201d Greg said. \u201cHe wants me. He\u2019ll go to any lengths for it, including fucking my fianc\u00e9e. Hell, I bet he enjoyed that since I screwed his sister. You were just a payback for him. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Maybe they had run. Maybe they were trying to get help.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think you could even get a man? You\u2019re twenty-five and the only man who ever asked you to marry him did it because you\u2019re a na\u00efve little idiot. If you honestly think those men wanted to fuck you, you\u2019re dumber than I thought.\u201d</p><p>She hated him. God, she hated him because he was really good at bringing out that nasty voice in her head, the one that told her she wasn\u2019t good enough for Law, Dominic, and Riley, that she wasn\u2019t smart enough or pretty enough. It was his true talent. He likely got a lot of women to hate themselves. Then they gave in to him.</p><p>But she could still feel Dominic\u2019s arms around her. His embrace hadn\u2019t felt like revenge. It had felt like what she\u2019d imagined love should be. Law hadn\u2019t been tricking her. Riley had fought the whole way...and still ended up wanting her.</p><p>The door from the kitchen swung open and her worst nightmare came through. Dominic\u2019s hands were bound behind his back, and it looked like they\u2019d already worked him over a bit. His eye was swollen and there was a trickle of blood on his chin.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold back the little gasp that fell from her mouth. Fear seized her.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mr. Anthony, it\u2019s so nice to see you again.\u201d That reptilian smile crossed Greg\u2019s face as he looked over the prisoner.</p><p>\u201cSorry I can\u2019t say the same.\u201d Dominic didn\u2019t look her way, just kept his eyes on Greg, not sparing her a glance.</p><p>Greg turned to his cohorts. \u201cDid it really take two of you to bring him in? Is Ross the only one still at his station? Vince, take charge of Mr. Anthony. You two get back to your posts. There are still two of them potentially out there. I\u2019m going to have a little talk with my bride and Mr. Anthony. Then we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p><p>The two thugs left, and Vincent took Dominic by the arm, forcing him to his knees.</p><p>Seeing him that way hurt Kinley\u2019s heart. He was always in charge, always in control. How humiliating it must be for him to be on his knees, at the mercy of his enemy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you look,\u201d Kinley offered. \u201cJust don\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s head came up. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Greg laughed, a nasty little sound. \u201cShe\u2019s being her true, idiotic self, Anthony. You fucked her, and now she thinks it\u2019s love. How about it? Do you love her? Is she your little sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s eyes slid away from hers. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t love her. I barely know her.\u201d</p><p>The words hurt, but she knew what he was doing. He was trying to save her, right? He had to be. He couldn\u2019t exactly declare himself here and now.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll still help you if you leave Dominic alone.\u201d She had to get the focus off Dominic.</p><p>\u201cKinley, you will not go anywhere with him.\u201d Dominic seemed to think he was still in charge of her at least.</p><p>\u201cAh, so you do have some feelings for the girl.\u201d Greg hauled her up again. \u201cTell me where the diamonds are or I might decide that I\u2019m bored.\u201d He ran a hand up to her breast. \u201cI might have to find a way to amuse myself. I like it when they scream, don\u2019t you, Anthony?\u201d</p><p>Now Dominic was looking straight at her with murder in his eyes. \u201cGet your fucking hands off her.\u201d</p><p>She caught sight of something moving in the background. Gigi ran into the room, heading toward the kitchen door. She barked as Butch loped into the room behind her.</p><p>It was feeding time. Gigi always reminded her it was dinnertime by standing at her bowl and barking incessantly. Her bowl was in the kitchen where the tiny dog was headed.</p><p>For the merest moment both Vincent and Greg had their eyes on the chaos that had just run in.</p><p>She heard a gunshot, then saw Dominic rear back, catching Vincent in the gut with the back of his head.</p><p>Kinley took advantage of the distraction by pulling her elbow and bringing it straight to Greg\u2019s chest. He cursed and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cKinley, get down!\u201d Law yelled as he entered the room, his gun drawn. He popped off a quick shot, hitting Vincent Dargo before the man could recover.</p><p>\u201cDrop the weapon, Jansen. I took out everyone you brought along,\u201d Law said, his eyes on Greg.</p><p>\u201cAnd I arranged the distraction with the dog,\u201d Riley said, holding his gun up. \u201cThat little bitch is getting a treat. So you really should drop the gun. The game is over.\u201d</p><p>Greg had never lost his footing. He stood tall. \u201cDon\u2019t you two realize? The game is never over. I\u2019m not going to be taken in.\u201d</p><p>Time seemed to slow down. Greg raised his gun and aimed, and Kinley could see exactly where the bullet would hit. Dominic scrambled to his feet, but his hands were bound behind his back.</p><p>He was helpless.</p><p>Without thinking of anything but saving Dominic, Kinley jumped just as Greg fired the gun.</p><p>She heard the sound of more gunfire splitting the air. It seemed to come from everywhere all at once.</p><p>And then she felt fire in her chest, an agony unlike anything she felt before. The air left her lungs. She gasped as she hit the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dominic\u2019s panicked face suddenly loomed over her. \u201cOh, god. She\u2019s hit. Get me out of these fucking ties.\u201d</p><p>Hit. It didn\u2019t feel like she\u2019d been hit. This was so much worse, like her chest had imploded. Fire scorched her lungs, taking away all the oxygen and leaving her gasping for the tiniest bit of breath.</p><p>But Dominic was alive and unharmed.</p><p>She held on to that thought as the world went dark.</p> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>The nurse took the tray from her bedside table. \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat anything, hon. You have to eat to get your strength back or they won\u2019t ever let you out of here.\u201d</p><p>Kinley looked over at the nurse. She was the nicest one Kinley had found since she\u2019d been admitted to the hospital in Anchorage two days before. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the doctor won\u2019t release me now. The surgery went fine.\u201d The bullet had merely nicked her lung.</p><p>She was ready to go home. Well, to whatever home she had left. And it appeared she would be going alone.</p><p>Two days and no visitors. No phones calls. Nothing.</p> <p>She was alone again.</p><p>\u201cWell, you need time to rest. You\u2019ve been through a lot. And the press figured out where you are. The hospital is surrounded by news vans. Doctor Craig is keeping them all away with some help from the police, too.\u201d</p><p>Ah, the police. \u201cI\u2019m sure they want to talk to me. I should just get it over with.\u201d</p><p>The nurse patted her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll tell the doctor you said you were ready. He\u2019s been holding them off because he\u2019s worried about you. You\u2019ve been...withdrawn. Do you think you\u2019re up for a visitor? There\u2019s a young woman out there who\u2019s very insistent on seeing you. We\u2019ve checked her out, and she isn\u2019t a member of the press. This woman says her name is Annabelle Wright. Would you like to see her?\u201d</p><p>Belle had come all the way to Anchorage? At least Kinley had one person she could count on through thick and thin. She nodded at the nurse. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Two minutes later, Annabelle rushed in, heels clicking on the cheap linoleum tiles, carrying a massive bouquet of flowers. \u201cOh, girl, you are going to be the death of me. Thank God you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p> <p>Tears welled in Annabelle\u2019s dark eyes as she set the flowers down and reached for Kinley\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m okay.\u201d She felt better with Annabelle here. A sense of comfort eased through her. It didn\u2019t stop the pain of Dominic, Law, and Riley\u2019s absence, but settled over the wound like a bandage. If she could stop the bleeding, maybe healing would follow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come all this way.\u201d</p><p>Annabelle shook her head. \u201cOf course, I did. God, Kinley, I got you into this. I agreed to help. I didn\u2019t imagine it would go so wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone is to blame, it\u2019s me. I wouldn\u2019t listen to you about Greg being an obnoxious douchebag killer.\u201d Kinley took a long breath. \u201cSpeaking of, I need to hire a lawyer. Can your guys recommend someone for me? I have to sue my sister.\u201d</p><p>Annabelle\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cThey haven\u2019t let you watch TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to.\u201d The last thing she wanted was to see the press interviewing Law, Riley, and Dominic, all alive and happy without her.</p><p>\u201cYour sister has been arrested for embezzlement. The files on your iPad showed plainly that she was the one who moved the money around. Then pictures of her with Greg Jansen doing the nasty surfaced. Your brother-in-law has already filed for divorce and is bringing the kids back from boarding school.\u201d</p><p>So those sweet kids would finally get the life they deserved. \u201cI\u2019m glad. So the FBI is investigating?\u201d</p> <p>Annabelle huffed. \u201cYou have no idea. They\u2019ve impounded the diamonds, including the ones they found in the shampoo bottles. Nice job there, Kin. They\u2019re investigating everything. They realized they have an internal leak.\u201d</p><p>One that had sent Greg Jansen straight to their hideout, where he\u2019d almost killed Dominic. Instead, he\u2019d shot her.</p><p>She could still hear Greg\u2019s voice telling her all the things that were wrong with her. He\u2019d preferred her sister. He\u2019d wanted someone thinner, someone blonder. Someone more devious. \u201cI hope they find the leak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bosses are going to force them to. They were wiretapping us. You do not do that to lawyers without expecting some backlash.\u201d She sighed a little.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank them for me, please. You saved me from a tropical death, so it seems. You were the only one willing to step up and do it.\u201d</p><p>No one in her family loved her. She would have to be grateful that Dominic had loved his sister enough to spend years bringing her killer to justice. Kinley had to be satisfied that she\u2019d helped with that effort. But the men themselves...they were obviously gone. She\u2019d probably been a total fool\u2014again\u2014to trust them, but she\u2019d always think of those few days at the James compound as some of her happiest.</p><p>Annabelle squeezed her hand. \u201cGosh, Kinley, I\u2019m so sorry they hurt you. I always knew Becks was a nasty bitch, but I can\u2019t believe she\u2019d actually steal from you and plot to kill you. And your dad is being investigated for his participation. If I had to guess, I think he\u2019s going down, too.\u201d</p><p>So everyone was getting what they deserved. Somehow it didn\u2019t make her feel better. It just depressed her more. The one bright spot was her niece and nephew coming home. Kinley had to be happy for that. She only hoped that Brian would allow her into the kids\u2019 lives.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll survive.\u201d Kinley tried to shrug, but the wound in her chest was stiff and sore. \u201cI guess I need to find a job.\u201d</p><p>Her charity was surely in limbo until the investigation was over, but she worried that with all the scandal it would go under anyway. She needed to be able to feed herself and buy kibble for her dog\u2014and any puppies that came from her illicit union.</p><p>Annabelle stared at her blankly, blinking in confusion. \u201cWhy would you do that? I mean, you need to wait until you\u2019ve settled into your new place in Dallas. Once the feds clear Hope House, you can start up again or find different work, if you want. I personally think you should sell your engagement ring to fund the reopening of Hope House, but I don\u2019t think those guys are going to let you get too far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys? Dallas?\u201d She\u2019d never actually been to Dallas. Why would Annabelle think she was moving to Dallas? Though she would definitely sell the ring. She liked the idea of hundreds of children being clothed by Greg\u2019s ring. \u201cI\u2019ve really been thinking about coming to Chicago. Hopefully, I can find a job there.\u201d</p><p>Annabelle was the only person on the planet that Kinley knew loved her. She trusted Belle more than anyone. It made sense to move closer to her best friend.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Annabelle squeezed her hand. \u201cSweetie, where do you think your men are?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, not wanting to have this particular conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The job was over. Mission accomplished. I\u2019m sure they moved on.\u201d Kinley looked away. \u201cThey aren\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think these flowers are from? If I\u2019d bought it, you would have two daisies, honey. But this is a really expensive arrangement. Those men gave me very specific instructions about what to buy you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the bouquet. They were high end, beautiful and expensive. The vase looked to be crystal. So at least they had wanted to send her something. They hadn\u2019t come in person...but she supposed she would have to mean something to them for that. \u201cI\u2019ll send them a thank you note.\u201d</p><p>It would be polite and formal. Dear Dominic, Riley, and Law, Thank you so much for the lovely floral arrangement and for saving my life. It was a kind thing to do. And I truly appreciated the lessons in sexuality and m\u00e9nage. I will never forget the spankings. They meant so much to me. Sincerely, Kinley Kohl. P.S., you owe me for puppy support.</p><p>Annabelle\u2019s phone chirped. She fished it out of her purse, then looked down at the screen. Her face lit up. \u201cThey made it inside. You have no idea how crazy it is out there. They\u2019ve been trying to make their way in here for hours. Wait a second.\u201d</p><p>She turned to the door and opened it. A man walked through wearing scrubs and carrying a clipboard. Two more men in scrubs followed him.</p><p>Her heart seized when she realized that under the bland clothes and masks, it was Riley, Law, and Dominic.</p><p>Law tore his mask away and stepped up to her side, his eyes wide. His expression softened as he took her in. \u201cBaby, tell us everything. We\u2019ve been dying. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>They were here. Why? \u201cUhm, I\u2019ve been here for days. I\u2019m alive. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Dominic took her hand. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been in a forty-eight-hour hold. The FBI has been questioning the hell out of us. They didn\u2019t have to give us a phone call or any rights. And the hospital is in virtual lockdown because of the media frenzy out there. Annabelle only got in because Tate threatened to sue the hospital. We had to sneak in to see you, Kinley.\u201d</p><p>Riley moved around to her opposite side and cupped her cheek. \u201cAre you okay? They wouldn\u2019t tell us anything. They said we weren\u2019t husbands or family, so we didn\u2019t have rights to your information. God, I hated every moment they kept us away from you. We need to fix that.\u201d</p><p>He tried to pull her gently into an embrace.</p><p>What the hell were they talking about? She held herself stiffly until Riley eased back with a frown. \u201cWho kept you away?\u201d</p><p>She still didn\u2019t quite understand why Law, Dominic, and Riley had come. When she\u2019d awakened alone, that had felt like a statement\u2014one full of finality. She\u2019d heard all those voices in her head that told her she wasn\u2019t good enough or pretty enough. That she would never be what three incredible men wanted. No one had been there to hold her hand or talk to her or reassure her that everything would be all right. Because no one cared.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying that we were held for questioning, pet.\u201d Dominic reached for her other hand. \u201cDo you understand? They held us the full forty-eight hours because your doctors wouldn\u2019t allow you to answer questions. And our lawyers took their damn time getting here.\u201d</p><p>Tears threatened. She couldn\u2019t deny how much she loved seeing them, even if she wasn\u2019t sure why they\u2019d come. Guilt? \u201cNo one said anything. They wouldn\u2019t even tell me what happened to Gigi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hired a dog sitter,\u201d Law said quickly. \u201cWe flew them out on a private plane. She\u2019s fine. She and Butch are going to be here tomorrow so we can all fly out together.\u201d</p><p>So they planned to take her home. That was nicer than making her find her own way back. She supposed that was the polite thing to do, given that they weren\u2019t really in the kidnapping business. \u201cIt will be good to get back to New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to New York.\u201d Law crossed his arms over his chest in a deeply forbidding gesture. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Dallas.\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s jaw firmed stubbornly. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere but home with us, Kinley. I know you\u2019ll have things to clear up there, but not until the press\u2019s interest dies down. We\u2019re going to hole up at Dominic\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our place, not just mine anymore. It\u2019s our home, and we want to take you there with us.\u201d Dominic took her hand.</p><p>Why? The question floated through Kinley\u2019s head, but she didn\u2019t speak it. What was the purpose? To put them in the position where they had to explain the duty they felt to her, the responsibility to make sure she was safe from the media, the feds, and whoever else wanted a chunk of her?</p><p>\u201cKinley, we\u2019re going about this all wrong.\u201d Dominic raked a hand through his hair.</p><p>Annabelle rolled her eyes. \u201cYou sure are.\u201d</p><p>Dominic ignored her. \u201cKinley, pet, we want you to marry us and live with us. We\u2019ll take care of you in every way. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>Annabelle rolled her eyes. \u201cDoms. What is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Hope lit up a corner of Kinley\u2019s heart, but she refused to settle for less than everything. She wouldn\u2019t be the girl who took less than she deserved ever again. \u201cI won\u2019t live with men who see me as just a responsibility to be taken care of. I won\u2019t marry men who don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s eyes flared. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said the words either, pet.\u201d</p><p>He had a point, just not a good one. \u201cI got shot saving you. That should speak very clearly about my feelings. After all, I\u2019ll bear the scars of loving you for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Dominic turned stark white. He looked somewhere between horrified and tongue tied, and suddenly Kinley believed what they were trying to say. It took everything she had not to giggle. She loved teasing her Dom Dom.</p><p>\u201cYou will never do that again.\u201d He pointed a finger at her. \u201cI swear to god, pet, if you ever throw yourself bodily in front of a bullet again, we will give you the spanking of a lifetime. You won\u2019t be able to sit down for a week. A month. And there will be no orgasms. Ever again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Law moved in, wearing a grin on his rugged face. She loved seeing him smile. \u201cForgive him, baby. We\u2019re all still in a little bit of shock. We thought you were going to die, that we\u2019d lost you. I love you, Kinley. And if you don\u2019t come home with us and be our wife, I\u2019ll do everything I can to persuade you. No, I suck at that. I\u2019ll pester you.\u201d He sighed. \u201cFuck that. I\u2019ll just kidnap you again until you say \u2018I do.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Riley glared at his brother. \u201cSmooth, bro. Thanks.\u201d Then Riley focused all his attention on her. \u201cI love you, Kinley. Will you please marry us?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes, happy ones. After Simone, she knew how much it took for Riley to be the one to ask. \u201cYes, and I love you so much. You, too, my stubborn and humorless Master. I love you, Dom Dom.\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughed, the sound booming through the room and filling her with joy. \u201cI love you, pet. And once you\u2019re healthy again, you\u2019ll see just how much.\u201d</p> <p>They all surrounded her, crowding her as they began to talk about what had happened. They held her and kissed her and promised to never be apart.</p><p>Kinley sat back and relaxed because she was with her men. Her loves. Her future. Her forever. </p>  </body></html>"]
