The depth and darkness of that inner truth can be the precursor that determines ones lifeline or, perhaps, eventually, personality. To err is human, so I'm told. But my mistakes and regrets were buried so deep, darkened my soul so black, that they were no longer secrets, but bars on a prison I trapped myself in, I guess. And if I opened that door, if I let them out, there was a strong chance that those who love me might never look at me the same. I couldn't live with that; I was the treasure in everyone\u2019s life\u2014the little girl who was born still, without hope of ever taking a breath. To show them what I truly was would be to destroy them.</p><p>They say that death blessed me with skin pale as the moon, soft as a rose petal, and lips coloured with blood. The day I was born, my parents held my tiny, dead body for a last goodbye, but all the tears in the world couldn't restore life. Until they did.</p><p>Mum always said my father\u2019s love saved me\u2014that as his hands touched my breathless form, I started coughing, which became crying and, finally, blue skin turned pink, renewing the room with hope. His large hands laid open, cradling this screaming child like a curious new stone and a breath passed before they could move, before they could dare to believe I was alive.</p> <p>My mother named me for my grandmother, Amara, which means \u201ceverlasting.\u201d But I no longer wear that name with pride; she was a woman of beauty and kindness, something I could not liken to. Not anymore.</p><p>How could that miracle, that child they proclaimed to be the \u201cblossom of life,\u201d have become something so dark, so tainted, that the wish they had for her to breathe would one day become the mistake they regretted?</p><p>I had ended life and, in that, was not worthy of mine any longer.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose, hurry up. You\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, Vic\u2014uh, Mom,\u201d I called down to the woman at the base of the stairs. \u201cJust finishing my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair\u2019s perfect,\u201d she called back. I rolled my eyes, unwinding the long braid, then scooped the dark waves into a ponytail, pulling the elastic band out again after a few seconds to fluff it around my face. It was Murphy\u2019s Law\u2014to be starting a new school, in a new country, on a bad hair day.</p><p>With a deep huff at my reflection, I stood back; the girl in the mirror looked as miserable as my soul felt. Even the smile she\u2019d practiced so many times just looked forced\u2014overly polite. But it was the best we could do. On the bright side, I was lucky to have stayed so thin over the months. Even with all the emotions I\u2019d been eating, my yellow dress still looked nice on me. Maybe too fem for school. Maybe not. I had no way of knowing what the kids over here wore or even if long hair was fashionable. For all I knew, I could be heading into a one-way popularity suicide jump. And I think, in truth, that\u2019s why I wore this dress. I kinda wanted to just blend in\u2014stay away from everyone. But being cast as a frigid dork on day one served my purpose too.</p><p>I turned away from the mirror, stuffed a summer cardigan in my bag and readied myself by the bedroom door.</p><p>Step one on Ara-Rose\u2019s road to recovery: new school.</p><p>A lanky galoot passed me in the hall, giving a cool nod as he ruffled a hand through his bed-hair, shrugging his backpack onto both shoulders. Where I came from, that was something only dorks did.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d I huffed. \u201cI hate being called Amara, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d His shoulders dropped. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Butt-face suits you so much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d I said as he stalked down the stairs. \u201cWell...it suits you better more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d he called, slamming the front door on my humiliation.</p><p>I slapped my own brow, shaking my head. My knack for sibling rivalry needed improvement.</p><p>\u201cMorning, honey,\u201d Dad said, coming out of his room at the end of the hall, wearing his suit and an expectant grin.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d</p><p>I stood on my toes, pressing my forehead into his kiss. \u201cNo. I'm actually fine.\u201d But my pathetic giggle exposed the truth my words buried.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. You just need to get back into living, honey. After all, it\u2019s been two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I\u2019d been counting the days. \u201cBut...what if someone says something mean and I start crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays something about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>He clicked his tongue. \u201cThe scars?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my eyes on my feet.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you are beautiful. And these\u2014\u201d I flinched a little when he touched my jaw. \u201cThe doctor said they\u2019d completely fade, eventually, and for now\u2014well, they\u2019re barely visible. You\u2019re still my beautiful girl.\u201d</p><p>Beautiful? My lip quivered. \u201cHow can you even say that, Dad? Maybe I was once, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, don\u2019t cry. It\u2019ll be okay. Hey\u2014\u201d He squished my cheeks together. \u201cLook, all the kids there are great. You\u2019re going to love it, I promise. But you know the hardest part of a journey is always the first step. And look at you; all dressed up, lookin\u2019 pretty, and you\u2019ve got your little backpack. The hard part\u2019s over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, actually, I think the hard part\u2019s gonna be the whispers and stares when I walk into that school with a neon sign over my head that says \u2018New\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He laughed once. \u201cWould you like me to drive you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d A frown replaced my pout. \u201cIt\u2019s across the road. I\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could walk with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. That\u2019ll really help me blend in, won\u2019t it? I might even be lucky enough to get my head flushed down the toilet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of the kids there are like that. I think you\u2019ll be just fine. Now\u2014\u201d he turned me toward the stairs and gave a soft shove, \u201c\u2014go to school. And don\u2019t come home until you\u2019ve been a normal teenager for at least a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I called over my shoulder, vaguely aware of Dad following. I opened the front door and stepped outside, hearing it close behind me with a certain amount of farewell in the sound that did not permit return. I had been officially kicked out of the house for the day. No more moping, Ara-Rose. Time to move on. After all, they\u2019ve been dead now for two whole months. Not like you should still be grieving.</p><p>\u201cBoo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d The sudden noise pushed my heart up my throat. \u201cGod damn it, Sam, you little butt-head.\u201d I leaped off the porch step, dumped my backpack on the grass, and ran after him. \u201cCome back here and I\u2019ll make it quick.\u201d</p><p>He ducked behind Dad\u2019s car. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Mom if you do it, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ara-Rose!\u201d I stomped my foot.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a stupid name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as stupid as your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He stood up, holding his hands out. \u201cThat\u2019s all you could come up with?\u201d</p><p>I huffed, stomping once in his direction; he bolted behind the tree, cackling. \u201cYou\u2019re such a pain, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather be that than whiney and melodramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not melodramatic. I'm expressive. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d I let my voice quiver a little and squatted down with my face in my hands, tucking my dress in first so my underwear wouldn\u2019t show. He was about to see how melodramatic I could be.</p><p>\u201cAw, sis, I didn\u2019t mean\u2019ta make ya cry...\u201d he said, making the stupid mistake of touching my shoulder. I grabbed his wrist, calling on three years\u2019 worth of self-defence training, and jammed my shoulder into his chest\u2014flipping him onto the grass in front of me.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d He coughed out, rolling into a ball on his side. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Amara again and I\u2019ll be happy to demonstrate.\u201d I dusted my hands off, stepped over the pile of Sam and walked to the curbside. But an invisible barrier stopped me; I merely watched the students across the road, filing up the stairs to my future daily obligation.</p><p>\u201cBell\u2019s gone, Ara-Rose. We\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell, you might like after-school detention, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to babysit me, Sam. You can walk ahead.\u201d</p><p>He went quiet for a second; the call of teens laughing and a whistle blowing somewhere on the football field seeming suddenly really loud. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad there, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not. I still don\u2019t wanna go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople\u2019re really nice,\u201d Sam offered. I looked up at him\u2014all the way up. His height shaded me from the morning glare, leaving the simple, easy-going smile he inherited from my dad to warm the moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them to be nice. I want them to leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy.\u201d He shrugged, readjusting his backpack, then wandered onto the road. \u201cIf you want them not to like you, just be yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! I\u2019m going to kill you this time, pest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to catch me first.\u201d</p><p>I charged after him, my sudden movement making him squeal like a girl, though it kind of sounded like a bumblebee. \u201cI used to run track, Sam, remember? You won\u2019t get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, used to. But I doubt those twig legs could even catch a renegade granny with a walking-stick.\u201d He took off again when I glared at him, and I bet he thought he\u2019d escape, darting so gracefully over the grass, but he hadn\u2019t counted on me being a little fitter than I let on\u2014until I grabbed his shoulder. \u201cOh no, don\u2019t kill me, I take it back.\u201d</p><p>I reached past his shielding hands and punched him. \u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d He rubbed his arm as I walked away. \u201cYou punch like a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you owe me.\u201d He caught up to me, grinning.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I got you to school\u2014without all the tears and fuss.\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking, turning to smirk at Sam.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day, sis.\u201d He skipped off with a wide stride and disappeared into the building\u2014now only a few steps in front of me.</p><p>I stood staring up at it like some kid who found a wall of broccoli with their name on it, ignoring the increasing volume of Dad\u2019s house calling my return. I refused to even give it a backward glance. If I did, I\u2019d surely run back across the grass, screeching like Sam, and hide under my bed for the day.</p><p>Instead, I bit my lip, considering the mundane scene beyond the glass doors with a bit of disappointment; it was nothing like American high schools on TV. Everything was plainly coloured and all the kids looked normal; no glamorous groups of girls walking down the hall, flicking their hair while guys parted for them. No one was dancing or singing and, thankfully, no slushies. There were lockers, though\u2014greyish-brown ones. Not big enough to be stuffed inside.</p><p>A few boys ran past me in a tight, sweaty group, tripping their way up the cement steps, ignoring my neon sign, despite the word \u2018New\u2019 having grown so big now it was making my shoulders sink. When the doors slammed behind them and the crowd parted, I braved step one, then step two, stopping dead at step three, catching sight of two heavy black boots\u2014beyond the glass. My eyes traced them up the denim jeans to a black shirt, rolled up over the elbows of a guy. The head, however, was gone. Or rather, hidden behind the doorhandles. But one thing was for sure; he was looking this way\u2014perhaps at me, standing dead still while people moved all around him, laughing and acting normal. And my nerve-wracked brain concluded one thing, practically screaming out loud, Sweet mother of all things inhumanly awkward, please do not let him be planning to greet the new kid.</p><p>I dumped my bag on the step and grabbed my cardigan to cover my arms\u2014hopefully to hide my face in too. Then, with my chin tucked toward the concealment of my collarbones, I threw my bag over one shoulder and continued with the inevitable.</p><p>By the time I reached step seven, Mr Black Boots, with his hands in his pockets, had progressed forward as well. I closed my eyes and, praying he\u2019d just disappear, pushed the door open, waking with a gasp when a hand grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cNew?\u201d said a girl with a very bright smile, her blonde ponytail bouncing behind her.</p><p>\u201cUr, no.\u201d I looked to where the boy had been standing and, thankfully, my prayers were answered.</p><p>She giggled. \u201cI\u2019m Emily Pierce.\u201d Her extended hand shook mine; I drew it back quickly. \u201cCheer Captain and\u2014\u201d she tilted her head, \u201c\u2014your self-appointed tour guide.\u201d</p><p>Self-appointed tour guide? I considered this bouncy girl for a second, forming an opinion on her that probably wasn't fair. But, as far as I was concerned, it really should be illegal to wear skirts that short to school and, so, maybe her perfect skin and confident disposition was a little threatening\u2014maybe it forced a pang of jealousy in me, but I think I really just didn\u2019t like this girl.</p><p>The door swung closed behind me then, pushing me into the school with a whack on the butt. \u201cI uh\u2014\u201d I moved out of the way for another group of people coming in. \u201cI really don\u2019t need a tour guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but, good luck finding anything around here. Kids strip the labels off the doors and switch them around for just this sort of occasion.\u201d She turned away. \u201cIf you want to be the laughing stock\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I caught up. \u201cFine. Where\u2019s the office, then? I need to get a schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this way.\u201d She pointed forward, smiling. \u201cSo, do you have a name?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My fingers tightened around my backpack. \u201cUm, yeah. Ara-Rose.\u201d</p><p>She drew a breath through her teeth. \u201cYikes. Do you go by Ara? The whole Rose thing\u2019ll get dropped around here anyway, you know, \u2018cause it kinda sounds a little... antique.\u201d</p><p>I smiled pleasantly, remembering that being normal meant fitting in; slapping a girl you just met led to detention. \u201cI guess just Ara\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, but scowled at the girl when she wasn't looking, thinking I should start shortening her name. In fact, that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. Well, maybe later, assuming we ever talked again after this one time.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what brings you to our school?\u201d the girl asked.</p><p>Death, Tragedy. \u201cMy feet.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me, then, seeing I was joking, actually laughed. And I suddenly liked her so much more. \u201cSeriously. Did you just move here or were you, like, expelled from another school?\u201d</p><p>I wondered if I looked like the sort of kid who\u2019d get expelled. \u201cSea change.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cEccentric mom?\u201d</p> <p>My brow crinkled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I mean, most of the new kids come here because their moms decided to be a painter or marry a man they met on the Net. Eccentric moms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I tried to laugh. \u201cNo. Just a sea change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, our gain,\u201d she said, linking arms with me as if we were friends.</p><p>I laughed awkwardly, using the excuse of adjusting my backpack to break away from her. And she talked non-stop after that\u2014her high voice too fast for my ears, while I let my mind wander in the ugliness of the d\u00e9cor. Brown seemed to be the preferred colour at this school and, in my yellow dress, I blended in too easily with the linoleum floors. But it was better than black, I suppose, which had been the only colour I really took notice of anymore. Not that I wore black, but everything just felt black.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Emily called from a few steps ahead. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p> <p>I snapped out of my state, realising my feet had stopped moving. \u201cOh, yeah, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d</p><p>I walked quickly past her curious stare. \u201cI, uh. I kind of faze out sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do you have, like, a brain condition or something?\u201d</p><p>I laughed for real this time. \u201cNo, just an over-active imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Well, you should fit in just fine here, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Not.</p><p>She stopped walking. \u201cWere you being sarcastic?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBecause, you know, we started back last week. If you wanted to be a wallflower, you should have started with all the other new kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was...\u201d I looped my thumb around my backpack strap. \u201cI wasn\u2019t quite ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you like attention.\u201d</p><p>Attention, I didn't really have a problem with. It was questions I wanted to avoid or, well, answers.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d She linked her arm through mine again. \u201cLet\u2019s just find out where your first class is.\u201d</p><p>The corridor had gone quiet\u2014all the students closing the plain brown doors on the noise in each classroom, leaving only the occasional squeak of Emily\u2019s sneaker on the linoleum. Ahead of us, pale light filtered in through the glass doors leading to a parking lot, making the floor gleam in an eerie way, like something out of a post-apocalyptic horror film.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Emily said, stopping abruptly by a door on the right, her ponytail swinging behind her again. \u201cThis is the school office and your first stop on today\u2019s tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d I nodded, fake-smiling again. \u201cCan you just show me to the last stop?\u201d</p><p>She laughed and pushed the door open. \u201cSure. As soon as the last bell rings.\u201d</p><p>Inside the quiet, muggy room, a lady behind the desk, talking softly on a phone tucked into her chin, looked up and smiled, issuing a straight finger at us while she wrote something down. \u201cOkay, Mrs Rossi, I\u2019ll let them know. You just tell him to get some rest and we\u2019ll see him back here next week. Okay, bye.\u201d She hung up, stashed the note elsewhere, then looked at me; I shrunk, contemplating a quick dive to hide under the desk. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Miss Pierce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew kid.\u201d Emily leaned her forearms on the counter. \u201cNeed her schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName?\u201d She put her glasses on and fingered through a pile of manila folders.</p><p>\u201cUm, Ara-Rose,\u201d I said, stepping closer.</p><p>She stopped searching. \u201cAmara-Rose?\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s eyes fell on me.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The lady woke up then and, in a jittery fashion, fumbled about her papers. \u201cI\u2019ll just find your file here among all this mess, and\u2014\u201d her voice trailed off. \u201cHaven\u2019t had a chance to read it yet. Been so busy with all this stuff here. Ah, here we go.\u201d She put her glasses on. \u201cYes, this is you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the folder, wondering when I had become an A-Four piece of stationery.</p><p>\u201cWell, um, here\u2019s your class schedule\u2014\u201d She handed me a piece of paper. \u201cAnd you can just go ahead and take one of those there maps ya see.\u201d</p><p>Emily handed me a pamphlet from the desktop. I ran my fingers over it, biting my lip to hide a hint of a grin. This little piece of paper was my new best friend.</p><p>\u201cNow, Emily, can you show Amara-Rose to her first class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to.\u201d Emily grabbed my hand and dragged me from the room, but even as the door closed, the eyes of Reception Lady lingered along my nerves. \u201cI bet you have English first period.\u201d She snatched my schedule, then grinned widely. \u201cYou do. I hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, too.\u201d I took the paper back and frowned at it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just....\u201d She started walking; I followed. \u201cYou have David Knight in your class.\u201d</p><p>I scratched my head, choosing to ignore her complete lack of composure. \u201cSchool heartthrob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guessed it. I mean, he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, really\u2014to most girls, but he\u2019s just so damn cute no one cares.\u201d</p><p>My lip curled. I bit it. This girl had issues. \u201cI don\u2019t like jerks, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-mm.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe won\u2019t be a jerk to you. You haven't done anything to annoy him yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and he totally goes for that lost lamb thing you\u2019ve got going.\u201d She motioned to me\u2014all of me.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, well, my biggest concern for senior year is not what some jerk-face cute guy thinks of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you haven\u2019t seen him yet.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. As if I\u2019d ever be that pathetic.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She considered me again for a second. \u201cHe is just going to snatch you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be worried?\u201d I wasn't partial to being snatched.</p><p>\u201cNo way. They\u2019d deny it, but any girl in the school would give their right arm to be snatched by David.\u201d</p><p>Or maybe just you would.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She stopped again. I wanted to keep walking\u2014right past the glass doors, out to the front parking lot and into the closet under the stairs back at Dad\u2019s house. \u201cHere\u2019s Room One; you\u2019re late, but people will only whisper about you for the first ten or so minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I faked another smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d She curled a fist in front of the door and said, \u201cTake a deep breath.\u201d</p><p>I tried, but the deep gasp of air just formed another lump in my throat, making me dizzy as I held it in.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you can let it out.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>My head moved; I think I nodded. Then, Emily rapped lightly on the door, sending my nerves into a frenzy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I could handle nerves, and butterflies in my stomach were just yesterday\u2019s breakfast, but these felt more like bats. Big black, hairy bats.</p><p>The door clinked and popped open a little, revealing a shiny head with a light tuft of hair around the ears. \u201cEmily? What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Ara. She\u2019s new.\u201d Emily presented me.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Of course.\u201d He turned to look at my face; his eyes warm, his grey-brown moustache curving atop his grin. \u201cAra, is it, not Amara-Rose?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head\u2014maybe I should\u2019ve nodded. Who knows?</p><p>\u201cWell, Ara, I hope you\u2019re a much quieter student than this lot.\u201d He jerked his thumb to the noisy class; I tried to look past him to get a handle on the room, so as not to trip on anyone when I walked in, but he was in the way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to worry about that, Mr Benson. She\u2019s hardly said two words.\u201d</p><p>The teacher looked back at me, straightening up a little, making my heart race as if I\u2019d just run a block, which seemed like a viable option, just...in the other direction. \u201cAre you nervous, Ara?\u201d</p><p>I nodded slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a new school before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I tell you what...\u201d He touched his chin, then turned and signalled into the class. \u201cI think I have a solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr B.\u201d A boy stepped up before I expected him to, and a short gasp escaped my lips, making my heart skip a beat that it would never recover. I wanted to grab Emily, who stifled a giggle beside me, and shake her for being right about a boy so cute you\u2019d picture yourself in his arms without even knowing his name. I really hoped this wasn't Mr B\u2019s idea of a \u2018solution\u2019 to my anxiety.</p><p>As the boy settled into his lean on the doorframe, his casually-dishevelled dark-brown hair fell into his eyes; he swept it back, and any hope of composure withered away with the hold of that smile; how his dark-pink lips sat closed and turned up sharply in the corners, his gaze fixing mine in place. He seemed completely unfazed by my totally obvious ogling. I even felt myself rise onto my toes; my inner fantasies wandering off to a world where I shoved Mr Benson aside and stepped up to charm the hell out of this boy with my sassy disposition. But the true, witless me stood, mouth gaping, begging my skin not to drop my bones all over the floor.</p><p>\u201cAra? This is David,\u201d Mr Benson said, eyeing the proverbial drool on my lip.</p><p>Time came rushing back like a smack across the face; I snapped my gob shut and wiped my chin, glad there wasn\u2019t actually drool there. I already knew that boy was David; my reaction completely mirrored the stupidity I despised in Emily two minutes ago.</p><p>David\u2019s smile changed then, became wider, drawing me in to his world, almost inviting me to be his friend. But the dimples beside his lips made promises I knew they\u2019d never keep. \u201cHello, Ara.\u201d He nodded, almost like a bow.</p><p>Breathe, Amara-Rose, just breathe. I lifted my hand a little to wave. No words came out, though. Pathetic.</p><p>\u201cAra, David is my best student,\u201d Mr Benson said, then looked at the boy. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d The boy stole his gaze away, his head turning before his eyes left mine, and shoved his hands into his pockets, his shoulders lifting as if he was some kind of shy guy. No freakin\u2019 way.</p><p>\u201cAra\u2019s a little worried about coming to a new class,\u201d Mr Benson said. \u201cWould you take her to the library and fill her in on last week\u2019s lessons, please?\u201d</p><p>A sudden wash of relief brought my body back to life. I wanted to hug Mr Benson for being so considerate.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d David smiled at me again, the sound of his voice running through me, like milk for my soul\u2014liquid with maturity, yet simultaneously weightless.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Mr Benson went to walk away but stopped. \u201cAnd keep your charms to yourself, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, sir,\u201d he said, looking right at me with those smiling green eyes.</p><p>And my cheeks exploded with heat, sending it to my ears. I looked down at my feet, biting my spreading grin.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, Ara, you take care, and I\u2019ll see you in class tomorrow.\u201d Mr Benson patted my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, looking him directly in the eye this time.</p><p>\u201cYou are more than welcome.\u201d He turned to face the boy. \u201cDavid, you can get your stuff.\u201d</p><p>For a split second, as David and Mr Benson walked away, I braved a glance into the room of dread\u2014seeing only a desk and a whiteboard. Looked normal enough. I\u2019d imagined fiery pits and wailing souls. Guess I was wrong.</p><p>Emily squeaked, bouncing on her toes. I actually wanted to squeal, too. She was so right. He was so hot!</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You\u2019re so lucky.\u201d She waved two handfuls of spirit-fingers.</p><p>\u201cLucky? I have to spend forty minutes alone with that guy.\u201d I pointed into the class.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Ara. You\u2019re going to love David.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what I was worried about. \u201cHe\u2019s not that cute,\u201d I said, but the lie showed in my tone, shouting to the world that I was as pathetic as Emily.</p><p>She rolled her head to one side. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to like him, you know. We\u2019re only human.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed my pride and said, \u201cDoes he have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Emily leaned closer. \u201cHe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Mr Benson.\u201d David\u2019s smooth voice filled the hallway a second before he stepped out of the classroom, carrying his bag and a stack of books.</p><p>Emily straightened up, poorly masking her conspicuous smile.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, Emily?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me then and studied my face with slightly narrowed eyes\u2014as if maybe he was trying to figure me out. I wished him luck. \u201cYou ready, new girl?\u201d</p><p>I managed to nod. Somehow, staying with Mr Benson seemed more appealing. I was going to make a fool of myself in front of this boy, I just knew it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Emily touched my arm. \u201cDavid will take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late for class, Emily,\u201d he said in a dull tone, looking at his watch.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well. Have fun, Ara, and...I\u2019ll see you at lunch?\u201d she asked, her eyes round, hopeful.</p> <p>Terrific, I\u2019d just made a new friend without even trying. Great. Not. \u201cThanks, Emily, and yeah, sure, I\u2019ll see you at lunch, then.\u201d</p><p>She skipped off, beaming, but as she reached the corner, stopped to fan her chin, mouthing what looked like \u201cHe\u2019s so hot,\u201d right as David turned to catch her.</p><p>I allowed a small smile, watching her quickly press her hands behind her back as she disappeared around the corner, leaving David and I completely alone.</p><p>My heart pumped blood the wrong way around my body, and the beat bounced off every wall in the school\u2014a suspenseful soundtrack to a gripping scene. I forced myself to look up from my shoes, and though I sat for hours last night scripting topics for just this sort of occasion, when I met David\u2019s gaze, it was all gone\u2014escaped me completely. All I could find was a white cloud of wordless stupor. I was without ammunition, alone in the wilderness, with a lion.</p><p>\u201cCome, I\u2019ll show you to the library.\u201d He started walking. I stayed put, safe and snug against the wall, where I couldn't trip on my own nerves. He didn't even notice I stayed behind, just walked ahead without me. Or maybe he did notice but chose to ignore it, figuring I\u2019d eventually move. But staying behind gave me a great vantage point for hotness-evaluation; I could see the definition in his back through that black shirt\u2014could see the marvellous contours of his arms and how his torso seemed to taper inward at the waist, like an upside-down triangle, despite his otherwise very slim form. I\u2019d seen that kind of physique, but a little bigger, only on guys in the football teams back home. Which made me wonder if David was a football jock. If he so, he disguised that stereotypical arrogance really well under the impression of a kind, well-mannered boy.</p> <p>\u201cHey, are you coming?\u201d he said, walking backward to face me.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. Sorry.\u201d I pushed away from the wall and started after him, giggling to myself when he turned away. I always knew the world was unnaturally cruel and today I learned it could also be cruel in an unbelievably giving way.</p><p>David strolled along silently beside me, focusing on the path ahead. I didn't know if I should\u2014or could\u2014say something to break the silence, which made it turn suddenly into the uncomfortable sort. Yet, he didn't seem uncomfortable, and his self-satisfied grin made me feel almost like he could hear every deranged, lustful thought I was having.</p><p>I rocked my jaw, searching deep inside for that level-headed girl in me who didn\u2019t get pummelled by a cute face. She was dead, though. David killed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you focusing on in your last school\u2014for English studies?\u201d he asked in that buttery voice, like, if I could swallow it in one gulp, it wouldn\u2019t even touch the sides of my throat.</p><p>\u201cThe standard stuff,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in any advanced classes or anything.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cDo you read much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his feet.</p><p>I felt bad for that answer; it was probably a little vague\u2014maybe even rude. I just...I wanted him to keep talking, but...not ask any questions.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked, with a sassy grin.</p><p>\u201cWhy not what?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, the corner of his lip creeping up to his dimple. \u201cWhy don't you read anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no reason. What do you like to read?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed to himself. \u201cDracula, Jamaica Inn, Pride and Prejudice. I actually read quite a bit. Though, not so much anymore, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked, curious about his reasons. Also curious as to why a seventeen-year-old boy would admit to reading Pride and Prejudice of his own free will.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say\u2014\u201d he grinned as he leaned against the wall near another brown door, \u201c\u2014I have better things to do with my time at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, yeah me too,\u201d I added.</p><p>He laughed and stood up from the wall, patting the door. \u201cSo, this is the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d It sat inconspicuously in the long wall of the first floor corridor, rather oddly-placed for such an important room. If David wasn\u2019t with me, I might\u2019ve passed it completely.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let looks deceive you. It\u2019s actually quite well-stocked,\u201d he said, opening the door.</p><p>We stepped inside and shelves of books, practically touching the ceiling, greeted us with the rich smell of old pages. A group of study desks marked the centre of the brightly lit space, and computers lined the wall on one side. It seemed the school made up in supplies for what it lacked in style.</p><p>\u201cThey fit a lot into a small room, don't they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d my unfairly gorgeous tour guide said simply, standing motionless beside me. \u201cWould you like a seat?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to ask if he meant I could take one home with me, to keep, but was afraid the corniness might show me up for the dweeb I really was. So, I started off with a determined stride and, using my ankle, kicked a chair out at the circle of study desks. The lone student beside me didn\u2019t bother to look up as I dumped my bag down, unzipped it and stuffed my schedule inside. But then, he most likely didn\u2019t hear me approach since the music coming from his earphones could be heard in London.</p><p>\u201cAre we allowed iPods in here?\u201d I asked, looking up to meet David's stare.</p><p>He made no effort to look away, smiling before saying, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And my pulse quickened. He just looked so pleased with himself for something, like a schoolboy who just got a new video game. \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed iPods at my old school.\u201d I looked back at the kid for a second. \u201cPrivate school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just have a knack for categorisation.\u201d He cocked his head a little.</p><p>\u201cHm, me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we should get along great.\u201d He dropped the grin and moved into all-business mode, placing a heavy rectangle book on the table in front of me, tapping it twice. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay,\u201d I said in my most sarcastic tone ever. The pages were thin and the cover was hard, which could only mean boring.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d David said, sitting down, \u201cyou\u2019re awfully quiet. I expected you to say more by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a library,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He laughed and looked around. \u201cWe don\u2019t have teachers in here. No one cares if you talk.\u201d</p><p>I sat taller and slowly turned my head. He was right. I didn\u2019t even notice. There was no desk and no old, grey-haired woman with large-rimmed glasses shushing us when we breathed. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sat back, leaning his elbow on the desk, a pen coming up to the corner of his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>I looked away from him, finally calming myself enough to act human, and opened the giant book. \u201cWhat page?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2014\u201d he inclined toward me, his voice becoming a husky whisper, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s your first day, so we can either fill you in on Mr Benson\u2019s class, or\u2014\u201d He paused, looking at the student near us.</p><p>I rested my cheek on the back of my hand. \u201cI already prefer the or.\u201d And as soon as that creepy sentence slipped past my lips to ruin my life, I dropped my hand, my head begging to follow.</p><p>But, instead of throwing a spitball at me before quickly fleeing the room, David just leaned back, crossing his hands behind his head. \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019m beginning to like you already, Ara-Rose.\u201d</p><p>Which was great, except, I was already in love with him. \u201cIt\u2019s just Ara, by the way,\u201d I said.</p><p>He sat straight and looked at me with one slightly squinted eye, then folded his arms. \u201cOkay, Ara. What\u2019s your next class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, hold on a sec.\u201d I dug into my backpack, pulled out the schedule and map, then passed them to David, who read the page, wearing an impish grin. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have quite a few classes together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding music.\u201d He cleared his throat into his fist.</p><p>\u201cIs that...bad?\u201d All the blood ran from my face as he handed the schedule back to me.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI mean, not all bad. We have Mr Grant, but I\u2019m in your class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he...nice?\u201d I kind of expected a two-headed monster, judging from the smirk on David\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll be there with you.\u201d</p><p>I folded my bottom lip between my teeth. Music class was going to be bad\u2014I could feel it.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t stay in the room long,\u201d David said. I looked up at him. \u201cMr Grant. He comes in, tells us what to do and leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe usually just have a jam-session.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWicked.\u201d I shut the textbook in front of me, finding my cool again. \u201cSo? What instrument do you play?\u201d I could sum up a lot about a person by the kind of music they liked, and more, by the instrument they chose to express themselves with.</p><p>David sat back a little, drumming his fingers on the desk. \u201cWell, I actually play all instruments. But this year I\u2019m focusing on the guitar.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Well, that blew my prejudice out the window. \u201cHm. I would\u2019ve figured you for a bass guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBass? And...what exactly would that say about me?\u201d The heart-stealing smile he presented as he leaned on his elbow made me shiver\u2014in a good way.</p><p>\u201cCool? Confident?\u201d A soft breath left my lips before I added, \u201cSexy?\u201d And though, on the outside, I shrugged as I said it, every ounce of cool I\u2019d mustered stopped moving and groaned, slapping its head.</p><p>David stared at me for a second, his lip twitching as if stuck on a word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was so rude of me.\u201d I covered my brow.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, it wasn\u2019t at all. It was just...\u201d He stared forward, frowning slightly. \u201cUnexpected.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my books, unsure what to say.</p><p>\u201cYou just seem so shy and quiet, now. I never expected you to say something so\u2014honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really shy.\u201d I traced the edge of the book. \u201cI\u2019m just quiet because I\u2019m new. But you won\u2019t be able to shut me up in a few weeks.\u201d I laughed but stifled it quickly. As if that would be reassuring. And I was off again with the assumptions. Who said this guy would even talk to me after today? He was only here because the teacher forced him to bring me up to scale. I kind of felt sorry for him then.</p><p>He suppressed a smile, nodding his head softly. \u201cWell, I look forward to seeing your more talkative side.\u201d</p><p>Was he serious? Maybe I didn\u2019t make myself clear enough the first time. Um, hello? I am totally infatuated with you and I just met you. You should run away, now! \u201cWhat? What are you laughing at?\u201d I asked, hoping my facial expressions hadn\u2019t given away my strange internal monologue.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>I scratched at the edge of the book again. \u201cNormally, people don't laugh at nothing.\u201d</p><p>He stopped. \u201cMaybe I'm not normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I nodded to myself, and since there was no rock to hide under in here, I covered the awkward tension with a very normal question that I was rather proud of. \u201cSo, are the people here nice?\u201d I said, when what nearly came out was, \u201cHey let\u2019s be rebels and ditch class\u2014go somewhere quiet, talk for hours and get to know each other,\u201d but that would\u2019ve been way too creepy.</p><p>David nodded, taking a deep breath. \u201cYeah, mostly. You shouldn\u2019t have a problem, though. Seems you\u2019ve struck up a friendship with Emily Peirce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that good?\u201d I hoped it was. Emily seemed nice, but I\u2019d hate to have ended up friends with the school bully.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes.\u201d He cleared his throat, looking away. \u201cIt\u2019s good. Emily has...a special gift for making people like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like her, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just easy to be around. I think you two will be good friends.\u201d</p><p>Did that mean I was easy to be around? And there I went again, looking for hidden meanings in words that weren\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine here, Ara. You\u2019ve already made two friends today and school has only just begun.\u201d He smiled warmly.</p><p>That was nice of him\u2014to say that. It felt so weird that, only half an hour ago, I was terrified to even step off the driveway, and now I was here, alone with David, and he just called himself my friend\u2014completely tarnishing all my first impressions about this once seemingly nightmarish brown building. \u201cWell, thanks.\u201d I shrugged, but couldn\u2019t contain my smile. It was a strange sensation, but for the first time in over two months, I just smiled because I wanted to.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cWhy are they all staring at me?\u201d I said under my breath as we strolled through the corridor.</p><p>David just grinned, wiping his thumb across his chin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d I scowled at one of the girls, whose mouth hung open like a frog waiting for a fly. \u201cThey are staring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll stop in a few weeks. They\u2019re just fascinated by anything with colour. And you are\u2014\u201d he smiled at my yellow dress, \u201c\u2014very colourful.\u201d</p><p>Colourful? I wished I could be smaller\u2014small enough to fit inside a locker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDave, too cool for the team jacket this year?

Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell ya later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, later, bro.\u201d The guy nodded and kept walking, giving some brotherhood click of his fingers that David copied.</p><p>\u201cAre you on the football team?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Okay. I looked ahead, weaving through the oncoming traffic, taking his lack of elaboration as a giant \u2018None of your business\u2019.</p> <p>As we passed a few open class doors, the crowds thickened, pushing David slightly closer to me, but not quite close enough to touch. I thought about \u2018accidentally\u2019 tripping, so I\u2019d have to catch myself against his arm, but, knowing my luck, I\u2019d miss and end up on the floor with my skirt above my head.</p><p>\u201cTurn here,\u201d he said, waking me from that little daydream.</p><p>I walked with my nose tilted slightly to the roof, taking in the dim lighting and rich burgundy colour of the walls. \u201cWhy is this area so different to the rest of the school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hold concerts open to the public in that room at the end.\u201d He pointed past the trophy cases to a set of heavy-looking double doors. \u201cGuess they wanted to give the illusion of grandeur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd parade the victories of their student body?\u201d I nodded to the over-stuffed trophy cases.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He breathed out through a smile. \u201cUm, Mr Grant\u2019s a bit of an exhibitionist. We tour around and enter just about every contest there is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds like my kind of music teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said, pushing on the heavy door. \u201cHe\u2019s real loveable.\u201d</p><p>I half laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo, we always have music class in the auditorium. Good acoustics. And more space,\u201d he said, and as the door opened, my breath caught in my throat. \u201cIt\u2019s much brighter in here when the House Lights are on, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? This room is great in the dark.\u201d My eyes followed the long columns of steeply inclined seats, stopping on the red velvet curtains framing the stage. It reminded me instantly of ballet\u2014with the smell of latex, chipboard and wool carpet, while the sound of feet on the floorboards over a hollow stage, if I closed my eyes, took me home again. In the aisle before the front row, students had dragged tables and chairs into a small, disorderly cluster, where they all sat, tuning their instruments or laughing and talking.</p><p>In the seconds it took to size up the group, my eyes swept past them and stopped on a long forgotten acquaintance of mine. \u201cA piano?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery observant,\u201d David said, and I rolled my eyes at him. He laughed. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll introduce you to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said simply, and as he let go of the auditorium door, it thudded loudly behind us, making everyone look up; the shambolic wailing of their instruments stopped abruptly, leaving a dense silence as we started down the aisle. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he leaned closer to whisper. \u201cThey\u2019re not necessarily staring at you, Ara, more the fact that you\u2019re walking with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What does that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I just don\u2019t really ever talk to girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I folded my arms around myself. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and slipped a guiding hand through the strap of my backpack, resting it just under my shoulder blade. \u201cI uh\u2014I don\u2019t like any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I tried to laugh off the nerves, but nothing came out. All I could focus on was his touch against my cotton dress, so close to my skin.</p><p>As we neared the stage, some of the kids stood up, but their eager smiles sent my shoulders to my ears.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d David nodded his greeting, keeping his hand safely on my back. \u201cThis is Ara.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, shaky breath, and waved, but the forced smile probably made me look more like a troll than a friendly newcomer.</p><p>\u201cAh, a fellow muso.\u201d A vertical palm appeared at my mid-section, ready to shake my hand; I looked up from his thin wrist to his sandy-blonde hair, then back down to his broad, honest grin, warmly inviting friendship.</p><p>\u201cUm, hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Ryan.\u201d He shook my hand then inclined his head to a small, dark-haired girl in the corner, quietly playing her violin. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Alana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d I smiled at her, but my troll face clearly scared her back into the shadows after a quick nod my way.</p><p>Ryan laughed, leaning closer. \u201cShe\u2019s shy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, that there is Fiona, and that\u2019s Jess, Jay, Dan...\u201d He rattled off names as I nodded and smiled at the faces, forgetting their names instantly. They should\u2019ve all been called Bob\u2014make things so much easier.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ryan asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s your poison?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, trying to figure out what the hell he meant.</p><p>\u201cHe means what do you play?\u201d David added, barely masking his amusement.</p><p>\u201cOh. Um. Piano?\u201d I said, but it sounded more like a question for some reason.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d Ryan nodded then pointed to the old brown upright. \u201cWell, that\u2019s Big Bertha. She\u2019s old and large and always in the way\u2014but she\u2019s in tune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig Bertha?\u201d I scratched my head, looking at David.</p><p>\u201cWe have a name for everything around here,\u201d David said.</p><p>Before I could laugh, a loud clap resonated around the auditorium. Everyone stopped and looked to the silhouette at the entrance. \u201cI hear we have a new student today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here, sir,\u201d Ryan said, and I was pretty sure I just shrunk about two inches.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d His booming voice reached my ears with the presumption that he was a big, tall man, but as he stalked toward us, he became amusingly short and round. I tightened my lips, trapping the laughter, when I caught sight of his blonde ponytail, gathered at the nape of his neck, tugging heavily on the few straining hairs clasping for dear life around the edges of his bald spot. Stylish. But, short as he was, he was also still a centimetre taller than me; just tall enough to be threatening as he towered over me, burrowing into my soul with an accusing glare. \u201cMiss Thompson, I presume?\u201d</p><p>Self-amusement turned to fear and dried my throat. I looked at Bertha, considering hiding behind her. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you be playing for us today, Miss Thompson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe expect a performance from all our students on the first day.\u201d He grinned, cupping his hands as he looked around the class. And at that point, the second head I\u2019d earlier assumed he\u2019d have, showed itself.</p><p>Everyone in the class waited for me to respond, or maybe to run away crying. Clearly, this was the reason for David's smirk in the library. I felt like saying, \u201cFYI, David, you being here with me does not make this spotlight on my awkwardness okay. Not even a little bit!\u201d But I bit my tongue instead, my eyes narrowing when David tipped his head in a slight nod. It was so obvious. He knew this was coming. He knew Mr Grant was going to do this. Why didn't he warn me? Then I could have made some lame excuse to run back home for the day.</p><p>Mr Grant stood back from his lean toward me, offering the piano stool. \u201cIf you please, Miss Thompson. Or do you require sheet music?\u201d</p><p>Groaning, I shuffled out of the straps of my backpack and went to dump it on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take this for you.\u201d David grabbed it and placed it by his feet.</p><p>\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d I said, then walked over to Bertha. The weight of two options dragged me to slump a little heavier on the stool; burst into tears and run away, or play a song?</p><p>\u201cIf you can only play Chopsticks, Miss Thompson, that will be fine,\u201d Mr Grant said, and I just wanted to pull his ponytail. Jerk. But there was no way I\u2019d let this know-it-all music professor make me cry in front of all these kids. I was sure he\u2019d reduced many a student to tears in the past and it was time somebody taught him a lesson. If there was one thing I hated in this world more than anything, it was people using their talents or skills or, worse, knowledge, to make other people feel small. And that\u2019s exactly what Mr Grant was doing to me. And it worked.</p><p>Everyone watched. I hesitated only a breath more, then lifted the cover and touched the very tip of one finger to the high C, too afraid to press down.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David rested his elbows on the top of the piano and smiled at me. I did not smile back. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. Just play.\u201d</p><p>My lip quivered a little, tears burning in my eyes. That little bit of control I had over my life was just about to slip away.</p><p>Mr Grant, standing uncomfortably close, watched me reposition my stool so I could reach the foot pedals, then held out a stack of papers. \u201cYour sheet music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine without that, thank you, Mr Grant,\u201d I stated calmly and politely. Really, I wanted to take them from his puny little hands and clonk him over the head. Instead, I traced the columns of black and white for a second, drawing a tight breath through my teeth. I didn\u2019t know the weight of the keys or the force it would take to draw a sound from them. This piano was unfamiliar and old, and after two months without so much as hearing a piano, I wasn\u2019t sure I could even play anymore. This could end badly.</p><p>\u201cToday, Miss Thompson,\u201d said the intolerant imp.</p><p>David gave me a reassuring nod, leaning a little closer to watch my fingers as they found their way home.</p><p>Okay, you can do this, Ara-Rose. Just breathe. I looked around the room and grinned. \u201cHas any one here heard of the band Muse?\u201d</p><p>Under the cheers of the class, David nodded and sat back against the table behind him, while everyone else pulled their chairs into a neat circle around me. Even Alana moved from her desolation in the corner and stood beside Ryan, with her violin still in hand.</p><p>\u201cGo get \u2018em, Ara.\u201d Ryan waved an encouraging fist.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>The world disappeared for a second then. I inhaled and felt the cool of the keys under my fingertips\u2014heavy and solid. Breathe.</p><p>The first notes of the song filled the air, and a familiar flood of excitement rushed through my heart, then flowed down my hands. The keys were heavier than the ones back home, but it only took two chords to get used to it. \u201cThis is called United States of Eurasia, followed by Collateral Damage,\u201d I said.</p><p>A few people laughed loudly and cheered.</p><p>As I panned over the notes, feeling the long-forgotten muscles in my hands stretch; I cleared my throat and sung the words. David looked down, keeping a smile hidden behind his eyes as he nodded in time with the music.</p><p>On the second verse, a violin came in out of nowhere; I looked over my shoulder and smiled at Alana, who had her eyes closed. But her accompaniment gave me a new kind of confidence, and my voice flowed, unwavering, into the echo of the auditorium. It just felt so damn good to release the air from my lungs this way again, as if this was my first breath in two months.</p><p>Everyone else in the room became a part of the performance then\u2014keeping the beat with their hands and feet as I played. It was like a journey; a story with a beginning, middle, and end. And right where I\u2019d have done so, if it were me, the violin cut out, leaving an eerie stillness as I drew the song to an end; the high notes sorrowful, laden with a distant kind of pain that reminded me of home\u2014of my best friend.</p><p>With my eyes closed, encasing the memories of my old school and the softly-weighted keys of the baby grand piano in the music room there, my fingers played for me, allowing me to drift away to the shores of days when life was simple. Alone, in that place, I felt the last note leave, and only silence remained\u2014hovering like a breath held.</p><p>I opened my eyes to David\u2019s beautiful face. \u201cOh, crap. Did I faze out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stood up, and Ryan started clapping like a seal at a marine park.</p><p>\u201cWay to go, New Kid,\u201d one of the girls said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smiled sheepishly, steering my eyes away from David's soul-penetrating gaze.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Mr Grant peered down his sharp nose, \u201c\u2014I can see I have nothing much to teach you, Miss Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Mr Grant,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cDan still hasn't gotten past open chords.\u201d</p><p>A boy ditched a pencil at Ryan.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mr Grant turned on his heel and walked back up the aisle. \u201cCarry on, people. We will be working on our performance pieces for the Halloween concert.\u201d</p><p>My eyes stayed on the keys until the heavy door to the auditorium closed with an echoed thud behind the two-headed beast. What was that guy\u2019s problem? \u201cDid he expect me to fail?\u201d I asked, looking around the group.</p><p>\u201cHe does it to everyone new.\u201d Ryan patted my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for the heads-up, David.\u201d I frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cI figured you could handle it.\u201d He looked at Ryan then and they both laughed.</p><p>There was no way he could\u2019ve known that, unless he\u2019d read my student file\u2014which I highly doubted. This was obviously some cruel practical joke they played on new kids. I folded my arms. \u201cSo what gave you that impression? That I could handle it?\u201d</p><p>David stopped laughing and folded his arms, too, looking a little smug. \u201cYour fingers, actually.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I pulled them out from the fold and studied them. My nails used to be perfectly rounded atop the long, thin digits, but looked a little worn these days from being munched on so often. But he was right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe hands of a pianist,\u201d he added.</p><p>Very observant, Mr Know-It-All. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll pay that one. But next time, a little warning, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Well, in that case, maybe you should ditch History class,\u201d he said, holding back a smile. \u201cThat guy gives really boring lectures.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d I rolled my eyes, not really meaning to smile as well. It was hard to be annoyed at David\u2014he was just so sweet, and I had to hand it to him, he was right. I could handle it. I did handle it. I was grateful to Mrs Baker now for the three hours every Tuesday and Thursday, where she would painstakingly force me to play piano until my fingers seized up and turned bone-white. Mrs Baker was one thing I would not miss about my old life.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d David whispered in my ear as the hovering crowd dissipated and went back to their projects. \u201cThere was a reason I didn\u2019t tell you about Mr Grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I said, shuffling over so he could sit beside me.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you\u2019d run home.\u201d</p><p>I would have. \u201cI\u2019m not that weak,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I could\u2019ve at least prepared myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI'm sure.\u201d He smiled to himself, placing his fingers on the keys. \u201cHeart and Soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cHeart and Soul. You wanna play it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little Kindergarten, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Mozart,\u201d he said with a breathy laugh. \u201cWould you prefer a more complicated duet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you handle it?\u201d I asked teasingly.</p> <p>\u201cYoung lady, I can handle anything you can dish out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, I strongly doubt.\u201d</p><p>After David escorted me all the way to third period Math class\u2014even though he wasn\u2019t in my class\u2014I watched him walk away, and fell inside myself at the back of the room. I didn\u2019t recognise anyone from Music class and, for the most part, no one bothered to strike up a friendship. So, I sat quietly and thought about David until the teacher said, \u201cFive minutes left to finish those questions and hand them in. If you\u2019re done already, you can leave.\u201d</p><p>A few students jumped up, placed their work on Miss Chester\u2019s desk and left the room. I pushed my unfinished paper aside and reached into my bag for my map\u2014to hopefully locate the nearest bathroom. But as I pulled my schedule and pencil case out, then my purse and keys, and looked into the empty space, a wave of panic rushed over me.</p><p>Oh my holy God! It was gone.</p><p>I checked the ground, the desk, even in my pencil case. Nope. Definitely gone. But I was sure I had it in the library.</p><p>The familiar heat of panic flushed through my arms, rising into my cheeks as I dropped my face against my hand. I was ruined! I could see the headlines now: New Girl Asks Where Bathroom Is\u2014Gets Laughed at for Needing to Pee.</p><p>The bell screeched. I stood, packing my stuff into my bag with the speed of an old, arthritic lady. As the last of the gossiping dregs shuffled from the room, I herded out behind them, dumping my paper on the teacher\u2019s desk before stepping into the corridor. The hot, damp air trickled over the balustrade from the courtyard below, wetting my lungs as I breathed it in.</p> <p>Of all the doors nestled into the brown bricks around the square lot, not one of them looked like a bathroom, and of all the kids hanging over the guardrail, tossing things to their friends on the ground floor, not one of them looked like the kind of kid I could ask for directions without being laughed at.</p><p>So, I swung my bag over my shoulder, and as I looked up, my gaze met a pair of amazing green eyes, shining out like emeralds.</p><p>\u201cNeed a guide?\u201d David flashed his mischievous grin.</p><p>God, yes. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t if someone hadn\u2019t taken my map,\u201d I said accusingly, then smiled back as I stood beside him.</p><p>\u201cSorry. But those things are impossible to read, anyway.\u201d He looked down at me. \u201cYou\u2019d have gotten lost without me to show the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d My playful tone drew a smile to his lips again.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem pretty sure of yourself.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his smile remaining.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you saying I\u2019m incapable of finding my own way?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOnly that life\u2019s easier when you have someone to walk beside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, yeah, I meant...in the context of getting from A to B.\u201d He rubbed a hand across his mouth. \u201cThat was kind of awkward, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d I let the laughter out with a breath. He had foot-in-mouth-disease almost as bad as me. \u201cYou know, Emily warned me about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did?\u201d He turned and looked forward as we started walking, his natural cool spreading calm out over my awkwardness.</p><p>I hugged my books tightly to my chest to stop from flinging my arms around his waist. \u201cYeah, she said you had a tendency to snatch up lost lambs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you why she thought that?\u201d He stopped then, and took my math book from me, tucking it under his arm\u2014beside his books.</p><p>I watched it for a second. \u201cNot really. I came to my own conclusions, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what might they be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not the lost lamb thing you\u2019re into. It\u2019s fresh meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFresh meat?\u201d He laughed, looking away.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You know? A new toy\u2014something different to play with than all the old ones.\u201d</p><p>David stayed quiet for a moment, and I watched the other students file past us in a hurry. \u201cYou don\u2019t think of me like that, do you? That I am only talking to you because I want something more interesting to play with?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI did. But, I actually think you might be a very genuinely nice guy.\u201d I tried not to let the surprise seep out in my tone; it did anyway. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never had a guy carry my books.\u201d</p><p>We both looked at the books.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever carried a girl\u2019s books. Not at this school, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t grow up here?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you new, too?\u201d</p><p>He turned and started walking. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Hm, king of elaboration. \u201cHave you...been here long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I ran my tongue along the ridges of my back tooth. \u201cLonger than a year\u2014less than a year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two years. Almost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, um...so, you don\u2019t really talk to many of the girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don't really like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d We came to a stop, and David scratched his ear as I leaned on the wall. \u201cTell me why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask so many questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you evade so many answers.\u201d</p><p>His lip tugged on one corner, his eyes smiling. \u201cYes, I suppose I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d I twirled my hair around my finger, vaguely noticing a few girls giggle as they rushed in through the door beside us. \u201cAre you going to tell me why don\u2019t you like the girls here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019ve just never really been interested in any of them, until\u2014\u201d</p><p>I smiled at the way he smiled. \u201cUntil what?\u201d</p><p>He stepped into me, showing no respect for my territorial bubble; the length of his entire body hovered barely a centimetre away from mine, forcing my gaze to roll upward just to meet his lovely green eyes. \u201cUntil today.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened, but only a soft breath came from the very back of my throat, stopping on the sweet scent of his vibrant, chocolaty cologne. All I could do was squeak.</p><p>David nodded to the door beside us. \u201cDid you need to go?\u201d</p><p>Go? I forced myself to look right.</p><p>\u201cThe bathroom,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cUr, yes, I kinda did.\u201d Oh, God, awkward meter off the Richter scale.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll mind your bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just be a sec.\u201d I passed it to David, then pushed the door open to a nose-burning bleach smell, mingling with other rancid scents in the heat of the only non-air-conditioned room in this school. And as the door shut quietly behind me, a voice rose above the putrid smell with familiar content.</p><p>\u201cThe girl in the yellow dress?\u201d it said.</p><p>I stopped dead, remaining in the concealment of the dividing wall.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the new girl,\u201d another replied.</p><p>I cringed; this was that moment where you decide to either walk in there and act like you didn\u2019t hear, or stop and listen, hoping they wouldn't discover you. I should\u2019ve read up on this in the How to be a New Student Without Looking Like an Idiot guide.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you think of her?\u201d she continued.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s pretty, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, did you see how blue her eyes are? Like, so wasted on her face, hey?\u201d</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally. You want some?\u201d the other girl said.</p><p>\u201cWhat scent is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunlight Breeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d A long hiss of a spray can sounded before the sharp, choking fumes of deodorant filled the tiny bathroom. I covered my mouth, silently coughing into my hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you hear? She\u2019s already got her claws into David Knight?\u201d</p><p>My heart jumped to alert. Claws?</p><p>\u201cYep. Typical. He doesn\u2019t like her, I heard. He\u2019s just interested in her because she\u2019s wearing a dress and it\u2019s, like, easy access.\u201d</p><p>My eyes all but jumped out of my head, but as soon as the echo of her voice retreated, I felt my heart break a little.</p><p>\u201cThat must be it, I mean, come on. He\u2019s way out of her league.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know what she thinks he wants with her. Did you see her outside just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, oh my God!\u201d The other laughed. \u201cShe has so never had a boyfriend before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Probably still a virgin.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, becoming a little smaller.</p><p>\u201cMm. I give it a week before he loses interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week? That\u2019s generous. Maria said the girl has, like, scars on her face.\u201d</p><p>My breath froze halfway through a gasp, the walls closing in around me.</p><p>\u201cTrue? No way? That\u2019s so gross. I wonder if he\u2019s noticed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can he not? Apparently they\u2019re\u2014\u201d A face appeared right in front of mine and everyone took a breath.</p><p>While I stood frozen in humiliated stillness, a blonde girl just looked me over\u2014focusing on my scars, then threw her hair back and opened the door, dragging a dark-haired girl behind her. I hid myself in the corner as bright light from the corridor filled the room, disappearing with their sudden high-pitched cackles.</p><p>A layer of my soul slowly peeled away like an unfurling blossom, petal by petal. I blinked the tears free, unable to move or think or breathe, focusing only on the impression of my nails digging into my palms.</p><p>They were right. David was probably showing interest in me as a joke or a bet he made with a friend. I was stupid to think he hadn't noticed my scars.</p><p>I touched my jaw, my fingertips shaking, and as my desperate urge to go to the bathroom faded, a longing to go home came in its place, stepping aside for the rolling in my stomach; I lopped a hand across my gut and ran for the toilet.</p><p>Even as I rinsed my face and washed my mouth out, the voice of that girl played in my head: \u201cOut of her league; A week before he loses interest.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, the idea that David would be grossed-out by me had taken over my fear of being new.</p><p>In the mirror, my face looked pale and washed-out, which made the scars look red and menacing, worse than they did this morning. I leaned closer and poked about my face, moving my skin to get a good look at them; tiny little dots covering one side of my neck and along my jaw, like a fine sprinkling of nuts on a sundae. The weird thing was, I hardly ever noticed them; it was like my mind subconsciously blacked them out. But I knew they were there, and I knew everyone else could see them. Including David.</p><p>The real world sucked so much more than my mum said it would.</p><p>I splashed another handful of water over my face and grabbed a few sheets of paper towel, pausing when the door opened, but no one came in.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>I froze, instantly recognising David's voice. \u201cUh, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you...are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. He probably thought I fell in. \u201cUm. I\u2019ll be out in a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d he said, his tone a little flat. \u201cAnswer me, or I\u2019m coming in. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m good.\u201d But I wasn\u2019t, and the mirror too clearly reflected the sadness in my eyes. The mask I\u2019d become so good at holding in place hadn\u2019t slipped, but cracked completely, and the self-pity I\u2019d battled so hard against suddenly won the war. But I took a deep breath and looked my reflection square in the eye. \u201cEvery ache is step toward redemption,\u201d I told myself. I still didn\u2019t believe it, though. Nothing could undo what had been done and I knew, eventually, David would find out, and he\u2019d hate me too.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>I straightened my shoulders. Not yet. I just wanted a little more time with him. Give me that, I said to myself, hoping it\u2019d reach some magic fairy godmother. Just him. Just for today. And I\u2019ll never ask for anything else, ever again.</p><p>The summer sun streamed into the corridor, and as I stepped into the light, drew a deep breath and looked sadly at the boy leaning over the railing on the other side. The shadows highlighted the contours of his shoulder blades and the arch of his spine. If I knew him better, I could slowly trace my finger down his back, feeling how solid and real he was under my touch. Except, right now, I wanted nothing more than to run over and tell him everything those girls just said. Only problem was that, in the real world, he wouldn't care if my feelings were hurt; he\u2019d probably just freak out and dust me off like a cobweb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned around and smiled at me with those kind, warm eyes, and the pain I just forced down rose to the surface again. I flattened the front of my dress, blinking rapidly until, as the tears receded, David\u2019s arm landed around my shoulder. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>He stood back up slowly, his jaw stiff, and looked at the two girls from the bathroom\u2014now whispering to each other by an open locker in the corner. \u201cYou\u2019re not okay. I can tell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerils of being new.\u201d I flashed a grin.</p><p>\u201cOr perils of gossip,\u201d he said, checking over his shoulder before looking back at me. \u201cDo you mind if I teach those girls a lesson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go with it, okay?\u201d he whispered in my ear, so close that his breath tickled my cheek. \u201cAre they watching?\u201d</p><p>I cast my eyes to them; they stared on with arched brows, lips curled in disgust. \u201cYeah. They\u2019re watching.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He gently wrapped his fingers around my arms and walked me backward, past our bags and the stack of books, until my spine pressed against the cold wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving them something to talk about.\u201d He propped his forearm on the wall, bending at the knees, hiding us behind his shoulder as his face came in line with mine. And my eyes stayed on him, locked to his every move, trying to predict his next. But even though he moved his hand slowly to my face, my heart still skipped when his thumb touched my cheek, gently sliding down, then across my bottom lip. I could taste something sweet on his skin, and I wanted so badly to make a joke, wanted to run or hide, or close my eyes and breathe him in. In fact, I thought I was holding my breath, but as his lips hovered in front of mine, the warmth he exhaled went into my lungs. But he didn't kiss me. He just smiled into me, speaking with his eyes. I knew what he was doing, and he knew, if he had any sense at all, he knew what this closeness was doing to me. I swallowed, my mouth watering.</p><p>But the good feeling slinked away as the two girls walked off in a huff, flipping their hair. I looked up at David, who smiled in a way that made me feel I belonged here. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo what?\u201d He leaned a little closer; I stopped him with a hand to his firm, cool chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you made them think we were kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, don\u2019t you get it? They\u2019ll spread this around to everyone\u2014tell the whole school you were kissing me!\u201d I swallowed the lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Against everything inside me, I pressed my hand more firmly to his chest and shoved him away, then rolled out from the wall and flung myself across the corridor.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter if they tell everyone?\u201d He slowly turned around, holding his arms out wide.</p><p>I looked into the sunny courtyard below, leaning my elbows over the cold, metal bar. \u201cWell, do you want people thinking you like me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra.\u201d He appeared beside me, and as he wrapped his fingers over the railing, our elbows touched. \u201cWhat would be so wrong about liking you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, refusing to point out the obvious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very sweet girl. And you don't deserve to be the entity of other people\u2019s cruelty. I would rather they told the whole school I was kissing you in the corridor than to have them talk about you like that.\u201d He pointed back to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYou heard that?\u201d Everything suspended in slow motion around me. \u201cHow did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathrooms echo, Ara.\u201d</p><p>It felt like a hot-air balloon had just been let off in my face. I bit my quivering lip tightly. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d David gently grabbed my wrist and started walking, dragging me along behind him. \u201cThey\u2019re not nice people. I\u2019m just sorry that of all the girls you had to run into in there, it was those two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you\u2014\u201d I stopped and pulled my arm from his grip, \u201c\u2014for standing up for me. No one\u2019s...ever done that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He looked amazed, or maybe mortified.</p><p>\u201cI never needed it.\u201d I reached down and picked up my bag as an excuse to avoid eye contact. \u201cThick skin and quick wit were kind of a requirement at an all girls\u2019 school. But...I guess I just lost my nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to stand up for yourself, Ara. People should mind their tongues.\u201d David softened a bit then, quickly bending to grab our books off the floor by his feet. \u201cAnd for the record, mon amie, despite what those girls just said\u2014\u201d He took a step closer, \u201c\u2014I think you are very pretty.\u201d</p><p>Yep, that did it. Cheeks hot; heart tumbling down the stairwell; lust-meter at fifty. \u201cSo, you\u2014you speak French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeulement quand je parle avec mon coeur.\u201d David started walking, but I caught a glimpse of a smile as he turned, shouldering his bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGoogle it.\u201d</p><p>A second passed before I forced myself to run after him. \u201cI will, you know\u2014look it up.\u201d</p><p>He just stared ahead, his dimpled smile making my heart race as we walked in silence.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>The bell tolled before we even made it to the cafeteria. David smiled gently and jerked his head in the other direction. \u201cCome on, your next class is this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I asked, running after him.</p><p>\u201cI read your schedule, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but, how did you retain all that info? I can\u2019t even remember what classes I actually signed up for.\u201d</p><p>David said nothing, just smiled\u2014a kind of secret smile\u2014as we headed back up the stairs, past a waving carrot-top girl.</p><p>\u201cUm, hi,\u201d I muttered, returning the wave.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Ellie.\u201d David leaned in. \u201cShe\u2019s in our music class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I looked back down the stairwell at her just as she glanced up to gush over David. \u201cShe likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn't. She\u2019s just...I don't know.\u201d He shrugged once. \u201cI think they all suffer from a \u2018desire the unattainable\u2019 disease around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you think you\u2019re too good for them?\u201d I challenged playfully.</p><p>He fanned the collar of his shirt, humour lighting the smugness on his face. \u201cI don't think I am. I know I am.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cSo...you\u2019ve never dated any of the girls\u2014ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I don\u2019t plan to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, falling suddenly through the earth.</p><p>David\u2019s head whipped up as he came to an abrupt halt. \u201cUm\u2014I, uh\u2014I really didn\u2019t mean it like that. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDave? Ditching class, man?\u201d the same jock from earlier said, slapping David on the shoulder again.</p><p>\u201cHey, you know the code, bro.\u201d David grinned, pointing down the hall at him.</p><p>\u201cDitch school; ditch life,\u201d they both said, and laughed.</p><p>As soon as the boy disappeared around the corner, so did David\u2019s smile. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my books.\u201d I pointed to them.</p><p>He gently drew them from the stack and placed them in my waiting hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>We stood looking at each other for a moment, surrounded by the sound of a teacher\u2019s voice talking about today\u2019s lesson in history.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is your class,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cI figured.\u201d I smiled softly, but my heart was completely broken. \u201cWell, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara.\u201d He grabbed my arm. I looked up from his hand to his lovely green eyes. He let go. \u201cWhen I said I don\u2019t plan to date, I wasn\u2019t talking about y\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, David, you don\u2019t owe me an explanation.\u201d I tried to grin. \u201cI only just met you, after all. And I hadn\u2019t placed myself in that category, anyway.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s jaw set stiff, his eyes fixing on the ground.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ll see ya later?\u201d I said, slowly backing in through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we finally have a new student.\u201d</p><p>I turned away from David, leaving our conversation before his response, but felt better suddenly seeing a familiar face in the room. \u201cHi, Dad,\u201d I whispered so no one else would hear, then stole a quick glance at the now empty corridor.</p><p>\u201cAttention please.\u201d Dad\u2019s voice rose above the chatter. Everyone hushed. \u201cThis is Ara-Rose. I\u2019m sure some of you have already met her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually\u2014\u201d I cringed. \u201cIt\u2019s just Ara.\u201d</p><p>He looked sideways at me for a second. \u201cOkay, this is just Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Just Ara,\u201d someone called from the back of the room, and a low hum of laughter erupted over the entire class.</p><p>\u201cSettle down, Maverick,\u201d Dad said sternly.</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot, Dad,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>\u201cUh, Emily?\u201d he called to a girl in the front row of the raised, auditorium-style seating.</p><p>Without hesitation, the same girl I met this morning, with her swinging ponytail, bounded over. \u201cYes, Mr Thompson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met Ara?\u201d Dad aimed his thumb at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d She added a little too much \u2018cutesy\u2019 to that eyelash batting, and my mouth fell open. She totally had a crush on my dad.</p><p>\u201cRight. I want you to help\u2014\u201d he looked at me as he passed some papers to Emily. \u201cJust Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. Hint, hint.</p><p>\u201cHelp Ara get up to date with our lessons, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Mr Thompson.\u201d Emily grabbed my hand and dragged me to sit next to her\u2014right in the front\u2014right where Dad would be able to see my every move.</p><p>\u201cUm, do you always sit here?\u201d I asked, plonking down.</p><p>\u201cYup. I can see the teacher better.\u201d She watched Dad walk across the room and push the antique gramophone, normally in our attic, out of the way.</p><p>\u201cWhy would that be a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d She motioned her open palm to my dad. \u201cLook at him.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. \u201cUm, Emily\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he cute?\u201d she continued. \u201cDon\u2019t you think he looks just like Harrison Ford\u2014but, like, Indiana Jones Harrison Ford?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my dad, my nose crinkling as I took notice of his greying, light-brown hair and the creases he\u2019d get around his kind eyes when he smiled. I guess he did sort of look like Indiana Jones. \u201cEmily,\u201d I whispered again.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She sighed, dreamily gazing up at him.</p><p>There was no easy way around it. I had to tell her before she embarrassed herself further. \u201cHe\u2019s...my dad.\u201d</p><p>She spun around so quickly that I jumped. \u201cYou are kidding me. Oh my God, Ara. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I just, I didn\u2019t realise you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are so having a sleepover at your house.\u201d She practically jumped in her seat. \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on Mr Thompson for, like\u2014\u201d she flipped her head to one side, \u201c\u2014two years.\u201d</p><p>My tongue pushed into the side of my cheek. I really did not expect that. I thought she might be a little humiliated at the least, but I guess it was better this way. \u201cTwo years, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. It\u2019s why I take History.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...disturbing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She shrugged, gnawing the tip of her pen. \u201cYou could look at it as though your dad is inspiring my education.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if he\u2019d feel the same way. Instead of rolling my eyes at her, I turned my head back to watch Dad writing the words \u2018Religious History\u2019 on the board.</p><p>\u201cOh, come now, it\u2019ll be fun and you know it,\u201d he announced to the groaners around the room, then turned back to write on the board again.</p><p>Emily leaned in. \u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe always makes boring topics fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smiled to myself. \u201cHe even used to do all the voices of characters when he\u2019d read to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does that in class\u2014\u201d Emily laughed, \u201c\u2014when he reads direct from text books. Sometimes he puts on different accents.\u201d</p><p>As I went to laugh, my eyes darted quickly from my dad to a boy beside me, who jolted forward in his seat, a scrunched-up piece of paper bouncing off his desk, landing on his schoolbag a second later. He spun around, presenting his middle finger to the boys up the back, while my dad remained oblivious, glancing from a textbook to the whiteboard.</p><p>\u201cWhat a loser,\u201d one of the boys said.</p><p>I turned away and leaned closer to Emily. \u201cDo they know that by making that L sign on their own heads, they\u2019re technically making themselves look like losers?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cThey are losers.\u201d</p><p>I let out a small laugh.</p><p>In the seat across from me, the boy scrunched up a sheet of paper, hiding it under his desk, keeping his eyes on my dad the whole time. I looked back at the jocks, who watched the kid with an amused kind of interest, until they broke formation suddenly, launching to their feet as he sent a paper cannon into enemy territory.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap.\u201d Emily covered her head with her notepad, smiling. \u201cHe just started a war.\u201d</p><p>I went to duck too, but Dad started in with something about Greek gods, forcing a cease-fire; the jocks sat down, and the boy knocked the ammo into his open backpack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLooks like they\u2019ll live to fight another day,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Emily whispered under my dad\u2019s lecture. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be a lunch-room continuation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.

She turned to me quickly, grinning, and before she could say Oh, my God, you like him, I said, \u201cSo, does my dad know you have a crush on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d She leaned back, her eyes wide. \u201cI would be so humiliated.\u201d</p><p>I scratched my temple, wondering how admitting it to his daughter was any less humiliating.</p> <p>\u201cSo, how was the library, with David?\u201d She kind of sung his name.</p><p>I froze, wondering which parts of my amazing morning I should leave out. \u201cIt was okay. He seems nice.\u201d I nodded casually, but Emily\u2019s smile grew.</p><p>\u201cYou like him.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat, repositioning my chair. \u201cI think he\u2019s...a nice...kid.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed in the back of her throat. And I knew, from the look on her face, exactly what she was about to say. \u201cYou so do like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I wore the face of denial, but the cheesy grin in my eyes must have changed the wording on my neon sign to \u2018Oh my God. I totally do.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d She pointed at me. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her finger and pushed it down. \u201cI do not like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen that look before. You have Knight Fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnight what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we call it when all the girls swoon over David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not swooning.\u201d I turned my face away.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s charming, isn\u2019t he?\u201d She leaned on her hand, her thoughts a million miles away. \u201cIt\u2019ll kill you, you know? Knight Fever. Have you heard the I don\u2019t date speech yet?\u201d</p><p>I drew a tight breath.</p> <p>\u201cOh no. You have. Oh, I thought\u2014\u201d Her head moved slowly from side to side. \u201cWell, now I\u2019m sure he\u2019s gay. I mean, I was sure you had to be his type. Us girls have pretty much got it down to a science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot what down to a science?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girls David Knight will and will not scope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s scoping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerving, you know...checking out.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>Oh. \u201cHe scopes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hot-blooded male, Ara? Of course he does. Just, very subtly,\u201d her tone dropped its certainty. \u201cLike, he never actually looks, but he\u2019s nicer to some than others. So, we\u2019ve grouped together a sort of profiling on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s just creepy,\u201d I said, turning away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014\u201d she paused when my dad glared at us, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s just a bit of gossip. We don\u2019t have, like, a file on him or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you thought I was his type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was sure, but...I guess not.\u201d She shrugged, staring forward.</p><p>And that was it. A shrug. That\u2019s all I was? I really liked this guy, and I\u2019d just been dusted off with a shrug?</p><p>I drummed my fingers on the desk, trying really hard to focus on the legends of Zeus, but my stomach grumbled, making a fuss about my missed mid-morning snack, and nausea brought the taste of bile up to the back of my throat. \u201cHe seemed so genuine,\u201d I turned and whispered to Emily, letting my temper get the better of me. \u201cHe walked me to every class. He was so nice, so sweet, and\u2014\u201d I told her about the bathroom gossip and the theatrical kiss.</p><p>Her eyes rounded into her brow. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So what\u2019s the deal then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has. Never. Done. That before,\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cOkay? So why did he give me the speech?\u201d</p><p>She slowly looked away. \u201cI can not figure that boy out.\u201d</p><p>The bell rang before I expected it to. I swallowed the last of my sentence and smiled at Emily; she was so easy to be around. At first, I thought she was a bit stuck up, but the last forty minutes suggested that might\u2019ve just been a nasty first assumption.</p><p>I jammed my books into my bag and frowned at the elbow in my rib. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She nodded across the room. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>At the end of my gaze, David came into focus, hands wedged in pockets, shoulder on the doorframe and a very sexy grin across his lips.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I mouthed, looking down at my bag before he could see my cheeks change colour.</p><p>\u201cMm-mm.\u201d Emily shook her head, hugging her books.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mm-mm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, he likes you, Ara\u2014he\u2019s just trying not to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d I looked back at David, now talking to my dad.</p><p>\u201cCome on, girl. Even Mr Thompson noticed the way he was staring at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d I hid behind my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s the touch-my-daughter-and-you-die speech.\u201d I wanted to melt\u2014hide under my desk or slink away.</p><p>Emily hummed, smiling. \u201cThey\u2019re both so gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Emily,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cOnly one of them is gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she said. \u201cYour dad is so much better.\u201d</p><p>We both laughed, but mine ended in a sigh. \u201cI hope Dad doesn\u2019t give David the creeps. I only just met the poor guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, he\u2019s just making the lines clear. Can you blame him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s breaking all the rules I set out before I came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave your dad rules?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Dad said loudly, patting David on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI had no intentions of that, Mr Thompson,\u201d David said, looking him right in the eye.</p><p>I watched on in horror. \u201cOh God, just hide me now.\u201d</p><p>Emily laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope you don't receive the tail-end of that lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what I was just thinking.\u201d She must\u2019ve known my dad pretty well. It felt kind of strange then to know I shared him with so many other kids. I always knew that, but never experienced it firsthand before.</p><p>Dad sat back at his desk, and I chose the opportune moment, as he reached for something on the floor, to slink quietly past\u2014sinking my neck into my shoulders.</p><p>Emily, however, shamelessly stopped in front of the desk just to tell Dad how great his lecture was today. Never mind that she wasn\u2019t even listening. I really quite liked Emily.</p><p>\u201cHi, David,\u201d I said.</p><p>He just smiled and took my bag as we walked into the corridor.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m so sorry. What was my dad saying to you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed once. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s okay, Ara. If I was your father and I saw some punk kid look at you the way I\u2019m sure I was, I wouldn't have used words.\u201d</p><p>We stopped walking, and I groaned, slamming my back against a row of lockers as I tried to rub the ache of mortification from my temples.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d David continued after a short breath, \u201cif I\u2019d known he was your dad, I might\u2019ve thought twice about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging out with me?\u201d I dropped my hands to my sides. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve told you.\u201d And so, I lost my first friend. I was in no way offended, though. I knew going to the same school as my dad would have its pitfalls. I\u2019d accepted that.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d He stepped closer to me, shaking his head. \u201cNo, Ara, I would have thought twice about staring at you that way\u2014in front of him.\u201d His words softened on the end.</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. Well, uh, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mention it earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a heads-up would\u2019ve been nice,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d I smiled, surprised he remembered me saying that in music class.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d We both said at the same time, then laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ladies first.\u201d He bowed his head.</p><p>\u201cUm, about before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, wait.\u201d His hand came up like a stop sign; I snapped my mouth shut. \u201cWhat I said before about dating?\u201d He paused. \u201cIt was a mistake. I\u2019m so used to having to give that speech, it just came out on auto. But I didn\u2019t mean it for you. I was just illustrating how I don\u2019t\u2014I mean\u2014I\u2019m just not that kinda guy.\u201d David\u2019s fists clenched beside him. \u201cWhat I meant was that I\u2019d never date any of them\u2014I didn\u2019t mean that to include yo\u2014I mean, what I'm trying to say is\u2014\u201d He looked directly into my eyes, and all the students in the hall seemed to disappear. \u201cYou\u2019re not just any girl, Ara, I\u2014\u201d he swallowed, \u201c\u2014I...like you.\u201d</p><p>Uh? What? My lungs went tight, like a softball just got lodged in my chest. I looked around, waiting for a group of kids to jump out from behind the lockers and laugh at me, screaming April Fools. Despite it not being April.</p><p>David laughed to himself then. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was very forward of me. You don\u2019t even know me yet, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, David?\u201d I stopped him. Oh my God. I had no idea what to say. I mean, for all I knew, I had merely imagined him saying that and, at any minute, I\u2019d wake up, still in Dad\u2019s class, Emily beside me and a piece of paper stuck to the drool on my chin. I hugged my arms across my waist. \u201cThis is all a little bit weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He scratched his thumb across his upper lip, clearing his throat. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get it.\u201d I chased after him as he turned away.</p><p>\u201cNo. Really.\u201d His smile radiated sincerity. \u201cI really do. You don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, we\u2019re late.\u201d He walked a little faster then, but slowed and turned back to face me, pointing his thumb toward the stairs. \u201cIt\u2019s uh\u2014it\u2019s this way.\u201d</p><p>I walked after him, forcing my fingertips into my own brows. I wished I could scream it out\u2014tell him exactly what I was thinking. But I just didn\u2019t want to seem creepy or desperate. And it was creepy, and probably a little desperate, to like a guy I just met. Of course, that didn't change the fact that I was practically envisioning my initials beside his surname. Creepy.</p><p>David stopped walking. \u201cDid you just say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI uh\u2014no.\u201d I hope not. \u201cWas I thinking out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I don't know. Did you mean to say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two!\u201d A door burst open beside us, and an evil-villain-type-scary woman, who probably kidnaped Dalmatians, popped her angry face out. \u201cWhy aren't you in class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Miss Hawkins, we were just going,\u201d David said slowly.</p><p>\u201cWell, make it quick, please, the bell has rung.\u201d She slammed the door, leaving David and I alone again.</p><p>The awkwardness separated us with an invisible line.</p><p>\u201cLunch?\u201d David said, shattering the tension.</p><p>\u201cLunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Can I...\u201d He stuffed his hands in his pockets, looking up from his shoes. \u201cCan I walk you to lunch after class?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, a simple smile. \u201cSure, why not.\u201d</p><p>The words \u2018coward\u2019, \u2018moronically deranged\u2019 and \u2018stupid, stupid, stupid!\u2019 stared at me from the page where an equation was supposed to be solved. But if I couldn't find the formula for curing regret, how was chemistry going to be any easier?</p><p>I dropped my face against my hands, slamming my elbows on either side of my book, while the whole conversation with David played in my mind like a regret marathon on repeat. How could I have just stood there with my giant gob open and let nothing out? I should\u2019ve told him. I should\u2019ve said, \u201cThanks, David. I like you, too.\u201d What is wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, Ara?\u201d Miss Swanson asked.</p><p>I sat up straight and grabbed my pen. \u201cUm, yeah. All good.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied, the teacher turned back to the board and, one by one, the students followed suit, leaving me and my scribble alone again.</p><p>My scribble became pictures then, each word transforming into a snake or overlapping circles and other various works of notepad art, all twining together to form two words: Knight Fever. I had it bad\u2014bad enough to be drawing love hearts.</p><p>I scribbled them out, practically ripping the page with my pen. It was way too early to use that word. This was in no way love at first sight\u2014just my deep-seated need to feel accepted manifesting itself into emotions that weren't real. I nodded, satisfied with my psychological assessment. That would\u2019ve made Vicki proud. Except, I didn\u2019t want it to be right. It felt good to like a boy. It felt good to be that distracted. But I couldn\u2019t let that feeling divert me from the plan; to put my head down, get through this year and hopefully, somewhere in the mix of all my moving on, I might actually move on\u2014without dragging anyone down with me.</p><p>When the lunch bell rang, I stayed in my chair, sharing my pendulum thoughts with the Bunsen burner. He didn\u2019t talk back, thankfully, but I wished he would. If it was even a he. \u201cSorry,\u201d I said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a girl, you have a lovely figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I\u2019m a boy,\u201d it said in a velvety voice. And my cheeks went really hot when I realised it wasn\u2019t the Bunsen burner that spoke.</p><p>All I could do was laugh, staring forward with a rock of tension making my head want to sink down. \u201cI\u2019m...just gonna go hide under the desk.\u201d</p><p>David cleared his throat into his fist. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. It\u2019s okay, I talk to inanimate objects all the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do?\u201d I said as he sat beside me.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIs something on your mind, new girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of things are, but only one of them\u2019s bothering me right now.\u201d</p> <p>He clasped his hands together on the table in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>I tried to think of something funny to say, but couldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore what? Before the beginning of the world, before the coming of Christ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d I slapped his forearm, noting the silkiness of his skin just below his sleeve. \u201cNo, about before, when I choked up.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, pretty girl. I have a tendency to...\u201d he smiled, \u201c...over-share.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really. All you said is you like me.\u201d I dipped my shoulder a little, feeling funny about saying that out loud. \u201cAnd I just choked because no one\u2019s ever said that to me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t a confession of love. Like can mean many things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I just wished it was a confession of love. \u201cAnd I guess...in that sense, I actually like you too.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, making a thin line of his lips. \u201cGood. Then, friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, friends.\u201d</p><p>David frowned then, looking down as my belly added its two cents. \u201cHungry?\u201d he said.</p> <p>I wrapped my hands over the rumbling. \u201cUh, yeah, just a little.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Though the rest of the school was unbelievably free of clich\u00e9s, given that I\u2019d expected a High-School-Musical type scene when I first arrived here, the cafeteria was not. The buffet style cabinets, the old ladies in hairnets, and even the giant hall with long lines of plastic picnic tables, looked just like something out of a movie. Nothing like the old window-in-a-wall we had at my old school, where you could buy pies and wraps and that\u2019s pretty much it.</p><p>\u201cThis is so much cooler than back home,\u201d I said, sliding my tray down a few seats to sit at the centre of the empty table. The warm weather had attracted most of the students outside today, so we had free pick of the room.</p><p>David slid in next to me. \u201cCooler would be if they hired enough kitchen staff to accommodate the great number of students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they did just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it usually takes until the end of lunch period to be served, and half of us end up eating in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, why was today so quick then?\u201d I looked back at the now empty buffet\u2014all the kids seated, eating, aside from a few dregs gathering by the drink machine or buying dessert.</p> <p>\u201cThey had help today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVolunteers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf a sort.\u201d David covered his smile with a fist. \u201cHalf the football team is serving detention in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about ditching paper cannons.\u201d He picked up a corn chip and held it near his mouth. \u201cYou planning to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, yeah.\u201d I straightened my tray and leaned my elbows on the table. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the deal here anyway, like, social hierarchy? I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re at the top.\u201d I pointed to the group of well-built jocks at the corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cThe guys having the fruit war?\u201d He smiled as a piece of banana hit the glass window then slid down into a pile of pulp on the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s the other half of the football team, and yeah\u2014\u201d he nodded, looking away from them, \u201c\u2014they\u2019re pretty much the top of the food chain. Fourth on the list would be these guys.\u201d He waved at one of the girls at the table in front of us. \u201cMusic class. They pretty much hang out together. The lowest ranking would be the boys behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess.\u201d I smirked, looking at their paper-wrapped sandwiches and milk cartons beside the chessboard. \u201cThey\u2019re the chess geeks.\u201d</p><p>David laughed. \u201cYou must be psychic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the whole scene is self-explanatory, but the \u2018Chess Club\u2019 jacket was a dead giveaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose it is. Do you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I do. Should I be sitting with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cUnless you want to wear fruit juice home every day.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cStrawberry would look rather fetching on me, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair smells like strawberries,\u201d he said, and I wondered quietly how he could smell that.</p><p>\u201cSo where do you fit in?\u201d I asked.</p><p>David looked to the side. \u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d Emily perched herself on the seat across from David.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d He nodded his greeting.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, then shovelled a mouthful of lasagne into my gob\u2014an offering for the empty hole in my belly where a green ogre dwelled.</p><p>\u201cHey, do you guys mind if Ryan and Alana sit with us?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey\u2019ve got new-girl fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I scoffed, \u201cwhy would I mind?\u201d</p><p>David lifted one shoulder. \u201cFine with me.\u201d</p><p>After Emily signalled them over, she leaned forward and a bright grin lit up her caramel eyes. \u201cSo, what\u2019dya think\u2014a new love blossoming, or what?\u201d</p><p>New love? My head burned as if a warm towel had just been wrapped around it.</p><p>\u201cI think you might be right, Emily,\u201d David said, a sassy smile twinkling in the corners of his eyes. And as I was about to grab both cheeks and run screaming like a girl at a boy-band concert, he redirected his gaze to the pair walking toward us, standing as close to each other as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of them has figured it out, yet, though,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Emily sighed, gazing dreamily at Alana and Ryan, while I caught my breath.</p><p>\u201cHey, all.\u201d Ryan bumped knuckles with David, then sat down next to Emily, sliding Alana\u2019s tray closer to his.</p><p>\u201cHi, guys.\u201d I smiled, still feeling silly.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara\u2014so cool what you did to Mr Grant, today.\u201d Ryan pointed gun-fingers at me. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll go down in high school history: The Newbie Bites Back. Part One.\u201d Beneath his docile tones, he made himself sound like the voice-over for a movie trailer.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t biting back,\u201d I said with my mouth a little full, \u201cnot really. I was just...politely not taking any crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noble.\u201d Ryan nodded, lost in awe. Alana sat quietly beside him, not making any effort to stand out.</p><p>\u201cSo, Ara?\u201d Emily said. \u201cWe just finished French class\u2014are you taking French this semester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Foreign languages just don\u2019t click up here.\u201d I tapped my head. \u201cMy friend tried to teach me some French once...it was bad. I sounded like I was spitting insults at someone who made me hungry.\u201d</p><p>Ryan and David chuckled to themselves.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pity.\u201d Emily propped her cheek against her hand. \u201cI was kinda hoping we\u2019d have someone to take the spotlight off us for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpotlight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Our teacher, Mz Sears\u2014\u201d Ryan pointed his chip at me, \u201c\u2014Total cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean grenouille?\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cUh, Em?\u201d David frowned. \u201cYou know that doesn\u2019t mean cow, right?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed pink. \u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s being a cow got to do with a spotlight?\u201d I asked. Unless she was a Broadway cow.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d Emily sighed. \u201cI just thought she might play nice in front of a new kid for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, but she\u2019s just so finicky. Everything has to be done a certain way. If you don\u2019t follow her rules to the T, she goes all PMS on you,\u201d Emily added, then looked at Ryan.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s so stuck-up, Ara, like you wouldn\u2019t believe. She came from some private school in the city, and she just doesn\u2019t understand our ways.\u201d Ryan waved his hands about in the air, making \u2018scary fingers\u2019.</p><p>Alana shook her head and smiled into her salad.</p><p>\u201cWell, I come from a private school. I\u2019m not stuck-up, am I?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou come from a private school? No way.\u201d Ryan leaned back in his seat, making a cross with his index fingers.</p><p>\u201cYes way.\u201d I sipped my choc-milk to wash down my lunch. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like this place. A different world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where did you go to school?\u201d Alana finally spoke up.</p><p>\u201cReally far away.\u201d I smirked.</p><p>\u201cHow far?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cVery far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you have a bit of an accent there. What is that? English?\u201d Emily leaned in slightly, as did Ryan and Alana, and the eager curiosity in their eyes made me want to smile\u2014until I looked at David. I wasn\u2019t sure if he didn\u2019t care, or didn\u2019t want to know, but he sat still, with his fingers clasped just in front of his simple smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Promise you won\u2019t laugh.\u201d I pointed at them.</p><p>Ryan crossed his heart. Emily crossed her fingers, laughing already. Alana and David waited patiently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...from Australia.\u201d Almost closing my eyes, I awaited the onslaught of giggling\u2014but they just gawked at me.</p><p>\u201cNo way? You\u2019re all the way from Oz? You\u2019re totally like Dorothy,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and that makes David Toto.\u201d Emily laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, um, Dorothy was from Kansas,\u201d I said. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019d be the Cowardly Lion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the Tin Man. Didn\u2019t that Aussie guy play the Tin Man in that movie?\u201d Emily looked up at the ceiling as though her answer would be there.</p><p>\u201cNo way\u2014Tin Man? Ara has too much heart,\u201d Alana added. \u201cYou saw her play the piano?\u201d</p><p>Mockingly, I tilted my head and sighed. \u201cAw, thanks.\u201d</p><p>When Alana ditched a piece of lettuce at me, David\u2019s hand shot out and caught it\u2014right in front of my face. My mouth dropped and everyone else burst out laughing. \u201cNice catch, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he used to play baseball,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cIt was\u2014\u201d he stood up and reached across the table to drop the lettuce on Alana\u2019s plate, \u201c\u2014a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, all the way from Australia, hey? You don\u2019t sound Australian,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cActually, I do. Just not so much anymore.\u201d I smiled softly. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last month or so working on my accent, but you can hear it when I get upset.\u201d</p><p>David shifted in his chair.</p><p>\u201cAre you ashamed of it?\u201d Alana asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI just didn\u2019t wanna draw any extra attention to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, is it different over there to, like, how school is here?\u201d Emily held a forkful of carrot just in front of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah. In ways. I mean, we have our school year from January to December and we break over summer as well, except it\u2019s over Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas in summer?\u201d Ryan stared into the distance. \u201cWeird. But cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s not cool,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s really bloody hot.\u201d</p><p>Emily and Ryan stared at me blankly.</p><p>Alana stifled a soft giggle. \u201cSummer is hot, Ryan?\u201d She nudged his arm. \u201cNot cool?\u201d</p><p>I looked at David, who shook his head. Emily and Ryan did the same, half smiling.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that goes in the vault as the worst joke of the week.\u201d Ryan pointed at me again with his ketchup-covered chip.</p><p>I feigned insult.</p><p>\u201cBut you did sound very Australian when you said bloody,\u201d Emily added.</p><p>David chuckled beside me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, say it again?\u201d Ryan leaned forward, turning his ear toward me, making a funnel of his hand.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a circus freak, Ryan.\u201d Emily pushed his hand down.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mouthed, and with my belly full, all my pre-rehearsed questions came flooding back. \u201cSo, where do you guys normally sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Emily chimed in, \u201cDavid sits with the giant, incredibly gorgeous guys throwing food at each other.\u201d She grinned at David. \u201cMore like monkeys, really. And I sit with that group out there by the tree.\u201d She pointed to the windows covering the back wall of the cafeteria. Outside, in the sunshine, a large group of clich\u00e9-ridden boys and girls gathered under a big oak tree, laughing and throwing water.</p><p>David leaned closer and whispered, \u201cSecond in command.\u201d</p><p>I wondered where that placed me if I hung out with one from each group.</p><p>Emily\u2019s voice trailed back in suddenly with my attention span. \u201cRyan hangs out on the basketball courts, mostly.\u201d She looked at Ryan for confirmation; he shrugged with a small nod. \u201cAnd Alana hangs with those guys.\u201d She pointed to the Music class kids.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d I nodded. \u201cWell, thanks for keeping me company today, you guys. I would\u2019ve felt like a total loser sitting by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would never happen.\u201d Emily tilted her head to the side. \u201cSomeone would\u2019ve come and talked to you. If they could get past David, that is.\u201d She threw him a mock annoyed stare.</p><p>David grinned and leaned back in his chair, resting his hands behind his head. \u201cCan you blame me? I kinda like fresh meat.\u201d</p><p>I inched away from him jokingly, and a sudden whoosh of air brushed past my hair, impacting something that screeched loudly. Silence washed over the room. We all turned to the kid behind us, who sat straight again, rubbing his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat gives?\u201d His friend stood up, aiming his voice at the jocks.</p><p>\u201cWhat up, losers? Mommy forget to pack your helmet?\u201d</p><p>Apple pulp covered the chess club boy\u2019s hair and shoulders, while the remainder of the offending fruit rolled around on the ground just near his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said, and with teeth tight in his mouth, jumped up and grabbed the apple.</p> <p>\u201cJust leave it, Dominic. It\u2019s not worth it,\u201d one of his friends said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sick of this.\u201d His knuckles turned white around the apple.</p><p>No one in the room seemed to have moved; I think they were bracing for an all-out war. But someone should have done something. If even one person stood up for that boy, just once, maybe those jerks would leave him alone.</p><p>I pushed my chair out, and as I took a step toward him, Emily squeaked, \u201cDavid? Don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>My eyes flicked from the apple that was in Dominic\u2019s hand, to the other side of the cafeteria where juice rained in a shower over the jocks, a million tiny pieces of apple sticking to the wall behind them.</p> <p>A cool silence lingered.</p><p>David\u2019s arm came back down to his side, his shoulder still leaned into the throw, when the whole room erupted\u2014every person, sitting or standing, started clapping and cheering. Even the helmet-comment jock raised his thumb.</p><p>David took a few pats on the back and shook a few hands, and when he looked at me again, his eyes betraying fake amusement by displaying anger, I closed my gaping mouth and walked up to the chess-kid. \u201cHey? Are you okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he moaned and sat back down, rubbing his head. \u201cThose guys are just assholes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. They had no right to do that. I\u2019m so sorry. If I hadn\u2019t moved, it would\u2019ve hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s good you moved then.\u201d He gave me a smirk, his whole face still red.</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cNah, I can handle embarrassment pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled softly at him. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and shifted his black knight to another square on the chessboard. \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it was cool what David just did,\u201d one of the other guys piped up, still laughing.</p><p>\u201cRight. Today. But tomorrow he\u2019ll just be a big jackass again like the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>A bucket of realisation flooded over me like heat. \u201cReally? He\u2019s a bully?\u201d</p><p>The boy glanced at David, then shook his head; not a no, but maybe more like he was shaking it at himself, then went back to his game, ignoring me.</p> <p>David turned quickly away then, dropping his head, tension making a stiff line across his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d I sat back down in my spot.</p><p>\u201cReally, Ara,\u201d Emily said. \u201cHe sits with the jocks, but he\u2019s not like them at all. Anymore.\u201d</p><p>Anymore? I searched his face for a second, but he kept his gaze on the table between his wrists. Ryan and Alana looked back at their food, making sideways glances at each other. \u201cSo what\u2019s the big deal, then?\u201d I shrugged and looked at Emily. \u201cWhy are you all acting strange?\u201d</p><p>Emily took a breath to speak, but David cut in. \u201cBecause I was a jackass, Ara.\u201d He turned to me, and a flicker, resembling disgrace, fluttered under his eyelids. \u201cWhen I first came to the school, I used to do stuff like that all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. Well...\u201d I blinked, studying the side of his face. \u201cI still don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re not like that now, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had hoped it might be some time before you learned of this. You know what they say\u2014about first impressions.\u201d David looked at me with those big, green eyes, and all I could think was how unfair it is that guys have thicker, darker lashes than girls.</p><p>\u201cI doubt Ara\u2019s first impression of you is that you\u2019re a jackass, David,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>My eyes went from her to David again, humour-laced confusion making them smaller. \u201cWait, you were worried about my first impression\u2014of you?\u201d</p><p>David exhaled a breath through his nose.</p><p>I wanted to laugh. \u201cUm. I\u2019ve already decided who I think you are and, David?\u201d I looked over at the chess club boy. \u201cWhat you did for that kid\u2014it was really nice. Jackass-jocks, they don\u2019t do things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd neither do fragile, very breakable young girls.\u201d He grew taller in his seat, his tone sharp.</p><p>I inhaled a huff of insult through my open mouth. How dare he? Fragile? Breakable? \u201cI can take care of myself, thank you,\u201d I scolded. \u201cHow\u2019d you even know I was gonna throw it back at them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell\u2014from the way you charged forward, guns blazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Ara. You should avoid revenge throws when it comes to fruit at this school,\u201d Emily warned.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ryan added. \u201cWe\u2019ve had kids hospitalised with lemons in places they don\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>I cringed, hiding my disgust. \u201cWell, thanks, but I\u2019m fine. I know how to hold my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Until you hit the wrong person in the head and they come after you,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>I doubted they\u2019d come after a teacher\u2019s daughter. \u201cI\u2019d be okay. I\u2019ve done self-defence training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious?\u201d Emily sat taller.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, kind of. My friend\u2019s a cop, so he taught me how to fight off bad guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. You should teach us some moves.\u201d Emily motioned to herself and Alana.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t matter, Ara,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIf they know you\u2019ve done self-defence, they\u2019ll make a point of showing you how weak you really are. And you\u2019re like\u2014\u201d he presented me with a flat palm, \u201c\u2014tiny. They\u2019d pin you in two-point-one nanoseconds.\u201d</p><p>David glowered at Ryan then looked back at me, turning his whole body to face mine. \u201cLook, the fact is, they don\u2019t care who you are or who you hang out with. If they get it in for you, you might as well leave the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d just leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely why it was just better for all if I turned it into a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t need someone making those decisions for me. If I want to get myself in trouble, that\u2019s my prerogative.\u201d I folded my arms, sounding too Aussie on the last word.</p><p>After a second, David breathed out through his nose, his shoulders sinking. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry I stepped in; it was not my intention to offend you. I just didn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d He swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want what?\u201d I hated when people stopped talking mid-sentence.</p><p>His jaw went tight as his eyes narrowed, tracing every inch of my face like I was the most irritating person in the world.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an apple bomb,\u201d I said. \u201cGet over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the apple bomb issue I have a problem with.\u201d He sat back a little, gaining distance. \u201cIt\u2019s you and your altruistic need to get yourself marked as a target.\u201d</p><p>Altruistic? Me? Boy, he so did not know me. I cleared my throat, half aware of all the eyes at our table baring down on David and I. \u201cAnd why would that irritate you so much? You don\u2019t even know me. I\u2019m not your problem.\u201d</p><p>My words only made him rub his brow; he took a long breath, turning the tension around the table into dense air. \u201cAra. You just don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get it? Don\u2019t get what?\u201d I wanted to stand up so I could yell louder. \u201cThat you had no right to play white knight and step in when I was going to help someone. I am not a little girl. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth then closed it quickly. \u201cYou know what, fine. Go ahead. Throw a damn apple at them and see what they do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I unfolded my arms, stood up and grabbed the apple off Alana\u2019s plate.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d David had his hand on my wrist before I even drew it back by my side. \u201cI was bluffing, Ara.\u201d</p><p>A smirk formed laughter in the back of my throat, my shoulders shaking with the sound. \u201cAnd I was calling your bluff.\u201d I pointed at him, letting him take the apple. \u201cYou should see the look on your face.\u201d</p><p>Emily and Ryan laughed too, but Alana just looked ultimately worried. David, however, drew a breath to support a probably very massive serving...</p><p>\u201cSo, Ara?\u201d Emily interjected. \u201cYou moved over here from Oz. Why?\u201d</p><p>David snapped his mouth shut, and my posture drooped a little\u2014not likely noticeable, but enough to make me feel smaller. We both sat back down with a little too much weight in the slump. \u201cI\u2014uh.\u201d I wanted to say mind your own business. As I scanned the room, wishing the jocks would throw a banana or something, David reached across to grab the salt from my tray and knocked my milk carton flat. Everyone jumped back just as brown rivers spread across the plastic table, trickling onto the floor, right where our laps had been.</p><p>\u201cAra, I\u2019m sorry. That was an accident.\u201d He lifted our trays out of the mess, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ll get a sponge.\u201d</p><p>After he walked away, I looked at Emily and we both broke into laughter.</p><p>David didn\u2019t know it, but I owed him\u2014big time.</p><p>When the bell rang, I stacked my dirty tray on the trolley and smacked straight into David\u2019s chest as I turned around. \u201cOh, David, you scared me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He smiled and placed his tray on mine, staying awkwardly close to me. I took a half a step back so I could look up at him without straining my neck. \u201cAre you okay, Ara?\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest and hunched my shoulders a little. \u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>He looked around the almost empty lunchroom. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you avoid the topic of your family and your home twice today.\u201d He stepped closer\u2014close enough for me to discover that the top of my head only just met his mouth. \u201cI just want you to know that I am an excellent listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I couldn\u2019t speak; he was way too close to me. His lips nearly brushed my hair as I nodded, and the heat of his breath\u2014with an underlying cool, like he\u2019d just had a mint, yet warm and sweet\u2014trickled over the bridge of my nose. I took another step back from him, afraid I might accidentally stand on my toes and kiss him. \u201cI...um. It\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m fine. I just\u2014\u201d really should\u2019ve made up some elaborate lie before I came to this school, is all.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ara.\u201d David took a deep breath and looked to the side. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019ll be here when you want to talk. I\u2014I can see there\u2019s something bothering you. I don\u2019t have to know you to notice that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. That\u2019s...a little bit concerning.\u201d I laughed it off. \u201cLook, when I need a friend? I promise, you\u2019ll be the first person I come to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He looked into my eyes for a long moment. I wondered what he could see there. I\u2019d been told my emotions displayed themselves on my face, but for my sake, I really hoped not. \u201cCome on.\u201d David ushered with a nod. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to class.\u201d</p><p>The shrill peal of a whistle summoned football practice to start behind me, and the dull thud of a boot on the ball made my skin itch to be off the field. But I wasn\u2019t ready to go home, so I perched myself on a tree stump at the edge of the road and looked across at the white house. It was a different world over there; the maple trees lined the paths on both sides of the street, and behind them sat quaint little houses\u2014whimsical yet mysterious\u2014like something from a fairytale. They were pretty much all the same as my dad\u2019s, just different colours; some grey, some olive green, but mostly white. The kind of houses that, on the fourth of July, had flags hanging from the porches, and kids running from the long, grass-lined driveways waving sparklers around. Dad\u2019s house was the only one with a hedge fence, though, since, thanks to Vicki\u2019s aversion to Man\u2019s Best Friend, we were the only family on the block without a dog. Instead, we had an overfed cat, whose one value was keeping my feet warm in winter. I could see his tail sticking out from behind the gutter over the porch\u2014the same place he was sitting last time he fell from the roof. Stupid cat.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I looked up, squinting in the sun. \u201cHi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you live around here, or are you lost?\u201d asked a boy who looked remarkably like my brother.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah\u2014I live just over there.\u201d I pointed across the road.</p><p>\u201cThe house with the blue door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He nodded, thoughtful. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool. Ours is brown.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s only blue because it\u2019s supposed to be good luck.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cDidn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded. \u201cWell, red\u2019s actually good luck. But, I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell my mom. She\u2019s old\u2014she gets confused,\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cShould just paint it red, then tell her it\u2019s blue. She probably won\u2019t even notice.\u201d He smiled down at me and extended his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Spencer, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I shook it.</p><p>\u201cWell, I better go. Later.\u201d He flipped his chin before walking across the road, disappearing into the shade of dancing maple leaves.</p><p>Dad was right. I nodded to myself. The kids here weren\u2019t so bad.</p><p>\u201cYou can go in,\u201d someone muttered sarcastically from behind.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. What\u2019ya starin\u2019 at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat\u2019s up on the roof again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled. \u201cSo go get him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I already fell off that roof. Not planning to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Yeah, I remember that. What were you, like, seven, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSix, actually.\u201d I looked at the second storey of the house. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t laugh. It was a big fall. I could\u2019ve been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom thought you were, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't you remember her running down the stairs behind Dad, screaming She\u2019s dead\u2014oh, my God, Greg\u2014she\u2019s dead? Vivid memory.\u201d He tapped his temple. I chuckled. He imitated a very good version of Vicki\u2019s panicky voice. \u201cThat was my first traumatic experience, y\u2019know? And I owe it all to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that why Dad bricked up your balcony door\u2014and put a desk there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But probably also \u2018cause it\u2019s harder to sneak out a window than a door.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled, and somewhere, as the day had gone on, despite what I felt for him this morning, I kind of felt a pang of a connection then\u2014seeing my dad\u2019s eyes in his. \u201cDo you smell that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Vicki\u2019s making casserole.\u201d I inhaled the scent of gravy and Italian herb.</p><p>Sam took off running. \u201cI\u2019ll race you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. No fair.\u201d I darted after him, catching up as we both jumped the creaky bottom step of the porch then burst through the front door.</p> <p>\u201cSam? Ara-Rose, is that you?\u201d Vicki called from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWho else would it be?\u201d Sam muttered to me as we dumped our schoolbags on the staircase.</p><p>\u201cCome in here and have a snack before homework please,\u201d she called.</p><p>As I walked into the dining area to the left, Italian herb blended warmly with garlic and onion, sparking a flashback of cold winters and roast dinners. But the oak dining table by the window, littered with Vicki\u2019s scrapbooking mess, and the island counter sitting centre to dark wood kitchen cabinets, held too much class above the little beach house I grew up in, obliterating any sense of \u2018coming home\u2019 after a long day.</p><p>\u201cDid you shut the front door? You\u2019re letting all the cool air out,\u201d Vicki yapped from her position at the counter.</p><p>Sam waltzed past, grabbing an apple from the fruit bowl. \u201cSorry\u2014I got homework to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, and I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, biting his apple, and wandered into the forbidden formal rooms through an archway on the other side of the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a pain, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe nice, Ara-Rose,\u201d Vicki warned.</p><p>I groaned and headed back to the entranceway, slammed the front door, then stomped into the kitchen again.</p><p>\u201cTough day?\u201d Vicki asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just seem moodier than your usual self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoody? I\u2019m never moody.\u201d I grabbed an apple and plonked into a dining chair facing the window. Outside, across the road, football practice was in full-swing, with shirtless guys running back and forth across the grass. I kind of wished David were on the team this year so I could sit on the tree stump and watch him train. Then again, Vicki would probably be sitting right here, in the chair, watching me watch him. I knew she\u2019d been sitting in it just before we came in, probably watching me talk to that kid Spencer, because the seat was still warm.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Vicki said. \u201cHow was school?\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed. That wasn\u2019t just a question formed out of a light attempt at decent conversation\u2014it was a probe; she wanted me to tell her she was right\u2014that school wasn't as bad as I thought\u2014and busying herself washing coriander couldn\u2019t disguise that meddlesome undertone. She should\u2019ve known better. After all, it was her profession. Okay, so she hadn\u2019t worked as a psychiatrist since she married my dad, but she still practiced\u2014on me. \u201cSchool was fine,\u201d I muttered absently, fingering through the tablecloth of photos and cardboard frames.</p><p>\u201cDid you make any friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one makes friends on the first day, Vicki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>She wasn't sorry. She didn't really care.</p><p>\u201cDid you see any cute guys?\u201d her tone became light, suggestive.</p><p>Did she really think I was that clueless\u2014that I wouldn\u2019t notice her trying to get me to open up? With a short sigh, I bit into my apple, licking the sweet juice as it spilled onto my lip.</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>I sat back, rolling my eyes. She wasn't going to let this go. She was hell-bent on having a \u2018conversation\u2019 with me this afternoon. If I didn't attempt to \u2018play along\u2019, she\u2019d tell my dad I was exhibiting anti-social behaviour again.</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose?\u201d she said, standing right beside me.</p><p>\u201cCute guys? Uh...yes.\u201d I grinned widely, keeping my face down. \u201cA guy that\u2019s so cute he makes Stefan look like a dweeb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Stefan?\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cNever mind. He\u2019s cute, he\u2019s fictional\u2014that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you...like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, Stefan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this boy you saw today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, do you like him?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Yes, I do. \u201cNo. I just met him. But he\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>She breathed out, her shoulders dropping. The movement was small, but so obvious to me; I was accustomed to the casual displays of indifference she used in order to psychologically assess or relate to me. She counted on the fact that I was a docile teen with no clue what went on around me. Clearly, she\u2019d never been a teenager. I knew all the tricks, and I never gave anything away about my psychological well-being. I wouldn\u2019t give her the satisfaction.</p><p>She walked away again, and I shifted the photos until the dark wood of the table bared itself from under them. Not one of those photos was of me. I spent every summer and at least six winters here since I was a child, but the absence of my face in these scrapbooks was just another indicator that I really was just a walk-in\u2014a temporary fixture made permanent by circumstance. I was like a painting you hung on the wrong wall using your last nail.</p><p>\u201cDid you sit with anyone at lunch?\u201d Vicki asked.</p><p>I spun around again and watched her fussing about near the stove. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good. I knew you wouldn\u2019t end up sitting alone\u2014even though you were so sure you would.\u201d She laughed lightly.</p><p>\u201cGuess you were right.\u201d</p><p>She ignored my disingenuous tone, tipping the chopping block over the pot, breaking the cloud of steam as she scraped the veggies in. \u201cSo, do you like any of your teachers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But my friend likes your husband.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dad? You\u2019re in his class, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he gives boring lectures.\u201d I assume. Not that I was listening.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t tell him that\u2014you\u2019ll hurt his feelings.\u201d</p><p>Feelings? Do dads have feelings? Almost as if his past self heard me, his smiling face appeared among the pile of photos. He was so much younger then. His hair was darker and the crinkles around his eyes weren't as deep. Vicki was younger, too. Her hair was still the same straight blonde, but her thin, white face had no smile lines. They were abysmal now, running down from her nose to the outside corners of her mouth like a V... for Vicki.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think of the cafeteria food?\u201d Vicki asked, tasting her casserole.</p><p>I spun my apple core between my fingers and watched her rinse the spoon off under the tap. \u201cIt was okay. Pricey, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I give you some extra money tomorrow\u2014did you have enough today?\u201d She looked up with round eyes of concern.</p><p>\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t use my own money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone offered to spot me.\u201d Well, forced me to let them.</p><p>\u201cOh, that was nice. Who was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy named David Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. David...David,\u201d she muttered his name under her breath, her brow wrinkles deepening. \u201cNope. Never heard of him.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201csounds like you\u2019ve made an impression, Ara-Rose. I told you people would like you\u2014you\u2019re a very lovely girl.\u201d</p><p>I dropped the snotty teen facade and sat back against my chair. It was hard to be hostile when she wouldn't take the confrontation bait. \u201cUm, thanks, I mean, that\u2019s great and all, but I don\u2019t think being a lovely girl is an asset in high school these days, Vicki. Also, I\u2019m just gonna go by Ara now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Really? But you always loved your name. What does your dad think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were given the name Rose for a reason, dear. I know it would break your fathe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike always called me just Ara, Vicki. It doesn't bother me, so it shouldn't bother my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She nodded and turned back to the stove. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>But I wasn't sure. I didn't want to drop the Rose. I didn't want to go to a new school, make new friends\u2014pretend to be something I just wasn't sure I could be anymore. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my room,\u201d I said, shoving my chair out. \u201cI have a lot of homework to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ara,\u201d Vicki called after me with a hint of detest behind my new name.</p><p>Why did she have to make it worse? She could just be nice about it\u2014supportive, even. I mean, on what twisted version of this story was I supposed to seek my dad\u2019s permission to omit my middle name? I felt like kicking something.</p><p>\u201cIs Mom still cooking?\u201d Sam asked, coming in through the arch on the right.</p><p>\u201cYes, why?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, dropped his books in his schoolbag, then dumped it back on the stair. \u201cI'm gonna watch TV. Don't tell, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll hear it.\u201d</p><p>He held up his wireless headphones.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I said, grabbing my bag, and stomped up the stairs. As I pushed my door open, it swung back and hit the wall, making my open window rattle. But the heat in my temper simmered a little at the sight of dancing prisms on my lemon walls, like rainbow butterflies, as the afternoon sun reached through the crystals on my windows, reflecting life around the room.</p><p>Back home, my room faced west, and the setting sun would cast golden rays of blinding light through my window, igniting the whole room ablaze with a warm, orange glow. I\u2019d lay on my bed, talking to Mike on the phone, watching the prancing spectrums perform their final act for the day. But here, my window faced east, giving me only morning sun. Dad, somehow, knew how much that daily routine meant to me, so he bought these Plane Mirrors and even let me climb out my window\u2014after I threw a tantrum about independence\u2014to position them carefully so they\u2019d catch the light of the retiring sun. It was just a little piece of magic, from a childhood passed, that he wanted me to hold onto.</p><p>\u201cHomework. Now.\u201d I heard Vicki say.</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom,\u201d Sam whined.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself and shut my door, kicking my shoes off as I flopped backward on my bed; one hit my dressing table and the other landed by my door, then, I dug my toes into the squishy carpet and let out a long sigh.</p><p>It was over. The torturous first day was over.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I called across to the girl in the mirror. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMo-om!\u201d Sam yelled from the hallway. \u201cAra-Rose is talking to herself again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Sam!\u201d I sat up and ditched a pillow at the back of my door.</p><p>\u201cTime to call the men in white coats,\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Samuel,\u201d Vicki said, loud enough that I heard her voice from the kitchen.</p><p>Sam\u2019s boisterous cackle faded down the hall, but he\u2019d left a great cloud of infuriation behind. I huffed out loud. Talking to myself did not make me crazy. Waiting for myself to talk back did, but...let\u2019s not go there.</p><p>I looked down at my bag, then over at my dresser, sitting against the angled wall of my wardrobe. The girl in the yellow dress wasn\u2019t there anymore; the only thing looking back was the oak tree outside. I smiled then, thinking about my day; thinking about how David said he liked me, and I read into so wrong I couldn\u2019t even speak after. I think he took it pretty well, though. He didn\u2019t make me feel like a total loser. Well, until Society and Environment class, when he corrected the teacher on the Emancipation Proclamation. It wasn\u2019t even on topic, but it took one simple comment from a kid up the back, and our discussion on North America turned into a full-blown slavery debate. David, rather heatedly, put everyone in their place. I stayed quiet through the whole thing, but his mere presence made me want to pick up a book and read it. I think he had that effect on everyone\u2014even the teacher.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Vicki knocked on my door.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I jumped up and sat at my desk, quickly grabbing my books from my bag.</p><p>\u201cDad called\u2014asked if you need some help with homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. No, thanks,\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, just give him a call if you do,\u201d she said through the door. \u201cHe\u2019s supervising detention today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d I said, kind of just wanting her to go away. I waited another few seconds, and when she added nothing else, spun around to face the window. The day outside was so bright and the afternoon breeze had settled among the leaves of my oak tree, rocking the rope swing in a soothing wave, as if to say, \u201cCome to us, Ara-Rose.\u201d And I wanted to. I really did, which made homework feel like a rock of pressure on my neck. I looked at the pink phone on my desk and slowly pulled my nail from between my teeth, grabbing it quickly to dial Dad\u2019s mobile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, how was school today, honey?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, great. So, I was just...I'm a bit stressed, Dad\u2014with homework. Can I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don't you leave it for today?\u201d he said, and I grinned. \u201cMaybe just do a bit of reading, and I\u2019ll talk to your teachers for you. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief, maybe a little forced. \u201cThanks, Dad. That\u2019d really help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s good then. Hey, since you\u2019re finally using that phone I got you, why don't you call your pal in Australia? I know he\u2019s\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cDad. No.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra, he\u2019s been calling every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he stopped now, right? You said he hadn't called for a week.\u201d</p><p>He went quiet. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a good thing, honey.\u201d</p><p>I sighed heavily, resting my head on my hand. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to talk to my best friend again. I wasn't even sure I had the right to after evading his calls so often.</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose, he cares about you. He\u2019s just worried\u2014just wanted to make sure you\u2019re doing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not give him a call then? Maybe after, you can sit back and read a book for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...what if he doesn\u2019t want to speak to me?\u201d</p><p>Dad laughed. \u201cJust call him.\u201d</p><p>I jammed my fingers between my teeth again. \u201cOkay. Maybe I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. Now, go rest up and don't stress over homework, okay? I promised you we\u2019d ease you back into this slowly, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, honey. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d I hung up and, before placing the handset down again, flipped it over and stared at the numbers. I\u2019d dialled Mike\u2019s number so many times I could do it with my toes if I wanted, but it took me a minute, as I stared at the phone, to remember the first digit. And in that moment, a pocket of fear crept in, asking me what I was going to talk to him about. I mean, what did I say? \u201cHi, Mike. I haven\u2019t called to see if you\u2019re coping in the last two months, but I just wanted to let you know that I'm not. That I feel tired and sad all the time. That I went to school today and fell in love with a boy at first sight, and I'm pretty sure I might be going insane, because that\u2019s just not normal, but I thought I\u2019d just tell you that because you have no reason to care how I feel anymore after I\u2019ve ignored you the way I have.\u201d</p> <p>With a sigh, I looked at the phone again.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d it teased.</p><p>I pinned the number in, my hand shaking, and it only rang twice before the husky voice on the other end made my heart jump. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, kid. How you doin\u2019?\u201d His voice pitched high on the end.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d I scratched the wood grain on my desk. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d your first day go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was starting school today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke to your dad on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...?\u201d he said leadingly. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well, it was good, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He exhaled. \u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019ve been worried \u2018bout ya all night. I haven't even slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh crud, the time difference thing.\u201d I slapped my forehead. \u201cI'm sorry, Mike. Should I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, of course not.\u201d I heard a ruffling sound on his end and imagined him sitting up in bed, his black cotton sheets looking blue in the moonlight under him. \u201cSo, did you make any friends yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d I grinned, then Mike got the run down on all the happenings of the day; Emily, Alana, how cool Ryan was\u2014a tiny bit about David\u2014and a massively overdramatised recap on music class with Mr Grant.</p><p>\u201cNo joke? What an arse.\u201d Mike laughed. \u201cI wish I\u2019d been there. I would\u2019ve played Chopsticks and deliberately done a bad job of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you would. I was thinking about that while I was playing.\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou were thinking about me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, even though he couldn\u2019t see it. \u201cI really missed you today.\u201d</p><p>Mike went quiet. \u201cI...I'm actually really glad to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI just. Ara, about that night...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not talk about the past?\u201d I said quickly. \u201cCan we just talk about...normal stuff, please?</p><p>\u201cSure thing, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. So, what\u2019ve you been up to the last few months?\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily, probably running a hand through his sandy hair. \u201cWell, you know how I applied to Tactical last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I said, getting excited at the excitement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got one more interview to go, and I\u2019m pretty much in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me? Mike, that\u2019s so awesome. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve finally done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t jinx it. I haven\u2019t made it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right. You\u2019re, like, super fit and super smart. You were in when you were born and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know. Hey, listen, I was thinking...once I make it in, I\u2019ve got a few weeks before training begins. Can I come see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I stood up, practically squealing. \u201cOf course you can. I\u2019d love that. There\u2019s so much I wanna show you, and I really want to talk to you about this guy, and\u2014\u201d I paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat guy?\u201d Mike\u2019s voice peaked. I pictured his face, the way the corners of his lips would turn up under his rough, sandy-brown stubble.</p><p>\u201cI really need your advice, actually.\u201d I slumped back down in my chair.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m good for it. What\u2019s the deal, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, his name\u2019s David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who showed you around today?\u201d</p><p>Does he not miss anything? I barely even mentioned David. \u201cYeah, except I left everything out. He didn\u2019t just show me around, Mike, he, like, I don\u2019t know, he stayed with me all day, and didn\u2019t really make a secret of the fact that he likes me.\u201d My brows rose. \u201cHe\u2019s, um, well. I really like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter one day?\u201d I looked out at the corner of the school\u2019s front parking lot, just visible from my window. \u201cDoes that make me creepy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take you to fall completely in love with Leopold?\u201d he asked, referring to my favourite movie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Leopold\u2019s not real. David is, and I\u2019m not some character in a love story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike groaned. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, defensive.</p><p>\u201cYou like a guy, flirt with him, befriend him, but whenever\u2014\u201d he cleared his throat, \u201c\u2014whenever they like you, show the tiniest bit of interest, you run the other way. I don't know, it\u2019s like you\u2019re afraid they\u2019re gonna wake up one day and realise you\u2019re not that special or something.\u201d</p><p>I gasped silently, closing my eyes. \u201cYou know me better than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I do, Ara. I\u2019m your best bud. Now stop worrying and just let this David guy like you\u2014if that\u2019s what he wants to do. I mean, you like him too, right?\u201d He sounded so mature, so unlike my Mike\u2014my fun-loving, carefree Mike.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I like him, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what? You\u2019re afraid that liking someone you just met means you\u2019re abnormal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Kind of.\u201d I shrugged, scraping at the wood grain again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not creepy or weird if you both feel the same way. And, do you think he\u2019s creepy for liking you?\u201d</p><p>I might if he liked me the way I like him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, then, you\u2019re not creepy\u2014you\u2019re a teenager. You\u2019re supposed to fall head over heels with every guy who has a cute smile.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cMike, you make too much sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, still laughing lightly. \u201cBut you do the same to me when I\u2019m having a girl crisis\u2014so we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, how are things on that front, anyway?\u201d</p><p>He groaned loudly. \u201cDon\u2019t even ask. I am never dating again, Ara. They\u2019re all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHypocrite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d The smile on his lips came through with his voice.</p><p>But the small moment of happiness fizzled out quickly when I looked at my stack of homework. I sighed and leaned on my hand. \u201cI should go, Mike. I asked Dad to get me out of homework and now I feel kinda bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I was too stressed, but I actually just couldn't be bothered doing it.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cOh, good to see you\u2019re still the same Ara.\u201d</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, kid. Well, keep ya chin up. I\u2019ll come see you in a few weeks, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d I hung up the phone, and the room felt suddenly empty, like I\u2019d just caught the first vortex back to reality\u2014one where I was alone. Always alone.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Dad sounded panicked.</p><p>I flung my door open and the concern on his face dropped instantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing, honey? I\u2019ve been calling you for two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad. I was reading the compulsory books for English class\u2014I had my earphones in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He seemed suspired. \u201cAny good books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh.\u201d I nodded, rolling my shoulder forward.</p><p>\u201cWell, I spoke to your teachers and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, about that, Dad,\u201d I said as we walked down the stairs. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be okay. I can handle a little homework.\u201d</p><p>He smiled widely and pulled my chair out at the dining table for me. \u201cGood girl. I'm very glad to hear that.\u201d</p><p>As I sat down, I glanced at Sam, who, for the first time since I moved here, didn't smile; he pushed his vegetables around his plate with his fork, hiding under his baseball cap. Poor Sam. I wondered how he felt suddenly inheriting a permanent sister after fourteen years being an only child. If it bothered him, he hadn\u2019t acted out or anything. I was grateful for that. But something seemed to be bothering him tonight.</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d Dad\u2019s stern voice made us both look up as he sat down. \u201cCap, son.\u201d</p><p>Sam sighed to himself, slipping his baseball cap off and dropping it to the floor, without protest.</p><p>Weird.</p><p>\u201cSo, Ara met a boy today,\u201d Vicki said, serving a pile of peas onto Dad\u2019s plate.</p><p>Dad winked at me.</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d I said, smiling, \u201che already interrogated him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not interrogate him. Whatever gave you that impression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you talking to him\u2014in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Dad scratched his brow. \u201cYes, that. Well, I might\u2019ve lightly threatened his safety. A little.\u201d</p><p>Vicki sat back down beside Dad. \u201cYou didn\u2019t? Greg, how\u2019s the poor girl supposed to make a life for herself here if you scare off all the kids that look at her sideways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was more than a sideways glance, Vicki.\u201d Dad chuckled, sprinkling salt all over his dinner. \u201cI used to be a boy myself, remember.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and snatched the salt. He reached for it again, and without so much as looking at him, Vicki moved it away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Vi-er-Mom,\u201d I said teasingly. \u201cHis grilling didn\u2019t work, anyway. David still walked everywhere with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid? As in...David Knight?\u201d Sam almost rocketed forward.</p><p>\u201cYeah. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s a nice kid,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bully!\u201d Sam added.</p><p>Dad\u2019s lips turned down with thought. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. We teachers have never heard sultanas about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSultanas?\u201d My forehead twitched. \u201cDad, is that some kind of weird teacher-lingo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually. It is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSultanas are bad gossip on the grapevine,\u201d Sam informed.</p><p>\u201cAnd grapes are good gossip,\u201d Dad finished.</p><p>\u201cSo, where do sour grapes come in?\u201d I said.</p><p>Four long lines formed across the top of Dad\u2019s brow. \u201cYou know what? We don\u2019t have one for sour grapes. I\u2019ll bring that one up in the lunchroom tomorrow.\u201d He nodded, spooning casserole into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo, no sultanas about David, then? That\u2019s good,\u201d Vicki said, eyeing me. \u201cMust be rare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, it is. We teachers scamper about the halls, unnoticed, so we get some good gossip, and believe me\u2014\u201d Dad winked at Sam, \u201c\u2014I hear it all.\u201d</p><p>Sam shuffled in his seat. Dad looked away, chuckling to himself.</p><p>\u201cOkay. What have you done, Samuel?\u201d Vicki asked, sounding kind of bored.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Sam looked her right in the eye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She focused intently on him for a moment, then laid her napkin slowly beside her plate. \u201cYou might as well tell me, Sam. I will find out\u2014one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>Sam liquefied.</p><p>\u201cSpill it. Now.\u201d She poked the table with her finger.</p> <p>\u201cI got a lunch-time detention today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Vicki asked.</p><p>He stayed quiet.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d Vicki reached across and took the salt off Dad again, her eyes never leaving Sam\u2019s face. \u201cEither you tell me, or I come into the school for an appointment with the principal.\u201d</p><p>Sam stewed in his own nerves, looking at Dad, who laughed into his plate. \u201cI got caught sneaking into the girls\u2019 locker room,\u201d he muttered to his chest.</p> <p>Unable to hold back any longer, Dad burst into a loud, burly laugh, covering his mouth to keep his dinner in. I looked at Vicki, unsure if I should laugh or not, but a smile crept across my lips.</p><p>\u201cGreg, I can\u2019t believe you weren\u2019t going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014\u201d Dad caught his breath, still laughing; the infectious sound spread over the whole table. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I laughed then, and Vicki started, too. \u201cWhat on earth were you going in there for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like you think.\u201d Sam\u2019s cheeks went bright red.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. No. A fourteen-year-old boy goes into the girls\u2019 locker room to buy a sandwich,\u201d Dad joked.</p> <p>Sam\u2019s teeth clenched. I felt a little sorry for him. He obviously didn\u2019t want to talk about it. They should be able to see that. And they were probably just making light of the situation, but I felt a sudden urge to protect\u2014something I\u2019d never felt for Sam before. \u201cSo, Dad?\u201d I said. \u201cYou know my friend from Australia\u2014Mike? He said he might come over in a few weeks. Can he stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? You want a boy to stay here\u2014under the same roof as you?\u201d Vicki jumped in.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a boy,\u201d I corrected. \u201cHe\u2019s a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man? Oh, well, that makes it okay, then,\u201d Vicki said, poorly attempting sarcasm. \u201cHow old is Mike now, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s twenty,\u201d I said, and looked at Sam, who mouthed thank you before returning to his casserole art.</p><p>\u201cTwenty? Ara, you\u2019re not even eighteen yet. It\u2019s against the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicki?\u201d I screeched. \u201cMike and I have never been like that with each other. God, we used to take baths together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention, Mom,\u201d Sam said, \u201clegal age of consent is sixteen. I checked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, why on earth would a boy your age be looking up that kind of information?\u201d she asked, horrified.</p><p>Sam just smirked.</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014\u201d Vicki closed her eyes for a second. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara-Rose. I\u2019m just not used to having a daughter. I\u2014\u201d she exhaled, \u201c\u2014I just don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I appreciate that, Mom,\u201d I said with a mouthful of carrot. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry about Mike. There\u2019s, like, this invisible barrier around him that repulses me from loving him that way.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWell, all right. But when does he want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as he gets his acceptance into Tactical\u2014in a few weeks,\u201d I beamed.</p><p>\u201cWhat, the SWAT unit?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014that\u2019s not what they call it over there, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he gonna be a sniper?\u201d Sam asked, sitting taller.</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d I frowned at him. \u201cBut, anyway, he\u2019s got one interview left then he gets a few weeks off before training begins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great, Ara.\u201d Dad reached across and patted my hand, as if this was my victory. \u201cIt\u2019s what he always wanted, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, swallowing my mouthful. \u201cYep, he\u2019s doing well for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame you don\u2019t like him then,\u201d Vicki added.</p><p>\u201cNah, he lives in Australia, anyway.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cCould be a bit tricky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you couldn\u2019t get pregnant,\u201d Dad said with a completely straight face.</p><p>I stopped chewing, and Sam coughed a carrot out onto his plate, but Dad just sat there, eating and sipping his wine as if nothing had been said.</p><p>\u201cMoving on then?\u201d Vicki suggested, raising her glass.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Bright yellow sunlight beamed off my mirror and into my eyes, blinding me. I rolled over and faced the wall, snuggling back into the warmth, seeking a few more minutes in the bliss of this cloud-soft bed and the lingering remnants of last night\u2019s dreams. In my own mind, while I slept, I came to know David so much better than I did yesterday. Perhaps maybe even well enough to invite him over after school today. Except, that would mean introducing him to Vicki\u2014and cleaning my room. Hm, perhaps not.</p><p>Down the hall, Sam\u2019s stereo suddenly blasted out into the morning. I rolled over and checked my bedside clock. \u201cSam! It\u2019s six in the morning. Turn it down.\u201d</p><p>His rock scream, followed by a thud that could only be a stage dive into his pile of laundry, suggested he didn't hear me.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d I tried, but on listening closer, heard the screaming shower pipes through the wall.</p><p>Great. I burrowed under my covers for a second longer, trying to find that dream again, but it was gone, as was any point of lying here trying to retrieve it.</p><p>I threw my covers back, leaped out of bed\u2014of my own free will\u2014then dug around in my pillows and blankets for my iPod.</p><p>It was time for a little battle of the bands.</p><p>But my iPod was gone from the base of my bed, where it usually landed after a harrowing night of tossing and turning.</p><p>Outside, on my windowsill, a tiny bird with silky blue feathers appeared, chirping and fussing about in the condensation puddle.</p><p>\u201cYou took it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I glared accusingly at him.</p><p>He stopped chirping and stared at me, then flew away. Guilty. I knew it. Well, I thought he was, until I lifted my pillow and found it right where I left it when I went to sleep. That was a first. And with eyes narrowed into vengeful slits, I scrolled through my playlists to find the most soulful compilation of what Sam called \u2018woe is me\u2019 songs, then slipped my iPod into its dock and held the volume button until the tip of my finger turned white and my soft, elegant tunes drowned out Sam\u2019s music.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d I dusted my hands off.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Dad banged on my door. \u201cToo loud. Sam, you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe started it!\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cI'm finishing it. Turn it down or I\u2019ll confiscate your dock.\u201d</p><p>I turned it down, even though I knew he wouldn\u2019t actually follow through on his threat. I\u2019d tested that so many times now I knew it was an empty one. Fact was, he didn't have the heart to take away the one thing that brought happiness to a grieving girl. He knew that without my music I had nothing to live for. That\u2019s why he bought me the dock in the first place. The one I moved here with had the wrong pins for the wall socket, and I was so tired and so upset from the long flight that day, I tried to force the plug into the wall anyway, repeatedly, with my foot. Dad came in and pulled me away before I could get myself electrocuted, but I\u2019d never let him see me cry that way before. As soon as I calmed enough to fall asleep, he went straight down to the store and got me a brand new dock. I'm not sure I even thanked him.</p><p>I swiped my thumb over a small layer of dust on the speaker and smiled, then turned it up just a few more decibels, whacking the snooze button as the alarm sounded the hour of wake. I wanted it to be nine o\u2019clock, though, so I could be in English class with David.</p><p>When the pipes beyond the wall stopped squealing, I stripped off, left my clothes on my floor and wandered through my walk-in wardrobe to the bathroom I shared with Sam. The little bugger had left the second door open, leaving my girl parts exposed to any who walked down the hall. I quickly ran and locked it into place.</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d Sam banged on the door.</p><p>\u201cGo away. I got here first.\u201d I turned on the faucet and stepped into the shower, closing the glass door.</p><p>\u201cBut I need the comb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the hairbrush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ran my fingers through my hair, wetting it. \u201cYou never brush your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can wait. I'm already in the shower.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, but obviously walked away.</p><p>On the glass, some remnant of a steam drawing Sam had done showed itself. I swiped a hand through it, leaving my palm against the cool for a moment, watching the condensation drip down from under it in three long lines. I felt grounded, steady, calm, for the first time in so long. Maybe because this was the first morning I\u2019d woken without crying since I got here. I\u2019d almost forgotten what it felt like. And I knew it was because of school\u2014because I met David and Emily and Ryan and Alana yesterday.</p><p>I pulled my hand down from the glass, watching the lone print disappear behind the steam again. I wasn't really alone anymore, and when I thought about getting out of the shower, getting dressed and going to school, I actually felt a bubble of excitement.</p><p>In my wardrobe, I threw on my light denim shorts and a pink tank top, then wandered out to my room. The rug, weaved entirely out of dirty laundry, stared back at me; its evil laughter rising over my music, making demands for the release of my shoes.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d I asked myself, lifting a sweater and some jeans then tossing them beside the empty laundry basket.</p><p>\u201cYou nearly ready for school, Ara?\u201d Vicki asked, opening my door without knocking.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I just can't find my shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm not surprised.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault.\u201d I stood up, dusting my hands off. \u201cMy wardrobe got gastro and threw up all over my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don't you go down and have breakfast. I\u2019ll find them for you\u2014maybe even tidy up a little.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her, about to accept, when I spotted one shoe under my bed. \u201cOoh, there it is.\u201d</p><p>She walked in and started picking up clothes as I sat on my bed and slipped my shoe on. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks. Where was it?\u201d I asked, taking the shoe from her.</p><p>\u201cNear your dresser. How it got so far away from the other one, I don't know.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and, seeing my favourite sweater in the pile of clothes over Vicki\u2019s arm, stood up and tugged it out. \u201cI never wash this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She looked horrified.</p><p>\u201cI just...it was Mike\u2019s.\u201d I hugged it to my chest.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She took it from me and laid it over my chair. \u201cNow, go down and eat, please. You\u2019ll be late for school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I grabbed my schoolbag. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>After scoffing down a bowl of oatmeal, I practically ran to the front door.</p><p>\u201cA little eager today, Ara?\u201d Dad said, dropping a quick kiss to my cheek as I passed him.</p><p>All I could do was grin.</p><p>\u201cWant a ride to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad? Why don\u2019t you try walking for once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go \u2018round the front. Easier to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s so lazy. Walking\u2019s better for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got better things to do with my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Like what? Work on that heart attack you\u2019re trying to have?\u201d I nodded toward his travel mug, which we both knew was full of coffee with way too much cream and sugar.</p><p>He saluted me with the mug, taking another sip as he walked away. \u201cHave fun at school, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I said, closing the front door behind me, but my conceited smirk went flat when I heard a low growl coming from the end of the porch. Skittles, with his fluffy grey tail thrashing about, sat curled up like a porcupine, hissing and snarling at something; I followed his evil-kitty stare to a boy standing across the road. Just standing there\u2014a guitar case by his feet, his eyes on his phone, one hand in his pocket, wearing a black shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. My heart dropped into my feet. David.</p><p>\u201cPsst. Shut up, Skitz.\u201d I stomped on the floorboards.</p><p>The cat startled to silence, but his tail kept thrashing.</p><p>I wondered if David was maybe waiting for me\u2014if he even knew I lived here. Then again, everyone knew which house was Mr Thompson\u2019s, so it was a safe bet I lived here too.</p><p>As I leaped off the porch steps and onto the grass, the frogs in my belly jumped up to my chest, making my heart pound. I didn't know what to say to him\u2014or if he\u2019d even remember me. But that was silly. Why wouldn't he remember me?</p><p>All around me, the summer sun warmed the ground, making the grass look almost yellow. I closed my eyes for a second and took a deep breath, tasting the flavour of fresh dew blowing in on the breeze. When I opened them, David looked up, meeting my smile with a grin. And I practically floated across the road then. He looked really sexy in that shirt; it wasn\u2019t black, like I first thought, but dark grey, and way too much for my hormones to handle. I almost didn\u2019t care if I freaked him out with my ogling. It was his own fault for looking so sexy.</p><p>\u201cHi, David,\u201d I said cheerfully\u2014maybe too cheerful.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ara.\u201d He took my backpack and tossed it over his free shoulder. \u201cYou look pretty.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, practically melting into a puddle. \u201cUm, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay, now you just look pink.\u201d</p><p>Both hands slowly rose to cover my cheeks. \u201cWell, don't say nice things to me then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. But that doesn't leave me a whole lot to say.\u201d</p><p>I smiled up at him, forgetting every thought when the morning sun beamed down across his hair, highlighting the golden tones, making every strand obvious. I just wanted to run my fingers through it. \u201cI like your hair,\u201d I said, instantly snapping to the realisation that I just said it out loud.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He grinned mischievously, sweeping his hand through it. \u201cI uh...I grew it myself.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed. \u201cSorry\u2014forgot to put my brain-to-mouth filter on this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cI like you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hand into his pocket, and my eyes strayed from his hair to his jaw then down to the top button of his shirt, sitting slightly open, showing golden skin underneath.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David said.</p> <p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop biting your nails, sweetheart.\u201d He gently pushed my fingers away from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I stuffed both hands tightly into my pockets. \u201cDidn\u2019t realise I was.\u201d</p><p>After a soft smile, he started walking. \u201cI know. You do that a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I grinned sheepishly, then pointed to his guitar case. \u201cWhat kind of guitar is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh\u2014\u201d He looked down at the case. \u201cIt\u2019s a Maton. Twelve string.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice.\u201d I nodded, yawning.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually? I did. For the first time in months.\u201d I smiled, but dropped it instantly, realising my response could be bait for more questions. Please don\u2019t bite.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t normally sleep?\u201d he bit.</p><p>\u201cUh. Well. I um. Yeah, of course I do. I just meant that...\u201d Wow, I\u2019d really put my foot in that one. \u201cI stayed up late talking with a friend last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. After.\u201d I looked at my feet, wishing he\u2019d just drop it.</p><p>\u201cWho was your friend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were you taking to last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a guy I grew up with\u2014in Australia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s...a friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he a school friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I mean, he was a few years ahead of me in primary school, then I went to an all girls\u2019 high school, so, you know, we played at school as kids, but not once we grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do then?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThen? He practically lived at my house\u2014or me at his.\u201d</p><p>David nodded, his eyes straying slowly forward. \u201cAnd you miss him\u2014that\u2019s why you stayed up talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I closed my fist around my thumb, resisting the urge to munch it. \u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you miss him?\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>I felt his eyes on me, felt him searching inside me, sending my shoulders around my ears.</p><p>\u201cHow many years ahead?\u201d he asked out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou said he was a few years ahead in school. How much older is he than you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little over three,\u201d I said, growing taller without the tension shrinking me.</p><p>\u201cSo...he\u2019s twenty?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cYup. Twenty one in May next year.\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cAnd what about you? When\u2019s your birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you can\u2019t guess that by studying some random feature of mine?\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cLike my piano hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could find out for myself\u2014if I wanted to. But I\u2019d rather ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when you put it that way...March seventeen.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cPisces, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, shaking his head. \u201cThat explains a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! What do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just funny how much that fits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays he who\u2019s known me for a day.\u201d</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>\u201cHey, you two.\u201d Emily waved before we reached the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHi, Emily.\u201d I waved back, noticing that, aside from her blue top, we\u2019d pretty much dressed the same.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Emily.\u201d David nodded in his cool, charismatic way.</p><p>\u201cReady to start another day?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAlwa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm. David.\u201d Ryan called, running out from the school.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nathan, guys,\u201d he said, coming to stand beside us.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Nathan?\u201d I looked at David.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Sorry, Ara, you wouldn\u2019t know about this,\u201d Ryan said, \u201cbut, he\u2019s our star quarterback\u2014he got sick last week. Hasn\u2019t been able to get out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s awful. What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, at first they said it was a really bad flu or something, but my mom just spoke to his mom in the pharmacy.\u201d Ryan looked at David. \u201cHe\u2019s had to go to the hospital, man. They couldn\u2019t keep him at home any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Emily covered her mouth. \u201cWill he be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not sure. He\u2019s on machines and stuff to keep him alive, but, you know Mrs Rossi? She was crying \u2018cause she doesn\u2019t have insurance\u2014said she can\u2019t get Nathe the care he needs.\u201d</p><p>Emily covered her mouth. \u201cWhat are they gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all good friends with Nathan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is\u2014he\u2019s just one of those guys, y\u2019know?\u201d Ryan added.</p><p>David\u2019s fist clenched slightly by his side.</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t we do a fundraiser?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cWe could put on a concert and charge people to come\u2014give the money to Nathan\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>As if a light bulb had been switched on, they all looked up at me with a shimmering glint in their eyes. \u201cOh my God, Ara.\u201d Emily grabbed my forearm and started bouncing on her toes. \u201cThat\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good one, Ara.\u201d Ryan grinned.</p><p>\u201cWe should get moving on this right away,\u201d Emily said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Mrs Hawkins about it...er, if you don\u2019t mind, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, Em, this is better your project than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She beamed, rocking back on her heels. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll get things moving, and maybe have everyone meet in the auditorium at lunch if they want in?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She went to walk away, then stopped. \u201cWay to go, newbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You rock,\u201d Ryan said before skipping off, looping his arm over Alana\u2019s shoulder when she came out from the school.</p><p>And David and I were finally alone again. Or maybe just I was. He seemed distracted again, wearing a kind of smile I thought belonged only to me\u2014the tight-lipped one that covered a set of gritting teeth. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>He bent down to pick up his guitar case, his arched brows prompting my question as he stood up again.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>With a soft smile, the edgy concern lifted from his face and he nodded. \u201cYeah, sure. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>While Miss Chester prattled on up the front of class, I drew pictures of eyes all over my notepad; sad eyes, smiling eyes, secretive eyes, but all of them David\u2019s eyes\u2014not that they really looked anything like his. I doubted even a camera could capture the true beauty of his face. Even my memory did it no justice.</p><p>I tapped my pencil on the page, trying to see through the solid classroom door, hoping David was waiting for me out there. The clock on the wall sat at three minutes to lunch, but the corridors were already bustling with students, and I was in the only class whose teacher didn\u2019t give early marks.</p><p>Then, almost as if it obeyed my command, the bell wailed loudly and the class broke into noisy shuffles, fleeing the room. I tucked my books under my arm and pushed my chair in, looking up to the sound of my name. \u201cYes, Miss Chester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sure.\u201d I glanced quickly at the corridor\u2014to freedom\u2014to David, leaning on the locker with his hands in his pockets, looking down at his shoes. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just wondering how you\u2019re doing?\u201d she said softly, busying her eyes on some papers.</p><p>\u201cDoing? Uh...I\u2019m...fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know\u2014\u201d She looked up at me, her pale lips forming a smile. \u201cI\u2019m a good friend of your dad\u2019s. If you need to talk\u2014at any time\u2014I\u2019m always available. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I smiled politely, hugging my books a little tighter. \u201cUm, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, and, Ara?\u201d she said as I turned away.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to pay more attention in my class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I said, feeling stupid after. Yep? What was I thinking? Yep?</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d David stood from his lean.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Fine. Why?\u201d I let him take my books.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Miss Chester want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheee...just wanted to see how I was going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, homework?\u201d I cringed at the tone of my lie.</p><p>David smiled warmly, keeping his eyes on the path ahead. \u201cSo...you\u2019re not paying attention in class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no. Not really.\u201d I looked down at my feet, half noticing the walls go from white to burgundy.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you concentrating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I guess...I\u2019m tired?\u201d And there that questioning tone came again.</p><p>\u201cYou can talk to me, Ara.\u201d David gently grabbed my arm, stopping me by the auditorium door. \u201cYou don't have to make up some lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie? About what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard what she said.\u201d He waited, looking right into me as if I\u2019d just spill the beans. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t just asking how you were coping with a new school, was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI uh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you two.\u201d Emily popped up out of nowhere. \u201cReady to start our first official meeting for the benefit concert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d I stepped away quickly to stand beside Em. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Did you get lunch, yet? Cafeteria lines are out the door today.\u201d She nodded toward her tray of food. \u201cMr Grant said we can eat lunch in the auditorium if we\u2019re rehearsing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, hey. So, I\u2019ll go reserve a table near the stage. See you in a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead, Ara,\u201d David said, passing my books and his bag. \u201cI\u2019ll brave the cafeteria lines.\u201d</p><p>My fingers tightened around his backpack, finally touching something that belonged to him. \u201cSure, thanks, David.\u201d</p><p>He tried to smile, but his clearly agitated gaze kept drifting toward Emily. \u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>As he turned away, I squatted down and reached into my bag. \u201cDavid.

We\u2019re just not anymore\u2014people grow apart.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy sigh, I grabbed our bags and books and headed into the auditorium behind Emily. \u201cI can\u2019t let him buy me lunch all the time\u2014when\u2019s it going to stop?\u201d</p><p>She giggled, walking ahead of me. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Sinking into my quilt, I drifted, floating in that blissful moment between sleep and wake, where dreams mingle with reality, slowly and magically merging until everything in the now disappears. Here, in this halfway world, I could be with David in any form imaginable; friend, girlfriend, lover.</p><p>I drew a deeper breath and settled into the fantasy, angling my face to the warmth of the summer sun as it kissed my skin, lighting everything around me with a yellow glow.</p><p>\u201cHey there, beautiful.\u201d David landed beside me in the grass.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I smiled, pulling petals off a daisy, whispering, \u201cHe loves me; he loves me not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d He cupped my hand, crushing the flower slightly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say he loves me not.\u201d</p><p>I looked across at him and, seeing his playful smile, returned one. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I say it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not true.\u201d He ditched the flower and rolled me onto my back, landing beside me, with the grass closing in around us.</p><p>\u201cThen what is true?\u201d I asked, twirling my hair around my finger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe phone,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I frowned, staring up at him until the song of a bird transformed into a high-pitched screech, then sat bolt upright in my bed, leaving the dream behind to a cold-slap reality. \u201cOh, shut up,\u201d I said to the phone, flopping back down with my pillow over my face.</p><p>To my surprise, it actually did, and I once again drifted off to fantasyland, finding myself beside a tree, with warm beams of light wrapping around me again, but no David.</p> <p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I looked behind me, above me, below me. He was gone. But where did he go? People didn\u2019t just disappear from fantasies.</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose?\u201d</p><p>I turned slightly, seeing only my reflection in the glass of the phone booth behind me, disappearing with each flicker of a fluorescent light outside the corner store. \u201cMum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose, where are you?\u201d</p><p>I felt the weight of the pay phone in my hand then and squeezed it. \u201cI had a fight with Mike.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith Mike? What were you doing at Mike\u2019s? I thought you went to Kate\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum?\u201d I said, panic rising in my tone; I could see her face then, in the glass; she rubbed her forehead, washing away the weeks of sleepless nights. She looked tired and so worn. I knew I shouldn\u2019t be doing this, but I didn\u2019t care. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, they\u2019re coming for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d She leaned forward, her reflection showing the panic in her eyes. \u201cAra, tell me where you are.\u201d</p><p>I looked over my shoulder at the dark shadows, stealing the light from the pavement as they fingered their way along\u2014getting closer. \u201cYou need to come, Mum. You just need to come get me.\u201d I kept looking over my shoulder, unsure what was out there; I couldn\u2019t see past the street light over the booth, but I could feel them, knew they were lingering, waiting for me to hang up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll come. Just stay there, Ara. Just stay there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d I said, feeling a coolness take the air. Then, the line went dead. \u201cMum.\u201d I hung up the phone a few times, pressing all the numbers, but the receiver was empty\u2014no static, no noise. Behind me, the lights in Ronnie\u2019s store went out and the wind stopped; I touched a hand slowly to the glass, and another came up to meet it.</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d A deep voice snapped my mind back like an elastic band on a wrist; my eyes flung open.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, your phone\u2019s been ringing every few minutes for the last twenty. Will you please answer it?\u201d</p><p>I rolled over, rubbing the haze from my eyes. \u201cThe phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dad said and closed my door, leaving me in darkness.</p><p>I jumped up, grabbed the phone, tripping over the clothes and shoes on my floor, and landed in my desk chair. \u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, baby, did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, how you doin\u2019?\u201d he asked, then took a quick breath. \u201cOh, yeah, the time thing. Sorry, Ara. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I put the phone to my other ear. \u201cI was dreaming about her, Mike.\u201d</p><p>He went silent. \u201cYour mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d My voice cracked. \u201cI keep thinking she\u2019s gonna come pick me up and I\u2019ll go back home again, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Ara, please don\u2019t cry, it\u2014you\u2019ll break my heart, baby.\u201d He completely lost his voice then. \u2018I just, you don\u2019t know how much it kills me that I can\u2019t be there with you right now.\u201d</p><p>I smiled softly, sniffling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t take your calls the last few months, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby girl. Okay. And\u2014you know me, Ar. I\u2019m always here for ya, no matter what. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I wiped the mess of warm, salty tears from my cheeks. \u201cI just\u2014it\u2019s been so hard without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to your dad, yet\u2014about what you told me? Have you told anyone?\u201d</p><p>My head rocked from side to side.</p><p>\u201cAra, I can\u2019t hear you when you shake your head.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>My sudden burst of laughter forced static down the phone line. \u201cYou always know how to make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you need to talk to someone.\u201d His voice took on the serious note he seemed to have adopted over the past two months. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy for you to keep all of this inside, baby girl. You said you made friends? Why don\u2019t you have a girlie night and do one of those big deep-and-meaningful things?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know them well enough, Mike. I\u2019m just not ready to share that part of my life with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what about that David dude. I bet he\u2019d listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might. But, I don\u2019t want him to hate me if I tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, grow up. You need to talk to someone about this. Now, I don\u2019t care who\u2014your dad, Vicki, Sam even, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not there, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be soon, right? My dad said you can stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Tell him thanks. And stop changing the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Look, I\u2019ll talk to someone, okay. I do know you\u2019re right. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just gonna bottle it up until you\u2019re in a straightjacket.\u201d</p><p>I bit my tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna call you the second my interview\u2019s booked, Ara, and we\u2019re gonna pencil in a day for me to arrive. Then, if you haven\u2019t told David or Emily or someone what happened, I\u2019m gonna do it for you,\u201d he said. \u201cGot it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Zorro.\u201d I laughed. \u201cWhen do you think they\u2019ll do your interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. So, Mike, why did you call?\u201d I asked, realising that he woke me.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking \u2018bout ya, that\u2019s all. The ice cream man came past, playing that stupid jingle. Made me remember the time he ran over your foot\u2014when you chased him for your change.\u201d</p><p>My left toes twitched. That stupid truck cost me six weeks off ballet and a permanently demented pinkie toe. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad it brings you happiness to remember me in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I really miss ya, kid,\u201d he breathed the words out. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cDavid! You waited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d He laughed, watching me cross the road, still pulling my shoes on. \u201cStayed in the shower too long, did we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I uh\u2014\u201d I placed my bag in his outstretched hand, a little puffed. \u201cMy diary was begging me to write in it\u2014I was compelled to obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompelled?\u201d David nodded, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know how it goes with these things,\u201d I joked. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do as the voices tell you, they just get louder.\u201d</p><p>David stopped walking. \u201cYou hear voices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I frowned. \u201cNo. It was a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You do know what a joke is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. Just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust when it comes from me it isn\u2019t funny.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cNot about hearing voices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you faze out all the time. If you\u2019re hearing voices as well, it might mean there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I dragged the word out, nodding my head, then shrugged. \u201cMakes sense, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you eat breakfast?\u201d he asked accusingly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad,\u201d I responded in the same tone.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d David laughed, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ve just noticed that you get a little...tempestuous when you haven\u2019t eaten enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempestuous?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Hm. \u201cIt isn\u2019t my fault, you know. I have an ogre living in my belly. He makes me do bad things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you faze out, hear voices, and blame your tempered outbursts on a fictional creature living in...\u201d he looked down at my stomach, \u201c\u2014your belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. The boy catches on quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d he shook his head, \u201c\u2014one thing I can say about you, Miss Ara, is that never a moment passes where I am not entertained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that...a good thing?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled once. \u201cYes. It\u2019s a good thing, mon amie.\u201d</p><p>Mon amie. I repeated the words to myself, unable to hide my grin. \u201cWhy do you speak French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, what made you want to learn French?\u201d</p><p>He looked forward, both of us slowing simultaneously as we neared the big brown building. \u201cI uh\u2014I grew up in a community that was inhabited mostly by the French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Cool. Where did you grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...they all spoke French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I couldn\u2019t think of anywhere in New England that was grossly dominated by any one race. But, Mr I-Don\u2019t-Elaborate had, indeed, elaborated. I wasn\u2019t going to push for more. Not yet, anyway. I exhaled, looking up the stairs ahead of us, wishing it were Friday. \u201cDo we have to go to school today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said kindly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think we need an evasive action plan for Her Royal Dictator-ness at rehearsals today.\u201d</p><p>David tossed his head back, laughing. \u201cShe was pretty moody yesterday, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, I know it\u2019s just \u2018cause she\u2019s trying to get things done. And I guess, if it weren\u2019t for Em, this benefit concert really wouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, yes, but if she wanted to get things done, then casting the football team in a comedy skit was a terrible idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it breaks the monotony of all the musical numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. How many do we have now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, ten, I think.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, slowing his steps to match mine. \u201cGood line-up too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But Emily should be letting us practice our songs at lunch; not spend the whole period separated like kindergarten kids, painting ticket signs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if we hadn\u2019t joined the pencil throwing fight, she wouldn\u2019t have separated us.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have anyway. We\u2019re not children; we\u2019re practically adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we should act as such,\u201d he said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cNo mucking about today then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d He tilted his head almost bashfully toward one shoulder. \u201cI kinda liked mucking about with you yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it; I giggled a little. \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, we shall endeavour to attempt discretion, today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscretional chasing, giggling and poking each other?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYes, except, now that I know where your ticklish spot is, I don\u2019t need to chase you; I can just poke you whenever I please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in English class, though. You know how ticklish I am.\u201d</p><p>His smile grew, his eyes small with thoughts I wanted him to share. \u201cYes, and your infectiously sweet giggle is at my disposal.\u201d</p><p>I tensed, noticing his eyes on my lower ribcage. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He clicked his tongue and winked at me. \u201cYou can try to stop me.\u201d</p><p>I hugged my ribs and bit my lip, grinning. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Emily leaned forward on her desk, eagerly engaged in Dad\u2019s lecture. I hoped she was getting an A for all the extra listening she was doing. Then again, her interest wasn\u2019t companionless today\u2014most of the class seemed to be paying attention. My listening skills needed some work, however. Then again, get David out of my head for five minutes and I might be able to function.</p><p>\u201cNow, who here believes in God?\u201d Dad asked, holding his hand in the air; stunned silence replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not a trick question, people. Hands up if you believe there exists something bigger than yourself.\u201d</p><p>Come on, Dad, as if anyone\u2019s going to risk popularity to answer that question.</p><p>Emily\u2019s hand shot up into the sky.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You suck-up.\u201d I elbowed her, but put mine up, too\u2014to save getting in trouble from Dad later. A few other people followed; the rest of the class just laughed and pointed at us.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Now, hands up who believes Jesus walked on water.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the class started laughing. My dad, with his own hand up, nodded, then started writing on the board: \u201cMyths and legends\u2014Religious History.\u201d He read the words out, tapping each one, then popped the lid on his marker with a thud from his open palm. \u201cWho can tell me what that suggests we might be discussing?\u201d</p><p>Emily put her hand up.</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d Dad pointed the marker at her.</p><p>\u201cIt means, like you mentioned last week, that nearly everything we know about religion is based purely on some story or, like, Chinese whisper that\u2019s been passed down from one generation to the next. Not too many cold, hard facts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dad wrote What is real? on the board. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying Jesus never actually walked on water, but what I am saying is that, like young Emily just said, nearly every story you\u2019ve ever been told has been written by someone else. We don\u2019t know the facts for ourselves. But there is a fact behind every story. Now, it\u2019s my job to inspire freethinking, not encourage atheism, so, having said that\u2014\u201d He wrote something else on the whiteboard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Assignment: Fact of Myth</p><p>\u201cFor the next few weeks you\u2019ll be researching the origin of a myth or legend\u2014\u201d he shook his head, \u201c\u2014doesn\u2019t have to be religious, but if you sift through any myth and go deep enough, you\u2019ll usually find some religious connection, like most things in life. So, find a myth, research the legends around it and make a report based on your opinion whether or not there could be some truth behind it, and what it originally had to do with religious beliefs.\u201d He looked around at all the students. \u201cBecause, let\u2019s face it, if Jesus walked on water then there\u2019s a damn sure bet there\u2019s a Santa Claus, right?\u201d</p><p>The class broke into laughter.</p> <p>\u201cMr Thompson?\u201d a girl asked. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re admitting Jesus didn\u2019t walk on water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My dad leaned against his desk, crossing his arms. \u201cIt means I\u2019m admitting there\u2019s a Santa Claus.\u201d</p><p>The class roared with laughter again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wasn\u2019t lying to my five-year-old self when he said he believed in Santa,\u201d I whispered to Emily.</p><p>She started laughing. \u201cI can so picture your dad saying that, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you can.\u201d I grimaced.</p><p>\u201cSo, find the myth and decide the truth from your own perspective. That\u2019s all everybody. Have a good day,\u201d he called out over the bell.</p><p>Emily and I walked out of class, shoulder to shoulder, still laughing at Dad\u2019s unusual lecture. \u201cAnd, if he actually caught a burglar in your house on Christmas Eve, he\u2019d think it was just Santa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. I could so see that happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, then, next morning, he\u2019d be like, Gee, Sam\u2014\u201d she lowered her voice to sound like my dad, \u201c\u2014I\u2019m terribly sorry, but when Santa came last night he filled his sack with your presents instead. And...er...and the china and the silverware and the jewellery.\u201d</p><p>I folded over in a fit of teary giggles. \u201cOh, my God, Emily. That\u2019s so spot on. I mean, his belief was unyield...\u201d With an abrupt jolt, my cheek hit a warm, firm chest, and a boy stumbled back an inch, looping his arms around my shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d fall for me eventually,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d I looked up into his sparkling emerald eyes, melting within the circle of his arms. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I wasn\u2019t watching where I was going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, pretty girl.

I wanted him to ignore my dad and just pull me close again\u2014steal me from this place so we could lay together, my head in his lap, talking for hours about nothing. But, unfortunately, he was no mind reader, and I would never muster up the courage to say that, so, staying at school, pretending not to want him, was my only option.</p><p>\u201cSo, I hear Mr Thompson gave an unusual lecture today?\u201d David asked Emily.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, yes.\u201d She sunk into her knees, moving her hands around as she recounted the lesson. A few other kids joined in, adding their own theories on what my dad was aiming to teach us, and I just stood there watching David\u2014watching the way he interacted with others. When he noticed, he sent a soft smile my way, the crescent-shaped dimple above his lip showing\u2014the one that only showed with that certain kind of smile. I imagined pressing my finger to it; imagined the moment I fell into his arms back there happening all over again, except he\u2019d sweep me off my feet this time and prop me against the wall, wrapping my legs all the way around his hips. My lips would finally be on his, and his hands would sneak up my skirt, forcing a sharp intake of breath in me when he...</p><p>\u201cEarth to Ara?\u201d Emily waved a hand through the cloud of my fantasy.</p><p>I snapped back to the reality of a noisy corridor. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ice rained through me. \u201cDid I faze out again?\u201d</p><p>David cleared his throat, growing seemingly taller as he slowly rolled his shoulders back.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. Just a bit,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I looked right into his emerald eyes, seeing them go dark, almost black.</p><p>\u201cI uh\u2014I have to go.\u201d He wiped a hand across his mouth, then stalked off into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked Emily. \u201cWhere\u2019s he going?\u201d</p><p>She just stared at me blankly. \u201cWhat were you thinking about just then?\u201d</p><p>The ice rain melted as my bones turned to lava. \u201cUh. Nothing PG, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>She cackled. \u201cYeah, I guessed that much.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders dropped. \u201cWas it that obvious\u2014what I was thinking?\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cHave you ever looked at your face when you do that\u2014when you disappear like that?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny. You just...your eyes drift off to the ceiling, and your lips just sit apart like you\u2019re waiting for someone to kiss them.\u201d She tried to hold back her laughter, but it shook her whole body. \u201cExcept, that time, you were looking right at David, chewing your lip, kind of blushing at the same time. I think\u2014\u201d She pointed to my chin. \u201cI think you need to wipe the drool off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d I brushed her hand away; she laughed. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t believe I let my imagination run away with me at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She hugged her books, looking down the corridor after David. \u201cMaybe next time do it with a book in your hand so people think you\u2019re reading something juicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d I said, half groaning. \u201cDo you think David\u2019s upset with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpset? Are you kidding?\u201d Emily laughed, pointing to where he\u2019d disappeared. \u201cAra, that\u2019s not David upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s...offended?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, not unless he\u2019s gay. And judging from how his fists just clenched up and his whole body went all rigid, I would guess he is definitely not gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did he run away?\u201d</p><p>She started walking. \u201cHe does that. I think he really likes you. And if he got the vibe I got coming off you, then he walked away because you made him feel something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d I hoped she wasn\u2019t being rude, implying I made him...you know, feel...something.</p><p>\u201cI mean, David doesn\u2019t really do emotions. The few times I\u2019ve ever seen him close to feeling anything\u2014he takes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She just shrugged again. She seemed to pass everything off with that move.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m just glad he can\u2019t read minds, or he might never come back.\u201d</p><p>Sam caught up and babbled about his day while I nodded and smiled and drifted in and out of consciousness, my mind on my own day\u2014on the fact that David never came back to school after I practically jumped him in the corridor. But I fell back to attention, with the hot sun bearing down, the smell of topsoil and wet grass all around me, when I heard the word David. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you and David Knight. My friend Steve said he heard from Trav that you slapped David in the hallway at school today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I practically yelled, my steps coming to a halt.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they say he left school in a real hurry\u2014tires screeching and all.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a grape turning into a sultana, Sam.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, blinking.</p><p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s second-hand whispers. David left school today because he was sick.\u201d Or because I wanted to fornicate with him.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? Well, I saw you two on the stairs this morning\u2014he was standing real close to you. Rumour has it you guys are an item.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Nothing going on there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing going on...yet?\u201d He grinned.</p><p>I chuckled quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Sam. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p><p>I smirked. If I so much as hinted on the truth, the whole school would know by first period tomorrow. \u201cNo. I really don\u2019t. I mean, he\u2019s cute and we have a lot of fun together, but he\u2019s not really my type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And what\u2019s it to anyone else, anyway? How does what two seniors get up to become news to Freshies?\u201d</p><p>Sam just laughed lightly. \u201cVery little goes on in that school, Ara. Star football player quits the team this year then starts talking to a girl, after notoriously dismissing every advance so far. People are wondering if you\u2019ve got a golden vagi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d I held my hands up. \u201cWhat a horrid thing to say.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cSo, there\u2019s nothing going on with you and lover-boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no,\u201d I said, flooding with fury.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, look at me.\u201d I motioned to what my old friends called a twelve-year-old dress sense, then to my scarred face. \u201cI\u2019m never going to be anyone\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>He went quiet until we reached the driveway. \u201cHey, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we get in, can you peel me one of those apple snakes I saw you do the other day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, sure. I\u2019ll even teach you how to do them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, short-stuff.\u201d He wrapped his arm over my shoulder as we jumped the creaky bottom step and ran to the top of the porch.</p><p>\u201cOoh, that\u2019s a good one,\u201d I said to Skittles, scribbling the title down on a scrap of paper.</p><p>The cat licked his paw, stopping to eye the movement of my pen for a second.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend not to care, Skitz. You like him just as much as I do.\u201d I placed the pen by his paw and leaned on my hand, watching the blue sky fade over the horizon. So far, Dad\u2019s project on myths, Mr B\u2019s assignment on playwrights, and the list of numbers I was supposed to work out for math had not been touched. Instead, I had a ten-song list of cry-your-eyes-out-over-not-being-loved tunes for my David Playlist.</p><p>I leaned on my other hand then, scraping a thumbnail between two front teeth, wondering where he went after school, if his parents tore shreds off him for ditching, if he even had parents, where he lived, what condiments he liked on his toast in the morning, what the last song he listened to in his car was. So many things. And all the while, my song list grew, pushing homework further and further down my list of priorities.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d My chair nearly tipped back as I jerked away from the desk, scaring the cat and sending the little blue bird on my window into sudden flight. I needed to get out of the house. My nails were stinging down to the quick and all this over-thinking made my brain hurt.</p><p>I changed my clothes, grabbed my blue, nylon-string guitar, and headed outside to the oak tree.</p><p>Yellow leaves rained to the ground, falling from the old tree as the weight of each sway drew a low creak from its branches, reminding me I was growing up and that, soon, this swing would be a thing of my past.</p><p>My soft, light-blue dress swayed around my knees in the gentle breeze, sweet with the diluted fragrance of frangipanis. I felt better just breathing again. But, from here I could see the school parking lot, which only brought back the memory of my embarrassing eat-the-cute-guy-in-the-corridor display, making me hold that newfound breath.</p><p>When my head dizzied from the movement, I sunk my toes into the cool, slightly moist soil and grabbed my guitar. The stranger I usually saw in my mirror glared back at me from the glossy surface; I ran my fingers over her face then gently along the strings, making a dull, tuneless song as I thought back to when I first saw this guitar; it had been on display in the music store window, and I had fallen in love with it immediately. How was it so uncomplicated to love an inanimate object, yet, when it came to a boy, a girl would fall all over herself to hide her true feelings? Well, unless she was me. Then, the truth would come out in embarrassing displays...in corridors...at school. I dropped my head into my hand, replaying that whole fazing out thing for the hundredth time.</p><p>But what was the point? Really? I mean, it wasn\u2019t like I could take it back by reliving it.</p><p>With a deep exhale, laced with the heat of humiliation, I squared my shoulders and twisted the pegs on the neck of the guitar, then strummed a soft A minor; the first chord my mum played on this when she bought it for me. And a song formed from there, taking me through my David playlist until the thinking about him got too much to bear again.</p><p>My fingers stopped dead on the strings. I couldn\u2019t get this boy out of my head for five seconds.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t stop on my account.\u201d</p><p>I smelled his sweet scent before I felt his presence behind me. \u201cDavid? Where did you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Do I have to give you the birds and bees talk?\u201d His fingers appeared around the ropes of the swing just above my head.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I said sarcastically, but in truth, I actually did think it was funny.</p><p>\u201cI uh\u2014I went back to get my books from my locker\u2014saw you sitting here,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s okay I dropped by.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than okay,\u201d I said, lifting my feet as he gently pushed the swing.</p><p>\u201cHey, uh\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I left like that at school today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, David, don\u2019t you apologise. I was the one who\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra, you did nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>I planted my feet, stopping the motion of the swing, then laid my guitar on the grass. \u201cWhat do you mean? Emily tells me I practically licked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLicked me?\u201d David laughed, settling onto the ground right in front of my legs, resting his arm over his knee.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the whole...fazing out thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d He dusted his hand off on his jeans, leaning back a bit. \u201cSorry, I never even noticed that. I mean, I knew you fazed out, but it was actually your strawberry shampoo that reminded me I had something to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy shampoo?\u201d I raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He grinned, his white teeth showing.</p><p>\u201cO...kay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what were you thinking then? In the hallway?\u201d His eyes searched mine for a moment, an incredibly suggestive grin warming them.</p><p>I looked away, feeling almost naked. \u201cJust that...\u201d I like you! I like you and want you to like me so bad it kills me! It. Kills. Me! \u201cJust that it\u2019d been a long time since I was in anybody\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cGuess I just don\u2019t really like to be touched anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not anymore?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my chin, kind of wiping off my scars.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, rising onto his knees.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>He pulled my hand down from my face. \u201cDon\u2019t rub at your skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I studied the grass under my bare feet.</p><p>\u201cAra? Look at me,\u201d he asked softly, tilting my chin to lift my gaze. \u201cWhy do you hide your face so often?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s hideous.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up, shimmering like a green marble held up to the sun. \u201cHideous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe not hideous. But\u2014\u201d I couldn\u2019t bring myself to ask how he could possibly look at my scars.</p><p>\u201cCan I say something?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, keeping my eyes on his.</p><p>He so slowly reached out and brushed his fingertips just over the fine hairs on my face. \u201cThese scars you despise so much, Ara, they\u2019re not what you think they are.\u201d</p><p>I held on as long as I could, but I just couldn\u2019t let him touch them anymore; I gently pulled his hand away and turned my face.</p><p>He sat back down on the ground, his elbow on his knee, knuckles just beside his lips. \u201cI know you think everyone can see them, but that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s only up close that I've ever noticed, and I have, not once, ever thought you were hideous, Ara. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my jaw into my shoulder, reliving the memory of waking to tiny cuts and slivers of glass in my face. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t know how beautiful you are.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at my feet, afraid to look up, afraid to see sarcasm in his eyes. And as if it came out of nowhere, a hand slowly appeared, moving cautiously toward mine, but stopped just above my fingertips, hesitant, like he was asking me\u2014making sure it was okay. I tensed from ankles to knees, holding my breath, feeling my heartbeat surround everything in my world. It all could've turned to ash under my feet\u2014the ground, the swing, the day, the future, and I would\u2019ve remained oblivious to it, because even the suggestion of touching him\u2014of holding his hand\u2014closed off everything else that could possibly matter.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I tried to say yes, but only a quivering breath came past my lips.</p><p>David\u2019s cheeks lifted with a soft grin; he turned his hand, sliding his fingertips under mine, closing them against my palm, then pulled me down gently to the grass in front of him.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David paused, frowning at me. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to breathe.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and, though daylight remained, all around me night enclosed my world\u2014tunnelling my vision to the only thing in the universe worth looking at. I smoothed my thumb over his, feeling myself lean closer, our eyes locked so intensely that if we were any nearer, the colours would\u2019ve blended.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked quietly, holding my hand with a kind of gentility that made me feel precious.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t okay. Not anymore. I was lost, fallen completely into some feeling I wasn\u2019t ready for. Somehow, our fingers fit so perfectly together, like they were created only for this purpose. I was the lock and he was the only key. How would I ever come back from this? \u201cNo. I\u2019m not okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you something.\u201d David edged a little closer. \u201cAnd I say this as your friend, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I braced myself.</p><p>He brushed my ponytail over my shoulder, the softness of his touch sending a shiver down my neck. \u201cYour scars make no difference to the way I see you. I know you\u2019re afraid that you aren\u2019t good enough for me, but how could I ever look past those eyes long enough to see scars?\u201d</p><p>I half smiled, rolling my face downward; he\u2019d been allowed to look at them longer than anyone so far. \u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on mine. \u201cBecause I like you.\u201d</p><p>Behind me, the swing stirred gently in the breeze, and the golden glow of sunset surrounded the sky in a blanket of soft pink and purple clouds, making his eyes dark and shadowed. \u201cWhy do you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re funny, cute, sweet, smart\u2014\u201d</p><p>I scoffed at that one; he smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re, believe it or not, actually quite witty and, from what I can tell after this short period of time, I have a lot more in common with you than any other girl I\u2019ve ever spoken to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hard since you never talk to girls.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, smiling as he ran his fingers down my ponytail. \u201cI feel a connection to you, Ara\u2014one I\u2019ve not felt before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He kind of laughed, looking past me for a second. \u201cI think we roll on the same wavelength, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI think I know exactly what you mean.\u201d</p><p>He looked up from my lips. \u201cYou wanna know something else, pretty girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I\u2019m going to like what you have to say.\u201d</p><p>His serious eyes warmed, a wide smile showing his teeth again. \u201cI think I like holding your hand.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The rain passed left a chill that made my toes cold under the strappy shoes. I hugged my arms across my chest, making myself small as I passed a group of obviously drunk boys.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d One of them broke from the cluster.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey.\u201d I waved, glad it was only Mark from school.</p><p>\u201cWhat you doin\u2019 out this late?\u201d he said, but kind of kept walking past me.</p><p>\u201cJust headed home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a ride?\u201d He motioned behind him to his group of mates.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m gonna call my mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded and turned back, jumping into the huddle as I headed for the corner store, where the only pay phone still in existence resided. The flickering light beamed down on me inside the booth, making my skin almost blue. I picked up the receiver with two fingers and held it just beside my face, not touching my cheek, then dialled reverse charges; it picked up in two rings.</p><p>\u201cMum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose?\u201d she sounded groggy and confused.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. Um\u2014\u201d My lip quivered. \u201cCan you come get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at a pay phone. Can you please just come get me?\u201d I burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Why are you crying?\u201d Her voice became clear with panic as she threw a dozen questions at me.</p><p>\u201cI...I had a fight with Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike? What were you doing at Mike\u2019s? I thought you were at Kate\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, Mum. Okay. I don\u2019t wanna talk about it. Can you just come get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose. It\u2019s the middle of the night. I just got Harry down again and he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d I yelled down the line, holding the grotty phone in a tighter grip. \u201cIt\u2019s three in the morning. I\u2019m cold and tired and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, just...\u201d She let out a breath. \u201cHang up, okay, I\u2019ll call Mike. He can come\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mum. Don\u2019t. Please don\u2019t. I don\u2019t wanna see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, honey, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I practically screamed, my tears coming out in streams. \u201cJust come get me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s sick, Ara.\u201d She went quiet. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t go out at this time of night. You know I care about you and, quite frankly, I\u2019m terrified of the fact that I don\u2019t know where you are. I mean, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re on a pay phone, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I sniffled, wiping my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019re seventeen now. You\u2019re too old for this. Just stop being a baby and go back to Mike\u2019s. I\u2019ll come get you first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I held the phone right in front of my lips to make my voice as clear as the goddamn day. \u201cI am never going back there, Mum. Never. If you don\u2019t come get me, I\u2019ll hitchhike home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, honey, just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m hanging up,\u201d I said. \u201cI see a car.\u201d I didn\u2019t see a car. \u201cI\u2019m sticking my thumb out, Mum. I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Okay. I\u2019ll come get you. Just\u2014just stay there, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I calmed instantly.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe corner store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRonnie\u2019s?\u201d she screeched. \u201cAra, that\u2019s three blocks away. You can walk that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, Mum. And I\u2019m...I\u2019m wearing heels.\u201d</p><p>It clicked then. I knew it did. I knew she knew the only reason I\u2019d be wearing heels when I was supposed to be at a sleepover would be if I wasn\u2019t at a sleepover.</p><p>\u201cJust stay there, Ara-Rose. And by God, child, you are in a world of trouble when we get home.\u201d She hung up.</p><p>I held the phone for another few seconds, resting my head on the glass, feeling the swirl of alcohol mix in my system with fear, making me want to puke. But when I opened my eyes again, daylight flooded my world; it took a second for my eyes to adjust\u2014to see the dresser mirror on the other side of the room, the yellow walls, the white door and the new morning greeting me. And I could still feel her; still feel her voice in my ears.</p><p>I smoothed the covers out on top of me and let the proverbial rock on my chest keep me in place, on my back, unable to breathe.</p><p>Downstairs, Dad\u2019s burly laughter rose above the clatter of Vicki making breakfast, arguing about something with Sam.</p><p>But I was okay.</p><p>Slowly, the air came back into my lungs and, breath by breath, the rock lifted, leaving me picturing only one thing: David.</p><p>I jumped out of bed and headed straight for the shower, eager to start the brand new day.</p><p>Sam burst through the front door. \u201cAra, David\u2019s waiting for you across the road.\u201d</p><p>My spoon hit the side of my bowl, splashing milk onto the placemat, as I leaped from my chair to peer out the window. David\u2019s head whipped up, his eyes meeting mine for a split second when I pulled the sheer curtain back. And I was out of there. I grabbed my bag, leaving my bowl on the table, and ran out the door. In the case of David versus Breakfast, the judge and jury were in; we all knew the verdict.</p><p>Outside, the morning sun cast a spotlight on his perfection. I wanted to stop walking and just stand still\u2014gawking at him for a while. But he looked different somehow, than he did yesterday. His mysterious green eyes held a smile in the corners, but the depth of focus in them, when added with his thinly pressed lips, made him look almost uneasy.</p><p>\u201cHi, David.\u201d</p><p>He took my backpack and threw it over his shoulder, then started walking, without saying a word and without the usual smile.</p><p>My brow contorted into a frown. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d he said, but his eyes didn\u2019t answer, like they usually did.</p><p>\u201cIs...everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d He dropped his fingers from the bridge of his nose and looked up, remembering suddenly that I was alive. \u201cSorry. I have a lot on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I stared forward, wishing I had pockets to shove my hands in so I wouldn\u2019t chew my nails. \u201cAnything I can help with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can at least listen? You know, lend an ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf discussing this problem would solve it, then I would. But it won\u2019t, so there\u2019s little point.\u201d</p><p>So, he\u2019d taken a leaf out of my book. Suddenly, Mike\u2019s threat to either talk to someone or have him do it for me didn\u2019t seem so big and scary. In some ways, after sitting with David in my backyard last night, letting the sun set around us, just two friends, holding hands, I\u2019d almost considered telling him what brought me to live here. So many times I even opened my mouth, and while sleeping last night, had, I think, resolved to \u2018let him in\u2019. But his sudden distance, like someone had flicked the \u2018reality\u2019 switch, made me think all that magic I felt with him was an influx of hormones and, today, the world was back to its usual cold self. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stole a glance at David; he was walking beside me in physical form, but his mind and spirit were so far away that his eyes had completely fixed on one spot\u2014narrowed with deep concentration. I almost wondered if he was trying to start a fire with telekinesis.</p><p>\u201cSo...did you...did you get up to anything interesting last night?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cInteresting?\u201d he said, kind of confused.</p> <p>\u201cI just...never mind.\u201d I looked away. And he didn\u2019t mind. Didn\u2019t even bother to engage in small talk.</p><p>At the top of the stairs, Emily and Alana talked casually as if they\u2019d been close their whole lives, despite their friendship being only as old as theirs to mine. They didn\u2019t really match, as friends. Alana was so plain and almost gothic; she was smart and read books by indie authors, whereas, Emily was so colourful; she always looked fresh and happy, or maybe...overexcited. She must drink coffee every morning\u2014lots of coffee. Mind you, that never worked for me. But despite originating from different ends of the galaxy, they seemed to fit on exactly the same page. Kind of like I thought David and I did\u2014until today.</p><p>\u201cHi, guys.\u201d I waved as we reached the top.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Emily smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo cheer practice this morning, Em?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot for me. Had a meeting with the school board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenefit concert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. So, where\u2019s Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d He popped out from behind the glass doors, wearing a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d He gave me a quick hug, then cupped hands with David, who\u2019d managed to wake up enough to appear social all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cSo, new girl. You made it through your first week, and\u2014\u201d Ryan scratched the back of his neck and looked at Emily.</p><p>\u201cWell, we were thinking,\u201d Emily jumped in. \u201cWould you like to come to Betty\u2019s Caf\u00e9 tonight\u2014to celebrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the little fifties-style caf\u00e9?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Emily nodded. \u201cYeah, the pink and blue one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belongs to Emily\u2019s aunt.\u201d Ryan hooked his thumb in Emily\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cAunt...Betty?\u201d I raised one brow.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d Emily faked surprise, then waved a dismissive hand in the air as she laughed.</p> <p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I looked at David, wondering if he\u2019d go. He placed his guitar case on the ground and rested his hands in his back pockets, then, ever so subtly winked at me. \u201cUh, sure, you know what?\u201d I looked back at Emily. \u201cThat sounds really great.\u201d The distraction would be a welcome relief; maybe I could stop thinking about David for a while.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s settled then.\u201d Emily bounced on the balls of her feet. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll carpool?\u201d She looked at Ryan and Alana, then especially at David.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d I froze, trying to think of a way to say I never went in cars with teenagers. I didn\u2019t want to insult their driving ability or have them make the standard enquiry, complete with raised brow.</p><p>\u201cActually.\u201d David took a small step forward. \u201cI uh\u2014I was going to ask Ara out tonight.\u201d He looked directly at me then. \u201cSo, perhaps...I could be your escort?\u201d</p><p>My brow folded. He was going to ask me out? What kind of out? Friends? More than friends? Friends who like to hold each other\u2019s hand then ignore each other in the morning?</p><p>\u201cOh, a date? Really?\u201d Emily said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realise you two had\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends,\u201d David said in a very business-like tone.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t mind sharing her for the night, man?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d David kind of nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and, um,\u201d I chimed in, looking sideways at him, \u201c\u2014and, really, hanging out with you guys\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So, you bring Ara, David, and I\u2019ll go with Ryan and Alana.\u201d Emily linked her arm through Alana\u2019s.</p><p>Ryan, all tall and lanky-looking, sighed enviously at Emily, subconsciously imitating the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It was so obvious he liked Alana. I wondered why he hadn\u2019t just got with the programme and asked her out. I mean, it was obvious the feelings were mutual.</p><p>The routine catch-up at the top of the stairs continued then, without my cerebral focus. They were all smiling and talking, but I couldn\u2019t really hear them. My thoughts were off with my troubles, somewhere in clueless land. David wasn\u2019t really present, either. He was smiling and talking, too, but kept looking at me with those narrowed eyes\u2014studying me\u2014probably unaware he was even staring. And all my brain could do was worry that he felt he\u2019d made a mistake talking with me that way last night. But I could feel the energy between us, still alive as always, and after praying so hard, every breath of yesterday afternoon, that he\u2019d lean forward and kiss me, I think I grew a little tired of wishing. Yet, despite that, I still kept looking at his lips, imagining it. My feelings had manifested overnight and \u2018I think I like holding your hand\u2019 was not going to do for me. Not long term. Either he had a confession of love buried somewhere in those emerald eyes, or I needed to go to therapy.</p><p>David laughed, catching a paper canon, then hurled it up the back of the room where its journey ended on the brow of a football jock. I slinked down lower in my chair; I\u2019d really rather avoid getting a headache from unfinished English homework. It was bad enough that Mr B, with his strict designated seating plan, placed me right up front, right next to David. Not that I minded the David part, I was just kinda worried I might do something to embarrass myself\u2014like drool all over his notebook or start playing footsies with him under the table.</p><p>\u201cMorning, class.\u201d Mr Benson walked in, oblivious to the origami air-raid going on behind him.</p><p>David sat quickly in his seat, playing the good student.</p><p>\u201cFaker,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak, then dropped his words with a smile as his hand shot up behind his head. Everyone behind us broke into claps and cheers. \u201cNice catch, man,\u201d one of the jocks called.</p><p>\u201cSettle down, class.\u201d Mr Benson eyed the room for a second before turning back to write on the board.</p><p>Totally and utterly confused, I frowned at David. What the hell was all that about?</p><p>He smiled broadly and opened his palm to reveal a paper cannon.</p><p>\u201cDid you just catch that behind your head? Without looking?\u201d</p><p>He dumped the scrunched up paper onto his desk and leaned closer. \u201cOf course not. I just made it look that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a good catch. Er. I mean catcher.\u201d</p><p>He looked to the front of the class, crossing his arms over his chest, laughing to himself.</p><p>I left my lips slightly open as I smiled, because the sweet scent of his cologne brushed pleasantly over my tongue every time he leaned in or spoke. He smelled so fresh, like he\u2019d just stepped out of the shower, still steaming and hot, then sprayed deodorant all over his skin.</p><p>\u201cI need everyone to take out their notepads and jot some notes down for...\u201d Mr Benson started, but I lost focus as David leaned down and unzipped his bag. With his body angled that way, one side lengthened, his arm slightly up, stretching forward, his cologne dominated our private little space; I drew a really deep breath, then opened my eyes slowly\u2014meeting with his direct gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d He held back a chuckle, placing two pens and two notepads on his desk.</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you...thinking about ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He bit his lip, looking at mine. \u201cYou looked like one of those girls off a seductive ice cream commercial.\u201d</p><p>I flashed him a grin and he sat back, breathing out his laughter.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Mr Benson folded his arms, leaning on the front of his desk. \u201cToday, we\u2019ll be having a class discussion about...\u201d</p><p>Toes in the sand\u2014standing on a beach at sunset, kissing, making everyone who passes jealous...</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mr Benson said. \u201cPerhaps you can answer that question for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d I sat up a little. Crap!</p><p>David nudged me and held out three fingers under the desk.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014three?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Mr B turned back to the board. \u201cThere were three characters in...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d David folded his arms again and kicked his legs out straight in front of him, crossing his ankles. He was wearing those heavy black boots again; I\u2019d seen him in those nearly every day, except yesterday, when we sat on the grass by my swing, talking for hours\u2014our fingers entwined; his cold, like mine, yet warmer than mine. It felt so good, but for such a short time, because as soon as the sun went down, he left. I offered him to stay for dinner, but he said he already had plans. Talk about disappointment.</p><p>I wanted to touch his fingers again\u2014to make sure they really felt the way I remembered.</p><p>When David\u2019s head turned to watch the pacing teacher move around the class, I stared down at his hand, just to gauge the distance. Maybe I could accidentally brush past him or...</p><p>\u201cYou could at least try to concentrate.\u201d He leaned his head a little closer as he spoke, keeping his eyes forward, his arms folded.</p><p>How could I concentrate when every time he breathed, I could feel it and hear it? All I wanted was to rest my head against his chest and listen to his heart.</p><p>\u201cAra, stop that,\u201d he whispered gruffly.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you know that look you get\u2014when you\u2019re thinking...things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>His lips parted, his eyes sparkling with a grin. \u201cWell, you\u2019re...thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t sit next to me then,\u201d I whispered back playfully.</p><p>\u201cI shall ask Mr Benson to move my seat if you wish,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, David, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEyes forward please, Miss Thompson,\u201d Mr Benson said.</p><p>The eyes of every student in the class made my spine go stiff. Damn this tongue.</p><p>When Mr Benson looked away, I tore a strip of paper from my notepad, coughing over the sound it made. David smiled, watching my crafty display of rebellion. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he whispered so low it was only his cool breath I heard as his lips shaped the words.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d I frowned at him and nodded toward the teacher.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d he said, leaning over to look at the paper.</p><p>\u201cNo peeking.\u201d I hid it with my elbow.</p><p>He sat back in his chair, chuckling quietly.</p><p>Sorry, I wrote. When I said that, I just meant that you make me lose my concentration. I want to be next to you. I just wish we weren\u2019t at school.</p><p>There, that should do it. Somehow, it was so much easier to say what I wanted to say when I didn\u2019t actually have to say it. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>David placed a fingertip on the top corner of the note and slid it across the desk.</p><p>\u201cI want you all to write this down,\u201d Mr Benson said, scribbling on the board.</p><p>I dared to glance back to see what David thought of my note; he slipped it into his pocket, smiling my favourite smile\u2014the one that lit up the corners of his eyes before showing in his lips\u2014but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cPoint one.\u201d Mr Benson wrote number one to ten on the board, and kept talking about something I cared nothing for.</p><p>David, with his left hand, started taking notes, looking up at the board and back down again, and I watched in amazement. How did I not notice he was left-handed? His guitar wasn\u2019t left-handed.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He slid a page of notes across to me; an exact copy of what was on the board.</p><p>\u201cThanks. But, don\u2019t you need these?\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at another page in front of him; the same notes.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I toyed with the edge of the paper.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David whispered, eyes forward, head close to mine.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I hold your hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In class.\u201d</p><p>The idea took my breath. I couldn\u2019t even nod. I felt his cool touch just above my elbow before he slid his fingers slowly down the length of my arm, making little bumps lift the fine hairs as they followed the curve to the back of my hand. I flipped my palm over and our fingers laced.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded, squeezing his hand tightly. Just don\u2019t ever let go, David.</p><p>We sat with our hands concealed under the desk for the rest of class. But every now and then, David ran his thumb over mine and smiled at me\u2014and every time he did that, my heart skipped into my throat like the rush you get on a roller coaster.</p><p>I grinned like the Cheshire cat, silently praying the teacher wouldn\u2019t notice the reason for my happiness, and as I sat, feeling closer to this boy than I had to anyone in my life, ever before, I drew a conclusion again that I thought I\u2019d discarded completely; I was in love. Even if you couldn\u2019t fall in love with someone in four days, I didn\u2019t care. It didn\u2019t change how I felt right then. I could only hope, as I watched David trying to conceal his own smile, that he\u2019d one day feel the way I did. Definitely in love.</p><p>Dad paced the floor, hands behind his back, droning on about some faerie myth, and as usual, Emily and I quietly gossiped our way through the hour. She scribbled another fact about her latest crush on a page and passed it to me. Since he sat behind us, the only thing we could actually talk about in here was David. Which is why History was my new favourite, David-less class. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI already know that,\u201d I said to Em, sliding the paper back to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d She looked a little sheepish. \u201cDid I tell you he lives near you?\u201d</p><p>I half glanced over my shoulder at him; he was plain, kind of quiet, like Alana, but with sandy hair. His only redeeming quality was his dazzling hazel, almost green-grey eyes. \u201cI met him once\u2014on my first day,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, what did he say to you? Was he nice? Did he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d I put my hand up between us; she had somehow managed to excite herself so much she\u2019d almost drifted onto my lap. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just talk to him?\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head and took a half glance back at him. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d</p><p>In my mind, I flicked my hand out and whacked her across the back of the head; in the real world, I just rolled my eyes at her. Ever since she first took real notice of him at rehearsals yesterday, all she\u2019d done was talk about what this person told her about him, or what that person said he did in Math class. But I had to agree with her when she said that ever since she first decided he was perfect, she\u2019d seen the world move in slow motion. Now, that I understood.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you and David going out now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re going out tonight, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dummy.\u201d She slapped my arm. \u201cI mean, has he asked you to be his girlfriend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo guys do that?\u201d</p><p>Her expression said the words her lips held back. \u201cYes, Ara. Guys ask girls out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, no. He didn\u2019t. He um\u2014he said he liked holding my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. PG.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and sat facing the front again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just being a gentleman\u2014\u201d She leaned a little closer, keeping her eyes on Dad as if we were paying attention to him. \u201cI mean, that would be very like him, Ara. He might be waiting for you to make the first move?\u201d</p><p>I sat up in my chair. \u201cYeah, he does have that freaky old-world charm thing. Maybe he\u2019s ultra-traditional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would make sense.\u201d She offered, rolling out a flat palm.</p> <p>I chuckled once. \u201cMaybe I should offer him my intentions in writing, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d I elbowed her. \u201cThat was a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She frowned. \u201cAra, you tell the worst jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I must get it from my dad.\u201d I grinned as the whole class broke into laughter at one of his inadvertently humorous comments.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Emily sighed, leaning on her hand, dreamily gazing at Dad. \u201cHe\u2019s funny. You must\u2019ve inherited your terrible joke problem from your mom.\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped for a beat. \u201cYeah. I guess I do.\u201d And it was true. But not from the mom they all thought I grew up with. I got my terrible joke problem from the mother I just buried. It was kind of our little game\u2014almost an art form; lame \u2018Dad\u2019 jokes for a girl without a dad around. And I didn\u2019t realise, until now, that I was still playing it.</p><p>I saw myself then\u2014the girl standing by a coffin, looking down, wondering how I would walk away\u2014say goodbye to someone I\u2019d loved my whole life. I left her there, walked on, but my heart would never let go, never believe she wouldn\u2019t wake up\u2014never play that game with me again.</p><p>I covered my quivering jaw, releasing a moist, jagged breath into my hands. I needed to run. I needed to leave the class before the grief broke through right here in front of everyone.</p><p>Dad looked up suddenly and started talking with a slight information-stutter as he frowned at me. \u201cSorry, class\u2014\u201d He sauntered casually over to his desk and lifted a piece of paper, \u201c\u2014just remembered I need to send a note up to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, I\u2019ll go Mr T,\u201d one of the girls said, holding her hand high in the air.</p><p>\u201cActually\u2014\u201d He scanned the room. \u201cEdmond!\u201d The whole class turned to look up the back of the room, following Dad\u2019s unusual tone. Edmond dropped his phone and sat up straight, pulling his headphones out of his ears. Dad handed me the note and whispered, \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>I went. My feet carried me swiftly, leaving the curious stares of the entire class burning into my back, and the lecture on why we don\u2019t play with phones in class absconded into the empty corridor until the door slammed shut behind me.</p><p>Holding my breath, I dropped the fake note to the floor and felt for the wall as the hot, salty liquid of my troubled past streamed down my cheeks. For every tear I swiped away, another took its place, and I fought to quiet my sobs, but the pain just went too deep.</p><p>\u201cStupid jokes.\u201d I kicked the base of the wall. This was why I swore I\u2019d never let my guard down, why I swore I wouldn\u2019t try to make friends here. As soon as they found out, they\u2019d all crowd around me in the lunchroom, using my pain to fill the boring hour. I\u2019d seen it happen before when a girl lost her mum to cancer at my old school. I couldn\u2019t let that happen to me.</p><p>Slowly, I rolled my face upward to look at the classroom door, kind of wondering why Dad hadn\u2019t come out to see if I was okay\u2014see if I needed a hug, because, for the first time since I lost her, that was all I really wanted. Just a hug. Just to feel like someone could hold me down\u2014stop me from floating away.</p><p>I dropped my forehead against the wall and hugged myself, not really sure I could do this anymore.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Long, cool fingers slowly gripped my arms from behind. \u201cWhat happened? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d His words were barely a whisper, but I recognised his voice right away, and he was the last person I wanted to see. He\u2019d definitely ask questions\u2014questions I didn\u2019t want to answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m okay, David. I just...\u201d I wiped my face, keeping my head down. \u201cI guess being new just got to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is not nerves or fear, Ara. This is grief.\u201d His fingers tightened on my arms, his gently melodic tone forcing a rise of heartache inside my chest. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I sobbed, wrapping my fingers over my entire face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He tried to turn my shaking body, but I held fast, afraid to let him see me. \u201cIt\u2019s really okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Why does everyone always say that?\u201d I asked, barely able to understand myself. \u201cI\u2019m so sick of hearing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. Please. Please. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d His hand came forward, cupping my shoulder as he spun me gently into his chest and wrapped me up in his arms. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to,\u201d I said, shielding my face in the darkness against his chest. And he smelled so good, so real and so warm. He smelled like something safe, like a person who could hold on to me if I fell. I wanted to hold on; I wanted to wrap my arms around his waist and just hold on. But my arms, tucked so tightly into my chest, just couldn\u2019t break free. I just needed to be small, closed in.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He rubbed my back and took a step, keeping me close to his chest as we walked. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I hiccupped in an embarrassingly high-pitched tone. \u201cWhere\u2019re we going?\u201d</p><p>He looked down and smiled at me. \u201cWe\u2019re going somewhere we can be alone\u2014talk.\u201d</p><p>And like that, in one sentence, David hit every chord I ever wanted to hear. My heart squeezed tighter, then twisted into a large, pulsing knot\u2014a good knot.</p><p>As we hurried into the front parking lot, I glanced over my shoulder every few seconds\u2014watching for teachers, while David stayed calm, walking with the grace of a king. We stopped by the passenger door of a shiny black car with a soft-top roof.</p><p>\u201cIs this your car?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m stealing it.\u201d He jammed the key in the lock and twisted it, then laughed at me. \u201cYes, it\u2019s my car, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d He looked at the car, then at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a little old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassic old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda. It was my uncle\u2019s.\u201d He held the door open for me. \u201cHop in.\u201d</p><p>As David shut the door, the exasperating heat closed me in right away, and the tan leather seat burned the backs of my thighs under my skirt. I lifted one leg, then the other, and wiped the sweat from under my knees, placing fabric between skin.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d David asked, opening his door, releasing the tight pressure of exasperation for a moment.</p><p>I nodded, slinking down lower in my seat. \u201cI\u2019ve never ditched school before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t ditching,\u201d he said. \u201cYour dad will understand.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>He smiled across at me and shook his head, reaching into his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasing your conscience.\u201d He pinned a number into his phone and pressed it to his ear, taking my hand. \u201cMiss Apple?\u201d</p><p>I heard her voice muffled on the other end.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have Ara Thompson with me; can you let her father know she\u2019s fine, and I\u2019m taking her for a walk to clear her head.\u201d</p><p>I slowly inched up in the chair, inconspicuously wiping a few dots of moisture from my upper lip.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll bring her home later. Give him my number if he wishes to check on her. Okay. Bye.\u201d He hung up the phone and dumped it in the centre console, then started the engine.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome.\u201d</p><p>I sat back then and rubbed under my eyes where the tears had dried in the heat, making my skin stiff. Even my nose felt dry and swollen.</p><p>We sat at the exit sign for a second until the traffic passed, then David took off down the street, going slightly over the speed limit. \u201cHow long have you had your licence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while.\u201d He looked at my forehead and frowned; I wiped the sweat away with the back of my hand. \u201cOh, sorry, Ara. I don\u2019t really feel the heat as much as most people. Here.\u201d He turned on the air-conditioner. The suffocation of the heat eased after the first blast of hot air passed and the chilly wind blew against my face. \u201cIs that better?\u201d</p><p>With my nose pressed to the vent, I nodded. \u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get hot or cold, Ara, you really need to tell me. It\u2019s just not something I think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I sat back in my seat and angled the vent to blast along my hairline.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m insensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re so neglectful of others\u2019 feelings, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Sometimes I lose sleep over it.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cMm, I don\u2019t know how you live with yourself,\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cTakes practice.\u201d And he meant that, I could tell. And I was sure it was aimed at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegret. It takes time to live with it.\u201d He reached across and took my hand again. \u201cYou called your mom Vicki the other day.\u201d</p><p>I felt numb then, not just from the crying but the stupidity. \u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And if I am good at only one thing, Ara, it\u2019s deduction; I think I\u2019ve known for a while now that your mom died. I just don\u2019t know why you pretend she hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my face slowly toward my chest. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want people to ask how she died. Didn\u2019t want them to feel sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople only feel sorry for you when there\u2019s good reason, Ara. Your mom\u2019s gone. People just want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d But I didn\u2019t want their help. Every ache was a step toward redemption.</p><p>\u201cRedemption?\u2019 David said.</p><p>I looked up at him quickly. \u201cDid I say that out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d He looked at the road again, his face grey. \u201cYes. Didn\u2019t you mean to?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe my own carelessness. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean by that\u2014about redemption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that...when you do something wrong, sometimes you can make up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy doing what?\u201d</p><p>I blinked a few times and the dried tears made my skin crack a little. \u201cSuffering.\u201d</p><p>The car slowed for a second, then, as David sat taller, his fingers tighter on the wheel, it went back up to speed.</p><p>I flipped the visor mirror down and gasped at the mess David had been looking at for the last five minutes. My life was over. I wiped the smudges of black mascara from under my eyes, using the remaining tears around my lashes to smooth it away without too much of a problem. But I couldn\u2019t wipe away the blotchy patches of red under my skin and worse, my nose, whenever I cried, turned bright pink\u2014forming a giant rouge smudge across my face. \u201cI look like a clown,\u201d my voice quivered.</p><p>\u201cYou look\u2014\u201d David turned my face with his fingertips, \u201c\u2014adorable.\u201d</p><p>Right. Adorable. Was he serious? I folded my arms across my chest, looked out the window and focused on my breathing. The passing houses and tree-lined streets were all the same around here. Pretty, with that old-style, Halloween kind of feel. It felt like it should be autumn and everything sort of orange and brown, with the slight hint of cinnamon in the air. But the summer had this magic little place trapped in its grasp, making everything yellow and gold, and a little wilted.</p><p>The trees thickened as we turned onto a narrow road with dirt strips on both sides, and my squinting eyes relaxed as the sun\u2019s glare disappeared over the canopy. \u201cDavid, where\u2019re we going?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomewhere quiet, where no one can hear us.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThat sounded kinda creepy.\u201d</p><p>He laughed too. \u201cSorry. I realised that just as I said it.\u201d</p> <p>I sat taller to take a good look at the deserted forest road. \u201cWhy should we be where no one can hear us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, you need to talk. And you won\u2019t talk if you think someone might hear you.\u201d</p><p>I looked away, pinching the base of my thumb with my fingertips. He was right; I did need to talk, but I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. He had this delusion that I was some nice, sweet girl. He didn\u2019t know the real me\u2014the one that I was trying not to be anymore.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess\u2014\u201d He smiled, watching the road carefully, taking the curves with a kind of precision that put my dad\u2019s driving to shame. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna talk to me about it. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I looked out the window. \u201cIt was nice of you to bring me out here, but I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you go until you talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you going to do? Torture a confession out of me?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head a little, keeping his eyes on the road. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it won\u2019t work. I have my reasons for not wanting to talk, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they mean nothing to me. You\u2019re talking. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me.\u201d I folded my arms and stared ahead, biting my teeth together.</p> <p>The car slowed dramatically, gravel crunching under the tires as we pulled onto the side of the desolate road. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David said again.</p><p>Begrudgingly, I twisted my neck to look at him. I felt kind of like a spoilt kid throwing a tantrum.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, turning his whole body to face me. \u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re taking things a little too seriously. I meant no harm. Really. And the more I think about it\u2014\u201d he rolled back in his seat and faced the front, a cheeky grin stretching the corners of his mouth, \u201c\u2014the more I think I might just have to kidnap you until you do talk to me.\u201d</p><p>A small smile crept onto my lips. I pressed them together firmly to keep it hidden.</p><p>\u201cAra, please don\u2019t be so moody. It\u2019s okay to smile.\u201d</p><p>I let my arms fall away from my chest with the release of a long breath. The ogre was obviously dominating my mood right now. I should\u2019ve eaten more at lunch. \u201cI know you have the best of intentions here, David. But this is really nothing to do with you.\u201d I tried to sound polite, but the words came out sounding so mean.</p> <p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d he said after a second. \u201cI want to help you. All the bad things, Ara, all the pain you feel\u2014\u201d he reached for my hand; I let him take it, \u201c\u2014I can make it all hurt less. But you have to let me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said in a breaking whisper and turned away.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I looked back at him.</p><p>He smiled and opened his door, allowing the clammy air to mingle with the pleasant, artificial cool. \u201cSomewhere better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting out in the hea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d David appeared on my right, opening my door.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get there so fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He grabbed my hand, leaning in to unbuckle me. \u201cI wanna show you something.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The trees opened out to a forest trail before us, and the sun streaked through gaps in the tightly laced canopy, splashing long, dust-filled beams across the path. Above us, the summer heat looked on, forbidden to taint the cool, kind of clay-scented air.</p><p>\u201cWatch your step here.\u201d David steered me around a small cluster of rocks hidden beneath a pile of leaves.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I totally didn\u2019t see that.\u201d</p><p>He gave a soft nod, sliding his hand off my lower back. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouth-west.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Helpful.\u201d I looked to the path ahead, then up at the ball-shaped glare of the sun through the trees, using my hand as a visor. \u201cBut actually, we\u2019re going slightly more south.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d David nodded. \u201cThe path we\u2019re on heads south, but turns to the west up ahead.\u201d He stopped walking and looked at me. \u201cWait, how did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Aussie.\u201d I used my best homeland-sounding accent. \u201cMy friend Mike taught me how to roughly guess my direction by looking at the sun\u2014said it would come in handy if I ever found myself in the bush...with a strange guy...who might not turn out to be so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d David wiped a hand across his grin as he started walking again. \u201cSounds like Mike\u2019s a smart man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I followed after him, making no real effort to catch up. \u201cTaught me some defensive moves, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He sprung up right in front of me, catching me as my face hit his chest. \u201cYou weren\u2019t hinting at me about anything, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get there so fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was standing right here, waiting for you. You really should watch where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>I glared up at him quizzically.</p><p>\u201cAra? I asked you a question. Were you suggesting I\u2019d be capable of hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know? I don\u2019t really know you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes left my face before he turned and trudged off. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t really give me much to go on.\u201d I chased after him. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re so secretive all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecretive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what, specifically?\u201d He stopped again, wearing a defensive smile.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d I stopped walking too. \u201cWell. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you want me to be less secretive about nothing specifically?\u201d He nodded once and started walking again.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d My footfalls came down hard on the muddy leaves, slipping a little with the weight of irritation.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake my well-thought-out point and turn it into nothing.\u201d</p><p>The smile sparkled in his eyes as I caught up to him. \u201cIt\u2019s a talent of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s annoying. I really hate you for it,\u201d I said in a light-hearted tone.</p><p>He stopped again, almost as if he\u2019d been sprung back by an elastic hinge. \u201cHate is a very powerful word, mon amour. Do not use it unless you truly understand its value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then...\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cI despise you...\u201d Affectionately.</p><p>David smiled to himself. \u201cI can live with that\u2014for now.\u201d</p><p>We walked in silence for a bit then; me, trying to control my breath so I didn\u2019t sound puffed out, beside him, who walked so straight and tall I wondered if he really felt the ground beneath his feet at all.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true, you know,\u201d I said after a while.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour inability to elaborate. I\u2019ve asked you heaps of questions about yourself and, somehow, you\u2019ve managed not to tell me anything. And I didn\u2019t even realise how little I actually knew until Emily started telling me all about Spencer, you know, what brands he likes, what colour his bike is. And she hadn\u2019t actually even spoken to him yet.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if you like cats or dogs.\u201d</p><p>He laughed to himself, his boots crunching dry leaves beneath his steps. \u201cCats, if I\u2019m sitting at home on a cold night; dogs, if I\u2019m going for a run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou run?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI like to keep fit.\u201d</p><p>I let that simmer for a while, thinking about everything.</p><p>After a minute of silent companionship, David stretched out his arm and pointed ahead of us. \u201cSee that slight thinning of the trees up ahead?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Everything with you is.</p><p>We walked toward a newly decaying cedar tree, laying sidelong, slanted a little down the slope of the trail, making a wooden partition between us and the sudden openness of whatever was beyond. As we came nearer to the opening, the muddy clay smell disappeared under a damp, kind of mossy scent, spiked with the lemony fragrance of tree sap.</p><p>David stepped up quickly and took my hand, guiding me around the tree. \u201cWelcome to the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the...\u201d</p><p>The leaves stole my gaze upward before casting it out to the unspoiled, reflective body of water in front of me. A grand pathway of clover blanketed the trail toward the edge of the lake, and tiny hovering bugs danced above the star-shaped foliage left abandoned by maple trees. Though the sky dominated the space, it still felt cool and shadowed and kind of...private. A place not so very different from the mountain-surrounded picnic spots my dad used to take me to, but with an element of magic to it, like, somehow, I could believe we were the only two souls left in the world.</p><p>\u201cDavid, this is beautiful.\u201d I searched the vacant place beside me where David no longer stood, finding him leaning on a bulky, waist-height rock, right by the water\u2019s edge. \u201cHow did you find this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something you\u2019d find on a hike.\u201d He unhitched himself from the black rock and walked behind it, then squatted down. \u201cNo one comes out to this trail anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnymore?\u201d</p><p>He stood up, smiling, and presented a pillow-sized black bag. \u201cThis land is owned by my family. We closed the hiking trails to outsiders about a hundred years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that like you were a part of the decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d he reached into the plastic bag and pulled out a picnic rug, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s up to each generation to decide. I chose to keep the land private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like knowing I can come here to think. That when I do, I\u2019ll be completely alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone is right.\u201d I looked around again. A few metres out, in the middle of the lake, a family of trees gathered on a small island, surrounded by a moat of algae. And the only other signs of life here, aside from David and I, were a couple of ugly brown ducks. \u201cIt\u2019s very...private here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt originated as hunting land.\u201d He tucked his hands into his pockets, taking a long breath, squinting as he observed the landscape.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You said it was hunting land.\u201d</p><p>His jaw rocked. \u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt was...\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cFoxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...what about now? Do you still hunt here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if the foxes stray onto the land\u2014disregarding the warnings around the border.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I laughed. \u201cLast I checked, foxes couldn\u2019t read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then they die,\u201d he stated, then plonked down on the blue-and-red chequered blanket, with his back against the rock. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy.\u201d He patted the spot next to him. \u201cI won\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms, remembering suddenly why he brought me out here.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ara. You know you wanna talk to me.\u201d The arrogant smile on his lips filtered through his voice. \u201cYou also know I\u2019m not going to let you go until you do\u2014and no kitten-force Kung-fu is going to help you. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve noticed, ma petite, but I\u2019m a lot bigger than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does ma petite mean?\u201d I twisted at the shoulders to face him.</p><p>He smiled to himself, looking down at his outstretched legs. \u201cRoughly? Little girl.\u201d</p><p>I huffed. \u201cI am not a little girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then stop acting like one. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to sit there, so badly, but letting him in to my world meant opening it, and I wasn\u2019t sure I even could anymore.</p><p>David shrugged, then rested his hands behind his head\u2014keeping his smiling eyes on me. \u201cI\u2019ve got all day.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, with his conceited stare melting my icy exterior, my frown dropped, my arms following, until, with a low sigh, I wandered over and sat down about a metre across from him. And he waited, saying nothing. I was happy to let time just pass around us\u2014happy to be this nice, sweet girl he thought I was, for just a little longer. But I knew it would come to an end. It had to eventually. He had to know the truth about me\u2014about what I\u2019d done. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you need to be sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might\u2019ve given you the wrong impression about myself.\u201d I lowered my gaze. I didn\u2019t want to see his face as I said this\u2014the way any compassion would dissolve from his eyes, and that look, the smile that seemed to be reserved only for me, would vanish into disrespect. \u201cActually, I deliberately gave you the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not a schoolgirl with a broken heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you see in me?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head when I looked at him. \u201cYou know what I see in you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what I wanted you to see\u2014everyone to see. But I\u2019m not nice. I\u2019m not sweet and I\u2019m not this golden child that organises benefits and listens to people talk about their day. I\u2014\u201d I laughed a little. \u201cHalf the time I really don\u2019t care what Emily thinks about the latest books she\u2019s reading and, most of the time, I cut her off\u2014talk about things I want to talk about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>David laughed. \u201cAnd your honesty is one of the other things I like about you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cBut it\u2019s not honesty. It\u2019s horrible. I mean, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t care about people, but, I...I never really place them first.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cAnd you think that makes you a bad person?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cMaybe just selfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so maybe you\u2019re selfish. I still like you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile at that, but dropped it quickly. \u201cWhat if...what if my selfishness went so deep it cost someone their life?\u201d</p><p>He rose to his knees and shuffled closer. \u201cThen you have to take a risk, right now\u2014you have to put faith in our friendship, and just know that when you tell me what you\u2019re going to tell me, I\u2019m here\u2014for you. Not for anyone else. I don\u2019t care about Emily or her trivial conversations either, Ara. Not right now.\u201d He grabbed my hand. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m here with you, my little friend, and you\u2019re going to tell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d</p><p>I stole my hand back and pressed both palms to my now cool cheeks, swallowing the tight lump in the back of my throat.</p> <p>\u201cAra,\u201d he said softly, cupping his hand over mine, his fingertips resting just beside my ear. \u201cI can see you holding back tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But if I let them go, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>He clicked his tongue. \u201cCan I tell you something? A little story\u2014a legend among my people.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, resting my hands in my lap.</p><p>\u201cThey say that the tears one cries for loss are the Tears of the Broken. We call them the Devil\u2019s Liquid because, for each one you shed alone, you sacrifice a piece of your soul.\u201d</p><p>I sniffled, looking up at him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd they also say that for each tear shared, you give a piece of yourself for someone else to safeguard until you\u2019re ready to see the sun rise again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you...\u201d Hot tears doubled my vision; I blinked them out. \u201cYou want to be that someone?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, his round eyes unmoving. \u201cAra, I am that someone.\u201d</p><p>Only a short sniffle passed before it all fell to pieces. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have been there, David.\u201d I covered my face, inaudible gusts of explanation dribbling through my lips. \u201cShe should\u2019ve been in her bed, sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom?\u201d</p><p>I nodded into my hands. \u201cIt was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was late.\u201d I swallowed. \u201cI called her to come get me. I could\u2019ve walked home, but\u2014\u201d I wedged my thumbnail between my teeth. \u201cIt was so stupid. I\u2019m seventeen. I\u2019m not a child. But I was angry and all I wanted was my mom. I just wanted to go home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you asked her to come get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that one act makes this your fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, I\u2014\u201d I looked over at the lake, at the ducks splashing about, without a care in the world. I wanted to be them; brown and ugly, but free.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking,\u201d David ordered softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you,\u201d I explained, using my hands as if to animate my words. \u201cThe memory has, like, faded or something. It all looks like it was filmed on some camera with this blue filter. I can\u2019t see it all as clearly as I did before. I just...it\u2019s like it happened to someone else.\u201d</p><p>He sat down, his feet flat to the floor on either side of my legs, our faces almost touching. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t. It happened to you, and I need you to talk to me about it, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt feels silly\u2014like, no matter how I paint the scene, you just won\u2019t understand\u2014you won\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t try to make me understand. Just tell me how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel...\u201d I closed my eyes for a second. \u201cAlone. Lost. So, so empty and so full of this incredibly strong...regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegret for calling her or for what you\u2019ve suffered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Harry.\u201d My voice completely broke.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy baby brother. He...I got in the car\u2014I shut the door and the first thing I did was look at Harry. He was pale. He\u2019d been sick for a week or so, and he just smiled at me. Two teeth, all gums. So bright. So happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt made you feel lighter\u2014to see him?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s...exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now? How do you feel to look back on that memory?\u201d</p><p>I closed my hands around my face. \u201cDark. Hollow. I can\u2019t see his face anymore. It\u2019s like...it\u2019s just so dark. And a part of me still feels scared\u2014like I\u2019m gonna get in trouble from my mom when I get home, you know\u2014for all the bad decisions I made that night. But, for that one moment, when I got in the car and she smiled at me like Harry did, I felt like I\u2019d made one right choice. Just one. And then...\u201d I couldn\u2019t say it. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to say the words out loud. It wasn\u2019t until right then that I realised I\u2019d never had to. My dad broke the news to everyone, while I stood, numb and silent.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking,\u201d David said, with the insistent tone of an adult.</p><p>\u201cAll I remember was pulling away from the stop sign, then feeling this incredible jolt. Mom\u2019s hand grabbed mine for a second, but...everything shook\u2014like the most violent roller coaster I\u2019ve ever been on. My arms, my head, everything just...\u201d I searched for the words. \u201cI felt pain, but it was the rush\u2014the speed of things I really remember. I heard Harry crying; heard glass; heard my mom\u2019s scream get cut off suddenly, but that\u2019s it. I shut my eyes, praying for it to end, and when I opened them again, we\u2019d stopped. The crying had stopped. The noise, everything.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know I was upside down until I tried to undo my seatbelt. But it was stuck. I was stuck, and all the blood was making my head tight, making it hard to breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe now,\u201d David said, placing his palm firmly against my ribs.</p><p>I took a long breath, releasing it slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realise I was holding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He smiled softly and pulled his hand away.</p><p>I focused on my breathing for a second until my head stopped spinning, then looked up at David\u2019s incredible green eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought much about the accident. I...I forgot a lot of things\u2014things I\u2019m remembering now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe silence.\u201d My eyes narrowed into the memory. \u201cThe way, after we stopped rolling, it was like the world stood, staring on, completely hushed for a moment, maybe waiting for our souls to leave the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Harry? What happened to him?\u201d</p><p>My lips turned down tightly, quivering. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hear him cry. I didn\u2019t want him to be hurt\u2014lost somewhere I couldn\u2019t get to him. I was glad he was quiet. But I didn\u2019t know what that meant. I didn\u2019t know it meant...\u201d My words flaked away as thoughts that rushed through my head when I looked into the backseat and saw nothing came flooding back.</p><p>\u201cWhere was he?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was...gone.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, his hand coming up on my shoulder as he pulled me in, cradling my face against his chest.</p><p>\u201cHis blue beanie\u2014the one Mom knitted when we found out he was a boy\u2014it was still there. It came right off his head. It...I wanted to grab it, but I was afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know. Maybe that I\u2019d see blood or...maybe worse.\u201d My voice trailed down to a whisper on the end. \u201cI didn't know what to do. I...no one came. I thought people would come running, but no one came. So...I just...I screamed. I knew it wouldn\u2019t help, but I couldn't stop it. And something I learned that day\u2014\u201d I looked up into David\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how loud you scream. There is no such thing as the worst things can get. There is no rock bottom. There is only a deep, endless pit of hell that you can fall through. You always imagine, like the movies, that you scream and someone comes\u2014they come and they save you and they stop you from screaming. But...I stopped because my throat went dry. I screamed so long\u2014I stopped because my body couldn't scream anymore.\u201d My eyes filled with tears. \u201cWhere\u2019s the humanity in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is none,\u201d he said, drawing me into him again.</p><p>I closed my eyes and pictured the eerie dimness of the streetlights outside the car window, how, in the cold, the glow seemed to settle on the footpath like fog; the endless silence broken only by the hollow ticking of an indicator lamp\u2014distant and lonely in the dead of night. \u201cIf it had happened on another road\u2014maybe where there were houses, we would\u2019ve...someone would\u2019ve come sooner. But\u2014the drive home was down this freeway. If I\u2019d walked, I could\u2019ve cut through. I could've\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He stroked my hair. \u201cDon\u2019t go there, Ara. Just don\u2019t let yourself go there.\u201d</p><p>I studied the pattern of his denim jeans and the contrast of my white knee, nestled right into the underside of his upper thigh. He was slowly moving closer and closer, and I only felt safe and closed-in. \u201cI never believed in God. My mom tried to make me. I just never really believed. But, in that moment, when everything was dead quiet and I couldn\u2019t see my mom, didn\u2019t know where Harry was, I prayed. I leaned on my elbows to hold my weight, clasped my hands together around all the blood and glass, and begged God to let Harry be okay. But he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay now, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? Harry was my world, David. Ever since he was born, all I ever did was talk about him, play with him...and...how can you think it\u2019s okay that he's dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I said he\u2019s not suffering anymore.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my lap, sniffling. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for any of this. I didn\u2019t mean for them to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, of course you didn\u2019t, sweetheart.\u201d He wrapped me in his arms, turning me slightly so my shoulder rested against his chest. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut even still, it was my fault, and I know I shouldn\u2019t think like that, I really do. But I feel like a murderer. I\u2014\u201d I looked back on the memory of the empty backseat and the feeling of everything being gone. It was like lying flat on a steel bed, having someone hit your soul with a rubber mallet, sending it in black splatters everywhere; each piece reaching out to something tingly, making you shake. I had no control. I didn\u2019t know where Harry was and couldn\u2019t get free to make him okay. \u201cHe was just a baby. What if he was awake? What if he was cold and wondering why we\u2019d left him there? What if he wanted to go home?\u201d I burst into tears. \u201cOh, David. I just wanna take him home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy love. I wish I could make you better. God knows, I do. But, I know, so much better than anyone, what that feels like\u2014to lose something precious\u2014and that there\u2019s nothing I can even say.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI just...how can he be gone? I was there. I was squeezing my mom\u2019s hand when he was born. I was the first person to hold him. I suggested his name, David. How could all that be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, my love, life just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s like...It\u2019s like creating something; like crafting it and painting it, then, in one stupid move, dropping it to the ground.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed gentle circles over my back. \u201cI know, but I also know that by talking to me, you\u2019re taking the first step toward healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, David. I just feel like I\u2019ve been lashed with something big and hard, and I can\u2019t make that go away.\u201d I touched my chest where it always hurt. \u201cI tried to tell myself it wasn\u2019t my fault. I tried to make amends, pray for forgiveness, but it doesn\u2019t matter what I do. This pain, it doesn\u2019t go. I feel choked-up and so damn sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you don\u2019t need to be sorry, Ara. You know this wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>My face crumpled. I truly wished I believed that. \u201cI\u2019ve been through every one of Vicki\u2019s books\u2014trying to find a way to make sense of the guilt. And I know all the facts. But science doesn\u2019t measure grief, David. It can\u2019t, and it can\u2019t make sense of it. In my heart\u2014\u201d I touched the base of my ribs. \u201cWay down here\u2014I think, maybe my soul, I can\u2019t put the guilt away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime, Ara.\u201d He hugged me close again. \u201cTime is all that can heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I get so angry. Sometimes I really think I\u2019m okay, and then I get so angry at myself. I hate myself for making that phone call\u2014for going out that night. I just\u2014sometimes the anger is so much stronger than the grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you angry about, Ara\u2014just that you called her?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cSo many things. I think the powerlessness, you know, the feeling like I had no control, and that it was my life. My goddamn life, but I was a kid; just a kid who had to do as she was told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I bit my teeth together, folding forward as the feelings I\u2019d pushed down rose up in me again, making everything tight in my core. \u201cThey took me away; they came, and they leaned into that car and all they said was this one\u2019s alive. Then they took me away. They wouldn\u2019t let me go; wouldn\u2019t let me find Harry. I was fine. I wasn\u2019t hurt. Just glass and cuts, but I was fine. If I could\u2019ve\u2014if they just let me look. I might\u2019ve found him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid\u2014did they ever find him?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThey found his seat on the side of the road.

But I heard a nurse say the cop was having counselling\u2014the one that found him.\u201d</p><p>He clicked his tongue and squeezed me tighter. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have had to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And it made me so mad. I mean, I was over sixteen; legally old enough to make my own medical decisions. Legally old enough to be told what was going on. But they stuck me in that bed, drugged up on who knows what\u2014left alone until my dad arrived\u2014from America. They let him tell me my mom was dead. They let him tell me I\u2019d been horrifically scarred. And he didn\u2019t even say it. It was the way he looked at me, David. He hadn\u2019t seen me in nearly a year, and the first time he laid eyes on me was when my face had been ripped apart. What do you think I saw in him that morning?\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s throat shifted. \u201cI know. But you\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be safe, though. I feel like I owe a debt.\u201d</p> <p>He tilted my face upward with both hands. \u201cA debt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. Like I said, I know it\u2019s not my fault. I know it was an accident. But I feel like they\u2019re coming for me. Like I gave my family to them, and now they want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. The other side\u2014death. Karma, maybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s teeth slid slowly over each other as his jaw came forward and his eyes flicked to the place of deep thoughts. \u201cDo you\u2014do you ever think of taking those matters into your own hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm. Like, maybe I could trade places. You know\u2014offer myself in exchange. If I could go back, maybe I could\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra, my love, there is no going back.\u201d His hands tightened on my face. \u201cWe make mistakes, we have regrets, but, sweetheart\u2014\u201d He opened and closed his mouth a few times, his eyes searching my face for any words he could say to make it all okay. \u201cIt was selfish of you to make her come out and get you in the middle of the night, and it if it weren\u2019t for that, she would never have been there when that truck tire blew out. But that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t her time to go. You can\u2019t control everything, Ara, and what matters is that, if you were to go back, you\u2019d do it differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possibly any good to me\u2014to know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you learned something. And if that\u2019s all you can take from this, then it\u2019s better than walking away with only grief.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that rubbish, David. They spoon-fed me that crap in the hospital until I nearly choked on it. There is no lesson to be learned. There is no goddamn bright side. There are two facts here; they are dead, and if I hadn\u2019t called Mom, they wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>I could tell David was frustrated. I could tell he wanted to shake me. I wanted to shake me. I didn\u2019t want to feel this way, and couldn\u2019t expect anyone else to understand, which is precisely why I hadn\u2019t said it to anyone.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you shaking your head?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cI just...I\u2019m angry. Not at you, but...at everything. What...who was looking after you? Who\u2019s been talking to you about this, who have you had to comfort you?\u201d</p><p>I brushed my hair from my face. \u201cMy dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes he know you blame yourself?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, unable to see my shoes through the blur of tears. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of closure have you had, girl? Did he even let you farewell them in their graves before he dragged you away from the only home you\u2019ve ever known?\u201d David sounded almost as angry as me.</p><p>\u201cWe went to the funeral. But a storm hit. It rained so hard I could only see a grey blur in front of me where their coffins should be. And most people left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAt first, I refused. I knelt on the ground, in the mud, letting it soak through my clothes. I just wanted to touch them\u2014to feel them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your dad made you leave, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again. \u201cI sat there, with my hand on Harry\u2019s coffin, just watching the rain drip over my skin and into the ground where he was headed. I didn\u2019t want him to go in there. I didn\u2019t want that to be it for him. And my dad...he sat down next to me.\u201d I smiled. \u201cHe got covered in mud. He just took my hand and moved it down a little, told me it was over Harry\u2019s heart\u2014that he had his teddy and his little blanket in there to keep him warm and that, tucked up right beside his face was a picture of me and Mom. And I got up, and as soon as Dad got to his feet too, I shoved him, and I yelled at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA teddy?\u201d I wiped my nose on the back of my wrist. \u201cHe put a teddy in there with Harry. What teddy? Why didn\u2019t he come to me? Ask me? Harry would\u2019ve wanted his monkey\u2014Pappy. He wouldn\u2019t want some stupid teddy. But it was too late. It was sealed up\u2014locked up. I couldn't change it. I couldn\u2019t change any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it.\u201d He rested his chin on my head, shaking his. \u201cAra, I just\u2014I just wish I\u2019d known you then. I just wish I\u2019d met you sooner. I had no idea you were carrying this much grief. I mean, I knew you were sad, I knew you were grieving, but this...\u201d He kissed my hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it went this deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one does. And I won\u2019t tell them. And neither will you.\u201d It came out as a demand, but deep down, it was a question. He held all the cards right now. If he told my dad I called my mum that night, I\u2019m not sure Dad would ever forgive me.</p><p>David\u2019s soothing touch wordlessly tried to wash the pain of my scars away. He just sat there, shaking his head, making line after line over my jaw. \u201cWhen did this happen? You arrived here a month ago, but your scars\u2014they\u2019re healed too much to have such little time pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was June. My dad and I stayed at a motel until my face healed enough for me to go out in public again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA motel? Didn\u2019t you have any family to stay with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly Mike\u2014my best friend. But I didn\u2019t want to see him, and we couldn\u2019t go back to the house. Dad said it would be too painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve. But you still should have gone back once before leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I made him take me back there before we got on the plane, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>As I craned my neck to look at David, he gazed down at me, the feel of his breath on my nose and lips calming me with the reality of his existence.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I pictured the grey day, the cold wind and the rain making waterfalls over the windscreen as we pulled up outside my house. The lights were all out and the remainder of the daylight fought against thunderclouds for right of existence in my world. I took each shaky step up to the porch with a kind of stillness that had my dad lingering closely behind me. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t really hit me that they were gone,\u201d I said. \u201cNot until I pushed the door open and looked down the hall. And...for a second, I waited, expecting, truly believing I\u2019d see Harry crawl up to me at full speed with his little train in his hand.</p><p>\u201cEverything looked the same and it smelled like home, but it was empty\u2014and so very quiet\u2014like they weren\u2019t there anymore. I couldn\u2019t feel them there anymore.\u201d I tapped my chest with an open palm, trying to push the pain back in. \u201cThe dishes were still in the sink, and the clock on the wall was still ticking\u2014that much stayed the same. It felt strange, how, even though we weren\u2019t there, time just kept moving without us.\u201d I shook my head slowly, seeing that ticking hand. \u201cIt should\u2019ve stopped, but it didn\u2019t. That\u2019s when I fell down. It hit me so hard. I just broke apart and cried in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cDad didn\u2019t know what to do. He ran next door to get Mrs Baker; she made me get up. She told me I had to be strong now; that childhood passes with tragedy, and the sooner I came to accept that, the easier my life would be.\u201d</p><p>David groaned, folding my face into his chest. \u201cWhat did your dad say to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He just led me to my room and shut the door.\u201d I closed my eyes and saw the dark shadows in the hallway near my room, how the absence of that warm summer sun meant the death of everything I loved. \u201cI packed a few things, and...as I was leaving, I went to Harry\u2019s room\u2014to get Pappy, his monkey toy, but Dad blocked the door; he wouldn\u2019t let me go in there.\u201d I broke to tears so deep the words came out in hiccups.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it would hurt more. He said I needed to make Harry a memory\u2014something that didn\u2019t feel real anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just doing what he thought was best, Ara.\u201d David choked back tears.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nodded. \u201cBut he was wrong. They all think they know what I need\u2014but they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, sweetheart?\u201d he asked. \u201cTell me, and I\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go back, David\u2014to that night. I need to put down that goddamn phone, and if I can\u2019t do that, I just need to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d David grabbed both my cheeks, thrusting my face up until I looked into his eyes. \u201cWhat do you think your mother would feel to hear you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it.\u201d I pushed his hands away. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t feel anything, because she\u2019s dead, and it\u2019s my fault. No matter what you try to say, it\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was no one\u2019s fault. Get it through your head.\u201d He grabbed me more firmly, not letting me break away this time. \u201cYou wanna blame someone, blame the truck driver, blame the tire shop who fitted used tires, but don\u2019t blame yourself because it won\u2019t bring them back.\u201d</p><p>My brow creased tightly in the middle. I grabbed his hand slowly. \u201cWait, I never said there was a truck.\u201d</p><p>David stiffened, staring ahead, his mouth hanging open a little, like he was about to say something. I retraced my story in my head.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I sat back so I could look right into his eyes. \u201cTell me how you knew that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He winced, scratching the back of his neck. \u201cI kind of already knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid...did my dad tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything.\u201d He wiped his thumb over a line of tears on my cheek. \u201cBut he told me why you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d I yelled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, calm down, it\u2019s okay.\u201d He went to pull me closer, but I pushed away as hard as I could.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re traitors\u2014both of you.\u201d I jumped to my feet to get as much distance from him as possible.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, don\u2019t be upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. All this time. All this time, you knew. You knew and you made me talk about it. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I knew it wasn\u2019t just their death bothering you. I knew it went deeper.\u201d He stood up too. \u201cTurns out I was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d My eyes went wide, realisation sinking in like nausea. \u201cSo, you were spying, for my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, no\u2014\u201d He extended his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat would possibly make you want to do that, David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, it wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d He edged closer, both hands out now.</p><p>\u201cWhen did he tell you\u2014how long have you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen!\u201d My scream echoed off the rocks and came back to haunt me with its severity.</p><p>\u201cWhen you first came here.\u201d He walked slowly toward me, as if I were a mental patient he was going to grab at first opportunity. \u201cHe caught me during football practice, watching you on the swing, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were...watching me?\u201d An eerie sensation travelled over my neck and spine, like a hand just touched my shoulder in a room that was supposed to be empty.</p><p>\u201cNot like you think.\u201d</p><p>I backed away one step at a time in unison with his. \u201cYou\u2019re a creep.\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking, lowering his arms as his green eyes flooded. \u201cI know how this sounds, Ara-Rose. But it wasn\u2019t like that. I swear. Just, please. Listen to me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, though it wasn\u2019t out of amusement. \u201cAll this time\u2014you\u2019ve known about me. Even when we talked in the library?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I shook my head, \u201c\u2014I guess it makes sense now why you were so...\u201d Friendly? Eager? Was that it? What was it with him? Did he enjoy the company of messed-up young girls? Perhaps it was a complex of his: Knight Syndrome. I felt like such an idiot. I turned and marched off to vent my anger away from anyone that could get hurt.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, just leave me alone. Don\u2019t follow me!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t look back; I didn\u2019t want to know if he followed or if he turned and went back home. As far as I was concerned, hiding a secret from someone, hiding that you were playing a game with them\u2014that you were probing to get info out of them\u2014was a friendship-ending offense. If I never saw him again, that would even be too soon.</p><p>The forest showed me down an alternative path to the one we came in on. Billowing grass grew up between old tire tracks, and I followed them, hoping they\u2019d lead me into town. But my trek of rage drove me forward quickly, submerging me into an eerie surrounding, with the trail fading to thick shrubs, and at the end of it, only ugly, tangled trees and thorn-laced vines. I stopped walking. The once background sound of birds singing and leaves rustling in the wind was now unnervingly loud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Real smart, Ara. Go off the beaten track.</p><p>I wandered over and slumped heavily onto a nearby log, hugging my arms across my body. I wasn\u2019t sure what to be worried about out here; back home I knew there could be kangaroos around, but also knew they very rarely attacked. Here, there could be any manner of man-eating creature, and that\u2019s without even thinking about the foxes. I really hoped they could read David\u2019s signs on the border.</p><p>I checked my phone; no service, and it was getting late. The gentle breeze stopped then and a cunning silence looped around me, stealing the tranquillity of the woods. Even the midges dancing in beams of light disappeared with the warmth, leaving a cold kind of concern creeping under my skin.</p> <p>I kicked a ladybug off my shoe and looked back up the slope I just walked down. There was no denying it. I was stupid to walk off like that. And I shouldn\u2019t have yelled at David.</p><p>I took a really long breath, lifting my shoulders all the way up, and let it out slowly, then stood up, dumping my phone in the pocket of my dress. Maybe he was waiting for me back by the lake\u2014maybe it wasn\u2019t too late to apologise.</p><p>I steeled myself for a round of grovelling, but after only one step back up the hill, crashed right into the warm embrace of strong, firm arms. \u201cAra!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou silly girl!\u201d He wrapped me up almost restrictively, his fingertips pressing against my ribs. \u201cDon\u2019t ever run off like that again. I couldn\u2019t find you. I was worried sick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered into his chest.</p><p>\u201cAra? You. Have. Nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head against the top of mine. \u201cI won\u2019t let you say that word anymore; not for anything.\u201d</p><p>I tugged a little to make him loosen his grip, then looked up at him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me you knew about my mom?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, breathing out through his nose. \u201cWould you have wanted me to know? Would you still have been my friend?\u201d It was a rhetorical question; we both knew the answer.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what am I to you now? I mean, why would you still be friends with me now that you know all of this? Am I some damsel project to you or something? Do you think you can save me?\u201d</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cNo, Ara. It was never about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, what do you want from me; if my dad hasn\u2019t sent you in as his informant, then what do you want with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInformant?\u201d He looked down at me. \u201cIs that what you thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense. From the first moment we met, you acted like we knew each other\u2014like we were already friends. I just...I wondered why you were so interested, when, you know, I\u2019m no super model. I don\u2019t really have anything to offer you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have more than you think, Ara.\u201d He exhaled, rocking his jaw. \u201cOkay, at the risk of sounding creepy, I\u2019m going to tell you why I was so...overeager when you first came to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreepy? You weren\u2019t stalking me, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! No, I wasn\u2019t. But I had seen you several times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time was about a month ago\u2014guess it was the day you arrived. I was on the football field doing laps for practice and I passed your house\u2014saw this sweet little thing in a yellow dress, just standing there looking up at the blue sky. And I stopped running.\u201d</p><p>I pictured it for a second; David on the field, me by the car, watching Dad get the suitcases from the trunk, and Vicki standing on the porch steps, covering her mouth, trying not to cry, and so badly, I knew, wanting to run out and hug me. But she didn\u2019t. And I was glad for that, because I\u2019d have pushed her away.</p><p>\u201cMy first thought was how unusual it was to see a girl in a dress like that. And I just thought you looked so pretty, so innocent and...when I looked a bit closer, I realised that you looked sad. And something in me felt tight.\u201d He touched his chest, rubbing it. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really felt that before.\u201d He laughed a little; I smiled. \u201cI just wanted to make you okay. And I hoped I\u2019d get a chance to meet you. I knew that was Mr Thompson\u2019s house, so I figured you were his daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you asked him about me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his lips spreading wide over his teeth. \u201cUh, no. I didn\u2019t have the guts. I uh\u2014I actually set it up. I guess I set him up to have to tell me about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was running football practice one afternoon, and you were out in the backyard. I asked your dad if that girl on the swing at his house was related to him. And he told me you were his daughter. And I told him you were beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck up.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI waited so long for you to come to school, Ara. When you finally did, and I finally saw you up close, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d he touched his chest, grinning, \u201c\u2014but, I actually couldn\u2019t believe how beautiful you were and I\u2014\u201d He stopped, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI instantly fell in love with you.\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped beating, slipping through each of my internal organs until it hit my feet.</p><p>David laughed lightly, tucking my hair behind my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, you know. We\u2019ll get through this. Together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled into his chest, wrapping my arms all the way around him. \u201cI like the way that sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he said, and in his arms I stood, with my eyes closed and the tranquillity of love keeping my heart beating, while each breath I took unlinked my soul from the binds of my shadowed past. I never wanted to go back to before. I wanted this embrace to last forever\u2014to stay here in his arms where all of my troubles didn\u2019t seem so absolute and the world didn\u2019t seem so cruel. There was something about the way he held me that made me feel safe\u2014made me realise, as wholly as I knew myself, that the empty feeling I\u2019d suffered so long could only have been cured by this moment\u2014by David, who came into my life as just a boy, and turned out to be a knight.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>David closed the front door and we both looked up the dark staircase to the sound of a piano.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d I said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a piano.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d</p><p>His smile softened. \u201cSomething tells me you might need a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Dad called down from his room. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. I just came back to get changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in here first, please.\u201d</p><p>I looked at David, who took a step back, offering the stairway. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>Each step I took felt like my last; I was sure Dad had a massive lecture waiting behind his bedroom door on why we don\u2019t sneak out of school with strange boys, but as I pushed his door open and saw him sitting on the end of his bed, my heart felt heavy. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>He turned his face from the cradle of his hands. \u201cCome in. Close the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Vicki and Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily pizza night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Sorry.\u201d I stopped. \u201cI forgot about pizza night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, honey.\u201d He patted the bed; I sat down next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go, Dad?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look that suggested the obvious. \u201cMy daughter ran away from school today\u2014crying. I wanted to be here when you got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, Dad.\u201d I twiddled my thumbs.</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose, you don\u2019t need to be sorry.\u201d He rubbed my back. \u201cI\u2019m just glad someone was there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Dad\u2019s soft smile infected my heart, making me grin, too. \u201cDavid kind of forced a deep and meaningful confession out of me.\u201d</p><p>Dad laughed. \u201cSo, you told him\u2014about why you came to live here?\u201d</p><p>No, you did. \u201cYeah. We\u2019re\u2014he\u2019s helping me through it.\u201d</p><p>Dad sighed massively and wrapped his arm all the way around my shoulder, pulling me into him for a bear-tight hug. \u201cI\u2019m so relived to hear that. And you\u2019re all going out to Betty\u2019s tonight, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIf that\u2019s...is it still okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is, honey.\u201d He pressed a big sloppy Dad kiss on my brow. \u201cMore than okay. I\u2019ll even give you a later curfew. How\u2019s that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven sound fair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I hugged him, wrapping my skinny arms all the way around his neck. \u201cThank you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust happy to make you happy.\u201d He rubbed my back, and as I pulled away, sitting beside him again, my butt landed on the remote, starting up the film he\u2019d been watching. I went to apologise, but my eyes strayed from his smile to the TV set, stopping on the tiny dancer, gracefully billowing across the screen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey.\u201d Dad grabbed the remote and went to turn it off; I placed my hand over his.</p><p>\u201cWait. I want to see.\u201d</p><p>He lowered the remote and I rose to my feet, walking slowly over to watch the only piece of my mother I had left.</p><p>\u201cDid she ever tell you about this concert?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIt was the year before she quit ballet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore she had me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stood beside me. \u201cIt was Swan Lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smiled, watching my mother dance. \u201cI did this one last year for our ballet recital.\u201d</p><p>His arm wrapped my shoulders. \u201cI remember. You were such a beautiful dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I inherited that from Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked at the screen. \u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at his watering eyes. \u201cYou miss her, too?\u201d</p><p>He pressed stop on the remote and the screen went black. \u201cI always will.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence passed between us. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m just sorry\u2014about everything.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me, his eyes narrowing tightly on the inner corners. \u201cYou know, honey, if there\u2019s something you need to tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d I hugged him softly, squeezing once before backing up. \u201cI do know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d His concerned smile dropped for the warm one I always loved. \u201cWell, you go on now and have a good night. Promise?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah. I promise.\u201d</p><p>As I closed his door, the gentle hum of piano followed me out into the hall again.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Ara?\u201d David called from downstairs.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d I called back. \u201cJust gotta throw on some jeans. Won\u2019t be long.\u201d I slipped into the cleanest-smelling pair of jeans I could find on my floor and grabbed the blue zip-up sweater from my dresser, then scrunched my hair up a few times and grabbed my purse as I stumbled out the door.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be needing this.\u201d David took my purse, appearing out of nowhere, and ditched it back into my room. I heard it hit my bed with a dull, leather-sounding thud.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t I need that? Don\u2019t they sell food there? I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, unamused. \u201cYou know I won\u2019t let you pay for your own food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is my money dirty?\u201d I followed him down the stairs, my careless feet thumping loudly behind his barely audible footfalls.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He opened the front door. \u201cBut when a guy takes a girl on a date, he should pay. It\u2019s the way I was raised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I sauntered past him; he closed the front door behind us, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you object to me treating you as a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do.\u201d</p><p>Despite that, he still opened the car door for me. \u201cWhy do girls always do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpill that equal rights nonsense\u2014argue that we\u2019re taking their independence by opening a door for them. That\u2019s just not the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what is the case?\u201d I sat down on the front seat, leaving my feet on the driveway.</p><p>\u201cSimply that we\u2019re demonstrating good breeding; showing the girl we\u2019re worthy and capable of taking care of her\u2014that we\u2019re polite, considerate, nurturing.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms. \u201cWomen don\u2019t need nurturing\u2014or to be taken care of. We can fend for ourselves. We\u2019re equal to men, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He stared down at me, the skin under his eyes tight. \u201cI\u2019m not disregarding equality by being a gentleman; I\u2019m exercising chivalry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s outdated, though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I challenged, with a grin.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said in a high tone. \u201cWhy should courtesy be outdated\u2014or offensive? Is it not polite to offer a pregnant woman your seat on a bus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, if you want equal rights for all, it would only be polite for me to also offer this to a woman who is not pregnant. Or to the man playing Angry Birds on his iPhone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is getting off topic.\u201d I swung my legs into the car. \u201cThe point is\u2014\u201d Argh! What was my point? ...Oh yeah. \u201cThe point is that I should be able to pay for my own food if I want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you can, but not when you come out with me. I have rights, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...I\u2019m taking away your rights by buying my own food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat a load of rubbish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of it like this; some girls believe exerting independence by denying a man his own rights to be respectful demonstrates strength. But women are incredibly strong. We already know this. So, unfortunately, by labelling chivalry to be insolent, she is merely robbing the next generation of civility\u2014ensuring the extinction of well-mannered men. It\u2019s my right and duty to preserve the tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all women consider it good manners when a guy forces her to accept a free lunch.\u201d I tightened the fold of my arms.</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d He looked down at me with one brow arched. \u201cYet, if I neglected to wrap my jacket over your shoulders on a cold evening I\u2019d be regarded as a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a gentleman, Ara. Get used to it.\u201d He closed the door on my retort and appeared suddenly in the seat next to me.</p><p>\u201cHow do you move so quick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. You just faze out all the time.\u201d</p><p>David pulled into an angled space outside the buzzing corner caf\u00e9 and shut the engine off. \u201cWelcome to the best burger joint in town.\u201d</p><p>Beyond the flashing pink and blue signs on the windows, the generation gap seemed to be left behind; kids sat on chrome-rimmed stools by the milk-bar, singing Elvis songs loud enough to hear from here, while others gathered around the white billiard tables on the lower level. Even the staff, in their flaring poodle skirts and sneakers, seemed to have jumped right off the Grease film set. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>As I looked back at him, he smiled softly, comfortably, as if he\u2019d not taken his eyes off me the whole time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the whole independence thing. I think it\u2019s really sweet that you\u2019re a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, taking my hand delicately. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I can see right through your girl power act, young lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really.\u201d I leaned back in the chair, my eyes employing a defiant glare. \u201cAnd what exactly do you see, Mr Know-It-All?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see...\u201d He leaned forward, luring me into his private little world. \u201cI see a young girl who just wants to be loved by a man worthy of her.\u201d</p><p>Several retorts came to mind, none of them sassy and creative like I wished. I went with \u201cAw, how romantic,\u201d squeezing my fists tightly to stop from launching myself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cCome. Let\u2019s get some food.\u201d He turned slowly and hopped out, closing the door quietly behind him, then appeared by my door, offering his hand.</p> <p>As my fingers touched his, blood rushed up with a quick skip of my heart, and I drew my hand back. \u201cWow, you are really cold tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d He looked at his hand, rubbing his thumb over his fingertips. \u201cThey get cold when I drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine get cold when I do homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should avoid it then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I like cold hands,\u201d I said, walking beside him, and when he smiled down at me, I caught sight of his fangs.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking.\u201d I braved rejection and reached for his hand again; he let me take it. \u201cWith those pointy canines and cold hands\u2014you could pass as a vampire.\u201d</p><p>His sudden boisterous laughter made me smile. \u201cBetter watch out then; we are on a dinner date, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d I said. \u201cGuess I better order garlic then\u2014or maybe a steak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA steak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know...?\u201d I prompted, stabbing my heart with an invisible stick. \u201cAs in...a stake?\u201d</p><p>David shook his head, but a warm smile sparkled in his eyes as he opened the caf\u00e9 door and the nineteen-fifties time warp enveloped us.</p><p>\u201cI would guess, by the look on your face, that you like it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great. Crowded, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you taste the food you\u2019ll see why.\u201d</p><p>My stomach groaned.</p><p>\u201cAh, I see the very mention of sustenance has awakened the ogre.\u201d David grinned at my belly.</p><p>\u201cStop laughing,\u201d I said, covering it.</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, you know.\u201d I looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m tougher than I look.\u201d</p><p>He pinched my bony wrist between two fingers and held it up. \u201cYeah. So much muscle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I laughed, punching him softly in the arm.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d He rubbed it. \u201cThat really hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smirked, offering a seat nearby. \u201cI was just trying to be nice.\u201d</p><p>I slid into the booth, shaking my head, and David shuffled in beside me, coming closer each time I moved over to give him more space. It wasn\u2019t until my shoulder and arm pressed against the cold glass that I realised it wasn\u2019t more space he wanted, but less between us. I looked into my lap, smiling to myself. \u201cHave you...\u201d I cleared the nerves from my throat. \u201cHave you seen the others yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the pool table.\u201d He tilted his head in their direction, without taking his eyes off me.</p><p>\u201cHm. Didn\u2019t even see them when we walked in.\u201d I leaned around him and watched Emily and Alana\u2014covering their mouths, giggling at Ryan. \u201cAre they checking out his butt every time he takes a shot?\u201d</p><p>David nodded, smiling.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should go say hello?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019ll come over when they finish. For now\u2014\u201d he shrugged, \u201c\u2014I kinda like this.\u201d</p><p>So did I. In fact, I kinda hoped they didn\u2019t notice us at all.</p><p>The corner of David\u2019s mouth twitched, breaking his face into a grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why are you smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d he said.</p><p>I turned my face away, feeling heat rise up in my cheeks. Sometimes it felt like he knew exactly what I was thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d He cupped my chin, turning my head.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turn your face away when you blush,\u201d he said delicately. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>My breath fluttered as our eyes locked together for an awkward moment. Well, awkward for me\u2014he seemed perfectly at ease. \u201cYou know, you have an irritating quirk, yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat!\u201d I pointed to that smile\u2014the one evident only by the two dimples above the corners of his lips, while his gaze drifted downward. \u201cIt\u2019s like you...I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like you have a secret or a joke, and it\u2019s a good one, but you don\u2019t want to share it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He nodded, hiding the smallest hint of humour. \u201cI guess I do, maybe do that\u2014a lot.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very observant, Ara-Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what is it? Why do you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just spend too much time in my own head, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, except...it gets pretty boring up here, so I find ways to amuse myself.\u201d The bright smile dropped instantly and his lost words hung in the air as I folded my arms and stole his smile for my own.</p><p>\u201cSo, am I boring you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you two.\u201d Emily bounced up beside the table.</p><p>\u201cHey, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck it out.\u201d She inclined her head to one side in a quick movement, hinting with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you guys,\u201d I beamed, seeing the joined hands of Alana and Ryan. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Ryan swept his fingers through his hair. \u201cI kinda got the hard word put on me.\u201d</p><p>Alana raised her eyebrows in Emily\u2019s direction.</p><p>Emily shrugged. \u201cYou weren\u2019t there to talk with me about David this afternoon, so I had to find something to do.\u201d</p><p>David looked sideways at me, his radiant smile gleaming. \u201cYou talk about me?\u201d</p><p>I blinked a few extra times, feeling pretty sheepish, and chose to ignore him. \u201cWell, that\u2019s really cool, guys. I\u2019m glad you finally got together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ryan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m pretty happy about it.\u201d</p><p>They slid into the seat opposite us, while Emily slid in beside David, leaving a less than reasonable gap. I all but got my ruler out and measured it to the last millimetre.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you guys?\u201d a waitress said, popping up out of nowhere, pulling a pen from her ponytail.</p><p>David handed me the menu; I placed it back down, shaking my head. As the others rattled off their orders, he leaned in and whispered against my ear, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why aren\u2019t you ordering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I said enthusiastically, logging the cool, minty scent of his breath in my memory. \u201cI just don\u2019t need the menu.\u201d I looked at the waitress as a tray of burgers and fries passed her head. \u201cI\u2019ll have that, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She turned around, then smiled when she looked back. \u201cOkay, Betty Burger, fries and shake?\u201d She wrote it down and looked at David.</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019ll just be a moment.\u201d She skipped off.</p><p>David stared at me. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of food. Can you really eat all that?\u201d</p><p>Evidence that he didn\u2019t know me very well at all. \u201cI think we should have a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always up for that,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cCool. It\u2019s a who can eat the most challenge?\u201d</p><p>Emily shook her head. \u201cEw, no, sorry. Count me out. I\u2019m on a diet.\u201d</p><p>My eyes bulged. \u201cA diet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, no, not like that.\u201d She waved her hands around. \u201cIt\u2019s just a healthy eating thing\u2014to stay fit. I\u2019m on top of the pyramid. If I weigh too much, someone could get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Alana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Count me out, too. I have a really small stomach. I\u2019ll probably lose on the first fry.\u201d</p><p>Ryan grinned wildly. \u201cCount me in, sister.\u201d He shook my hand, then we both looked at David, who leaned back in his chair, linking his fingers behind his head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can eat a lot. I could probably eat you and not think twice about it.\u201d He leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table, titling his shoulders closer to me. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re up for that kind of a challenge, little girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on,\u201d I said, and as I went to shake his hand, a jolt of static shot through us, making me yelp. \u201cOw. I hate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d David touched the sleeve of his thin black sweater. \u201cI\u2019m wearing wool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWool?\u201d I exclaimed with a certain amount of accusation in my tone. \u201cHow do you even know that\u2019s wool? You\u2019re a guy!\u201d</p><p>He leaned on his hand, resting his knuckles just beside his smile. \u201cA guy who knows what wool feels like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think you know too much for your age, David Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I come from a wealthy family.\u201d He distracted himself, swapping the salt label with the sugar one. \u201cGrooming and Deportment were lessons of great significance during my upbringing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrooming and what?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>\u201cEtiquette classes,\u201d I informed, leaning around David to look at her. \u201cI had to do them in modelling school when I was ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sat back, staring ahead thoughtfully. \u201cHm, that makes sense on so many levels.\u201d</p><p>Yup, I thought so too. Being raised like an English Lord explained why he was so charming and charismatic and...otherworldly.</p><p>When we finished dinner, David and Ryan discussed, rather heatedly, their opinions on the best guitar brands while I lost myself to thought, sliding my finger over the condensation on my milkshake glass. The waitress took our plates and left the bill, which David snaffled quickly, opening his leather wallet. \u201cI\u2019ll get this one, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, man?\u201d Ryan offered a fifty.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hundred percent.\u201d David nodded, laying the cash out with a rather large tip to accompany.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI\u2019ll get the next one.\u201d</p><p>David nodded, leaning forward to stuff his wallet in his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Emily leaned around David to look at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not human, are you? How do you eat so much?\u201d</p><p>I patted my belly. \u201cI like my stomach to be full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s good to see a girl eating,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cDon\u2019t you, Dave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He looked at me with soft eyes, then linked his fingers through mine under the table. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be one of those guys who\u2019s gotta convince his girlfriend to eat. Huh! She\u2019ll probably eat mine t\u2014\u201d he stopped mid-sentence.</p><p>Everyone at the table stared at him, including me.</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend?\u201d Emily said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s official?\u201d</p><p>David just sat incredibly still, barely breathing, and certainly not speaking, so I squeezed his hand and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d David said smoothly, turning slightly to look at Emily. \u201cIt\u2019s official.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s really awesome, man. Congrats.\u201d Ryan reached out and they shook hands, bumping knuckles after.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Emily practically squealed. \u201cI just knew she\u2019d be your type, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have a type, Emily,\u201d he said, and wrapped his arm around me. \u201cBut Ara\u2019s pretty much everything I ever wanted in a girl.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone made a cheering-yet-that\u2019s-totally-lame noise at David\u2019s mushy statement, but my whole body flooded with warmth, making me feel almost dizzy.</p><p>\u201cWay to make me look bad, man,\u201d Ryan said, laughing once. \u201cIf I even tried to say something like that I\u2019d be accused of reading poetry from the Lame Book of Things Guys Shouldn\u2019t Say.\u201d</p><p>We all laughed, and David pulled me closer until my head rested between his jaw and shoulder, our thighs touching, the warmth from under his arm making the sharp, sweet smell of his cologne so much stronger; a spicy scent, like Brut, not the orangey-chocolate one he usually wore.</p><p>\u201cGuess that just leaves me now,\u201d Emily said, leaning on her hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re not with Spencer soon, maybe you should meet my best friend\u2014he\u2019s coming to visit in a few weeks.\u201d I leaned around David to look at her.</p> <p>\u201cIs he from Australia?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I put my drink down on the table. \u201cAnd he\u2019s really cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute, is he?\u201d David raised one brow.</p><p>\u201cActually, yes. He is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d Emily leaned further around, forcing David to sit back a little.</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you come have a sleepover at mine next Saturday and I\u2019ll show you some pics.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah? I\u2019d actually really like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Alana, you wanna come, too?\u201d I asked, allowing myself to feel the excitement of a normal teenager for a moment.</p><p>She looked at Ryan and smiled, shrinking into herself a little more. \u201cUm, yeah, if Emily doesn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind? Of course you should come. Hey, I\u2019ll bring a movie, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019ll get a pizza,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cBetter make that two,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cOtherwise the girls\u2019ll go hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring the popcorn,\u201d Alana said, shyly.</p> <p>\u201cGreat. It\u2019s settled then.\u201d And I was actually excited. Mike would be, too, when I told him. In fact, this had been a great day. The best ever. In a way, I was kinda glad my dad so cruelly forced me back to school this week, because I had new friends now and my horrible past was no longer a burden I solely owned. But best of all, David liked me enough to want me as his girlfriend. In fact...love. Love is what he\u2019d said.</p><p>I looked sideways at David, flouncing his hand around in the air as he explained the size of the pizza he ate last night. He didn\u2019t know it yet, and I wasn\u2019t ready to tell him, but I loved him, too. Not in the way he loved me\u2014like the way you love your guitar or your best friend\u2014but real love. The kind of love you hold for someone you want to marry one day.</p><p>The phone rang twice. I waited impatiently, tapping my fingers on the desk.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you doin\u2019?\u201d I asked, hearing a strange static kind of sound.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s playing a death-match, online, with me,\u201d another voice said very clearly into the receiver.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, Josh.\u201d I laughed, wincing. Lucky I didn\u2019t just blurt out my news the second Mike picked up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara. How\u2019s things, what you been up to?\u201d Josh asked, half distracted.</p><p>\u201cWell, actually. A lot. That\u2019s why I called,\u201d I said in an eager, soprano voice.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI\u2019ll just de-link the phone line from the headsets.\u201d I heard a noise, like someone tapping a fingertip on the lid of an empty tin, and a bleep followed, making the slight static in the phone line recede, leaving a clear, quiet hum. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m alone now. How you doin\u2019, kid?\u201d Mike\u2019s deep, sexy voice made my blood warmer.</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, I\u2019ve been waiting up all night for you to get home so I could call you. I\u2019ve got good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>I paused for dramatic effect. \u201cI\u2019m having a sleepover next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he dragged the word out.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great. Are you gonna talk to the girls about what happened\u2014with your mum?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, watching my reflection in the window. \u201cNope. Don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready talked to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asked. \u201cWas it your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? The guy you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come on, fill me in, then?\u201d His voice glided in that husky smoothness that could only be Mike\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWell, it turns out he already knew.\u201d I sighed, rubbing my forehead. \u201cHe spoke to my dad before he even met me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s cool. And he still made friends with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said in a flat tone. \u201cI know, I know\u2014you told me it\u2019d be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him about...you know, the other part of it\u2014your inner guilt?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he still wants to be your friend?\u201d he asked, unperturbed.</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling. We made our relationship official tonight,\u201d I beamed.</p><p>Mike went quiet. \u201cAra, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, no, not like that, Mike.\u201d I laughed, waving my hands about.</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cSo, like what, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in he said the word girlfriend.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but grin.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s really cool. I\u2019m glad there\u2019s someone lookin\u2019 out for ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could make even half an effort to sound happy for me, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy for you, baby. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still my bestie, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m not there, Ara. And I\u2019m worried. I know you too well, and I know that tone. You\u2019re pretty serious about this guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I grinned, glad he couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you gotta be careful. Grief can magnify emotions. You know that. What you\u2019re feeling, it may just be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it, okay?\u201d I said, holding the phone away from my ear in case he did. \u201cI don\u2019t need you telling me what to feel.\u201d</p><p>He just sighed heavily. \u201cOkay. Fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I sat quiet for a second, considering just hanging up. \u201cHey, guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a girl I want you to meet when you come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, don\u2019t play matchmaker. I\u2019m coming to see you, not go on dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s blonde. And cute,\u201d I offered, my voice rising in question. \u201cShe\u2019s the one I\u2019m having over next weekend for a sleepover. I\u2019m gonna show her some pictures of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d his voice dragged, \u201c\u2014I do like blondes, but not dumb ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s definitely not stupid. But don\u2019t get ahead of yourself, Romeo. She might not even like you. You\u2019re not that good looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019m a hunk.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d pay that. But it takes more than just good looks to get the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how \u2018bout my charming personality and witty sense of humour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorked on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I take it back. I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Anyway. You don\u2019t need to worry about me now, okay. I\u2019m doing well. I\u2019m still not fine. But I\u2019m okay. Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, kid. You could use a bit of okay. But\u2014\u201d a long, stretching groan sounded down the phone line; I pictured him rolling his spine, straightening his arms behind his head, \u201c\u2014I\u2019ll be there soon, and then you\u2019ll be all better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d</p><p>He laughed for a second, then became all stern; \u201cBut, seriously, Ara? Please don\u2019t set me up with this friend of yours. I\u2019m in a difficult place right now with matters of the heart. I\u2019d rather not drag anyone else into that. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d But I knew he\u2019d change his mind when he saw her.</p><p>The fresh scent of Mr Warner\u2019s cut grass next door mixed with the lemony fragrance of Vicki\u2019s bathroom cleaner, and the sound of the vacuum cleaner down the hall sent a warm pang of calm through me. I smoothed my hands over the unruffled bedcovers on top of me, remembering my irrational but normal dreams. I wondered how today could seem so perfectly sunny and bright when yesterday, despite the weather being the same, my whole life had felt grey and stormy.</p><p>With a hint of a skip in my step, I leaped out of bed and stood right in front of my open window, drawing a breath of the fresh, cool morning air. It wasn\u2019t even nine o\u2019clock yet, but I wanted nothing more than to be up and a part of the day.</p><p>When my crappy old phone bleeped, I dove onto my bed and opened my messages; Can I come see you today? It\u2019s David, by the way.</p><p>An invisible paintbrush swerved across my lips, bringing them up on both corners. I texted back: Are you kidding? Of course you can.</p><p>Didn\u2019t want to seem overeager.</p><p>Be there in five, he texted back.</p><p>My eyes went wider, taking in my ultra messy room. I scooped my clothes off my floor in one big pile and threw them in the laundry basket, then shook my quilt over my bed and sprayed deodorant all around my room, waving a hand through the scented cloud to rid the stench of depression from within the walls.</p><p>\u201cVicki?\u201d I called, grabbing my doorframe to lean out into the hall.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a friend coming over, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I heard the vacuum cleaner start up again, relieved she didn\u2019t ask if it was a boy friend or a girl friend. I wasn\u2019t ready to tell her I had a boyfriend yet.</p><p>I shut my bedroom door to get changed, but as I lifted my shirt, heard a high-pitched yowling echo in the street below. Hanging from the old oak tree in the backyard, a fat grey body swung from side to side, flailing around in an attempt to free its paw from a branch.</p><p>\u201cStupid cat.\u201d I laughed, pulling my top back on as I burst through my door.</p><p>\u201cHey, princess.\u201d Dad passed me on the stairs. \u201cWhere\u2019re you running off to in such a hurry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicki\u2019s dumb cat\u2019s got itself stuck in the tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra to the rescue, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d I passed through the forbidden formal room, pushed the back door open and leaped off the porch, landing on the dewy grass. But instead of climbing up a tree, stopped dead at the sight of every sunrise that ever brought day, standing in my backyard, holding a very sorry-looking grey fluffball.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, tucking Skittles\u2019 lashing tail into the hold as we met under the tree.</p><p>\u201cOh, my knight in shining armour. You saved my baby.\u201d I took the cat from him, then squeezed the tip of its paw to inspect the claws.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a little embarrassed, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be.\u201d I cradled the cat close to my face; he was still growling in the back of his throat, not at all amused to be held like a baby. \u201cSilly kitty.\u201d</p><p>David smiled fondly at me.</p><p>When I released my hold on the cat, he bolted over the hedge fence\u2014into the front yard.</p><p>\u201cHow did you sleep last night?\u201d David asked, running a finger down my arm.</p><p>\u201cLaying down,\u201d I said, and David laughed. \u201cNo, in all seriousness, I actually did sleep. No joke. And I had normal dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen my work here is done.\u201d He took a step away, then turned back, wedging his hands in his pockets. \u201cKidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny.\u201d I slapped his chest, noting that small indent between his pecs. I just wanted to keep my hand there, against his plain white T-shirt.</p><p>He grabbed it as I pulled away, and brushed his lips across my knuckles. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid to touch me, Ara.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my heart. Will it ever beat again? I smiled and slowly reached up to his face; it felt silky, warm under my fingertips, with just a tiny hint of regrowth breaking the skin around his chin and upper lip. \u201cIt looks good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Clean-shaven. I like it.\u201d</p><p>He gave a short, breathy laugh, and placed his hands on my hipbones. \u201cSo, how are you feeling today? After everything we talked about yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really good. I mean, I still hurt inside, all the time, and I never stop thinking about them, but\u2014\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt will get easier.\u201d David ducked his head a little so our eyes met in perfect alignment. \u201cYou will always think about them, but I can promise you that missing them will get easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know so much about this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve suffered a lot of loss in my life.\u201d He nodded smoothly and looked away. \u201cBut, I find more people to love and make my life about them.\u201d</p><p>As our eyes met again, his warmed with a soft, simple smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019d told me that a week ago, I might not\u2019ve believed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do today?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, resting both hands flat on the front of his chest, my elbows touching his ribs. I needed to stand on my toes a little to feel like he could hear me talk without my having to yell, but that only made my lips come up to his chin; not close enough to lean forward and steal a kiss. \u201cI\u2019m glad my dad told you, David\u2014about my mom. I think I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not going to yell at him. I mean, he was just doing what he thought was best for me, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t really mean to tell me, Ara. That wasn\u2019t his intention. I lead him into it.\u201d</p><p>My smile twisted up with a frown and I shook my head. \u201cIs that why he gave you the touch-my-daughter-and-you-die speech?\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s eyes narrowed a little as he cleared his throat. \u201cHe never gave me that speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, in History class, he\u2014you said he\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head once, a suppressed grin creeping up into his eyes. \u201cI lied.\u201d</p> <p>I dropped my arms to my sides. \u201cI told my dad off, you know, for giving you that speech? And worse, he played along. How could you two just conspire against me like that?\u201d</p><p>David laughed aloud, tilting his head back so his canines showed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He shook his head, failing to subdue his amusement. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t laugh. But you\u2019re just so funny when you get on a heated rant. I love it when you do that.\u201d He pointed to my hands wedged firmly on my hips; I dropped them.</p><p>\u201cSo what was my dad saying that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to keep an eye on you, since I already knew why you were here, and you had apparently taken a liking to me.\u201d He combed a fingertip though my hair and swept it back behind my ear. \u201cAnd I told him I had absolutely no intention of letting you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>Hmph! \u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to know he approves of you. But how\u2019d he know I liked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about sultanas and grapes?\u201d David\u2019s dark brows pulled together.</p> <p>I laughed, thinking of Dad\u2019s weird teacher lingo. And then, so many other things suddenly seemed to fit together, like a three dimensional puzzle that I assumed was only two. \u201cSo, when you said you didn\u2019t know he was my dad, that day after History class?\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s smile slipped away. \u201cHe asked me to keep it from you that I even knew your name.\u201d</p><p>I nodded slowly. \u201cI wondered how you knew it was Ara-Rose\u2014in the library, because no one here knew that until after History class. You sneaky little thing.\u201d I pointed at him.</p><p>He reached down and took only my fingertips in his delicate grasp. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I deceived you. I meant no ill intent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the past, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not still mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m incapable of being mad at you. Well, for long anyway.\u201d I smiled, drawing my shoulder up to my ear. \u201cI\u2019m glad you talked to my dad. If you hadn\u2019t, we\u2019d never\u2019ve met, and I would\u2019ve wished every day that we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible. You\u2019re not the kind of girl I could ever just pass in the street, Ara. I would\u2019ve seen you eventually, and it would only have been a matter of time until I made myself a part of your life after that.\u201d He cupped his hand over the side of my neck. \u201cTragic past or none, we would\u2019ve ended up friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra-Rose!\u201d a high-pitched and rather cross voice called from behind. Vicki stood on the back porch, her hand on her hip, still clutching a dishcloth. \u201cGet some clothes on, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I covered my chest with my forearms. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me I was still in my pyjamas?\u201d</p><p>David grinned, looking at my tiny pink shorts and white tank top. \u201cRelax. You look adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdorable?\u201d I said, making myself smaller. \u201cI\u2019m not even wearing a bra.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and we walked toward the house. \u201cYes, I noticed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this one?\u201d David called out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s what one?\u201d I called back from my wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cThe playlist called Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Are you snooping through my iPod?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cSo, why do you have a playlist named for a guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s just all the music that makes me think of him. You know, the fun we had, that kind of thing.\u201d I shrugged and shimmied out of my bed shorts.</p><p>\u201cShould I be worried? There\u2019s no David list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I smiled to myself, glad I saved that one as Night Fantasy\u2014deliberately leaving off the K.</p><p>\u201cHm, this Night Fantasy one looks awfully suspicious.\u201d I could actually hear the grin in his tone; I wanted to throw something at him.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at that list.\u201d I pulled my dress over my head quickly.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of sad songs on here, Ara. I hope this isn\u2019t my playlist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it is?\u201d I said, stepping back out into my room.</p><p>My gorgeous boyfriend docked the iPod and a \u2018David\u2019 song came on. \u201cBecause it gives me the impression that you think I don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, maybe, after yesterday, I need to make a new list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I would say so.\u201d He turned to face me and his mouth fell open. \u201cAra, that colour is beautiful on you.\u201d He practically floated over to me. \u201cIt really brings out the pinks in your skin.\u201d</p><p>I flattened the front of my cotton dress, closing my eyes when he ran the back of his finger over my cheekbone. \u201cEmerald green,\u201d I muttered, getting lost in the way the tingle of his touch made my teeth feel numb. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my new favourite colours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of? What\u2019s your favourite, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny reason for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a happy colour. The colour of the sun.\u201d I opened my eyes. \u201cI just refuse to think everything in life has to be all dark and gloomy all the time. So, I like yellow,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat about you? What\u2019s your favourite colour?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a moment, smiling as he looked down at my mouth, then back into my eyes\u2014catching them in a breathless hold. \u201cSapphire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy sapphire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, since I met you, I\u2019ve seen nothing but magic in the world.\u201d He gently moved his cold fingers from my cheekbone to the nape of my neck. \u201cYou might say that sapphire represents the blue of a brighter horizon\u2014a life I never imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing in love?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tangled in my hair and he pulled me slightly closer. \u201cBeing in love with you. And now, every time I see this colour, my heart skips a beat; it makes me think of everything that might be possible, that never was before.\u201d</p><p>I kind of laughed. \u201cAw, I feel special now.\u201d</p><p>He laughed too. \u201cSorry. Does it bother you for me to speak my heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. But sometimes I feel like you\u2019re making this stuff up, you know, like you\u2019re just saying what I want to hear.\u201d</p><p>He held out his pinkie; \u201cI promise I speak only truth.\u201d</p><p>I linked mine over his. \u201cThen I promise to always try to believe you. But I can\u2019t promise not to giggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d he swiped his thumb down my chin, \u201c\u2014we both know how I feel about that giggle.\u201d</p><p>The warm sun heated the room around us then, and the tranquil hum of the weekend filled the air, until a loud rumbling disturbed the peace.</p><p>David looked down at my belly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet, have you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we need to feed you before the beast presents itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me too well, already.\u201d</p><p>Skittles hissed, leaping out my open window, sending my homework scattering as we entered the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to that cat, David?\u201d I asked, turning to look at him. \u201cHe hates you.\u201d</p><p>David grinned, closing the door. \u201cAre you suggesting I threw him up that tree to get your attention?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t sur\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Vicki opened my door. \u201cThis stays open.\u201d</p><p>My arms fell loosely by my sides. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>She gave me \u2018the glare\u2019, then walked away.</p><p>\u201cLooks like the cat\u2019s not the only one who doesn\u2019t trust me,\u201d David joked, smiling.</p><p>\u201cArgh.\u201d I stomped over to my desk and pressed play on my iPod. \u201cWhy does she have to treat me like a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not,\u201d he said, tossing my stuffed dog aside as he landed on my pillow. \u201cShe\u2019s treating you like a teenager who\u2019s alone in her room with a boy.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and turned the music up pretty loud\u2014loud enough to give us some privacy. \u201cWell, she needs to get used to you being around. After all, you are going to come meet me here every morning now, so you can make me one of those glorious coffees, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, opening his arm so my body could slide along next to his. \u201cYou liked that, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d he kissed my head as I snuggled into him, \u201c\u2014I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d But I kinda knew he wouldn\u2019t. I think Vicki made him feel really unwelcome.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bothered by your stepmother, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>I rolled up a bit to look at him; his green eyes smiled down at me. \u201cI was. I thought maybe she\u2019d offended you\u2014you know, sitting with us at breakfast and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a little bit.\u201d He pressed my head until I rested it back on his white T-shirt. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with a lot worse than Vicki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re pre-approved by my dad, right? So she has to accept you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does, sweetheart. Just give her time.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and we laid that way for a while then, music filling the silence, while a summer breeze swept through the window, circling my vanilla body wash with the fragrance of fresh cut grass and the sharp, spicy scent of David\u2019s cologne. It was so easy to be with David. He asked me a lot about Australia, and we sat for about half an hour comparing the differences in words from the two countries, like jam versus jelly and sweater versus jumper. He thought jumper was another word for a kangaroo or a really depressed guy standing on a rooftop.</p><p>\u201cAnd the food here is different, too, as in the portions,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy in all my life.\u201d I patted my belly. \u201cThe ogre\u2019s started raising his demands. I\u2019m gonna get fat soon.\u201d</p><p>David squeezed my hand. \u201cYou would still be beautiful, even if you were too big to touch your toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d I winced, but it made me smile. \u201cThat\u2019s the sweetest thing any guy has ever said to me. In a really strange way.\u201d</p><p>He went quiet for a second, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think you get it, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet what?\u201d I rolled onto my belly, resting my elbows against his chest. \u201cGet what, David?\u201d</p><p>With his lips pressed together, he smiled, studying my face. \u201cNever mind. So, what\u2019s your favourite genre of film?\u201d</p><p>Seriously? So we were playing the withholding game again. I deliberately slumped myself a little too heavily onto my back against his chest again. \u201cFavourite genre of film? I guess it used to be action. The nineteen-eighties kind. But, now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d David led when my silence lasted too long.</p><p>\u201cNow, I like comedies. You know, it\u2019s like\u2014\u201d I huffed through my nose, \u201c\u2014I\u2019m always so unhappy. If I can find something that makes me laugh and forget about my life for a while, that\u2019s what I like to do. So, comedies.\u201d My shoulders lifted once.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of comedies? Stand-up, action\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomantic.\u201d I smoothed my fingertips over David\u2019s ribs. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorror,\u201d he stated, cupping his hand over mine, stopping it from lifting his shirt.</p><p>\u201cReally? Why? They\u2019re so\u2014icky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me. I love a good, scary horror. I have this thing for blood; can\u2019t get enough of it.\u201d</p><p>Well, I never assumed that one. I just couldn\u2019t believe my ears. Sweet, kind David? Liked blood? It just didn\u2019t fit. I rolled onto my belly again to study his face. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He just smiled and placed his hand under my shoulder blade, making me feel so grounded and so real with the weight of his touch. What was it about him that could come across as so harmless, when all I\u2019d heard were stories about his bullying antics, and now he was telling me he liked horror?</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGore, horror. All that stuff. I can\u2019t picture you watching things like that.\u201d</p><p>He just laughed. \u201cGuess we won\u2019t be having many movie nights then\u2014since we have such different tastes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no way, we so will. You\u2019ll just have to watch chick flicks.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cI look forward to it. Of course, I would like to watch a horror with you\u2014\u201d He motioned to my hand on his chest, \u201c\u2014if it meant you\u2019d snuggle into me to feel safe.\u201d</p><p>I rested my cheek on his shirt again. \u201cWe can do that without the horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about books? Can you read books with horror?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I like some Stephen King stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you ever read anything by Anne Rice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I got swept up in the vampire craze. Basically, any books or movies about fangs, and I was there.\u201d I nodded. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Even I fell victim to vampire pop culture.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed aloud. \u201cYeah, but, personally, I prefer animal-eating vamps. Killing people is just\u2014\u201d I rubbed pretend goose-bumps off my arms. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t appeal to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you met a vampire who was nice, like me, but killed people? Would you still like him?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI know there\u2019re girls who would. But, I guess, after seeing death firsthand\u2014how it affects people, I\u2019m not sure now.\u201d</p> <p>He went ultimately quiet and still; I think he even stopped breathing.</p><p>I propped my head up again and his stunned stare at my face drew a smirk to my lips. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAspirations,\u201d he said suddenly, the stare washing away to a smile. \u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, knowing full well that his liquid eyes were hiding some deeper thought, but he wouldn\u2019t share it. \u201cUm, I always wanted to be a teacher\u2014like my dad. But now I think I kind of want to be a musician\u2014write my own songs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that would be perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d I rolled onto my back and took his hand again. \u201cI\u2019d like to be famous one day\u2014maybe as a pianist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d need to get a piano first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, trust me, I know. I\u2019ve been begging Dad for one since I was four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he bought one for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to be a teacher. Better income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you were to make it famous.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cGuess he\u2019s seen Hollywood dreams go sour too many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not just big dreams with you, Ara. You\u2019re very talented\u2014\u201d he laughed on those two words. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever be happy teaching.\u201d</p><p>I felt warm then. \u201cIt amazes me how well you know me.\u201d</p> <p>He frayed his fingers gently through mine. \u201cYou know, I wanted to be in a rock band once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWent in another direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat direction?\u201d</p><p>He did that pause thing he was becoming famous for; I assumed he was weighing up all the different answers he could give against the ones he would give to keep me out of his world. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that now. Might say I\u2019m at a crossroads.\u201d</p><p>And that answer, believe it or not, let me into his world more than if he\u2019d said Law or something like that. I smiled. \u201cWhat direction do you want to take? I mean, what options are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it; I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMy uncle, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would the question be?\u201d I probed.</p><p>His fingers tightened on mine. \u201cWhen I know the answer to that question, I\u2019ll ask it.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cIs it that you don\u2019t want to tell me, or that you genuinely don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have secrets.\u201d His body became a firm board under me.</p><p>\u201cI like secrets,\u201d I said, and the board turned to sponge.</p><p>\u201cWhat if they\u2019re dark secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kinds of dark secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad ones.\u201d</p><p>I really thought about that for a second\u2014about the fear I had that he\u2019d hate me when he learned my dark secrets. But I never imagined he\u2019d have some\u2014that there might be reasons I could hate him. \u201cThen don\u2019t tell me just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen should I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t have much time\u2014what if I had to tell you soon?\u201d</p><p>That rubber mallet of destruction came at my soul again; I felt it getting closer. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favourite sport?\u201d</p><p>David didn\u2019t answer for a few breaths. \u201cHockey. You?\u201d</p><p>The mallet missed completely, falling through the blankets under me. \u201cI like dancing, but as for actual sports, I was never interested. It was a taboo subject in my house\u2014much to Mike\u2019s disgust.\u201d</p><p>David cleared his throat, crossing his ankles over where they dangled off the end of my bed. \u201cSo he really did spend a lot of time there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Every day. He was a permanent fixture\u2014just another piece of furniture. His mom and my mom were really close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Mike were, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We were. I mean, we are, but we\u2019re just so far apart right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think things will be the same as before when he comes to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. He\u2019s always been a constant thing in my life. It\u2019s been really hard without him.\u201d I crossed my hands under my head, losing myself to thought for a second before a smile expanded my lips. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of like a favourite pillow, you know, you can cry into it, it keeps you warm and comfy, and it\u2019s always there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t sleep with it?\u201d He tried to make it sound like a joke, but I knew he was also really curious. Everyone was.</p><p>\u201cNo, David. It\u2019s not that kind of pillow,\u201d I said slowly, then added, \u201cIt\u2019s a couch pillow. Mike\u2019s just a couch pillow. But this one\u2014\u201d I rolled over and traced circles over his chest; he tensed, his hand ready, near mine, \u201c\u2014this is my new favourite pillow.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then took my hand, pressing his lips to it once. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wish the circumstances that brought you to me had been different. But I am very glad you came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure, when you see Mike in a few weeks, you\u2019ll fall back into step with each other right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, probably.\u201d I shrugged, then curiosity itched. \u201cSo? What about your family? Do you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a brother. A twin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Wow.\u201d I sat up next to David\u2019s hips, crossing my legs under me. This was way too interesting for a lie-down conversation. \u201cAre you identical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We look the same, but we\u2019re very different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I gathered that. Why doesn\u2019t he go to school with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe chose a different path\u2014stayed with my uncle, in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who do you live with, then? Are your parents still together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother passed away when I was a baby, and my father followed not long after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, David.\u201d I covered my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d He rested his arm behind his head.</p><p>\u201cSo, you grew up with your uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was raised by my aunt, and when she passed away, my uncle took my brother and I into his care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, you weren\u2019t kidding when you said you\u2019d suffered a lot of grief. I feel bad, like I\u2019m making a big deal out of my problems, but you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d He pushed himself up on his elbow and took my hand. \u201cYou have every right to \u2018make a big deal,\u2019 Ara. You just lost your mom. My grief, my loss, it all happened a very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be that long ago. You\u2019re only a teenager.\u201d I frowned, half laughing at the way he brushed off his own grief\u2014just like me.</p><p>He smiled and looked down at our hands, then took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m older than I look. The things I\u2019ve been through in life have made me older\u2014given me wisdom beyond my years.\u201d He laid back and said through a breathy smile, \u201cSometimes I feel like I\u2019m over a hundred years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you sound it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you see your uncle much, I mean, since you moved away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery other week or so. I\u2019ll be seeing him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re members of a council. We have a few things to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of council?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cA charity organisation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. What charity?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cBlood donation.\u201d</p><p>Hm. \u201cThen, I must confess.\u201d I showed him my arm. \u201cI\u2019ve never donated.\u201d</p><p>He laughed out loud. \u201cSomething we shall have to remedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. No one sticks needles in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could rent a vampire for the day\u2014he could draw it from you.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cSo, what about your brother? Do you see him much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d David\u2019s cheek flinched. \u201cNot so much. We\u2019ve kind of grown apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe uh\u2014\u201d He eyed Vicki as she passed my bedroom door, pretending not to look in on us, \u201c\u2014he and I had a falling out a while back. Things are...neutral, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeutral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d he muttered and sat up. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for him to find out about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said in short. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that answer, David.\u201d</p><p>Vicki passed my room, again, and David pulled my hand, making me sit beside him. \u201cHow \u2018bout we get out of here for the day, go to the lake?\u201d</p><p>A smile spread across my lips\u2014a real smile. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Do you have a picnic basket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d I said, standing up beside him.</p><p>\u201cGo get it.\u201d He leaned in and pecked my cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll run to the store and get some supplies.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Drawing a deep lungful of the woodsy leather smell, I smiled. Dad\u2019s car smelled nothing like this, and though the upholstery of David\u2019s car was sticky and uncomfortable under my legs in the summer heat, it seemed to retain the aged scent of experience\u2014a bit like riding in the car with my grandpa, which made it emotionally comforting\u2014kind of...safe.</p><p>Heavy weekend traffic made the trip out to the lake take longer. David, only half paying attention to the road, watched me sort through the CDs in his glove compartment. Most of the music would belong better in my dad\u2019s collection, but a tickle of elation perked me up at the sight of familiar cover-art. \u201cI\u2019ve actually heard of these guys.\u201d I held up the disk. \u201cI know a few of their songs.\u201d</p><p>David smiled. \u201cI have that album on my phone. I\u2019ll bring it with us when we get to the lake\u2014play it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Do...do you like them? I mean, I know you have a CD, but, like, what\u2019s your favourite one of their songs?\u201d</p><p>His chest puffed out with a deep breath as he looked at the CD. I held it up so he could see the back. \u201cOff that album...Overcome.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, scanning the song titles. \u201cWhy that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the piano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I considered the cover, then left it in my lap.</p><p>\u201cWe have more in common, musically, than just that one album, Ara,\u201d he said, clearly having sensed my gloom.</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Don\u2019t worry\u2014it\u2019s as important to me as it is to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I looked out the window for a second. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favourite song at the moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh\u2014\u201d He drew a tight breath through his teeth. \u201cHard to say. I go through phases. I uh\u2014right now, I\u2019m actually really enjoying Moonlight Sonata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that one, too.\u201d I smiled, sitting back. \u201cMaybe you can play it for me\u2014on the piano at school on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He placed his hand firmly on my leg. \u201cI would love to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I loved watching him play; it was almost as if he never even had to think about where his fingers were going. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever heard him hit a bum note, and just the thought of watching him play again filled me up with...well, happiness, I guess. \u201cHey, can I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He tore his eyes away from the road and they locked to mine for a breathless second.</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d I sprung upright in my seat, eyes wide. \u201cWatch the road!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ara. You are more than safe in the car with me.\u201d He reached across and pried my fingers from their grip on the leather seat. \u201cMy uncle forced me to take one of those stunt-driving courses once. I know how to handle myself on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re incapable of having an accident,\u201d I scolded. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not just your driving I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it make you feel better if I told you I\u2019ve never had an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stole my hand back.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll keep that in mind. No more eye contact when driving. Deal?\u201d he said with a breathy laugh, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, what were you about to say, before?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I should say it, since the moment had passed.</p><p>\u201cJust say it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My uncertainty lingered in the silence.</p><p>\u201cAra, say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy, is all.\u201d I shrugged and looked away. \u201cI\u2019m happy that we said we love each other, even if people say there\u2019s no such thing as love at first sight.\u201d</p> <p>We both stared forward, silence the only common ground. I kind of wished I hadn\u2019t said it. One thing I\u2019d learned about life was that happiness is subject to ignorance; as soon as you acknowledged it, it\u2019d disappear\u2014like everything else you care about.</p><p>David smiled; his own private joke again. \u201cIt really bothers you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just at odds with how I feel and what common sense says\u2014you know, what I should feel.\u201d</p> <p>David watched the road carefully, his easy smile making me feel silly for having doubts. \u201cYou can\u2019t make rules for your heart, Ara. And...if you berate yourself for what you feel, you\u2019ll eventually convince yourself not to feel that anymore. So\u2014\u201d He studied my face for a quick second, then turned his eyes back to the road. \u201cPlease just let yourself love me. I love you, and I don\u2019t want to lose your heart to some silly laws made up by man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut people just don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop trying to make them. If they\u2019ve ever loved before, then they\u2019ll understand and, if not, just let it go. They\u2019ll get it one day.\u201d</p><p>I took a long, slow breath. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you know, about being aged beyond your years.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDo you think you can still love me, even if I\u2019m an old man, deep down inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. How old are you, anyway? Emily said you\u2019re older than us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmily should mind her business.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cFeisty, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just despise gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we wouldn\u2019t need to gossip if you ever told me anything about yourself.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cShe\u2019s right. Emily. I am older. I\u2019ll be nineteen in November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you repeating a year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI uh\u2014\u201d He scratched the back of his head, resting his elbow on the door after, his fist in front of his lips. \u201cI went through a rough patch a few years ago and...I kind of let my grades slip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was when I left my uncle\u2014to come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...why did you leave your uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost someone.\u201d He swallowed, putting both hands on the steering wheel again. \u201cI\u2019ve been hiding from the world in a way, I guess, ever since. I wanted to pretend I was still seventeen\u2014get back some of the time I lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, David.\u201d I wished I could just kiss all his pain away. But grief just didn\u2019t work like that. \u201cSo, is that one of your secrets\u2014your dark secrets?\u201d I said playfully.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me something else about you\u2014something I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough. You know everything about me; I know nothing about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it will stay that way.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed and I bit my teeth together, folding my arms again. \u201cFine. Don\u2019t tell me. But I won\u2019t stop bugging you until you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he scoffed out a chuckling breath, \u201cbut I don\u2019t give in easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, I\u2019m very stubborn. I don\u2019t give up easily.\u201d There was so much attitude in that delivery, I wondered if perhaps I was capable of normal teenage behaviour.</p><p>David\u2019s head rocked from side to side, fluid with annoyance. \u201cYou are a wilful creature, Ara-Rose. I swear you will be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if you don\u2019t stop keeping secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, be nice,\u201d he said.</p><p>I tilted my nose in the air and watched the trees outside, blurring in hues of green and brown as we passed them.</p><p>The drive to the lake was relatively short, but the scenery changed so much, from closely gathered houses to a long stretch of highway and finally, a tunnel of trees around a hard-packed dirt road. As the tires crunched on the gravelly shoulder, my blue guitar, which hadn\u2019t shifted the whole drive, clunked noisily\u2014the vibrations drawing gentle hums of odd notes from the strings. I glanced over my shoulder to check on it; still upright, the strap looped safely over the headrest in the backseat.</p><p>As I turned back to face the front, David\u2019s gaze quickly shifted from me to the road. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me, are you?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p><p>When aren\u2019t I? \u201cNo. But I do wish you\u2019d trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I do trust you. But, to tell you more about myself means letting you into my world, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He shut the engine off, the sudden quiet making my ears ring. \u201cMy dark world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked to the front, folding my arms, and left it at that.</p><p>David glided along beside me, the guitar slung over his shoulder like a one-strapped backpack, and the picnic basket in hand. The sun filtered down through the tops of the trees in hazy lines of pale yellow and white, highlighting the golden tones in his hair. I just wanted to stop walking right then and run my fingers through it. But I wasn\u2019t sure our relationship was quite on the unguarded-impulse-control level yet.</p><p>When we came out to the clearing by the lake, the familiar lemony spice of wet bark and the heavy clay scent of decomposing leaves awakened my senses. A spectacular rainbow of nature greeted us, and I lost myself in the awe of this secret place. With the autumn hovering on the horizon of the approaching months, the deciduous evergreens surrounding the lake began to turn a hundred different colours. An illustration of mottled pinks, yellows and reds emulated off the lake\u2019s reflection, and dust motes settled on the water around the moss\u2014giving it an almost snow-like aspect. Across the lake, at the centre of the tranquil masterpiece, several flocks of colourful birds disappeared into the dense greenery of the island.</p><p>\u201cThis place is so amazing, David.\u201d And my mood just lifted like an elevator up the Empire State building.</p><p>David\u2019s hands circled my waist. He tucked his chin against the curve of my neck and squeezed my ribs. \u201cI can think of something more amazing.\u201d</p><p>Aw, how sweet. I smiled, resting my elbows over his. \u201cI like that\u2014the feel of you against me that way.\u201d</p><p>David pulled away, but stole my hand as he did, turning me to face him. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s sit down.\u201d He swept his arm outward, presenting a small square patch of grass, flattened by the rug\u2014picnic basket centred, and his iPhone setting the scene with some soft music.</p><p>\u201cHow did you set that up so fast?\u201d I looked back at David, my eyes quickly darting from where he\u2019d been standing beside me, to the rug, where he laid with his ankles crossed and the cheekiest grin warming his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re not human.\u201d</p><p>He laughed loudly. \u201cI think you\u2019re the one who\u2019s not human, Ara. I\u2019ve become accustomed to your trips outside your own head now. I set this up while you were lost in thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should get that looked at.\u201d I wandered over and sat down in front of him. \u201cHey, are you getting sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d David jumped back a little when I touched the purple indent under his eye. \u201cYou\u2019re freezing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I always forget that.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my hands, changing their temperature with the warmth of his breath.</p><p>\u201cThat feels nice,\u201d I said, watching him.</p><p>\u201cDid you know\u2014\u201d He closed his hands a little tighter around mine and pressed his nose against my fingers, drawing a deep breath, \u201c\u2014you smell like a freshly baked cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I gently pulled my hands away, rubbing the moisture from his breath into my skin. \u201cThat\u2019s just my body wash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, looking up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s just you.\u201d</p><p>I needed a subject change before those green eyes of his, all kind and smiling, made me lean forward and kiss him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this song? It has the most heartbreaking melody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called Overcome.\u201d David looked down at his hands. \u201cThe one I said I\u2019d play to you.\u201d</p><p>The words of the song danced around in my head, lilting softly over the wistful tide of the piano, while David stared into the tree line, his mind a million miles away. I watched his soft, angel-like face for just long enough to see that he was more beautiful than I\u2019d really noticed before. He was always lovely, but with his eyes lost in the splendour of the colourful surroundings, focused and totally unaware that I was staring, I could suddenly see just how out of my league he really was. His features were almost symmetrical, even down to the width of his mouth on both sides and the sharp, heart-shaped curve of his upper lip. There was this undeniable allure about him\u2014something\u2014maybe an energy that just drew me in, making me want to close my eyes and fall against him.</p><p>It was too late for me. I\u2019d never be able to go back. Never be able to live without him. \u2018Overcome\u2019 was very suitable for how I felt about this boy.</p><p>David looked up from his reverie and frowned at my face.</p><p>I wiped away my pout, forcing a look of composure, though inside, my heart was breaking. I wondered how I could possibly ever be good enough for him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why they say love is blind?\u201d he asked out of the blue.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d Okay, that was a strange question. \u201cBecause...you can\u2019t see straight when you\u2019re in love?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s because you don\u2019t need to see to fall in love. It\u2019s purely chemical. You can fall in love with someone before you\u2019ve spoken one word to them, and they don\u2019t have to be perfect, Ara, just perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re not from the same species\u2014can you be perfect for each other then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra\u2014\u201d he sat up a little. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean.\u201d I toyed with the hem of my dress. \u201cYou\u2019re...perfect, and I\u2019m...\u201d</p><p>He sat back, exhaling through his smile. \u201cThat\u2019s what you meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think I meant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He reached across and took my hand. \u201cAra. I don\u2019t know where you get this silly idea that we\u2019re not right for each other, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you said you\u2019re not good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my pale white fingers wrapped around his golden skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never loved anyone like this before. Ever. What do you think that means for me, Ara?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, not meeting his eyes, though I could feel them on me.</p><p>\u201cYou are more than good enough for me\u2014from personality to spirit and all the way to superficial and unimportant qualities.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re the single most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on and, believe me, Ara-Rose, I have seen a lot of girls.\u201d</p><p>One shoulder came up to my jaw. \u201cI guess I just don\u2019t see what you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m happy to keep saying it until you do.\u201d He touched the backs of his fingers to my cheek. \u201cJust relax into this, okay? We\u2019re together\u2014I\u2019m not going anywhere. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a long moment. \u201cYeah. But only if you promise to look in the mirror every day and tell yourself you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I smirked. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Hungry?\u201d He jumped up with a movement as light and fluid as a man on the moon.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, I am, actually.\u201d I hadn\u2019t even noticed it, but my stomach felt like a hollow pit. It might\u2019ve even growled at one point, but I\u2019d been too lost in David\u2019s flawless face to notice. I could\u2019ve starved to death and probably wouldn\u2019t have cared.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He handed me a small bunch of grapes and sat across from me, grabbing my guitar.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I picked at the plump, round fruit, while David plucked the strings; the squared tips of his fingers finding the notes so effortlessly, as if he knew every one like his own flesh.</p><p>\u201cDo you realise,\u201d I said with my mouth full, \u201cthat I\u2019ve never actually heard you play guitar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled, keeping his head down, twisting the pegs atop the neck. After a strum and a nod of satisfaction, he started playing.</p><p>My eyes tried to close again as the sound touched my heart, but I forced myself to open them and watch the phenomenon that was David\u2019s every note. In comparison to him, my musical ability was substandard, clumsy even. I hated that. \u201cYou make me feel like an amateur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been playing for a very long time.\u201d His laughter sounded like a release of tension, and as I sat back, watching the midday sun beam across his neck, he stopped playing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He shuffled over and picked a grape off the bunch, then popped it in his mouth, chewing thoughtfully. \u201cI wanna play you a song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I dumped the grapes back in the basket, readjusting my seat. \u201cDo I know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might. It\u2019s by Muse.\u201d He propped his left leg up, resting his forearm on his knee, and strummed the guitar. \u201cIt\u2019s called Unintended.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I picked through my music brain, but didn\u2019t recognise the melody at all.</p><p>With each chord change, my mind began to wander, the wind-chime notes carrying me to another place\u2014a dream-like world where emotions were displayed in melody. This one, with its harmony balancing on the edge of sadness, would be the song of a night sky that fell in love with the sun\u2014forever forbidden to be together, watching over a world that would end if one didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>David looked at me, and as he sung, the notes starting low and rolling up through the scale, his lips curved into that sexy smile. He tried to hold it back, but it crept onto his face anyway. And I closed my eyes, feeling a tight pull, like the blood in my brain suddenly gained ten pounds, filling my skull, David\u2019s perfect voice surrounding my thoughts. He made me want to cry\u2014to be a part of him, part of his voice\u2014and though I couldn\u2019t see anything but the golden light turning my eyelids red underneath, I could feel the colour of the lake around me; an image carved out in melody.</p> <p>As the song came to an end, the last notes hovered in my subconscious for a moment. I wiped a fingertip under my eye.</p><p>\u201cAra? You\u2019re crying.\u201d Sudden warmth spread through my cheek, the bright red glow behind my eyelids becoming shadowed as David\u2019s hot, sun-kissed fingers touched my face, pressing it against his heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, David, it\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d I pulled away and wiped my face with both hands, \u201c\u2014music is something that comes from a really deep place in me. I feel things so much, so completely, and that song?\u201d I leaned back and looked into his emerald eyes. \u201cIt was so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt reminds me of you\u2014of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see how much I\u2019m in love with you?\u201d He grabbed my face, his gaze penetrating my watery barrier, making my heart forget how to beat. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? Forever doesn\u2019t have to be a curse for me. Not anymore\u2014not now that I have you.\u201d</p><p>Motionless, breathless, with the only connection to the real world being the burning sun above, my mind fought for reason. \u201cBut we don\u2019t get to live forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we did? What if you could have an eternity with me?\u201d His thumbs pressed into my cheeks a little firmer. \u201cWould you take it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIf eternity were real\u2014I\u2019d give my soul to spend it with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He squeezed my face. \u201cOpen your eyes. Look at me and say that.\u201d</p><p>The sun brought momentary blindness with its bright glare as I looked at David. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they were closed.\u201d</p> <p>He studied me carefully, his brow tight in the middle.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want me to say?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Nearby, bee\u2019s buzzed with a gentle hum and a few birds chattered noisily in the treetops above us, and David\u2019s round eyes stared, glassy and distant, his lips sitting parted\u2014no words coming out.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He dropped his hands, shifting away from me, weighted like the dead.</p><p>A cool breath lifted my chest in a long, slow gasp, and a strange pull of energy\u2014or maybe warmth\u2014detached from the physical space between us, like hot ribbons had bound us, and now, snapped and tore away.</p><p>A spell had been broken.</p><p>The cold breath rushed out of my lungs too quickly, tightening my throat. I touched my fingertips to the racing pulse between my collarbones. \u201cDavid? I feel dizzy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He rolled me onto his lap, brushing my hair from my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened? I feel so sick.\u201d I snuggled my brow against his denim jeans, closing my eyes around the icy torrent of blood draining all the warmth from my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d David patted my back and lifted me to sit. \u201cYou need to eat. You get dizzy when you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>I forced a smile. \u201cTrue.\u201d But that was different, I was sure of it. That felt more like my soul had been connected to his for a split second. I felt so drawn to him, like I could\u2019ve stayed there forever\u2014died in his arms and have been grateful for that one, close moment. Now it was gone\u2014that warmth, the breathtaking intensity of our bodies so close to each other\u2014I wanted it back. I felt like it belonged to me.</p><p>David shuffled over and leaned his back against the rock while I swallowed every agonising bite of the food he handed me, forcing it down with orange juice because my mouth refused to make saliva. In fact, my body refused to do anything normal\u2014including breathe properly.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that?\u201d I looked up from under my lashes, pinching the edges of a sandwich. \u201cBefore\u2014when we were close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat...the energy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head once, pursing his lips. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou big, fat liar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014\u201d I got to my knees, \u201c\u2014you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, even if I knew what you were talking about, that does not mean I felt it.\u201d He sighed heavily and threw his sandwich into the basket, then sat back against the rock, folding his arms.</p><p>\u201cWell, what was that? What was I feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d</p><p>I dropped the sandwich to the rug. \u201cDavid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ara. What am I, a scientist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know.\u201d I looked over at the picnic basket. \u201cDid you drug those grapes?\u201d</p><p>David laughed. \u201cAra? Why would I do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what was that?\u201d I cut in. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel natural, and I know you know something about it. I saw how you looked at me.\u201d I pointed at him; he shook his head, smiling down at his folded arms. \u201cYou felt it, too. I know you did. Now tell me what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fight with you,\u201d he said calmly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen drop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t you think if I felt a\u2014a gravitational pull toward you, like my soul just split in two and then was suddenly\u2014\u201d I scrunched an imaginary piece of paper between my palms, \u201c\u2014forced back together, that if you felt it, too, or if you know why I felt it, you should tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGravitational pull?\u201d His brow rose; he leaned forward a little, resting his forearm over his knee.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me feel silly\u2014make me think I feel things you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>After rubbing his forehead viciously, he swept a hand through his hair and sat back against the rock again. \u201cCan we drop this? Please?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the ant-covered bread in front of me, blinking back tears.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d His voice commanded I look at him; I shook my head. \u201cAra, please. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I rolled my face upward.</p><p>His golden smile warmed. \u201cOh, sweetheart. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He reached out to me. \u201cYou know how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if you felt what I just felt.\u201d I nodded to the place on the rug where we\u2019d been sitting during the...moment. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t feel it too...what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat that was has nothing to do with how I\u2014\u201d His fists clenched in obvious frustration. \u201cYou are one of the most stubborn damn girls I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d He looked right into me. \u201cDo you know that?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you know what else, Ara?\u201d He appeared in front of me, tilting my chin upward.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also one of the most charming things about you.\u201d I caught the gleaming in David\u2019s eye, committing it to memory. \u201cNo more tears, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He tugged my hand until I came to sit beside him against the rock, and I nestled the crown of my head under his chin, placing my hand over the cotton shirt that barely contained the coolness of his skin underneath. I was sure he was getting colder.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>His strong arms squeezed me closer for a second. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about things another time, all right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>As the day rolled on, David asked me a lot about home\u2014about my mum and Mike, and didn\u2019t back down until I answered every question. But I found that, somehow, when I spoke to him about home, the good memories, I could do it without wanting to cry. It was like he formed an invisible, remedial barrier around me. I could just be with him, and that was nice. I rested my head in his lap, letting the tickle of sweat roll down my spine under the hot summer sun and soak into my green cotton dress, while David gently stroked my hair, pointing out odd clouds.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He squinted, shadowing his brow. \u201cI think it looks more like a bee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I scoffed, outlining the cloud with my fingertip. \u201cSee? Long tail, giant wings. It\u2019s a dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s a bee.\u201d David chuckled.</p><p>I slapped his arm playfully.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d He rubbed his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I laughed. \u201cI hit you in the arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it hurt here.\u201d</p><p>Aw, so sweet. \u201cThen, where would it hurt if I damaged your heart?\u201d I asked in a light, joking tone.</p><p>His eyes darkened, the smile fading. \u201cThe soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d I cleared my throat, looking away from his eyes. \u201cSo, what\u2019s out on that island? Anything interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could show you, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But won\u2019t we get wet?\u201d</p><p>David looked down at the tops of my thighs, just covered by the rim of my green dress, and smiled. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we\u2019ll leave it for today. There\u2019s always tomorrow, right?\u201d I rolled onto my knees and sat with my face right in front of David\u2019s, the tips of our noses just off touching. We both took a long, shaky breath, and the sweet scent of honey came back on my lips, making my mouth water. His hand slowly came up, taking hold of me, steering my face toward his. But he stopped\u2014held me there, my lips tingling just in front of his, and softly ran his thumb over them.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes tightly. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer\u2014just sat there, taking shallow breaths. I focused on his mouth, moving slowly forward, closing my eyes, holding my breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late,\u201d he said, and a cold rush separated us.</p><p>My eyes opened to the ugly black face of the rock he\u2019d been leaning against. I turned around to watch him walking off, running a hand through his hair. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re right.\u201d He stopped about ten paces away. \u201cWe can go out to the island another day. I think I remember something about a History assignment being due,\u201d his voice rose in question.</p><p>The breath I\u2019d been holding made a huge lump in my throat. \u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d He shook his head, coming over to pack the picnic basket. \u201cIt can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I flopped onto my back with a huff. In the corner of my mind, my silly fantasy continued\u2014David and I, all hands and lips, floating along the rest of the day in each other\u2019s arms. But reality shut the door on that world; opening another to the mountain of pending homework I faced instead.</p><p>With a sigh, I stood up and folded the picnic rug. \u201cHere, you wanna stash this back in your rock crevice?\u201d</p><p>He stepped away, shaking his head. \u201cThis is your secret place now too, Ara. I\u2019ll show you where to hide it.\u201d</p><p>I hugged the blanket and smiled. \u201cYou mean our secret place.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Everything had been set out properly; my pencils neatly lined up beside a notepad, my laptop centred, and even a glass of water for hydration. But after surfing the Net for two hours, the only thing I\u2019d accomplished was a mental list of reasons David wouldn\u2019t kiss me.</p><p>Outside, the hills to the east grew dark, and the summer sun settled red on a cloudless sky, turning the tops of the maple trees golden pink. It wasn\u2019t until my eyes burned, looking back at the white glow of my computer screen that I realised my attention had been on the distant horizon longer than I thought. It was almost too dark in my room to see now.</p><p>I tapped my pencil on the desk, trying to focus, but every time I tried to commit to an idea, the burn of kiss-rejection stole my concentration, forcing me to worry about why David jumped away from me so quick. All I wanted was to do normal things with him like, you know, holding hands, going to a movie or snuggling up on the couch\u2014kissing when my parents weren\u2019t in the room. But we were in the middle of nowhere today, and he still wouldn\u2019t kiss me.</p><p>I groaned at myself, and despite the sticky heat sneaking in through my window, gluing itself to my brow and neck, I lifted the feather quilt on my bed and slid my feet under it, rolling onto my side as I drew it up over my shoulders. Maybe if I could fall asleep until Vicki called me for dinner, I wouldn\u2019t have to think about David.</p><p>I flicked the lamp out and snuggled down, breathing the fruity scent of my sheets. That was the hardest thing about moving; how different things smelled\u2014like the towels and my shirts as I pulled them over my head. Vicki\u2019s clean laundry had a vibrant, peachy smell, whereas my mum\u2019s was a milky, powdery scent\u2014a bit like Mike, since our mums always bought the same laundry detergent. But peach was kind of comforting to me now; it meant I was in bed, away from the world, away from my troubles. I lay perfectly still, listening for the crickets\u2019 closing act, but the air was so thick and dense with heat even the bugs had taken the back road to anywhere but here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sun completely disappeared then, leaving the heat behind, and when the soft breeze picked up outside, I closed my eyes and imagined it was the sound of the ocean. When I opened them again, Mike smiled down at me from the photo I\u2019d tacked on my bedside wall. I yanked it downward and touched my fingers to his bright, cheeky smile. In so many ways, every guy I met, every smile that made my heart flutter, had been measured up to Mike\u2019s; it was always the first thing I noticed about a guy, always the deal breaker. The only place I got to see Mike\u2019s smile now, though, was in my dreams or in a picture taken long ago.</p><p>I kissed the photo and pressed my thumb to it against the wall. \u201cG\u2019night, Mike.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even have a photo of David to sit and fantasise over. All I had were a few faded images in my mind. But it was better than nothing, and more than enough to cast him in my fantasies each night. I closed my eyes and wandered away to my happy place, seeing David by the lake, strumming my guitar. He smiled back at me, then looked away again.</p> <p>\u201cThe words have changed.\u201d I sat on the ground beside him, my legs crossed.</p><p>\u201cNo, they haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have. That song was about love before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is it about now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think...\u201d I frowned, listening to him sing the words. \u201cDeath?\u201d</p> <p>His lips tugged on the corners, showing his dimples. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was always about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. You just couldn\u2019t hear it,\u201d he said and leaned closer, plucking the same string over and over again, the horrid repetition of a single note making my ears ring. \u201cListen now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not a song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not listening.\u201d He played louder; I covered my ears.</p><p>\u201cDavid. I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeath, Ara. It\u2019s about death.\u201d He appeared in front of my face, his nose touching mine. \u201cCan you handle death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d He grabbed my arms, the high note he was playing before ringing as the shadows closed in around us, making the ledge of his brow dark, menacing. \u201cAnswer me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I sat bolt upright, still feeling his hands on my arms, while the screeching of that single note, which suddenly gained a tone, became the ring of the phone. I jumped out of bed and grabbed it. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, kid, did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike? Um\u2014I uh, no, I was just daydreaming. What\u2019re you doing up?\u201d I looked at my clock. \u201cIsn\u2019t it, like, before six in the morning over there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I was in bed, but I was just layin\u2019 here, thinkin\u2019 \u2018bout ya.\u201d I could hear the grin behind his tone.</p><p>\u201cMe? Why?\u201d I sat at my desk.</p><p>\u201cInterview\u2019s booked now\u2014for next Monday. Thought I might start planning my trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think you\u2019ll be coming?\u201d</p><p>He took a long breath. \u201cI was thinking I should fly out that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Elation made my voice high. \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me. I\u2019d be happy if you came now.\u201d I flipped open my laptop, clicked on my calendar, then iTunes.</p><p>\u201cYou miss me that much, huh?\u201d He sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cMike, I\u2019ve never, ever had to live without you before. You\u2019re like my security blanket. I miss hanging out, you know, just being\u2014normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019m a blanky.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhat about David? He still in the picture?\u201d His light tone concealed a spearhead\u2014something only I would notice.</p><p>\u201cArgh. I just. Don\u2019t. Know, Mike. You know, he told me he loves me?\u201d I whined. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter a week?\u201d Mike\u2019s voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, it\u2019s not a week for him, remember? He\u2019s had around a month to think about it. But, you know, it\u2019s funny \u2018cause I kinda fell in love with him, too, like, the day I saw him.\u201d It was hard to admit that\u2014especially to Mike. I knew he couldn\u2019t comprehend love, and I never wanted to hear the word infatuation.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem, then? Are you being a commitment-phobe again?\u201d He sighed, sounding bored.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the opposite, actually. He hasn\u2019t kissed me yet.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. I could almost see him tilting his head forward, scratching his brow. \u201cHow long have you been official?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how long were you and Bec official before you guys did more than just kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different. I\u2019m an adult and you\u2019re a kid. Did you ever think that that might be his problem? You being under eighteen?\u201d Mike concluded. \u201cHow old is this guy, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a little older.\u201d I brushed over that one. \u201cAnd yes, I did consider the fact that we\u2019re not technically adults.\u201d Well I wasn\u2019t, but David was. \u201cBut we are at the legal age of consent here, and he\u2019s a hot-blooded male\u2014and there have been opportunities. I just don\u2019t get it. A kiss can\u2019t hurt, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re a hot-blooded male, Ara,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cA kiss can make you want a lot more, and maybe he just has\u2014\u201d he paused for a second, \u201c\u2014self-knowledge? He might think he won\u2019t wanna stop if you were to ask him to go further. And maybe he\u2019s afraid if he did have the willpower to stop, it might hurt your feelings.\u201d His voice dropped on the end.</p><p>\u201cThat could have something to do with it. But it makes me feel\u2014\u201d I knew the word, but didn\u2019t want to admit it.</p><p>\u201cUndesirable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>He laughed\u2014a loud, full bellow.</p><p>The tightness in my stomach spread to my teeth. \u201cMike. Stop it. Don\u2019t laugh at me, you know I hate that!\u201d</p><p>He stopped instantly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara, it\u2019s just that...I\u2019ve always thought you were cute. I\u2019m not stupid, I have eyes, and I promise, you are not undesirable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, you can\u2019t say that. You\u2019re my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m your friend, which means I can say that.\u201d</p><p>I typed pick up Mike on Tuesday in my desktop calendar then went back to iTunes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Mike asked, sensing my absence, I guess.</p><p>\u201cDownloading a song.\u201d I clicked on search.</p><p>\u201cA legal download, I hope,\u201d he muttered in his stern \u2018cop\u2019 voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I hissed, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat song?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s by this band called Live. You know them, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike scoffed. \u201cWhy would you be listening to them, though? It\u2019s a little old for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, I\u2019m three years your junior. If it\u2019s old for me, it\u2019s old for you.\u201d</p><p>Overcome started downloading so I looked up the song David said reminds him of me\u2014the one by Muse. I just had to hear it again. My playlist of David was getting very long.</p><p>\u201cSo, what song then?\u201d Mike asked after a moment.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, the Live one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOvercome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you hear that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid likes it. He played it today on his iPhone. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me, baby; I judge how you\u2019re feeling by your playlist. Don\u2019t you think that song\u2019s a little...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, depressing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cMike. Are you worried that I\u2019m suici\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ara. Please don\u2019t think that. I just\u2014you normally listen to such happy music. I just thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Just tired of people thinking I\u2019m depressed. \u201cI know Vicki and Dad think I\u2019m suicidal and, to be honest, if you all don\u2019t leave me alone, I might have to do something rash just to get you off my back. So, shut it! Okay? I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead silent. He should\u2019ve been used to my outbursts, but I guess, with all the miles between us, it was harder to just brush it off like normal. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood. \u2018Cause I\u2019m okay. I have David. My life is about him now. Look\u2014\u201d I exhaled and softened my tone. \u201cI love you, Mike. I know you\u2019re just worried. But it\u2019s really an insult to my character that everyone keeps watching me all the time for the wrong move. I live with a former psychiatrist, for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019ll go crazy soon.\u201d I took a breath and the smell of Vicki\u2019s cooking filled my nostrils. \u201cI need to feel free to make mistakes or listen to depressing music, and I need you to be with me on that.\u201d It was supposed to be an attempt at reason, but unfortunately for Mike, he\u2019d just become victim to two months\u2019 worth of saved-up ranting. \u201cMike?\u201d His quiet breath revealed his presence. \u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a little girl anymore, Ara,\u201d he concluded softly. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened these last few months has...well, it\u2019s changed you. A lot. You\u2019ve really had to grow up and...I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d I rested my hand over my belly button to quiet the flutters his words formed there. \u201cBut I\u2019m also really proud of you. I just need to see you again\u2014make sure you\u2019re still my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be your girl, Mike. You\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have David now. You won\u2019t be needing me for much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You know it\u2019s true. But it\u2019s okay,\u201d he assured himself. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be an adjustment, that\u2019s all\u2014not having you all to myself whenever I wanna talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the same for me when you were dating Lyndall. It\u2019s just the way things are. But I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll always be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure we will.\u201d After a second, he laughed softly. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to seeing you. I can\u2019t wait to pick you up and squeeze you until you can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! No way. I\u2019ll totally squeeze you harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, those skinny spider arms\u2019ll do so much damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Hercules!\u201d I chuckled the words out.</p><p>\u201cMiss you.\u201d Mike sighed, his laughter ceasing.</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>The morning greeted me with a light, airy feeling, and the awakening floral scent of frangipanis sent shivers of normality through my chest. I snuck down the stairs and quietly opened the front door, hoping Vicki wouldn\u2019t realise how late I was today. But it wasn\u2019t my fault; ever since I met David, the world was just too good to leave behind for the sake of sleep. So, technically, it was his fault I slept through my alarm this morning.</p><p>The last of the minivan parade sped past my dad\u2019s house as I reached the edge of the driveway, and the glowing heat of the sun warmed my skin while the sight of David warmed my whole day. Completely distracted, as usual, he didn\u2019t even see me walk out.</p><p>As I cleared the windbreak of the house, the morning breeze blew in from the east, sweeping the dewy scent of roses in on its back. Strands of my hair caught the gust and wisped pleasantly along my shoulders like tickly feathers. I closed my eyes and lost myself in the sensation.</p><p>\u201cAra! Look out!\u201d</p><p>My eyes shot open. The windshear of a speeding car nearly sucked me onto the road, but a hand gripped my arm and yanked me from the edge. \u201cJeeze, Ara!\u201d Sam dropped my arm. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard and blinked. One more step and I would\u2019ve been under that car. \u201cSorry, Sam. It wasn\u2019t there when I started crossing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He watched the beaten-up old bomb scream around the corner\u2014smoke billowing out from its exhaust. \u201cHe came out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d A smile spread over my shock. \u201cYou just saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid. How come you didn\u2019t see that?\u201d He looked over my shoulder just as warm hands clasped my waist; David spun me into him, ignoring Sam. \u201cMan, you were looking right at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d David asked in a soft whisper, cupping my cheek.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He shook his head and looked at Sam. \u201cI was looking this way, but I was...I just didn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>I touched my collarbone; it felt like my heart was trying to break through the skin. David placed his hand over mine.</p><p>\u201cWell, I gotta get to school,\u201d Sam said, nodding toward the building as the last bell rang. \u201cYou need me to hold your hand across the road, sis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cTake care, Ara. Okay?\u201d Sam started walking backward. \u201cDad only just got you back. It\u2019ll kill him if you...do something stupid.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open. \u201cIt was an accident,\u201d I called out, standing on my toes to make my voice seem bigger.</p><p>He shrugged and kept walking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara.\u201d David\u2019s eyes, still lost along the outline of my face, narrowed when I looked back at him. \u201cI really\u2014\u201d his brow tightened, \u201c\u2014should have seen that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, David. I was totally in my own world.\u201d I laughed, but David just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYour heart. It\u2019s beating so fast.\u201d He wrapped one arm, then the other around my shoulders and squeezed me tight enough to trap my hands against my chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re doing that.\u201d</p><p>He said something to me then, in a tone I interpreted as anger or maybe fear, but the words were in French.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s just get to class.\u201d He started walking.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is it? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d His chest heaved, almost unnoticeably, as if he were regurgitating or maybe choking on words.</p><p>\u201cOh God, there is something wrong.\u201d My heart picked up again and everything around me disappeared to insignificance. He didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t speak, just stood\u2014motionless, wordless and unresponsive. Tiny bubbles of despair flitted around my stomach. I felt like everyone on the school grounds was watching us. But the field was empty; we were late, and I didn\u2019t care. \u201cDoes this have something to do with the reason you don\u2019t wanna kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is that what you think? That I don\u2019t want to kiss you?\u201d He shook his head and started walking away. \u201cHonestly, Ara, I don\u2019t know where you come up with these things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, tell me what\u2019s wrong. What am I supposed to think when you act like this?\u201d I stepped out onto the road, pointing back to the spot where we\u2019d just been standing.</p><p>He stopped, but didn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>\u201cDavid, what is it, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His head rolled downward. \u201cI spoke to my uncle last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, and?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014\u201d He turned to face me again. \u201cWhen he comes to visit today, he has requested I return with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReturn? Return where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? For how long?\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s eyes closed for a second. \u201cFor good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>He looked up then, and I don\u2019t think he expected to see the hurt I could feel coming from my eyes. Without a word, he closed the gap between us and wrapped his body around me, pinning my face to his cool silk shirt. And though the warmth of his hands invited my soul to feel love, his heart betrayed the anguish in his eyes\u2014seeming completely still, as if it weren\u2019t even beating\u2014certainly not feeling the pain I was. \u201cAra, leaving was never optional for me.\u201d</p><p>My stomach sunk. \u201cBut...you said. You told me you weren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders dropped. \u201cI know. I\u2014it was silly of me to say that. I got caught up in you, in this, and I made promises I knew, even then, that I probably couldn\u2019t keep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cC\u2014\u201d My mouth hung open, stuck on a word. \u201cCaught up? You don\u2019t just get caught up, then make fake promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t fake. When I made that promise, my every intention was to try to keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s changed? Why can\u2019t you keep it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might say reality came back to pay me a visit.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cWhat kind of answer is that? That tells me nothing, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve done everything the wrong way here. I just wasn\u2019t prepared to come here and fall in love, and now that I have, I need to rethink everything my life means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...can\u2019t you rethink your life...with me in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not viable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViable? Viable?\u201d Incredulity rose up in me like heat. \u201cSo, that\u2019s it? No negotiations. You\u2019re just leaving me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be for another few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonths? You said never. When were you going to tell me this\u2014that you were leaving?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t, were you? You were just going to leave?\u201d I edged forward, my hands on my hips.</p><p>He moistened his lips. \u201cIt was one option.\u201d</p><p>I died inside then. \u201cI mean so little to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ara\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d I rolled my shoulder, pulling my arm away from his touch. \u201cGod, you\u2019re a player. You\u2014how could you do this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. I wasn\u2019t supposed to love you this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do. Doesn\u2019t that, I mean, can\u2019t that change how things have to be?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he turned and looked at me. His eyes shimmered so green in the morning light, so liquid with troubles that I wanted to look away. \u201cI wish it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s it. You\u2019re going\u2014leaving\u2014today?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>The world went dark behind my eyelids. I bit my quivering lip, then folded my arms, standing straight, and walked right past him.</p><p>\u201cAra, where are you going?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak\u2014couldn\u2019t even think; I just had to go to school, go to class, just move.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He grabbed my arms and pulled me back gently. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go. I\u2014\u201d I spoke to his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Ara, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it, David? You can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head, folding my arms tighter. \u201cI\u2019ll die. If you go, I won\u2019t be able to go on. You\u2019re the glue. You\u2019re everything that\u2019s holding me together. How will I possibly be okay without you?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his arms to his sides. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Would you rather I lied? Would you rather I said great, let\u2019s have a freakin\u2019 celebration\u2014a farewell party. What did you honestly expect by telling me this?\u201d</p><p>He looked down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>I wiped my face with my hand and walked away again. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d told you the truth. I should have told you I\u2019d be leaving, Ara.\u201d He caught up and stood in front of me, blocking my path. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t. And you wait until now, when I finally let myself need you, finally let myself feel okay again, to tell me you\u2019re going to take all that away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take it. You\u2019ll be okay. Don\u2019t you see? You\u2019re okay now. You have Em, you have your dad, Mike\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey mean nothing to me, David! They\u2019re not you.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back on his heels. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d I nodded, smiling, though the lump in my throat wanted to rip me open. \u201cOf course you are.\u201d And it all broke apart. I dug the heels of my palms into my eyes, and my shoulders hunched, shaking, as everything I thought was okay fled my heart. I felt so unsteady, like I was standing on the street, alone, in the pouring rain, and even the smell of the cut grass and the vapours of the melting dew on the hot pavement couldn\u2019t change my mind, couldn\u2019t make me believe this was not some horror movie where my hero walked away, got hit by a taxi, and I never saw him again.</p><p>\u201cYou will get through this,\u201d he said coldly.</p><p>I stifled my tears, straightening, like the strong girl I could pretend to be. \u201cIs that what you really believe?\u201d</p><p>He let out a long breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not my heart\u2019s desire to leave you. If you only knew how much you mean to me, you\u2019d know how the very idea of not being here to hold you, to see you smile, to be the one that makes it okay, is killing me. I\u2019ve lost sleep over this, Ara. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this,\u201d he said, his voice losing that deep, strong tone.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s ever what we want it to be.\u201d My lip quivered; I bit it.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. And I betrayed you\u2014betrayed your heart by allowing you to love me, when I knew this would end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think you could control this?\u201d I dug my finger into my chest. \u201cDid you think you could stop me falling in love with you, like it\u2019s some accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve left\u2014before you fell for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, before my first day\u2014before English class, before you took me to the lake and made me open up to you in a way I never thought I could with anyone.\u201d</p><p>He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cThis is a mess.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my shoulder back and looked around the field. \u201cWill he let you finish out the day, at least?\u201d</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019ll arrive just after lunch; I need to be there to meet with him.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my dad\u2019s house, then at my own feet for a long moment. \u201cJust go then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo now. Just go. Don\u2019t drag this out.\u201d Each sentence became more breathy, the composure I was attempting being slaughtered by a lack of control over anything in my life.</p><p>\u201cAra, don\u2019t cry like that. You\u2019ll make yourself sick again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Do you think I\u2019m doing it deliberately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He reached for me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shoved his chest as hard as I could. \u201cI said go. I don\u2019t want to see you anymore. I don\u2019t want to even look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You hurt me. You made me love you. You made me want to be happy with you\u2014\u201d I drew a deep, shuddering breath and folded over as he moved in and wrapped me up in his arms\u2014tucking my hands into my chest so I couldn\u2019t fight him.</p><p>\u201cShh. It\u2019s okay,\u201d he said into my hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was for always. I pictured a future,\u201d I sobbed inaudibly.</p><p>He slowly reached up and rubbed his mouth with a tight hand, his eyes closed. \u201cI know. I did too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happened? Why are you just letting this go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I want. I was stupid\u2014I thought I\u2019d be the exception, but Ara, I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t change this.\u201d</p><p>Like accepting death, his words rolled over me, and I nodded. \u201cDo you know what will happen to me\u2014when you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>He grew taller, inch-by-inch. \u201cDon\u2019t think that way. You\u2019re a strong, capable girl.\u201d He grabbed both my arms. \u201cYou will be okay. I know this.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s just what you tell yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I have to tell myself,\u201d he yelled, his gaze fixing mine. After a moment, he gently pushed me away and walked toward my dad\u2019s house, stopping after a few steps. \u201cGoddamn it, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my hands over my stomach to keep the contents in, drawing a few deep breaths, watching him do the same; his back to me, hand to his face.</p><p>The bell tolled behind us and students broke through the school doors, their noise filling the field\u2014first period.</p><p>David quickly turned and stalked closer, grabbing my arm again before he was fully at my side. He pulled me close, glaring down at me. \u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d</p><p>I shoved his hand off my arm. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if those secrets of mine, those secrets you\u2019re too innocent to handle, were stopping that from ever being possible? Would you be ready to hear them then?\u201d</p><p>I stepped forward, lifting my chin to feel taller. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He doubled back, his eyes narrowing for a second. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>I twitched a little. \u201cI just...I don\u2019t want you to be something bad, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not sure if you could love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in love like this before; I just don\u2019t know what it can withstand, and I feel so fragile\u2014\u201d I touched my chest. \u201cI just feel so afraid to lose you\u2014afraid to even want to stop loving you.\u201d</p><p>He looked around as the students branched out in several directions, intruding on our little battle over the end of the world. \u201cI can talk to my uncle. Maybe I can convince him to let me stay\u2014at least for my original designated allowance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not for always?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly, and I knew it weaselled its way in there\u2014the idea that a few months wouldn\u2019t suffice. \u201cThere are other options\u2014some I, until now, haven\u2019t been willing to explore; but staying is not one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them, really, Ara.\u201d He groaned, scratching his brow fiercely. \u201cNone of them are right\u2014not for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cBecause I love you. Because I want better for you. And because all your dreams, Ara\u2014everything you want in life could be destroyed if we stayed together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my love, is as far this explanation goes without formal approval.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed as I stepped into him, peering right into his soul. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to explain this to you. I\u2019ll talk to my uncle and return for you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter lunch,\u201d he said, and walked away without waiting for a response.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara,\u201d Emily beamed, racing up to where I stood; she smiled widely, looking at me then at David wandering away. \u201cMissed you in roll-call today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d I rolled my head to the side, knowing full well she could see my tears. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend there\u2019s nothing going on\u2014that just makes it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Her shoulders dropped. \u201cAre you okay? Did you have a fight?\u201d</p><p>I watched David getting smaller and smaller as he briskly walked toward the front parking lot. \u201cI gotta get to class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Um, Ara?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stopped, turning stiffly back to face Em.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you\u2019re upset, but, if you need to, like, talk or anything\u2014\u201d she pulled one shoulder up and touched her cheek to it.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Em. But I\u2019m okay, really.\u201d I could hold in hurt just fine. I didn\u2019t need to talk about it.</p> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>As we walked to class, Emily babbled mindlessly about the benefit concert and our difficult mythology paper\u2014which hadn\u2019t sounded so difficult when Dad assigned it\u2014while I slipped into the safety of my proverbial eggshell-carrycase, wandering around wearing my fake smile, even though, inside, my guts felt like fricassee. David\u2019s pendulum behaviour had finally sent me nuts; my every thought centred on reasons he might be leaving\u2014and I kept coming back to believing it was because of me. In my world, it didn\u2019t matter what was wrong or what you had to do, you\u2019d give it all up, give up everything for love. I\u2019d do that for David. But then, my dad always did say I spent too much time living in fantasyland\u2014expecting the fairy-tale endings I\u2019d read about in books.</p><p>At lunch, we set the date for the benefit concert and finished making ticket signs\u2014with the help of the Art students. Then, Emily went as far as to ask that the performers meet after school for further rehearsals. And we actually agreed.</p><p>Everything for the concert was falling in to place, while for me, everything was falling apart. Even watching Alana and Ryan cheerfully walk everywhere together, and whenever a teacher wasn\u2019t looking, hold hands or kiss, I actually felt the hollow pit of jealousy; something I\u2019d never felt before. They were so normal, and I was beginning to think, to my dismay, that David was not.</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d I said, lowering my voice so Dad wouldn\u2019t growl at me for talking in class again.</p> <p>\u201cMm?\u201d She kept her eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cHypothetical question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love this game.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cIf you loved someone, more than anything, what would be the only thing that could make you leave them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d She watched the projection screen as Dad changed the image, and I caught one or two words of his lecture about some religious topic\u2014something to do with vampire myth. \u201cDeath, I suppose. I\u2019d only leave if they could either die or get really hurt by my being with them.\u201d</p><p>I nodded to myself. \u201cWhat if you were a criminal and you didn\u2019t want them to know?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, leaning on her hand. \u201cNah, I\u2019d tell them; if they loved me, they wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if your horrible truth was that you went from place to place, making people love you, then leaving them\u2014for the fun of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it wouldn\u2019t be real love, so it wouldn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>My heart wriggled down into my diaphragm.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a hypothetical question?\u201d Emily said, lowering her voice when Dad gave us a warning glare.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I tried not to switch off; too many times she\u2019d said things and I had to pretend I\u2019d been paying attention. But I just felt like crying\u2014a feeling so deep I had to sit straight and take a few shallow breaths. I knew only too well that if David thought he would be hurting me by staying, then he would absolutely leave and not come back. And I loved him for that as much as I hated him for it.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Emily elbowed me. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Oh crud. \u201cUm\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra and Emily!\u201d Dad said, saving the day.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d Emily winced.</p><p>\u201cAsk me again later,\u201d I said, leaning closer.</p><p>She nodded and we tuned in to Dad\u2019s lecture; \u201cSo,\u201d he continued, \u201cWhen God created Adam, he also created who?\u201d He pointed his pen to the back of the room.</p><p>\u201cEve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn some versions of the story, yes, that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s also told that God first created a woman named Lilith. Now, she has many names in different cultures: Lilith, Kali, Satrina. She\u2019s also known as The Snake, The Screeching Owl\u2014\u201d I fazed out when I smelled something very similar to David\u2019s orange-chocolate cologne; I looked around, but he wasn\u2019t in the room.</p><p>\u201cSo, unlike her sister Eve, Lilith was not created from a part of Adam. She was created as his equal. However, Adam would not treat her as such. He tried to force her to submit to him as he pleased, and in a stand for her own rights, Lilith left the Garden of Eden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet, world\u2019s first feminist,\u201d one of the football jocks snickered.</p><p>\u201cI have to admit,\u201d I whispered to Em, \u201cthis is getting kind of interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sharp, Mr Grady.\u201d Dad paced the floor, gesturing with his hands as he spoke. \u201cSo, at a loss now, God decided to create another woman for Adam. But this time, she would be bound to Adam by the flesh.\u201d Dad stopped and looked around. \u201cWho knows how he did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was created from one of Adam\u2019s ribs or something, right?\u201d the paper cannon kid next to me said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. And because she was bound to him she couldn\u2019t...?\u201d Dad pointed around the room, stopping on Emily.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t just leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Lilith, on the other hand, believed Eve was made to be na\u00efve\u2014that God had not given her the knowledge of herself. Some say Lilith acted as the snake that conned Eve into tasting the Forbidden Fruit, also known as the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFruit of Knowledge.\u201d Emily grinned, dropping her raised hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Ten points to the students paying attention down the front here\u2014\u201d Dad grinned and scribbled only five lines on the top right corner of the board. \u201cAnd deduct five, for my daughter, who hasn\u2019t heard a word we\u2019ve been saying.\u201d The whole class erupted into a murmur of giggles; I sunk down in my seat\u2014staring daggers at my father.</p><p>\u201cNow, as the story continues, Lilith, who was created in God\u2019s exact likeness, lived outside the Garden of Eden. If we jump forward in the story a little\u2014\u201d he looked at his watch, \u201c\u2014you\u2019ll remember from our studies in religion last year that those in God\u2019s likeness have the same power as the Almighty\u2014which included immortality.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find that, in many cases throughout history, Lilith was said to be the Goddess of Seduction and believed to have power over men. In fact,\u201d Dad said, raising his index finger, \u201cin many cases, when men were unfaithful, they proclaimed it to have been an act of seduction by the Goddess, and not an act of sin. Sounds like the easy way out if you ask me.\u201d He melodramatically loosened his tie.</p><p>The class laughed\u2014but not me; I was still mad at him for singling me out.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t she also said to be a demon, which ate small children?\u201d a student asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Grace.\u201d Dad raised a brow. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right. There are many different myths surrounding Lilith. If anyone here knows the story of Cain and Abel, you\u2019ll know that Cain murdered his own brother and was punished by God\u2014banished and cursed for eternity with a thirst for blood. Then, he fell in love with the Goddess, Lilith.\u201d Dad smiled at the class. \u201cCan anyone see where I\u2019m going with this?\u201d He looked around; no one answered.</p><p>I shrugged when he looked at me. How would I know?</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, it\u2019s told that Lilith and Cain had a child\u2014an immortal, who inherited his father\u2019s thirst for blood. The world\u2019s first myth about...?\u201d He waited, his brow arched, cheeks high.</p><p>\u201cVampires,\u201d said a voice from the doorway.</p><p>Quiet murmurs spread over the class as everyone turned to look at the boy leaning on the doorframe with his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cVery good, David, and you\u2019re not even one of my students. And so\u2014\u201d Dad said as he walked over and took a note from David\u2019s hand, \u201c\u2014you can see that even legends of the most vile of creatures may have some religious origin.\u201d</p><p>David looked at me and smiled. It was not returned.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Dad called, still reading the note.</p><p>I sat up a little and stared at David, my mind filling with questions. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo with David, please?\u201d</p><p>All eyes in the class fell on me; I stood up slowly, jammed my books and pens into my bag, then shrugged at Emily as I sauntered past, slipping out the classroom door with David behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to my dad?\u201d</p><p>He started walking. \u201cI told him I needed to rehearse with you\u2014for the benefit concert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he bought it?\u201d I asked, the surprise in my voice a little too obvious.</p><p>He just laughed.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to your uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014\u201d His shoulders dropped. \u201cI still have to leave, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s granted me, provisionally, the original amount of time I had left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>His tongue moved between his lips for a second before he pressed them together. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. But, you can count on me being gone by winter.\u201d</p><p>Dread made my arms heavy. \u201cThen there\u2019s no need for us to see each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t.\u201d He grabbed my wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He maintained his tight grip. \u201cIf I have to leave in a few months, I won\u2019t waste this time we have left; there are some things I want to do with you, Ara-Rose, and I won\u2019t let the fear I might hurt you stop me from loving you the way I\u2019ve needed to for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt me?\u201d The bridge of my nose crinkled. \u201cWhy would you hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014\u201d He pulled me along by the arm. \u201cCome on. We need to go before we get caught ditching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, David.\u201d I twisted my wrist around in his grip and yanked it out through the break in his thumb and forefinger, then stood fast\u2014folding my arms like a spoiled child. \u201cNot until you tell me where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stubborn little thing,\u201d he said quickly, taking one long stride in my direction, then arched his body downward as he swept me off the floor, into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d I pinned my dress under my legs, nudging his chest with my elbow. \u201cPut me down. This is kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he stated with a smile, keeping his eyes on the path ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s a rescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRescue?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be rescued.\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking and looked down at me; I shrank into his arms a little. \u201cThe fair maiden who is locked in the darkest tower, guarded by the cruellest beast, never believes herself to be in danger; only suffering sorrows untold and a heart untouched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not in a tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be if you don\u2019t come quietly.\u201d</p><p>I huffed; he just looked forward and smiled to himself, then stuffed me in his car and drove away with me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Prince Charming.\u201d I buckled my seatbelt. \u201cFess up. Where\u2019re you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He stared ahead.</p><p>\u201cDavid. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot telling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you need to learn to control your moods, Ara, without getting your own way first.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed and I tightened my crossed arms. \u201cYou\u2019re not my dad. I don\u2019t need you to teach me a lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to.\u201d He held back a wry smile.</p><p>I huffed, bit my teeth together and looked out the window.</p><p>When David took the final turn onto the long stretch of tree-covered road, my arms loosened, my lungs drawing the fresh pine scent of evergreens and the cinnamon flavour of the approaching autumn. That smell was kind of comforting to me now\u2014like the feeling you get when you finally come home after a really bad day.</p><p>We pulled over in the usual spot, then walked in total silence until my temper became a physical sting in my chest. \u201cWhy are you walking so fast?\u201d</p><p>He ignored me, continuing on his path, gliding effortlessly over the rocks and twigs\u2014as if he were walking an inch above the forest floor, like a ghost. Meanwhile, I stumbled and slid on the bark-covered slopes, brushing the side of my leg off constantly, then standing back up\u2014trying to look as graceful as David.</p><p>Infuriation burned every drop of blood in my body. \u201cWhy are you ignoring me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t calmed down yet.\u201d</p><p>I pretty much walked with my teeth clenched the whole time after that. When we came to the rock where we usually sat, David shook his head and continued on a path we\u2019d never walked down before.</p><p>\u201cNow where are we going?\u201d I whined, dropping my arms to my sides. \u201cI\u2019m tired and it\u2019s hot. I don\u2019t wanna walk anymore.\u201d</p><p>He continued ahead\u2014tall and sleek, never looking back.</p><p>Argh! I felt like throwing a rock at his head.</p><p>David spun around then, his eyes alight with a humoured glint. \u201cForget to have lunch, did we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it is, because I\u2019m the one that has to put up with your moods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moody.\u201d But I knew that was a lie, and as I looked away from the irritation in his stern eyes, my breath stopped around a dose of crushing anxiety; his words \u201cput up with your moods\u201d resonating with every belief I had that he would one day get sick of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to take those off.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my shoes. \u201cNo. Not until you tell me where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, leave them on.\u201d He shrugged, then reached behind him and lifted his shirt, tugging it past the sharply cut V of muscles diving just below the waistline of his jeans.</p><p>I looked back down at my feet before it came off completely.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ara,\u201d David said, a hint of laughter in his tone. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, course you weren\u2019t.\u201d He came to stand in front of me, the rim of his Calvin Klein\u2019s showing just under the rise of his dark jeans; his tan skin covering every inch of him I wanted to see. And I could look, if I wanted to.</p><p>He held my hand firmly, like he was asking me to look, and when I finally braved it, a body like I\u2019d never seen before, except on TV, gobbled up my heart, destroying me in the end with that cheeky grin.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, Ara?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not blushing \u2018cause I think you\u2019re hot.\u201d I reached down and slipped off my shoes, then dumped them by a rock. \u201cYou don\u2019t affect me, David Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re too sensible to be knocked off your feet by a guy without a shirt.\u201d He grinned, reaching his hand out. I stared at it. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I walked the five-pace gap and touched his fingertips. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you need to take your shirt off; it\u2019s not that hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want it to get wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWet?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and led me to the cold, crisp water of the lake. \u201cDo you see where we\u2019re going now?\u201d</p> <p>I followed the direction of his nod. \u201cThe island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s a small sandbar that extends all the way across. It\u2019s only as deep as\u2014\u201d he considered my height for a second, \u201c\u2014probably your upper thigh.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught in my throat as the cold water reached my knees, and my fingers involuntarily tightened around David\u2019s. \u201cHow did you find this sandbar?\u201d I asked. It was only wide enough for David and I to walk on, side-by-side, disappearing into the depth of the lake after that.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he chuckled as he spoke, \u201clet\u2019s just say I kinda stumbled over it one day. It\u2019s the only way out to the island unless you swim\u2014or fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the water deep outside the sandbar?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once.</p><p>Above us, fingers of clouds blotted out the sun, and a cool breeze dragged the shivers in my body to the surface. David\u2019s jeans were soaked\u2014the water seeping all the way up to his pockets, but not anywhere on those golden ribs, or arms, did I see so much as a goosebump. \u201cHow come you\u2019re not cold?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me, then let go of my hand and wrapped his arm over my shoulder. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I can think of a few ways to get warm.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip to stop from giggling, already feeling warmer.</p><p>Under the crystal clear water, I saw David\u2019s feet for the first time, and smiled. It\u2019s kinda funny how seeing someone\u2019s feet can make them seem less mysterious; how it can make it easier to imagine them beside yours in a bed or in the kitchen while you make breakfast. But seeing his feet would only make it harder for me to cope when the winter came.</p><p>David\u2019s toes kicked up a swirl of sand, which spread out like a brown cloud\u2014hiding our feet completely. My fingers tightened around his again.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d he asked, looking at my hand.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t be. I won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cThen, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just afraid of what it\u2019s going to feel like when I can\u2019t hold your hand anymore.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, and a hint of a smile angled the corners of his mouth. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not goodbye, Ara. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>I moved my head in a nod\u2014feeling detached and outside reality.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna let that get wet?\u201d He motioned to the edges of my dress, slightly touching the water. \u201cI won\u2019t look if you want to lift it up a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said, regretting it as soon as the water soaked in.</p><p>Ahead of us, a thick moss blanket smothered the lake at the base of the island. We waded through, parting it with our fingers, like cheese on a pizza, until the steep, muddy slopes of the banks halted us with warding trees, leaning out like diagonal spears. David curled his palm around a branch and hoisted himself onto it. I waited in the water, imagining all the slimy things that might be lurking under the green, sludgy moss.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d David reached down from his perch, grinning. \u201cThe worst thing out here is me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in that case\u2014\u201d I took his hand, \u201c\u2014maybe I should be worrying about my heart instead of my toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just let me worry about your heart, mon amour.\u201d He yanked me from the lake in one fluid movement, swinging me onto the sloped shore; the soil sunk and shifted into a small mound between my toes; I scrunched them together, looking up at the knitted crown of yellow and green leaves. I felt so closed in, with low-lying shrubs and ferns at my feet and flowering vines covering nearly every other surface from floor to canopy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing under here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d David tucked his bunched-up shirt into the waistband of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in my own little cubby hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s very hidden here. No one can see us, not even if they were flying over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Comforting.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll take you to my favourite spot.\u201d</p><p>As we walked, my toes tangled in the carpet of loose-leafed clover. I lifted my feet a little higher with each step and placed them flat over the creepers, stabilising myself with my hand on the mossy tree trunks. It all smelled so moist, in a hot but dry kind of way.</p><p>\u201cJust watch out for these little terrors\u2014they\u2019ll give you a nasty scratch.\u201d David reached forward to shift the furry, silvery arm of a fern from our path.</p><p>\u201cSpeak from experience, do we?\u201d I said playfully.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He held it in place, dropping it softly back against the hip of the tree after I passed. \u201cMy brother and I used to play here as children.\u201d</p><p>I could actually picture that, too; little David, with a companion of exact look-alike, popping up above the bushes, pretending to shoot each other. \u201cI bet you were a cute little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStunning,\u201d he said, then pointed ahead. \u201cLook up there.\u201d</p><p>My eyes followed the vertical columns of maples to a deliciously colourful display of twisting climbers, shrouded with palm-sized purple and white flowers. \u201cWow. They look like purple cherry blossoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. It\u2019s okay. They\u2019re too high u\u2014\u201d</p><p>David grinned, then ran to the base of a tree trunk, took a small leap, wedging his foot against the bark, and plucked a flower from a vine six or seven feet off the ground. \u201cFor you,\u201d he said, landing back beside me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I sniffed its sour, grassy fragrance. And it was only as I tucked my hair back, placing the flower behind my ear, that I really noticed the vibrant songs of possibly thousands of different birds and small animals, chiming through the treetops like a symphony. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda noisy here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of noise I can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, my talking isn\u2019t?</p><p>He looked sideways at me; I turned my face to the front and kept walking\u2014well, shuffling, through the thick undergrowth.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to carry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I straightened the flower behind my ear. \u201cBut, how much further do we have to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to right...over...there.\u201d He pointed to a small circle of long grass, centre to a ring of tightly packed trees, with a single beam of sunlight making the busy movements of tiny insects look like sparkles. \u201cCome on.\u201d He took my hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you come here often?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot so much anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to come here to reflect on the miseries of my life.\u201d He kicked a few stones away from the grass and plonked down on his side. \u201cLast few weeks I haven\u2019t needed to.\u201d</p><p>I sat down, too, hugging my knees to keep the moist, tickly grass off the backs of my thighs. \u201cThis would be a great spot to bring a book.\u201d I could imagine that warm beam of sunlight overhead lighting the pages for me, just enough that I wouldn\u2019t need to squint. It made me wish I\u2019d brought one with me, but it was great just sitting here\u2014with David.</p><p>\u201cI have a box here, buried, where I keep books for when I visit unexpectedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBut, right now, it\u2019s great just sitting here.\u201d He sat up, resting his arms over his knees, leaning a little closer. \u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking that.\u201d I looked away from his ultra-cheeky grin. \u201cSometimes I feel like you steal my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s just the thing, I\u2019m starting to wonder if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d He held up a finger, his secret smile spreading across his face. \u201cI have a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA surprise, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d David offered me his hand, suddenly standing, when a second ago he so was not.</p><p>\u201cHey, how did you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He reached down and grasped my fingers, hoisting me off the ground. All protest stopped instantly with the feel of his smooth skin on the side of my face, my collarbones, and the back of my forearms as he directed them around his bare waist. Little bumps rose over my cheeks and across my shoulders, making me shiver, but not from cold, though. I\u2019d never felt them from touch, but I was sure\u2014</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d I rolled my face upward to smile at him, but the second I saw his tightly closed eyes and the ultra-still mask of concentration, it slipped away. \u201cDavid, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He opened his eyes for a second, winking at me before closing them again.</p><p>I exhaled a laugh, burying my face against the small hollow at the centre of his chest, where that sweet, kind of chocolaty smell dominated the powdery cologne under his arms. And my cheek felt moist suddenly, the heat of the day slipping past the canopy, making the air damp and almost hard to breathe. \u201cWow, it just got really hot,\u201d I said, looking up to see the rainfall I could hear all around us. But there was no rain, only the soft pattering sound.</p><p>\u201cStay calm, okay.\u201d David pressed one hand to my lower back, rolling my hips toward his, and the other to the base of my neck, forcing my face against his chest. My cheek squished up into my eye, making my lip jut out. I really hoped he didn\u2019t look down\u2014this was so not my sexy face.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I need to stay calm?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer; he just held me close, his eyes shut tight, his beautiful dark-pink lips, set perfectly into his golden brown skin, twitching. The pattering sound around us became louder then, drowned out for a second by a flock of birds bursting through the canopy above us\u2014colouring the sky in reds and greens. When silence fell over the island again as the birds disappeared, I saw something move from the corner of my eye, yanking my arm back when a light feathery touch brushed my skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d David said in a low voice. \u201cYou\u2019re safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, \u201cI just thought I felt a spider on my arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy love.\u201d He gently kissed the top of my head, tangling his fingers in my hair. \u201cLook up.\u201d</p><p>It took a second for my eyes to adjust, but as the blurry cloud of yellow and pale blue became the fluttering of hundreds of tiny wings, my mouth dropped. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d I watched in amazement, the cloud filling the space around us like pastel snow. \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything is possible.\u201d David smiled.</p><p>I smiled back and reached out as the glowing sun filtered down through the leaves, lighting the winged creatures in a soft, misty glow. They flitted across my skin with tiny silk kisses, forming a circle around us, like we were in some magical orb of nature. But the gem-like green of David\u2019s eyes stood out among the pale colours, as if he was backlit by the brightest star in the sky. His head turned, unlocking the hold of his gaze, and he nodded to the tip of my finger, held way up into the magic. I laughed, staying ultra still so as not to scare the blue and black butterfly there; it fluttered its wings for a single moment, before flying away.</p><p>\u201cDavid, this is so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my chin, pressing the tip of his nose to mine. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The heat stole my breath then, so humid and wet, but the distance of David\u2019s lips to mine, just enough to slip a finger between, made the air hotter, thicker, scented sweetly with the taste of his honey breath blowing against my tongue every time I breathed him in. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I had to let myself imagine the way his kiss would feel.</p><p>Then, the dream left my thoughts and touched reality. David\u2019s lips skimmed across the surface of mine, so softly, so hesitantly, coming to rest just in front of my mouth as he breathed for the both of us.</p><p>The world stopped. Every sound, every brush of air disappeared until only he and I existed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His fingers tightened on the small of my back, my dress lifting a little in his closed fist, then he pressed my spine, sweeping me onto my toes until our faces aligned\u2014lips finally touching. He kissed me deeply, drawing a breath so full it stole mine. I felt the wet soil and grass beneath my toes, the sweat trickling down my back, soaking into my dress, felt everything as if this one moment brought me to life, lit everything in stark contrast\u2014making it real, me real, him real, the world, somehow, a place I never thought existed.</p><p>He broke away for a single moment and slipped both hands along the sides of my face, pressing our lips together again after, hungrily catching my bottom lip against his, drawing it in, breaking only to release and drink it in again.</p><p>I had to open my eyes\u2014to savour this moment forever\u2014but while the kiss felt like a reality so stark it couldn\u2019t possibly become just a memory, when I looked up and the golden beams of sunlight shone through the cloud of butterflies, it felt more like a dream. This had to be a dream.</p> <p>With his hands pressed firmly to my cheeks, he gently drew my face away, smoothing his thumb over the moisture of his kiss. \u201cAre you happy here?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s only for the moment.\u201d I closed my eyes, resting both hands on his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019ll be gone soon. And I won\u2019t be happy anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will forget about me one day,\u201d he said in his soft, deep voice. \u201cI promise you that.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, David, I\u2019ll never forget you. I\u2019ll love you for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth quirked up. \u201cThat, my love, is what I\u2019m afraid of. Because I...will love you...until the end of time.\u201d He wrapped his fingers around my wrist, drawing my hand down until it rested over his heart, then, with his other hand, pressed my face into his chest again.</p> <p>We stood together in our timeless embrace and watched the miracle of life swarm around us for a while. But all it did to feel him so close was make me fall so much deeper in love with him\u2014so much that I was sure I\u2019d die when he went away.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>My fork scraped the plate where the absence of a potato mound left the ceramic bare. Even though I\u2019d managed to create something worthy of special mention in Art Weekly Magazine, I couldn\u2019t lift the heavy weight I\u2019d carried to the dinner table with me. I was losing David. He\u2019d be gone by winter and there was nothing I could do about it; not even a magical first kiss could save our happily ever after.</p><p>Our dreamy afternoon was followed by an intensely silent drive home, with me trying so hard not to burst into a snivelling, needy teenage girl, and when I walked through the front door, slammed it and readied myself to run upstairs and sob my heart out, Vicki called on me to help with dinner, forcing me to swallow my grief like a hard wedge of cheese.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>I looked up from my plate. \u201cHm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow was practice this afternoon?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>\u201cPractice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith David? The reason you left class today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, good. I\u2019m gonna perform a piece of music from a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean going to, not gonna,\u201d Dad added sternly.</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have your friends coming over this weekend, don\u2019t you? Emily and Alana?\u201d Vicki asked, taking the salt from Dad.</p><p>I nodded.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s your mythology paper coming along?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t good, though\u2014I hadn\u2019t even started it.</p><p>They all sat silently then, the feel of their stares burning into my face until Sam started laughing.</p><p>Dad looked at him with a raised brow. \u201cSomething funny, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra\u2019s in love,\u201d he teased.</p><p>I sat up straight, scowling at him. \u201cI am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. You wanna marry David.\u201d He laughed, poking his fingers in the air at me.</p><p>My cheeks went really hot. Dad looked at Vicki and a smile crept up under her lips. \u201cI think you\u2019re right, Sam.\u201d She pointed to my face. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that look before.\u201d</p><p>Okay, Dad, time to step in\u2014stand up for your only daughter. But Dad broke into laughter, too.</p><p>Traitor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey.\u201d He wiped his napkin across his mouth. \u201cBut I think your brother may be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered why you were suddenly so eager to go to school.\u201d Vicki covered her smile with her hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019d better have young David over for dinner\u2014discuss the dowry,\u201d Dad joked.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d I whined, hiding my face in my hands.</p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s taking you to the Fall Masquerade, then?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>I looked up. \u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Vicki heaped a spoonful of potato salad onto her plate. \u201cAra\u2019s never been to a masquerade, has she?\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cNo, she hasn\u2019t. Well, this\u2019ll be exciting then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what\u2019s the Fall Masquerade?\u201d I asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cEvery year, during fall, the town holds a masquerade for seniors\u2014like a school ball, but for the whole town,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou have to wear a mask and a giant dress\u2014totally lame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know what that means?\u201d Vicki squeaked. \u201cWe get to go shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, David hasn\u2019t asked me yet.\u201d And likely wouldn\u2019t be here. \u201cWhen is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll put posters up soon. It\u2019s usually held in early autumn,\u201d Dad added.</p><p>I smiled, thinking about the last ball I went to, which wasn't really a ball at all; it was an end of year formal, and my \u2018date\u2019 was my best friend, whom my mum actually had to pay to take me, because he thought wearing a penguin suit was an indication that you wanted to mate with an arctic bird. And since he didn\u2019t want to mate with me, he\u2019d told my mum, it was going to cost her. We had fun, though, Mike and I, but the formal was no masquerade.</p><p>Then, almost as if Dad read my mind, he asked, \u201cWhen\u2019s Mike coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, his interview is next Monday, so he\u2019ll be here on the Tuesday some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does David feel about that?\u201d Vicki asked in an evocative, feather-ruffling tone.</p><p>My shoulders dropped. \u201cDavid? Why would he care about my best friend coming to stay?\u201d</p><p>Vicki\u2019s expression suggested the obvious; she didn\u2019t even have to speak.</p><p>My lip curled. \u201cDavid doesn\u2019t see it like that. He knows Mike\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll just see, won\u2019t we?\u201d She rolled her head to the side. \u201cAra, sometimes a girl as young as you can misinterpret things, see them as more innocent than they really are. Mike\u2019s a fully-grown man\u2014\u201d She placed the salad back on the table, \u201c\u2014maybe he feels differently about you than you do about him.\u201d</p><p>Dad just sat there, saying nothing. My mouth hung open a little; I couldn\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t correct her. Betrayal. Again.</p><p>I threw my napkin down and stood up. \u201cMike and I are friends. That\u2019s all it\u2019s ever been!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, sit back down. Vicki knows that,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad! I\u2019m tired of it. Just because Mike\u2019s a boy and I\u2019m a girl?\u201d I pointed to my chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you guys get it? Don\u2019t you understand what David means to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019ve known him for a week,\u201d Dad reminded me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and that was enough to make me fall in love with him,\u201d I retorted. \u201cBut seventeen years didn\u2019t work for Mike? So what\u2019s gonna change now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a point.\u201d Sam shrugged.</p><p>I looked at Dad and he looked at Vicki. \u201cAra, you\u2019re so young. This thing with David\u2014it\u2019s just an infatuation. You can\u2019t know what love is yet,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d I leaned forward slightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I feel. None of you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you can\u2019t feel that kind of love at your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know? I\u2019m sorry, are you the all experienced love gurus because you\u2019ve both had a failed marriage?\u201d I waved my hands around at the word gurus, then dropped them to my hips. \u201cSo, just because I\u2019m under eighteen, means I don\u2019t know how to feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just saying that love is complicated,\u201d Dad said and held his hand up to Vicki, quietening her. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t know my own heart. \u2019Cause I can tell you, I do\u2014and it hurts.\u201d My voice broke under the strain of tears. \u201cIt hurts all the time, Dad. It hurts for Mum and Harry and Mike. And I loved them. And I love you\u2014\u201d the tears burst past the strain, \u201c\u2014so, you can\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t know what love is, because I think, of all the people in this room, I\u2019m the most qualified to say what my heart is capable of.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s jaw fell open and Vicki looked at her salad. Sam hovered between standing and sitting.</p><p>\u201cWell, Ara\u2014\u201d Vicki placed her fork on her plate and folded her fingers in front of her chin, \u201c\u2014do you feel better now you\u2019ve effectively displayed your maturity in front of your fourteen-year-old brother?\u201d</p><p>My arms fell to my sides. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d had enough\u2014just about all a girl could take. I watched them all\u2014waiting for me to respond. But I had no response. Of course I didn\u2019t feel better. What a stupid question to ask. \u201cHow you think I feel, Vicki?\u201d My chair fell over and hit the wall as I pushed it out with the backs of my legs and ran from the room.</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Dad said calmly as I thudded up the stairs, holding my forearm across the ache in my gut. I couldn\u2019t stop it; it all wanted to come out\u2014all the fear, the heartbreak, the grief. I knew too well what I felt for David; knew no one could understand it; knew it was crazy. And I knew, if losing everyone I loved so far hadn\u2019t killed me, loving David would.</p><p>I slammed my bedroom door unintentionally hard, sending vibrations through the house, making my open window rattle. Then, with a wailing breath, slid down the door and sat on the ground, hugging my knees to my chest\u2014making myself as small as possible. I couldn\u2019t breathe\u2014couldn\u2019t even find a good enough reason to breathe. I wanted to go home. Just wanted to go back and make it all okay again. But I couldn\u2019t, and I was so tired of losing people\u2014so tired of hurting to the point where crying just seemed pointless. It never helped. Tears or none, nothing ever changed. I just wished I could figure out what horrid crime I committed in a past life and atone for it, so maybe this life wouldn\u2019t suck so much.</p><p>Outside, the sunlight turned orange and the soft yellow glow that filled my room earlier slipped away with an empty blackness. My nose went cold and my cheeks numb and, after a while, an eerie rumble of thunder growled as a flash of white scorched the sky for a split second, then disappeared.</p><p>I stayed motionless in my nightmare life, listening to the quiet patter of rainfall that crept into my world under the cover of night\u2014afraid to move, afraid to cry anymore in case the brooding storm should find me here.</p><p>The familiar sound of doors being locked into place and lights flicked off around the house filled the wordless evening with noise. My parents\u2019 footsteps thudded up the stairs and, while the lighter ones continued down the hall, the heavy ones stopped by my door. I sunk my face into crossed arms, holding my breath. Please don\u2019t come in, Dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Vicki whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know. I just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Vicki said softly.</p><p>The footsteps faded to the other end of the house and silence swept over the night once more as Dad\u2019s bedroom door closed. My real mum would\u2019ve told him to check on me\u2014to open the door anyway and make sure I was all right. She would\u2019ve followed him in, warming the sudden unwelcome chill in here, and she would\u2019ve told me not to be silly. Told me to get up off the floor and get into bed; that when I woke in the morning, everything would seem clear again. And a part of me knew that, but not having her here to say it made the pain, made missing her, so much worse.</p><p>As I lifted my head and considered climbing into bed, a low rumble rolled across the roof, like a hundred horses running past on hard ground, the noise electrifying the skies with silver forks. It was almost as if the storm had lain dormant, building, waiting for my family to go to bed. I covered my head, crying into my knees. I had nowhere to hide\u2014no one to cuddle up safely beside. I was too old to climb into bed with Dad and Vicki now, and too far away from the phone on the other side of the room, in front of my open window, to call Mike.</p><p>I counted the seconds between the thunder, sliding my hands up the wood of the door, edging stiffly to my feet. Then, as soon as it struck and grew silent again, I ran, wedged my fingers onto the top of the wooden frame and slammed my window shut\u2014drawing the curtains together before the next strike of lightning. It hit as I turned away, making me squeal and trip all over myself to get away from the window; I fell into my stool, climbing onto it, and leaned my head on my hands against the dresser.</p><p>With the curtains closed, the darkness of my room swallowed up my reflection\u2014mirroring back only the outline of my head, shoulders and, as the lightning flashed again, the image of my mother\u2014smiling down at the tiny baby in her arms. I lifted the photo frame from the dresser and kissed them both, then wiped away the smudge my lips left on the glass. This was my favourite photo. My only photo. I so clearly remembered the day I took it; Harry, who was about two months old, had just been bathed, and my mum\u2014I ran my fingers over her face\u2014wrapped him safely in a towel. Then, when she looked down at him again, I took the shot, capturing the exact moment she saw her baby\u2019s first real smile. This was how I wanted to remember them, but at night, when I closed my eyes, it was the last seconds I ever saw them that flashed into my dreams\u2014making the smiles and the sunlight fade from nearly every memory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Resting my bare forearms on the wood of the dresser, cold and exhausted from all the crying, I dropped my head between my hands and let the warm, salty tears fall over my nose and drip away. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mum,\u201d I whispered to nothing. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>My crystals lashed against the window frame as the gloomy sky shoved its way into my morning, blowing papers around in the remains of the tsunami that hit my desk last night. I sat up on my elbows and looked down at the quilt covering my still fully dressed self then over at the shoes laid out neatly by my bedroom door, as if I was entering a dojo.</p><p>Great, I thought, flopping back, pulling the blankets over my head. So, I\u2019ve finally gone insane enough to put things away neatly while sleepwalking myself into bed.</p> <p>\u201cAra-Rose. Time to get up.\u201d Vicki banged on my door, making me jump.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up,\u201d I called, throwing my covers back. I wandered over and shut my window on the stormy day, drawing the curtains across, then slumped in my desk chair with a loud groan. All my homework was ruined\u2014every little bit. I tried to separate the dry pages from the wet ones, but dropped them all with a huff of defeat. It was no use; I\u2019d have to start all over again.</p><p>I propped my head against my hand, my elbow on the desk. Time had escaped me. I\u2019d be late for school if I didn\u2019t get my act together, but I just didn\u2019t feel like being a part of the world. Everything in my life that was once worth living for was now gone, or thousands of miles on the other side of the world. After months of trying so hard to keep it together, to be normal and move on, I\u2019d finally had enough. I couldn\u2019t think of one good reason to get dressed.</p><p>From under my pile of class literature, I slid out my diary and opened it. Last night\u2019s rain missed most of my books, thankfully, but the corner of my diary got a bit wet\u2014well, soggy was a better word.</p><p>It cracked as I opened it and turned to a blank page. The fading smell of home lingered in its binding, slowly being washed away by ageing and the sticky, inky smell of a blue pen.</p> <p>So many thoughts had been written down in here from times when everything was okay\u2014and not so okay. I fanned the edges with my thumb, considering a flip back through memory lane, but thought better. Before I knew grief, my problems were so mediocre, so unimportant. I don\u2019t think I could stand to hear myself drone on about my hopeless thoughts on boys or friends who wouldn\u2019t talk to me after a fight. Back then, I was so narrow-minded, so na\u00efve and ignorant to the world. I think it\u2019d just make me wanna throw up\u2014or slap myself.</p><p>I grabbed a pen from my drawer and leaned over the diary, expelling every twisted, deranged and ludicrous thought in my head. The one word that stood out, though, as I read back over it, was Dad. Somewhere inside me, I still wondered if David was some hired-help my dad called on to make me okay, and now that I was okay, David had to give some lame-ass excuse to leave. Bad thing was, I wouldn\u2019t put it past my dad to do that. And even if that wasn\u2019t the case, it didn\u2019t matter. I felt awful last night; I had never cried so much and I never, ever wanted to again. David had his nature-documentary timeline, and that was fine. But I didn\u2019t have to put up with it. If he really had to leave in the winter, then he could go, but I wouldn\u2019t let him destroy my heart on the way out.</p><p>I snapped my diary shut and stood up. I had to end it now.</p><p>With a new sense of purpose, I jammed my iPod into the dock and blasted my Girl Power playlist. If I was going to take a new approach to life, then I\u2019d need a montage\u2014and a sexy outfit.</p><p>I sang along, making a huge mess as I pulled nearly everything out of the neat little crevices in my wardrobe, then tossed my jeans, red tank top, and the only heeled shoes I owned into the bathroom. Then, in true montage style, shut the bathroom door and emerged again as the new, sexy, I-don\u2019t-take-no-crap me\u2014complete with red lip-gloss.</p><p>I stopped by my dresser to dash on some mascara, and the soulless face of my past stared back at me. \u201cDon\u2019t pout,\u201d I said to her. \u201cWe\u2019re breaking up with him, and that\u2019s that!\u201d</p> <p>The front door slammed a little as I stepped out onto the porch, and, okay, so that didn\u2019t feel so good, but the new me wanted it to. And she walked fiercely toward the roadside, her head down, eyes away from what she knew was waiting there. Then, as the montage music ended with an abrupt and sudden silence inside my head, I looked up at him, and my resolve wavered; he sat on a tree stump, his head in his hands, bag on the ground by his feet, forcing an ache in my heart.</p><p>But the new me in the heeled shoes stood taller, gave a not-so-gentle reminder of why we were doing this, and screamed, No more David Knight.</p><p>He stood up as I crossed the street, his eyes practically bulging from his head. \u201cAra? My God, you look amazing.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged away from his touch, nearly falling backward as the heels of my pretty black shoes, so out of place on the thick turf, sunk into the ground.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d His eyes narrowed, studying my face. \u201cDon\u2019t. I know what you\u2019re going to say. Please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, David, it\u2019s better this way.\u201d The words felt like shards of glass in my throat. \u201cLook, yesterday was great and all, but we both know where this is going. I don\u2019t see the point in dragging it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDragging it out?\u201d His shoulders came forward with his words. \u201cWe love each other, Ara\u2014spending our last few months together is not, by any means, dragging things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is to me. You\u2019re the one leaving\u2014you don\u2019t have to care, you don\u2019t have to suffer like I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d He stepped into me; I stepped back, raising my hands. \u201cAra, you know nothing about what I will suffer for leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t. Because you never tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. Don\u2019t you understand that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I? Why can\u2019t you just be honest with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know\u2014you told me you don\u2019t want to hear about my dark world!\u201d</p><p>I shuffled my feet, folding then unfolding my arms. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m ready now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect that. He doubled back a little, rubbing his head. \u201cThere are so many things, Ara. I wouldn\u2019t know where to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow \u2018bout the reason you\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d The words hung just on the exit of his lips; I tensed. \u201cI...I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can forget me staying friends with you.\u201d I turned away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of what you\u2019ll think of me,\u201d he said, and I stopped walking. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, because I know how sweet you are, how, despite what you think about yourself, how kind and loving and warm you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think I can\u2019t handle the truth?\u201d</p><p>He smiled softly. \u201cI know you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I looked away, breathing out.</p><p>\u201cLook, we have a few months left. I just want you like this\u2014my sweet, beautiful girl who loves me; who looks at me like I\u2019m good. I couldn\u2019t bear it if you hated me, Ara. I can\u2019t bear this\u2014\u201d he motioned to the distance between us. \u201cPlease don\u2019t break up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fall more in love with you.\u201d I forced back tears. \u201cIf I keep doing this, it\u2019ll only make me break down when you\u2019re gone\u2014and I won\u2019t get back up this time. I\u2019ve got nothing left in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ara. Please don\u2019t say things like that.\u201d I heard it in his voice, the way my words crushed him. \u201cAll I ever wanted was for you to be okay again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well\u2014\u201d I looked right into him, making sure my words hit the deepest part of his heart. \u201cNow you\u2019re the one breaking me.\u201d</p><p>He folded over, propping his hands to his knees.</p><p>\u201cBye, David,\u201d I turned away. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t talk to me if we pass each other in the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really mean that, Ara?\u201d His voice travelled across the distance effortlessly, carrying the entire weight of his confusion.</p><p>God no.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>My feet froze, no longer driven by the anger, and as I spun around to meet his emerald green gaze, my resolve slipped completely. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, David. I\u2019m just trying to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you should fight! If you really love me, you should fight for us\u2014to be together until the end\u2014until they drag me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m tired of fighting.\u201d I looked down. \u201cMaybe I just need to trust that the people I love will be with me. Forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. Please, look at me?\u201d he asked smoothly, his voice dropping on the end.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my lowered head.</p><p>\u201cAra, you have to trust me; you have to believe that I will only ever do what\u2019s best for you. Me leaving, keeping you free from my world, it\u2019s what\u2019s best. You can\u2019t see that now, but if you were to know the truth, you\u2019d see it then.\u201d</p><p>I bit my teeth together in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cPlease just give me you\u2014just give me this girl I love, just for a few more months. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not strong enough to keep loving you, knowing I have to let you go. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? What? You have the strength to walk away, but not to stay and fight?\u201d His hands went back into his pockets.</p><p>\u201cWould it do any good? To fight? And for what? For a guy who loves me enough to leave me for my own good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how right you are.\u201d He looked down, shaking his head.</p><p>I stood for a long time, watching him watching me. \u201cWhy is this so hard for you? You and my dad planned this\u2014you never really felt any of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting me down gently.\u201d I searched his face for proof. \u201cYou promised him you\u2019d make me okay again, and maybe you fell in love with me in the process, but then you realised, didn\u2019t you, that I\u2019m never going to change, that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe that? Do you really think I would do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a nice guy, David. But this\u2014\u201d I held my hands out, presenting me, \u201c\u2014this is a lot for anyone to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He reached for me again.</p><p>I pulled away. \u201cJust stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What you just said\u2014it\u2019s not true. I never made any deal with your dad. I love you. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, does it?\u201d I said drily. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving, whether you love me or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. What can I do? Please.\u201d He stepped closer, his hands out, wanting to grab me. \u201cPlease just...just tell me how to fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d I turned away. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hand shot out and he spun me into his chest by my arm. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you go that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Using the tops of my forearms, I pushed his hands off me. \u201cJust like I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoice, huh? So, you want a choice?\u201d he called; I kept walking. \u201cI could tell you why I can\u2019t stay\u2014I could give you a choice, but you won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut at least it would be on my own shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what then?\u201d He grabbed my arm again, stopping me. \u201cWhat if you hate me after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I do. Because it\u2019ll make losing you so much easier.\u201d</p><p>His mouth hung open, his body thrusting forward slightly with each breath. \u201cI will die inside\u2014if you hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, someone gets hurt.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll tell you\u2014because I would die a thousand deaths to save you from the pain of a paper cut, Ara. But I can\u2019t tell you here. Not now.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed, shaking my head. \u201cRight. You can tell me, but not today, huh? Same old story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, will you stop acting like a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You know what?\u201d I rolled my hip back, sinking my hand onto it. \u201cMaybe you should just do us both a favour and leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d he called as I walked away. \u201cWhy do you light your own fuse?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Ara?\u201d He came up behind me, inhumanly fast, and grabbed my arm, releasing it quickly when I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cI said, leave me alone. I am not your little toy, David. And I\u2019m so tired of being in pain.\u201d He backed up as I walked slowly forward, poking his chest. \u201cYou know what your secrets are; you know me\u2014know how I\u2019ll react. Do you even need to tell me? Really?\u201d</p><p>He stood taller, his hands falling to his side.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so. Just go, okay. Just leave me to get over you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth hung open, tongue between teeth and lip. \u201cYou said you were ready to hear. You said you were ready to know my dark world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I looked over at the school. \u201cMaybe that was the anger talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what now?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hate you, David. I don\u2019t want to know if I\u2019ll hate you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do I do?\u201d</p><p>It was clear; there was only one thing he could do. I nodded, preparing myself. \u201cJust leave.\u201d</p><p>He rolled back on his heels, eyes focusing on some black pit of nothingness. \u201cLeave?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. Just go now,\u201d I said, and despite the invisible strings tying my heart\u2014trying to make me move toward him\u2014I forced myself to turn away, leaving everything behind.</p><p>When I took one last glance backward, David was gone.</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d Ryan called, running toward me at full speed.</p> <p>I quickly swiped the tears away, forcing a smile. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He stopped running and looked at my cheeks. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, sniffling. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? You look\u2014\u201d I looked at his eyes, how red they were. \u201cHave you been crying?\u201d</p><p>He put his hands on his hips, panting, folding over a little. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNathan Rossi.\u201d He caught his breath. \u201cHe passed away early this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d I covered my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI gotta find David. You seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p><p>Ryan shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know. That\u2019s just it\u2014he was closer to Nathan than any of us. We\u2019re worried \u2018cause no one\u2019s seen him today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d I said. I just broke his heart.</p> <p>\u201cDid he say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never gave him the chance.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to himself, his hands still on his hips. \u201cDid you have a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d The stench of his sweat wafted up when he put his arm around me. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the office\u2014get you a tardy slip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Emily sat with her hands wedged under her knees, her legs swinging over the edge of the stage, trying to talk through the sobs. I wandered down the aisle silently, hugging my sheet music, trying not to disturb her quiet speech.</p> <p>\u201cIf he was here right now, he\u2019d probably slap us on the shoulder and tell us to get up\u2014that the show must go on.\u201d She sniffed, wiping her face softly with a tissue. \u201cI know it\u2019s been a hard day, and\u2014\u201d she motioned around the room, \u201c\u2014most of us have gone home. But, Nathan\u2019s gone, and...I know this whole thing started out as a way to help his mom with the hospital bills, but now she\u2019s got a funeral bill on top...of...that.\u201d Her voice broke. Ryan leaped up and sat on the stage, wrapping his arm over her shoulder. \u201cSo\u2014\u201d she composed herself, \u201c\u2014having said that, rehearsals will continue and so will the show, as a memorial concert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re not doing it this week, right?\u201d someone in the front row asked.</p><p>Emily shook her head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to. Any votes on when we should hold it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d a boy said. \u201cWeekend after next. The funeral\u2019s this Thursday, so...\u201d he let his voice trail off.</p><p>Emily looked around the rest of the group. \u201cEveryone agree with that?\u201d</p><p>People shrugged or nodded. Emily looked at me, and I smiled, bringing one shoulder up to my ear.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, two weekends from now. And we\u2019ll need to draw up new ticket sale signs\u2014if you guys can take care of that?\u201d She nodded toward the art students; they nodded back. \u201cOkay. So, thanks for coming, everybody, and\u2014\u201d she stood up, \u201c\u2014let\u2019s get this show on the road.\u201d</p><p>The small group disbursed, murmuring between themselves, while Ryan walked Emily off stage and talked to her quietly at the base for a second. She nodded, wiped her face, then hugged him tightly and walked away.</p><p>\u201cHey, Em,\u201d I said, deliberately avoiding how are you or I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara. Where\u2019s David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Ryan tell you?\u201d We slid into the end seats on the front row.</p><p>\u201cMm. No. What happened?\u201d Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>I just shattered him to pieces. \u201cHe uh\u2014he left school for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She slid down in her seat, folding her fingertips over her eyes. \u201cI feel like such an idiot for crying at school. I wish I\u2019d left, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Em\u2014don\u2019t. It\u2019s not silly at all. Hell, even I\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She sat up a little.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I hugged my music sheets.</p><p>\u201cWell, why? Was someone mean to you?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the theatrical kiss thing\u2014with David, the toilets, my first day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah\u2014Summer and that short girl she hangs around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cSummer was telling us the whole story, you know, that afternoon.\u201d Emily leaned back in her chair. \u201cNo one believed her, though\u2014about David kissing you. I wouldn\u2019t have if you hadn\u2019t told me about it in History class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is it so hard to believe David would kiss me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed once. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what we didn\u2019t believe; it was how Summer said he was doing it to stand up for you. David doesn\u2019t stand up for anybody,\u201d she added with a hint of spite.</p><p>\u201cHe stood up for the Apple King, at lunch that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it seems you\u2019ve unearthed a new David.\u201d She looked down at her hands, flipping her silver padlock bracelet. \u201cSo\u2014he went home, huh?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does this, you know?\u201d She smiled sympathetically. \u201cIf things get too...emotional, he takes off for a few days. But, he\u2019ll be at the funeral on Thursday. I\u2019m sure you can speak to him then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, what if it wasn\u2019t because of Nathan that he left? What if it was for some other reason? Would he still come back for the funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other reason would he have?\u201d she asked, smiling at Spencer as he walked past; he didn\u2019t smile back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with Spence?\u201d I asked. \u201cWas he close to Nathan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You saw that, huh? The quick-look-away thing he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Does he do that a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time I look at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think it\u2019s \u2018cause he doesn\u2019t like you?\u201d I tried to stifle a giggle.</p><p>\u201cIt must be. Why would he do it if he liked me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Emily\u2014\u201d I shoved my notes on the chair and stood up, \u201c\u2014he\u2019s a guy. They\u2019re more afraid of you than you are of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d she squeaked. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I ignored her, walking over to Ryan, Alana and Spencer. My brilliant idea of setting Emily up with Mike was about to go out the window...</p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara.\u201d Alana leaned a little closer. \u201cI was thinking...about the sleepover this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, could we...maybe move it to next weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Saturday before the concert?\u201d I confirmed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. With the funeral this week...\u201d She nodded at Emily, sitting low in her chair, staring at her feet. \u201cMight be a bit much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s cool. Next week\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Ara?\u201d Ryan asked. \u201cAre you coming to the wake at Betty\u2019s on Thursday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI um\u2014I didn\u2019t know about it. Why is Mrs Rossi doing it there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not,\u201d Ryan said, placing his arm around Alana. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bunch of us kids fare-welling Nathan in our own way. Betty\u2019s was his favourite burger joint\u2014we figure it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. Well, that sounds cool. I guess I\u2019ll try, but I may have to go to Mrs Rossi\u2019s with my dad, you know\u2014pay my respects as a family.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI get it. Totally cool. If we see you there, we see you there,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cHey, so, you two are going together, right?\u201d I asked Alana and Ryan.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why don\u2019t you take Emily, Spence? I know she needs a ride,\u201d I lied, hoping he wouldn\u2019t pick up on the fact that I couldn\u2019t know that, since I didn\u2019t even know about the wake before now.</p><p>Spencer smiled over at Emily\u2014looking away before she looked up.</p><p>Hopefully, this was one match that\u2019d work out well.</p><p>Grief struck the school like a tidal wave; the teachers cancelled homework for the week, and even my dad, when I woke up this morning and begged him not to make me go to school, just sighed and said, \u201cFine, stay home\u2014but just for today.\u201d</p><p>I froze on the spot, watching him walk away, half expecting him to turn back and say he was joking. But Dad wasn\u2019t his usual self; I think the grief of losing his ex-wife and a student in the same year was taking its toll.</p><p>There was no point in going to school, anyway. David wouldn\u2019t be there, and I couldn\u2019t bear the emptiness surrounding that place without him. I only stayed at school yesterday for the small glimmer of hope that he might decide to come back. He didn\u2019t. Instead, he had inflicted on me a foul taste of what life without him would be like, and already I couldn\u2019t take it.</p><p>Sam stacked the last of the dinner plates on the counter beside the sink, and I flicked on the faucet to help wash the scraps down the ancient garbage disposal. There were an awful lot of leftovers tonight.</p><p>When the clock in the front entrance chimed seven, I sighed. The anticipation to possibly see David tomorrow\u2014possibly tell him I was sorry, and maybe even tell him I\u2019d take that last few months with him\u2014made the day drag. I spent the better part of it out on my swing, just wishing he\u2019d come by; even contemplated throwing the cat up in the tree just to entice him. And if I knew where he lived, I\u2019d have gone over\u2014without invitation.</p><p>My ears pricked to the sound of Dad and Vicki\u2019s footsteps overhead. It was unusually empty in this house tonight; no TV buzzing from the lounge room, no laughter from Dad as he told Vicki about his day, and Sam, who normally tossed the forks in the air and caught them behind his back, dried them slowly and placed them quietly in the drawer. All the silence gave me too much time alone with my thoughts\u2014never a good thing.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Ara?\u201d Sam said.</p><p>I jumped back from the sink, flicking the faucet off as water spilled over the edge, soaking my tank top. \u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight wanna clean that up before Dad sees,\u201d Sam said, drying a plate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just water, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...you don\u2019t want him asking how it happened, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I asked, mopping it up with the floor mat.</p><p>\u201cYou were...pretty spaced out there for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to flip, Sam.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cI know everyone\u2019s waiting for it, but I\u2019m okay, really. Really!\u201d</p><p>He took a long step sideways\u2014away from the crazy person\u2014and continued drying the dishes, wearing the same smug grin he always wore when he thought he had the upper hand.</p><p>That\u2019s it! I dipped my fingertips into the sink then flicked dishwater all over his head.</p><p>\u201cArgh, Ara!\u201d He blinked, wiping his face, and when he looked up at me, revenge burning in his gaze, that little prank suddenly seemed like a better idea in theory. \u201cOh, you\u2019re gonna pay for that.\u201d He held the tea towel an arms length away, spinning it in circles to make a long, twisted snake.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. No. Don\u2019t you dare!\u201d I warned, with the pointed finger of authority.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s gonna stop me?\u201d He flicked the back of my leg with the towel.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d I squealed, running around the island counter to out-manoeuvre him. No good\u2014he took a head shot. \u201cHey, no fair, keep it below the knees,\u201d I yelled, running toward the front entrance, then bolted up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cCome back and I\u2019ll make it quick.\u201d He thudded up behind me.</p><p>As the towel came at me again, I slammed my bedroom door\u2014catching the end of it in the doorframe. Sam laughed boisterously, trying to pull it out.</p><p>\u201cTold you I\u2019m faster, Samuel,\u201d I called through the door. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, you two,\u201d Dad said in his booming voice.</p><p>\u201cBut, Dad\u2014\u201d Sam started.</p><p>\u201cI said enough! Now get back down and finish your chores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>In the hall, Sam sighed loudly. The tea towel made a grating sound before releasing from the door with a short, dull thud. \u201cWhy does the princess always get her own way? It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove it, Sam,\u201d Dad finished.</p><p>I tensed, waiting for him to yell at me\u2014to force me downstairs where I\u2019d get my butt whopped as soon as he walked away, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, he walked down the stairs and closed the front door, obviously having gone out it. I opened my door to check, hearing the car start up, and felt suddenly really bad for mucking about with Sam.</p><p>\u201cDid Dad just go out?\u201d Vicki asked, coming out from the spare room.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. I think Sam and I might\u2019ve upset him.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the front door. \u201cI doubt that, Ara-Rose. He\u2019s just...He\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019s just been a big year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d I closed my door before I could see the tears I heard in her voice, and wandered over to sit at my desk. Under the charcoal sky of the coming night outside, the oak tree rustled lightly in the breeze, and the swing, hovering low over the soft grass, swayed gently\u2014almost as if a small, invisible child were rocking back and forth on it. Along the sidewalk, a group of kids ran noisily past our block, dragging a red wagon behind them. Their laughter filled the night until they disappeared down the street, leaving an eerie stillness behind them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It amazed me how a second of distraction could make everything seem less empty, not quite so lonely, and when it was gone, the mere silence you were lost in before felt more like a vortex of desolation. Just like with David, I suppose; he came into my life when I was numb inside and, without him, I felt like I was dead.</p><p>And that was exactly why I had to let him go. Knowing the grief he\u2019d suffer for losing Nathan made me soft; made me think about taking him back. But that would do me no good at all. Time heals, David told me once, and if that was true, then time needed to start now. The sooner I let him out of my heart, the sooner I\u2019d move on.</p><p>Tomorrow, at sunrise, I\u2019d go running for the first time since I lost them\u2014feel the fresh air on my face in the early morning, just as I used to every day with Mike, back home in Australia. Vicki would think I was okay again, Dad would be happy I\u2019d left my mum and Harry in the past, and I would run. Nothing more. Run, until everything that hurt in my heart and my soul moved to the edges of my limbs, into my knees and my lungs, and I would leave it there. Leave the pain\u2014leave the sorrow. Leave David.</p> <p>When we saw each other at the funeral, he wouldn\u2019t know me. I could play a different Ara. I could stand strong\u2014smile. I would smile. If only for a second, just to nod toward him, while in my mind I\u2019d be saying goodbye.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cDad, you look nice,\u201d my voice trailed up as I set eyes upon my suit-wearing father, coming out of his room.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ara.\u201d He nodded solemnly.</p><p>It hurt to hear his voice sounding so flat and sad. \u201cYou okay, Dad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Hey, um, Dad?\u201d I said as he started walking away. \u201cIs this dress okay for a funeral?\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted tightly as he studied my mournful black attire: a soft cotton dress, with a burgundy belt around the waist. \u201cAra, are you sure you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d</p><p>I frowned up at him. \u201cFor a funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s just that\u2014it\u2019s barely been two months, honey.\u201d His eyes held obvious memory of my mother. \u201cAre you sure you can cope with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m actually not sure about anything anymore. But I want to go\u2014for Emily and...David.\u201d His name stuck in my throat.</p> <p>Dad nodded, but didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>The clock on the wall at the base of the stairs chimed eight. The funeral wasn\u2019t until nine o\u2019clock, but Mrs Rossi asked my dad and his family to attend a church service beforehand. Unfortunately, he agreed.</p><p>\u201cHad breakfast?\u201d Dad asked, heading down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I lied. I knew I should sit at the table and eat with him\u2014maybe even have a coffee to help ease the chill in my skin from my early morning run, but he was better than anyone at seeing through my mask; I wasn\u2019t okay. I wasn\u2019t ready to see a coffin or see people crying. But I had to see David one last time before he was gone from my life forever.</p><p>I sat at the base of the stairs, hugging the post, listening to the calm of the house; the way the smell of toast could make everything seem kind of okay. My hunger pangs grew, twisting my gut into knots. But instead of eating, I watched my father with a careful eye\u2014resting his chin on interlaced fingers, staring out at the white glare of the morning. I wondered where his thoughts were\u2014where his heart was. He said so little about what he felt or how he was coping, that watching him, seeing him look so sad and distracted, came as a bit of a shock.</p><p>\u201cAll set to go, are we?\u201d Vicki asked, coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you eat?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, resting my head against the post after.</p><p>\u201cVicki.\u201d Dad smiled at her adoringly as he came in from the kitchen. \u201cYou look lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Greg.\u201d She straightened the front of her skirt. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry for the occasion.\u201d</p><p>Dad nodded, and the sadness stole the smile from his blue eyes.</p><p>Vicki did look nice in black, but it seemed like such an unfriendly colour, almost cruel really, to say goodbye to someone in. If my last memory were of my funeral, I\u2019d want to see everyone dressed in colours\u2014to celebrate my life, instead of mourn it.</p><p>\u201cSam, you ready?\u201d Vicki called.</p><p>\u201cOne minute, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry up. We\u2019ll be in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Dad grabbed the keys and Vicki shouldered her purse, and as she pulled the front door open, my breath stopped short of my lips. The cool morning air blew across my knees, sending a chill through my skin, and the sun reflected brightly off the damp black road outside, like a spotlight\u2014blinding me. But my eyes did not betray me, displaying perfection before them. \u201cDavid?\u201d my dad said cheerfully. \u201cYou\u2019re right on time.\u201d</p><p>Right on time?</p><p>David stood in the doorway with one hand in the pocket of his tailored black suit as he shook my dad\u2019s with the other. \u201cGood to see you again, Mr Thompson, Mrs Thompson.\u201d He nodded politely at Dad, then Vicki, and turned his head to look directly at me.</p><p>I was shrinking. I could feel it. I wanted to close my mouth, wipe the dumbfounded stare off my face, but I really loved David too much to hide the elation in my soul. He looked so damn perfect. There was no way I\u2019d be able to control my emotions now.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Ara,\u201d he said in that smooth, weightless voice.</p><p>\u201cUm...hi,\u201d I said, and my eyes fell to the floor. I didn\u2019t want to see him standing there, looking at me like nothing ever happened between us\u2014like we were just friends.</p><p>\u201cUh, Ara?\u201d Dad broke the lengthy silence. \u201cSince you kids are having your own wake at Betty\u2019s, I thought you might like to ride in with David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you assumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Vicki gasped.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s right, Vicki,\u201d Dad said softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey. I did think it would be okay.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms, biting my teeth together. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this; I was supposed to see him from afar\u2014supposed to prepare myself for talking to him. Nobody seemed to care about my trying to move forward. I went jogging today! Jogging! Wasn\u2019t that enough? Dad had just single-handedly destroyed all the resolve I had to let David go. Well, I wasn\u2019t going to stand by and let them conspiratorially send me to a mental institution. I could handle this. I\u2019d dealt with worse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just see you there then.\u201d David looked at me once then turned stiffly away.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t go. I said you should have checked with me first.\u201d</p><p>David stopped.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ara.\u201d Dad patted my arm. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that for next time.\u201d</p><p>I took off, skulking along behind David, arms still folded, piercing his soul with eyes like daggers when he opened the car door for me. \u201cI can get the door myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He took a step back. \u201cI know you can. I was...\u201d</p><p>I pushed past him and slumped into the passenger seat, shutting the door on whatever he was going to say.</p><p>In the silence, while Dad talked to David by the mailbox, the woodsy, lemony smell of his seats stirred the memory of our picnic by the lake\u2014making my stomach growl again, spreading the familiar weak and shaky feeling through my arms. I looked over at Dad, his hand on David\u2019s shoulder, with Vicki jumping in to touch his arm. It was nice of them to just leave me sitting here, in the heat, waiting.</p><p>David glanced back at me, just for a second, then shook my dad\u2019s hand, jerking his head in my direction. I saw Dad\u2019s mouth move, breaking into a grin; I knew they were laughing at my bad mood\u2014they always did. No one cared to ask what was wrong. All they cared about was that my sulking was something funny to laugh at.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d David slid into the car, closing the door on a roll of thunder.</p><p>I cleared my throat and looked out the window. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I muttered\u2014just to shut him up.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you could\u2019ve said no.\u201d He started the engine. \u201cI didn\u2019t force you to come in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve said no, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad asked me. What was I supposed to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d I refolded my arms for good measure and glared at my parents as we pulled down the drive.</p><p>By the time the church came into focus on the distant horizon, the silence in the car had evolved into a big fat cloud of tension. I just wanted to hurry up and get there, but David was driving much more carefully and a hell of a lot slower than ever before.</p><p>When the car finally pulled up in a parking space, my door swung open, David offering his hand before I even saw him pull the key from the ignition.</p><p>\u201cGod! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looked ultimately confused.</p><p>\u201cYou keep popping up\u2014like, way too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, I didn\u2019t. I swear. You must have blacked out, sweetheart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d Ignoring his offer of assistance, I grabbed the doorframe and hoisted my dizzy self from the car, taking inconspicuously deep breaths to steady the ringing in my ears.</p><p>\u201cAra, are you okay?\u201d His hand hovered near my waist. \u201cYou\u2019re really pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, scowling at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine.\u201d He stood taller, dropping his hand. \u201cWould you like me to take you home?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, my gaze lingered between the church and freedom, but Emily caught my eye and waved softly. I waved back and shut the car door. \u201cNo. Then everyone will wonder why the new girl suddenly disappeared from a funeral\u2014questions would follow.\u201d</p><p>David laughed a little, wiping the amusement from his face quickly when he looked at mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Um\u2014shall we go in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLead the way,\u201d I offered, and walked slowly behind him, in no rush to be stuck in that dreary red-bricked building.</p><p>\u201cMr Knight.\u201d The priest by the door shook David\u2019s hand. \u201cLovely to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Father.\u201d David turned to a short, portly woman in a black tunic then, and kissed both her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming, David.\u201d She reached up and stroked his face. \u201cMy Nathan would be so proud to see you all here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a good boy.\u201d David squeezed her hand.</p><p>She smiled, her pudgy face tight with sorrow. \u201cAnd who do we have here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u2014\u201d David stepped back and placed his arm around my waist, pulling me closer. \u201cIs Ara Thompson.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went from David to me, widening. \u201cMy dear child. How sweet of you to come.\u201d</p><p>I smiled softly; there wasn\u2019t much I could say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so much like your mother,\u201d she said, taking my hand in her moist, plump grip. \u201cAnd is your father far behind?\u201d</p><p>I gave a quick glance into the parking lot. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, patting my hand. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you both after the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d David kissed her cheek again and stepped across the threshold of the church, smiling as he made the sign of the cross over his body.</p><p>I dipped my fingers in the holy water by the door, too, and did the same. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to smile, David.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his private, glittering grin. \u201cSorry. I was...remembering something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame old David,\u201d I scoffed, turning away a little too quickly. The walls grew taller around me, seeming to reach miles up into the sky, gathering a deathly chill from the outer atmosphere and sending it down here, to my world, making my stomach churn. A hint of smoke from singed candles wafted around the room, bringing my mind back to the last time I set foot in a church; the light faded from each stained-glass depiction of Bible stories lining the walls, making the coloured images grey and blurred\u2014revealing faces from the past; my mum, Harry, even my grandpa all stared out at me, though their spirits did not linger here, within these walls. I closed my eyes for a second and shut everything out\u2014the muffled sobs and whispers, the dreary organ music and the sound of paper rustling on the wooden backs of chairs.</p><p>David grabbed my arm and gently steered me to the edge of the pew, sliding in next to me, pushing me further up to allow room for more people. I wrapped my fingers around the back of the seat in front of me, taking slow, deep breaths until the bile pinching my tongue eased off.</p><p>\u201cMint?\u201d he offered; I grabbed one from the tiny tin and popped it in my mouth, refusing to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said smugly and stuffed them back in his pocket.</p><p>Then, the priest began, as did the incessant kneeling and standing. After communion, I knelt beside David and opened one eye to watch him. He seemed intent on his prayer; his eyes closed tight, lips moving fast\u2014speaking in tongues. Okay, so, not in tongues, but something that sounded remarkably like Latin. He never mentioned religion before. I didn\u2019t even know he was Catholic and did not know he spoke Latin. But why not; he spoke French? Then, so did Mike\u2014but that was different, because his mum was French, so he grew up with it.</p><p>\u201cFocus, Ara,\u201d David whispered quietly.</p><p>I turned my head, closed my eyes, and continued the Hail Mary I\u2019d started, just as everyone around us shuffled in their places and began to sit back in the pews. David reached across and helped me up gently by my arm.</p><p>I glared at him, jerking away. \u201cI can get myself up, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He swallowed, rubbing the left side of his chest as he looked to the front. When his hand dropped back into his lap, I studied the fine lines in his knuckles, the squared tips of his nails and the curl of his fingers, imagining mine wound through them, until he folded his arms, readjusting his seat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sat back then and listened to the eulogies given by Nathan\u2019s family and friends; each person passed by his coffin afterward and dropped a rose inside. I closed my eyes; from all the way up the back, I couldn\u2019t see Nathan in that box unless I angled my face the right way. Mum and Harry had closed caskets. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have coped with seeing their faces, so still, so devoid of life. Just seeing Harry\u2019s tiny coffin beside Mum\u2019s was enough to haunt me forever. It seemed funny how, no matter how big you thought someone was in life, when you lay them down, with six sides wrapping them tightly, they just look so small. It wasn\u2019t right to see a coffin that small.</p><p>David moved his hand onto mine and squeezed firmly. \u201cJust don\u2019t think about it, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to look at him; he kept his eyes forward.</p> <p>\u201cNathan was, and will always be a well-respected and much loved friend.\u201d I tuned in to the voice of Emily, standing up at the front, reading from a stack of palm cards. \u201cHe was there to give advice or a quick word of encouragement to anyone\u2014be they a jock, a chess geek, a cheer girl, or even a kid he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cNathan was the guy we all expected to see graduate with honours, make the national football league, marry the prom queen.\u201d Emily smiled then, looking down. \u201cDeath is sad in any case, but when it comes so suddenly and takes the life of someone who had so much to offer the world, who never had the chance, it truly is tragic.\u201d She stepped down and placed the cards inside the casket. \u201cWe\u2019ll all miss you, Nathe. Rest in peace.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s hand tightened on mine, and a single cool drop fell between our palms; I looked up and saw him nodding, breathing out slowly through parted lips.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>He sniffed and shook his head, wiping a line of moisture from his chin.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said, squeezing his hand back.</p><p>The grey sky opened up as we stepped outside the church, and the cool breeze eased the trapping tension of my own sorrows\u2014sorrows I had no right to bring with me to the farewell of another. Small droplets of rain began to sprinkle over the black hearse while David and a group of boys from the football team carried the pine box and slid it into the back.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, honey?\u201d Dad whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou look pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take her home?\u201d David offered quietly, popping up beside me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I scolded, moving swiftly away to stand among the crowd.</p><p>David walked by the hearse with the other pallbearers, leading the procession line through the church gates and into the cemetery. Each headstone we passed displayed names, dates, flowers, some even pictures of those who laid beneath\u2014every little detail showing the life they once belonged to. I closed my eyes and let the darkness narrow me in, the sobs of huddled mourners around me guiding my blind footsteps until a hand grabbed my arm. My eyes flashed open to David\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t walk with your eyes closed,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Hmph! I tucked my cold, shaking hands into my elbows, and David walked away\u2014back to his place beside the black car. When a loud grumble rolled across the darkening sky, everyone looked up\u2014squinting against the white sun until a cloud shadowed its glare. Icy patters of rain came down again, and little black umbrellas popped up all around me. I folded over ever so slightly, remembering how the uninvited rain ruined my last chance to farewell my family\u2014how it blinded me, made me so cold and so wet I had to fight with myself to stay. I hoped it wouldn\u2019t do the same to Nathan\u2019s family.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, dear?\u201d A skeletally-haggard old lady reached her hand toward me.</p><p>I nodded, taking a step away when a long, firm arm scooped my waist and pulled me under the shelter of a black canopy. \u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d David\u2019s silky voice hummed through the top of my head. \u201cShe\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The old lady smiled at David, but when she looked at me, her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be up front?\u201d I asked, craning my neck to look up at him.</p><p>He winked at me, a smile warming his face. \u201cI thought you might need some shelter.\u201d</p> <p>I pushed his arm from around my waist. \u201cI was fine. I don\u2019t need you to shelter me.\u201d Only I did\u2014so, so badly it hurt just to stand this close to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, um. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He placed the umbrella in my hand, squeezing my fingers around the handle before stepping back into the rain.</p><p>\u201cWait, David\u2014\u201d I reached out, but he strolled away too quickly, disappearing into the mist as the congregation dispersed suddenly, forming a semi-circle around a hole in the ground.</p><p>I scanned the crowd for my dad or Vicki, finding them beside the priest.</p><p>The rain came down harder then, making my ears feel blocked with its noisy pattering. Droplets of cold water splashed up onto my shoes, wetting my toes, while we stood around and waited for the boys to position the pine box above the ground.</p><p>The priest readied himself, straightening the cloth over his shoulders while an altar boy tipped and swayed, standing on his toes to keep an umbrella over the man. \u201cFriends and family\u2014\u201d</p><p>The rain stopped abruptly and all eyes cast to the heavens for a moment as umbrellas closed, like flowers at dusk, all around me. I leaned the umbrella David gave me against a nearby headstone and folded my arms over my chest.</p><p>As the priest began again, Dad wrapped his arm around Mrs Rossi and cast a quick glance at me; I smiled reassuringly. On the outside, I knew I looked strong, but inside, my heart was pouring like the rain passed, and my arms felt weak, like the blood was too thick to pump smoothly through my veins. The pressure of all the grieving people was starting to penetrate my emotional wall, and when I looked at Nathan\u2019s mother\u2014crying her heart out for her only child\u2014the memory of Harry came flooding back to the surface with vengeance. My hunger gave way to the green ogre, making my chest quiver as I fought to suppress the grief. But it was just no good\u2014all I saw was myself, in place of Mrs Rossi. I remembered how much it hurt to say goodbye. I knew what she felt, knew I couldn\u2019t help her, because nothing anyone said would ever make the pain go away.</p><p>The repressed grief burst out of me like an uncontrolled gust of rain-laced wind; I folded over a little more, shaking, and thunder cracked overhead, a flash of lightning giving the coffin a white glow\u2014the last light it would ever see. Looking up through swelling tears, I focused on the tall, familiar man standing near the priest with his hands clasped in front of him.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I said, taking a step toward him; he didn\u2019t hear me. I followed his gaze, and my heart shot into my throat, falling straight back down into my gut when I saw two coffins, side by side; one white, small, the other long. I wanted to fall to my knees between the open graves, to touch them one last time\u2014have longer to say goodbye, but Dad stepped up and whispered in my ear as they lowered them into the ground, \u201cThey\u2019re together up there, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I jumped back and looked across at Dad, still standing beside Mrs Rossi.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just us now,\u201d his voice played in my ear.</p><p>I looked back at the boxes containing my entire family as the priest spoke over the smallest one. \u201cCan I please go with them, Dad?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. Because he couldn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t even really standing beside me.</p><p>\u201cAs we lay this child to rest,\u201d the priest said, \u201cmay the angels greet him in Heaven. Father, for you are the all forgiving.\u201d</p><p>But what if there was no Heaven? What if Harry was lost out there somewhere\u2014alone, crying for me, and I never came to him?</p><p>He was too small to be all alone\u2014too small to be gone. He shouldn\u2019t have been there. He should\u2019ve been safe in his bed.</p><p>I wiped my face, smudging the rain into the tears while I watched Mike sprinkle a handful of soil over the coffins. Then, he looked at me, and my heart stopped beating as our eyes met.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I called out to him, but he just shook his head, unable to speak through his tears.</p><p>\u201cAshes to ashes, dust to dust.\u201d The words of the priest filled my ears; they sounded too real, like I was still there.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>My mind snapped back to reality. People sobbed hysterically around me, and Mrs Rossi fell into my dad\u2019s chest, hiding her face.</p><p>Lost in the unbelievable realism of my memory, I hadn\u2019t felt David place his arm around me. His voice, saying my name, echoed in the distance of my memory. I looked up at him for long enough to see extreme concern behind his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said, letting my gaze drift back to Nathan\u2019s box.</p><p>As it slowly lowered closer and closer to the ground, I thought about the empty space\u2014the horrible moment which brings everything into reality the minute you leave the funeral and walk into that vacant house. Before they\u2019re gone, before you bury them in the cold, hard ground, everything seems surreal, like they\u2019re just on a shopping trip or somewhere in the house where you can\u2019t hear them. But when their flesh touches the earth and settles in its final destination for all eternity, it takes with it the cloud, the safety of the cage that hides you from believing they\u2019re never coming back.</p><p>When Nathan\u2019s mom got home, she\u2019d fall apart. She\u2019d cry until there were no tears left and it would still do her no good. Nathan would never come back\u2014Harry was never coming back.</p><p>My shaking hands turned to ice. David\u2019s grip tightened around me.</p><p>All the things they\u2019d miss out on; it was too much to bear. Nathan would never finish high school, Mum would never see me get married, hold her first grandbaby and\u2014I swallowed hard, pressing my shaking knees together\u2014Harry would never go to school, never paint his first picture, never learn to walk. He never even got to have a birthday party.</p><p>The oxygen around me felt over-used. My head rocked back and forth inside, and as the shivers ran from my hands, up my arms and into my chest, I heard a quiet gasp\u2014and everything went black...</p><p>...Grains of sand fell through a narrow passage in a glass jar and hit the base with a soft pattering. The ground swayed gently beneath me, and the frosty rushing of my whole world felt calm now, closed in by the warmth of the summer sun. It was just David and I, watching the rain fall onto the leaves above us\u2014staying perfectly dry in the hidden clearing where I had my first kiss.</p><p>But as I felt the rain on my skin suddenly, I looked up to an open grey sky and the nostril hairs of a man, his breath brushing my fringe. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he whispered into my head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey. I\u2019m taking you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI what?\u201d I rolled my head to the side and looked around the church parking lot. \u201cI fainted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known better. It was just too soon,\u201d Dad said, more to himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, Ara,\u201d Vicki said from beside Dad, holding an umbrella over me while she dripped with rain.</p><p>I touched my hand to the back of my neck and pulled out a piece of grass. \u201cDid I hit my head?\u201d</p><p>Dad nodded. \u201cDavid caught you, but he was a fraction of a second too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe only stepped away from you for two seconds to place a rose into the, er...and you fell,\u201d Vicki added.</p><p>\u201cI must admit, though\u2014\u201d Dad half laughed, \u201c\u2014he made it to your side quicker than I\u2019ve ever seen anyone move. I almost didn\u2019t see it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he didn\u2019t even get a chance to say goodbye to Nathan?\u201d</p><p>Dad whispered something softly to Vicki\u2014something ending in the word David. My ears pricked up.</p><p>\u201cIs he\u2014\u201d I hesitated, \u201c\u2014is David mad with me?\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s head moved slowly to look at Vicki again.</p><p>\u201cAra, why would he be mad with you? You didn\u2019t mean to pass out,\u201d Vicki said.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t understand, so I said nothing else. Dad placed me in the backseat of the car and the door swung open on the other side. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Vicki, you can sit in the front with Dad,\u201d I started, but my eyes fell on something magnificent. \u201cDavid?\u201d And that was it. That was the final straw. I buried my crumpling face in my hands. I wanted to tell him to go away, but his arms, as they fell around me, pulling me into his cool, firm chest, held me so tight my body couldn\u2019t shake. Even the soaking rain, making his suit icy cold against my face, didn\u2019t bother me. I just needed him so badly.</p><p>\u201cShh, sweetheart.\u201d He stroked my hair, whispering into the top of my head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d I sobbed uncontrollably. \u201cNothing ever is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d He slid down in the seat a little more and wrapped his arms tighter around me. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d I lifted my head, speaking a little louder to project my voice over the heavy pounding of rain. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2014did she see? Did Mrs Rossi see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, honey. Mrs Rossi\u2019s more worried about you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d My head shook against my hands.</p><p>\u201cAra, please stop crying?\u201d David asked softly, brushing my hair from my face.</p><p>He smelled so good and he was just so sweet. That rich, orange-chocolate scent, the scent that could only be David\u2019s, matched his gorgeously gentle personality so well.</p><p>My sobbing stopped short for a second when a loud rumble emanated from the ogre within my belly.</p><p>\u201cAra? Did you eat breakfast?\u201d Vicki asked in a high-pitched tone.</p><p>David\u2019s chest sunk as he breathed out deeply, pressing his cheek against my forehead. \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t. Silly girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAra?\u201d Dad sighed. \u201cYou know better than that. What were you\u2014\u201d He stopped, almost visibly biting his own tongue. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. When we get home, you need to go straight upstairs. Vicki and I will fix you some food and bring it up. Okay?\u201d Dad looked in the rearview mirror.</p><p>I nodded, letting David pull me closer to his saturated shirt. We were almost home now. The sweet smell of the frangipani trees in Mr Herman\u2019s garden scented the cold, wet air coming in through Dad\u2019s window, and I breathed the last few minutes of David I would ever get.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>Dad let David carry me upstairs, much to my disgust and against my very strongly worded protest. When we stepped into the warm, soft light of my room, a wave of relief washed away the tight feeling in my chest. David stood me on the ground, pulled the quilt back on my bed, then lowered me onto the mattress\u2014smoothing the rain away from my legs before sliding my shoes off my feet.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smiled down at him.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He smiled back and, as he stood up, placed my shoes neatly, side-by-side, next to my bedroom door.</p><p>Something clicked then; the air stopped flowing to my lungs for a second and pieces of my life over the last few weeks started to fit together. My window\u2014that night\u2014I closed it. But it was open\u2014in the morning.</p><p>\u201cLay back,\u201d he said, and I did, very slowly, all the while moving pieces of the puzzle around in my head. He pulled the quilt up to my chin, sitting himself on the bed beside me.</p> <p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ar\u2014\u201d He frowned at my wide-eyed expression, then stood up, stiff and slow. I saw his throat move as he looked over at the shoes. I looked at them, too.</p><p>That was all the confirmation I needed.</p><p>\u201cI can explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou snuck...into my room?\u201d I said. \u201cWhy? I mean\u2014how did you even get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He stopped and straightened up suddenly, keeping his eyes on me. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p> <p>I looked at the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey.\u201d Dad popped his head in, smiling widely at a plate in his hand. \u201cMade you a salad sandwich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d I sat up. Though I was hungry and felt pretty sick because of it, all I wanted was for him to go away so I could figure out what the hell David was doing in my room that night and, more embarrassingly, how long he\u2019d been watching me.</p><p>\u201cMrs Rossi called,\u201d Dad said, sitting beside me, handing me the plate. \u201cShe asked me to tell you that she was overwhelmed with happiness to see you today and not to worry about fainting, because if you hadn\u2019t done it first, she would have.\u201d He laughed softly. \u201cAnd then she added that she wouldn\u2019t have had a handsome young man there to catch her.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s shoulders lifted once with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI told her I\u2019d have caught her, but, apparently\u2014\u201d Dad looked a little solemn, \u201c\u2014I\u2019m not a handsome young man.\u201d</p><p>I smiled softly. \u201cIt was nice of her to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was worried about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all were,\u201d David said, then moved away and leaned on the wall beside my door, his arms over his chest, a thousand thoughts dancing across his face. And all I read there, in his eyes and on his brow, was agony.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Dad waved a hand in front of my stare.</p><p>Clearing my throat, I looked at the smile badly masking his concern and almost laughed. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Dad. Really. I guess I just need to eat.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled, relieved, I guess, and nodded. \u201cOkay. Do you...need some time alone?\u201d</p><p>One of David\u2019s brows arched up slightly.</p><p>\u201cJust give me a second to talk to David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, honey.\u201d Dad stood up and patted David on the shoulder as he passed, shutting my door behind him.</p><p>The silence in the room hovered over the howling winds outside. David closed his eyes for a second, rolling his chin toward his chest. I wondered who should speak first; the prosecutor or the defendant.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d he said, out of the blue.</p><p>My eyes narrowed and I bit my teeth together. \u201cI think you have a few confessions to make before you go asking me to do anything.\u201d</p><p>His arms dropped to his sides with a heavy sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not talking until you\u2019ve eaten something.\u201d</p><p>Keeping my eyes on him, I picked up the sandwich and tore a corner away with my teeth. \u201cHappy?\u201d I muttered with my mouth full, slamming the sandwich back down on the plate.</p><p>David nodded once, the frown he wore erasing the usual smile from his eyes. Everything about him seemed odd without that smile. Empty, almost.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said after I swallowed, \u201cI\u2019ve eaten now. Fess up, for once.\u201d</p><p>He walked slowly over and knelt by my bed, taking both my wrists and setting them gently beside my legs. \u201cI love you. I would never do anything to hurt or dishonour you, and I would never intrude on you in a corrupt manner. But, I did come to your window and I did come in to your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about you. Your dad said you were suicidal, and I wasn\u2019t sure if he might be correct. After we\u2014\u201d he rocked his jaw, blinking a few times, \u201c\u2014after I kissed you and then took you home, I\u2014I knew what you were thinking, Ara. I knew you just...wanted to stop the pain. I was really worried you might. So I\u2014\u201d he shrugged and jerked his head to my window. \u201cI jumped through. Came to check on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it was you who put me into bed?\u201d</p><p>David swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have interfered. But, when I found you at your dresser, I nearly fell to pieces. You looked so alone, so destroyed, and worse, Ara, I did that to you. I made you sad because I never told you the truth\u2014that I\u2019d be leaving. If I had, you would never have let yourself fall so in love with me, and the worst part is, that\u2019s exactly why I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so horrible, David. How could you be so mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intention to be mean. I just wanted to love you. I really, honestly thought things would be different\u2014that when it came time for me to leave, you either wouldn\u2019t care as much as you did, or you might\u2014\u201d He exhaled, rubbing his brow.</p><p>\u201cMight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight come with me.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and dumped the sandwich beside me. \u201cCome with you? That\u2019s an option?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s always been an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d His frown deepened. \u201cAra, you broke up with me before I had the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because you\u2019re leaving! If we could stay together, that changes everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs does coming with me. Ara, you couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d He huffed, pursing his lips. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t live a normal life. You wouldn\u2019t be able to see your family anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014remember I told you I have secrets?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019re your secrets then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to hear them? Are you ready to hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to tell me or are you going to start, then say you\u2019ll tell me later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does the full truth sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair and sat on the bed beside me. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be doing this today\u2014you\u2019re in an emotional state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh!\u201d I wagged my finger. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare. You are telling me, Mr Knight.\u201d</p><p>He let out a short laugh. \u201cFine. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut.\u201d He turned slightly and grabbed both my arms, squeezing firmly. \u201cBy hearing this, you\u2019re\u2014well, you\u2019re making a verbal agreement, Ara, as am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean...I have obligations to fulfil, should this go bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich are?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around my arms again.</p><p>\u201cDavid, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf...\u201d His jaw went tight. \u201cLook, in the past, people have not taken this news well and there have been instances where, some in my position, have had to kill those they\u2019ve told.\u201d</p><p>My mouth hung open. I rolled my quilt away and slowly rose to my feet.</p><p>David shuffled back, letting me walk to the other side of my room.</p><p>\u201cWould you really be capable of doing that to me?\u201d</p><p>He looked down. \u201cI...I don't want to. Which is one of the reasons I haven\u2019t wanted to tell you, thus far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious! You\u2019d kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ara. But if you\u2014if you told anyone, if you freaked out, it would be out of my hands.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay, so I won\u2019t freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t.\u201d He smiled and patted the mattress. \u201cSit with me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cAra, please?\u201d</p><p>I shook it again. If this secret was so bad he might have to kill me, there was no way I was sitting next to him. No way!</p><p>He looked down at his hands. \u201cAra, I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vampire\u2014guys who drink blood, you know\u2014fangs, all that stuff.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing, folding over a little.</p><p>\u201cStop laughing, Ara. It's not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it's cool. Hey, can you turn me?\u201d I rolled my neck. \u201cI think I'd suit immortality.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou know, this isn't a joke.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cP\u2014\u201d He shook his head, wiping the incredulity from his lips. \u201cProve it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If you\u2019re really the undead, prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, we\u2019re not undead.\u201d He stood up. \u201cAnd what do you want me to do to prove it, eat you?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>I had time only to smile before he rushed in and wrapped his arms around my waist, nuzzling his face into my neck. The tickly sensation of his cool breath sent a shiver down my spine, allowing warmth to return only once my heart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cYou are a very silly girl,\u201d he said calmly, pressing his lips to my shoulder. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d bitten you? What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really were a vampire, you could do a lot worse than bite me\u2014if you wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. If I wanted to.\u201d He stood behind me and gently swept my hair over my shoulder, clearing way for his lips. \u201cRemember that when you freak out in a minute, okay?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Now, see that rise of hills over there?\u201d His finger aimed to the eastern hills where the first rays of sunlight touched the earth each morning.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a garden on the other side. Blue roses grow there. Have you seen it?\u201d He went back to kissing the curve of my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe Applebury Reserve?\u201d I rolled my eyes, lost in pleasure. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s twenty miles away. How long do you think it would take to run there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know? Depends how fast you run. And then, calculating that would involve math, so...\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s irritation blew out in cold air through his nose. \u201cWhat if?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if?\u201d I said back.</p><p>His arms tightened on my waist and he pressed his cheek to mine. \u201cWhat if I told you I could do it\u2014run there and be back before you had a chance to blink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say that you are very talented\u2014\u201d my voice trailed up with humour, \u201c\u2014and I would be jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it would prove I\u2019m a vampire; you\u2019d believe me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I spun around, hands on hips. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you got.\u201d</p><p>He looked out over the hills, then back at me. \u201cSo, you know the Applebury Reserve is the only place that grows blue roses, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah\u2014I guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t be scared.\u201d He inched away, holding up his index finger. \u201cPlease don\u2019t scream when you see this?\u201d</p><p>My eyes locked to his. He smiled, standing so tall and so sure of himself. It was hard to doubt him when he looked like that. I almost hoped he could do what he claimed. I\u2019d hate to think he was actually insane.</p><p>He scratched his temple for a second then held his palms out. \u201cNothing in my hands, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He turned them over a few times; I nodded to confirm\u2014again. \u201cNow, don\u2019t move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I started to say as a cold rush of air blew into my eyes. I closed them, feeling a tickle down my cheek, and the sweet, vibrant perfume of roses filled the air around me\u2014flavouring my breath with a walk in the garden.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d His hot breath brushed right against my ear. When I opened my eyes and they met with his, he watched expectantly, a ghost of anguish pinching his brows.</p><p>\u201cHuh!\u201d My quick gasp made him smile. \u201cHow did you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I run very fast.\u201d He smoothed the petals of the blue rose over my cheek again.</p><p>\u201cYes. That is fast. I am jealous.\u201d My eyes narrowed with scepticism. \u201cNow, tell me how you really did it.\u201d</p><p>David groaned in the back of his throat and took a step away. \u201cI can see this is going to be a little more of a challenge than I anticipated.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, if this was the early nineteen-hundreds, you\u2019d already be screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and you speak from personal experience, do you?\u201d</p> <p>Without even a smile at my joke, he placed the thornless rose in my hand and pulled me along. \u201cCome. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>I plonked onto my feather quilt and dug my toes into the carpet. David stood before me, then looked over his shoulder\u2014in the direction of my wardrobe. \u201cYou ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? A fashion show?\u201d</p><p>He flashed a cheeky, lopsided grin, and vanished into thin air, appearing a second later by my wardrobe door.</p><p>\u201cHow...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you believe me now?\u201d He sprung up right in front of my face.</p><p>A quick, half-breath reached my lungs as I launched for my bedroom door, but his strong hand covered my mouth before my cry for help ever reached the ears of its intended. I convulsed violently, wriggling to break free from the intensifying hold.</p><p>Let me go! Get off me!</p><p>I tried to stomp on his toes but he moved his foot, and my heel struck the ground with knee-jolting force\u2014sending instant tears into my eyes. I cried out under his iron grip.</p><p>\u201cAra! Look at me!\u201d He shook me once, pinning the back of my skull to his chest, his forearm firmly caging my collarbones. \u201cJust stop struggling. Look at me!\u201d</p><p>Heaving lungfuls of air came through my nose, dragging strands of my hair with it, but with each passing breath, I managed to calm myself enough to stop struggling, but not enough to stop shaking. David\u2019s hold relaxed a little, but stayed firm.</p> <p>\u201cIf I let go, will you promise not to scream?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. He was a monster. A killer. Oh, my God. How did I not see this?</p><p>\u201cAra, please?\u201d His deep, milky voice set my heart on fire with the hurt beneath his calm tone. I turned my head and forced my gaze upward, meeting the painfully detached ache behind the emerald eyes I loved so much.</p><p>\u201cMm-bm-mm-nn,\u201d I muttered under his grasp.</p><p>He released me instantly and air entered my lungs in a grateful gasp. I folded over slightly, rubbing my chin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hurt, I\u2014\u201d I bolted for the door again, reaching the handle as he pressed his palm flat to it, stopping it from opening. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d I tugged the handle, bucking him with my hip.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to calm down first.\u201d</p><p>My fists tightened. \u201cI\u2019m calm.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr!\u201d I growled, shoving his chest; this time, unlike our fight on the field, he didn\u2019t shift\u2014not even a little bit. \u201cGet away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d He laughed, pinning my wrists against my chest.</p><p>My eyes darted over every inch of his face; his dark pink lips, his emerald eyes, so kind, so loving, and his dimple\u2014the moon shape one above his lip. It was all David, but none of it was the boy I went to school with; he was never real. He never even existed.</p><p>David stood back. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head, dropping my hands to my knees.</p><p>\u201cAra, let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to talk about?\u201d I stood up, pressing my spine to the door. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re a...you have fangs, and I can think of only one thing they would do.\u201d</p><p>He touched his thumb to his tooth. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill?\u201d I confirmed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I folded over again, hiding my brow in my hands. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor...to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little selfish?\u201d</p><p>He laughed once. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Ara, I don\u2019t have a choice but to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this instance, sweetheart.\u201d He wandered over and sat on my bed; I wanted to tell him not to call me sweetheart, but didn\u2019t have the guts to say that to a vampire.</p><p>He smiled\u2014his secret smile. \u201cDo you really hate it when I call you sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>My mouth hung open. \u201cDid I say that out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He grinned, rubbing the tops of his knees. \u201cI can read minds, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I slid down the door and sat on the floor with my head in my palms. \u201cHow is that...possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d David said.</p><p>I looked up quickly to his hand on my shoulder. \u201cGet away from me.\u201d</p><p>He evaporated, appearing by my window. I dusted my arm off, scraping away any vampire germs that might\u2019ve been left behind, then looked over at him; he looked so conflicted yet so comfortable as he considered the world below. The muscles in his arms, with the way he folded them across his chest, looked bigger, more defined. And I had once wanted them on me, wanted to feel him against me. Now, I only felt anger at myself for that\u2014for ever loving him when he was such a vile, disgusting monster.</p><p>He took a breath and spoke to the world outside, \u201cDespite what you may believe, my girl, I am still human inside. And everything you\u2019re thinking right now does hurt.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, trying to make my mind go blank, but it wouldn\u2019t; I just kept seeing the faces of people as they screamed, begged for their lives, while David towered over them and took it. \u201cHave you always been able to read my mind?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, not looking at me. I wanted to be mad, but the heat that rushed through me was boiling mortification, more than anger. I buried my face in my hand and groaned. Oh, so many thoughts I wouldn\u2019t have wanted him to hear.</p><p>David chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what everyone says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I feel so violated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my love. I know it\u2019s awful but, if it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m not usually listening. And I can only hear your immediate thoughts. For anything in the past, I actually have to go inside your head.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cBut, you can get in there\u2014you can find things?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so freakin\u2019 creepy.\u201d</p><p>He became smaller. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say things like that, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you expect me to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s a vampire!\u201d He waved his hands about like a girl.</p><p>\u201cI kind of did say that.\u201d I smiled. \u201cBut you muzzled me.\u201d</p><p>He winced, letting a breath out. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that, Ara. I just couldn\u2019t have you running down to tell your dad.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, knowing full well that\u2019s exactly what I was going to do. \u201cSo, I\u2019m calm now. Am I free to go, or are you going to keep me hostage in here for the rest of my life?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to face me. \u201cWill you keep quiet?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>I felt better after a sigh of relief. Slowly, I got to my feet and opened my bedroom door. Dad\u2019s voice lilted up the stairs, homely and warm; I listened for a second then looked back at David, who leaned on my desk, his arms folded. \u201cWas that all\u2014is this your only dark secret?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo you...\u201d I lowered my voice. \u201cYou kill people?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>I stepped back in my room and shut my door, resting my head on it for a second. \u201cDo you like killing them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice came smoothly across the room, making my shoulders lift around my ears.</p><p>\u201cDo you...do you ever regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, no, not until I fell in love with you.\u201d</p><p>I turned around then. \u201cAnd what difference does that make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompassion. Vampires are nothing if not compassionate, but only for our own kind. When we fall for a human, that compassion, for some reason, extends out to their race as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept, instead of loving thy neighbour, you eat him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that. We don\u2019t just walk around with a constant desire to munch on random humans. And never those in our local community. We eat only when we get hungry\u2014like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not like I do. I go to the shop\u2014buy a packet of chips. Not walk into a dark alley and end the local milk man.\u201d</p><p>David laughed. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what about when you are hungry?\u201d I threw my hands up. \u201cIs it hard to live among us then? I mean, there\u2019s no way I could live in a chocolate factory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t let myself get that hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cDoes...\u201d I looked past him to the grey day. \u201cSo, how did you fall in love with me if I\u2019d look better on your plate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t choose to fall for you, Ara. It just happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow, I mean, what\u2019s a vampire even doing at our school?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m on leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I work for two years in the vampire community, then take two years to be human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman? There is nothing human about what you are,\u201d I said with a mouthful of spite.</p><p>\u201cWe fall in love,\u201d he offered, stuffing his hands in his pockets. \u201cWe can eat, sleep, walk in the day, as if we were still human. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I was going to say but\u2014\u201d he tried to keep a light grin on his lips, but the hurt of my repulsion revealed itself within his eyes, \u201c\u2014everything is stronger; our bodies, our minds, all of our senses. We feel everything with an intensity I cannot describe; happiness, pain, heartache\u2014\u201d he cringed on the word, \u201c\u2014and love are so much stronger than you can possibly imagine.\u201d</p><p>I softened a little\u2014about five-percent. It was the way he said love. There was something so...vulnerable about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrugged one shoulder. \u201cI think I might be able to empathise with you on the feeling-things-more-strongly aspect.\u201d</p><p>The sharp, crescent-moon dimple returned as he nodded. \u201cYou have a lot of heart, Ara. Perhaps that\u2019s why I\u2019m so drawn to you. You\u2019re not like other humans.\u201d His smile dropped away and he looked down at his shoes. \u201cI am sorry that I\u2019ve hurt you with my secrecy. More than you know.\u201d</p><p>Apology not accepted...yet. I squared my shoulders. \u201cOkay. So, you said you eat and sleep and everything else? Why be a vampire at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not by choice,\u201d he said calmly, like I was an infant. \u201cYou see, it\u2019s like an alien, I guess. I thought about it once\u2014how I could describe it to a human.\u201d He pointed at me as he spoke, then touched his chin with thought. \u201cIt\u2019s like an alien comes down and plants itself in you. You\u2019re everything you were before, except that now, you have these incredible abilities, and your human side is driven by the desires of the alien\u2019s first nature\u2014blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still David, but I\u2019m also this alien. I drink because I\u2019m compelled to. If I don\u2019t drink, I become weak and desperate, then I\u2019d eventually turn into a monster.\u201d He laughed lightly and added, \u201cMuch like you if you don\u2019t have breakfast. Only, there\u2019d be no stopping me. I would kill...uncontrollably.\u201d</p><p>Great, so, I fell in love with an alien-operated vampire.</p><p>We stood in silence again for a minute.</p><p>\u201cSo, why humans? Why not squirrels? Or cats?\u201d I subconsciously nodded toward my window, imagining Skittles on a plate.</p><p>David laughed. \u201cIt is vital to consume the blood of your own kind. I am human, in part. Without human blood, human energy, and human life force, I\u2019m nothing. Animal blood, and I speak from experience, not only tastes like ash, but can\u2019t satiate the thirst and it won\u2019t nourish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you just didn\u2019t eat blood at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d end up back at square one\u2014killing uncontrollably until my hunger was quenched; it\u2019s much kinder to take a few lives than many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I nearly folded over and threw up. \u201cHow can there be any kindness in killing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive a few hundred years and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him with a pang of excitement. \u201cSo, are you immortal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t die?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAt all?\u201d I double-checked.</p><p>He shook his head again and stood taller. \u201cNo. We\u2019re virtually indestructible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirtually?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t die, but we can get hurt. Our bones are like cement\u2014iron-coated cement. They do not break. Ever. And our flesh is extremely difficult to penetrate\u2014not that it would do any good to cut a vampire, because we heal incredibly fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so, like, there\u2019re no stakes or holy water or silver or decapitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Immortal means immortal, Ara. There is no death. No peace. Only an endless eternity of mourning and solitude\u2014watching everyone you love grow old and wither away\u2014forever just a memory, leaving nothing but a fruitless hope of finding happiness again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds\u2014\u201d I studied his face, \u201c\u2014unbearable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he said through a breathy laugh as the tension in the room eased.</p><p>\u201cI know you, David. I know you have a good heart, but, I mean, I\u2019m struggling to understand how you can be so loving, yet so...dangerous. How...how do you live with the guilt? For killing people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>David laughed lightly. \u201cI don\u2019t. I have no choice but to stay alive, but I hate myself for some of the things I\u2019ve done. You just find a way to do it without leaving too many scars on the world\u2014or your own heart. But there aren\u2019t too many vampires with empathy for humans. It gets lost when we change. Mostly, you\u2019re just food to us.\u201d As he shrugged, he flashed an easy smile at me; I shuddered.</p><p>Food? \u201cDon\u2019t ever use that term around me again, David. I still care for humans, you know, since I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara. We\u2019re just from different worlds, you and I. I\u2019ll be careful what I say around you, I promise.\u201d He looked into my eyes, his gaze guarded. \u201cAssuming you still want to see me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his feet. \u201cWould you like me to leave?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, tapping my fingertips on my leg. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I sit?\u201d he asked, motioning to the bed.</p><p>I nodded; he sat down.</p> <p>\u201cSo, is it true that all vampires are totally hot and sexy?\u201d I asked after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cDepends on your tastes, I\u2019d say.\u201d He sat back a little, smirking. \u201cGet to the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget,\u201d he said, pushing my quilt away from his leg. \u201cI can read your mind. What was your point?\u201d</p> <p>My shoulders sunk. \u201cWhy me? Why a plain, ordinary, scarred human, when you could be with a hot vampire chick?\u201d</p><p>He moved his words around inside his mouth for a second. \u201cYou do things to me that no other girl, human or vampire, has ever done. It\u2019s not optional for me to love you, Ara. I...when I\u2019m with you\u2014\u201d He looked at me, breathing out before continuing. \u201cI\u2019m more human than monster. More heart-and-soul than vacant-shadowy-night.\u201d He blinked softly and added, \u201cPlus,\u201d with a smile.</p><p>\u201cPlus what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus, I\u2019m crazy in love with you.\u201d</p><p>I looked down to hide my wide grin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough for me just to love you, though,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to be with you\u2014to see you, to touch you\u2014be a part of you in a way no one else in the world ever could.\u201d</p><p>My face fell into my hands, his words sending giggles through my chest. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d managed to fall in love with a real, blood-sucking vampire. And my parents were afraid I\u2019d start hanging with kids on drugs.</p><p>\u201cAra? Are...are you crying, ma jolie fille?\u201d David\u2019s hesitant embrace fell around me, and the fear I felt before edged in the centre of my stomach, while the weight of his arms on my body made my heart beat faster. But I closed my eyes and focused on the truth; this was David. Not some random murderer.</p> <p>My David.</p><p>I looked up, and the vampire ran a cool fingertip under my eye\u2014a kind of affection, kind of touch, that felt so normal to me now.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d David asked, looking overly concerned.</p><p>\u201cRelax, David. I haven\u2019t lost it...yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He broke into a breathy smile. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...when a guy tells a girl he\u2019s a vampire, he doesn\u2019t exactly expect to be laughed at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my defence, I screamed as well.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened.</p><p>\u201cWell, would you expect anything less than fear, David? You\u2019re a dangerous creature\u2014not a Cullen,\u201d I added, with a wry smile.</p><p>He laughed, loud and full. The sound warmed the room with its grace. \u201cI wish.\u201d He rolled his head backward as the laugh dissipated to a smile. \u201cGreat books, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He breathed out, still smiling as he added, \u201cWouldn\u2019t life be so much easier if it were really that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because then you\u2019d be icy-cold...and pale. But I like your golden skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>My ears and cheeks flushed with heat. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t, like, sparkle or anything, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. You\u2019ve seen me in the sun,\u201d he stated dryly. \u201cDid I look like a lamp to you?\u201d</p><p>Hmm. I remembered how lovely he looked in the sun; how he seemed to glow\u2014an incandescent beauty with perfectly formed muscles. His skin was so soft and smooth, hairless, as far as I could see. But although the memory was bright and golden, making me forget how dark my room was getting, I was pretty sure he didn\u2019t have moths buzzing around his head or anything. So, no, he didn\u2019t look like a lamp. But boy, would I love to take his shirt off right now just to be sure it was all real.</p><p>A tiny smile tugged the corners of David\u2019s lips, changing his whole expression.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I scolded, holding my finger up to warn him against his invasive, mind-reading behaviour. Would there ever be any way to get used to him being constantly in my head?</p><p>David\u2019s shoulders lifted with his short, breathy laugh.</p><p>Obviously not.</p><p>\u201cOkay. So, those myths aside\u2014\u201d I wandered over and plonked on my floor, crossing my legs to get comfortable.</p><p>\u201cJust to save you time, Ara, technically, everything you think you know is a myth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one, despite ancient storytelling, vampires are not actually dead.\u201d He sat on the edge of my bed and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not undead, either\u2014we\u2019re actually alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And you know what else we\u2019re not?\u201d he hinted with a lopsided grin.</p><p>\u201cEnlighten me,\u201d I said playfully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not evil demons or weirdoes with anaemia, but\u2014\u201d he pointed to the roof, \u201c\u2014we are, in fact, colder\u2014which is where some of the stories come from, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why are you cold if you\u2019re alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you cold?\u201d He grinned; I shrugged. \u201cIf we go for long periods without...nourishment, we get colder and a little pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not so very different from me, then?\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cHa! Maybe you\u2019re a vampire and you just don\u2019t know it.\u201d He pointed at me, his very cute, dimpled smile making me laugh.</p><p>It was nice to laugh with him again. \u201cThere\u2019s just one thing I\u2019m curious about, though. You said you\u2019re not dead?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Everything David and I ever did together, every moment I touched him since we met, I ran over in my mind. \u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t remember ever hearing a heartbeat. Do you have a heart?\u201d</p><p>His gaze fell on his clasped hands. \u201cI don\u2019t have a heartbeat, because I don\u2019t need my heart to beat. You see, the energy\u2014the life force I draw from a human\u2014moves the blood through my arteries. It\u2019s very powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of. And I don\u2019t need my heart to pump blood to my lungs for oxygenation either, because I don\u2019t make the blood. It comes to me with oxygen in it. See?\u201d He held out his forearm and rolled up his sleeve to reveal clear veins, slightly protruding from his skin as if he were flexing his muscles. \u201cThey don\u2019t contain blood. They carry the remaining life force\u2014the energy that makes me immortal. The blood I drink runs through the arteries, which are deeper. That\u2019s why my veins look skin-tone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...really? You don\u2019t make your own blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. When the blood I drink runs out of oxygen and nutrients, I simply drink more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if you get a cut and bleed, it\u2019s not your blood seeping out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is. My body coverts the blood I drink to use as its own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I stared at his arm.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he added, rolling his sleeve back down, \u201cI do still have a heart.\u201d</p><p>My head bounced and my lips pressed together into a thin smile. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know I love you?\u201d His hand flinched a little\u2014like he was going to reach for me, but thought better of it.</p><p>\u201cI know you do. The trouble is\u2014I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should that be a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a vampire, David. You\u2014\u201d My words were lost. What could I say? That I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about him now I knew he killed people? That\u2019d be kinda shallow, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not shallow, Ara. This,\u201d he said, motioning to himself, \u201cis a lot for anyone to handle.\u201d</p><p>I let my cheek lift my lip in the smile it forced. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>He sat back again, rubbing his thumb over his chin. \u201cI was human once, you know. And I do understand how you feel about the deaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, thinking for a moment. \u201cSo, how long have you been a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince nineteen-thirteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it! I knew you weren\u2019t an eighteen-year-old boy.\u201d I shook my head in amazement. \u201cIt all makes so much sense now\u2014especially how you keep appearing at my side all the time.\u201d After that thought came another, but a more carefully considered question this time. \u201cAre you...alone?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. I live in a large community of vampires. Plus, I have my uncle and my brother, which is more than most vampires have.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWait, they\u2019re vampires, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about girlfriends? Have you ever had one?\u201d I probably didn\u2019t really want to know, especially if she went out to dinner with him and ended up becoming the main course.</p><p>David laughed again. \u201cI\u2019m not that careless, but, yes, I have had girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas anyone special? I mean, you\u2019re pretty old, right, so have you ever, like, loved anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014like you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I love you?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNever. But there were two other girls I\u2019ve loved in my existence. Neither of them worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cWhy do you want to know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame reason you wonder about Mike.\u201d I pointed at him. \u201cAnd I know you do.\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cSo, you wanna know who the competition is.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fine. Well, let\u2019s just say that for one of the girls\u2014it turned out that we were really too different, and...\u201d He took a breath, biting his lip, his eyes distant. \u201cAnd the other was...just not meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what happened to her?\u201d I moved an inch closer, sensing his obvious distress.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps this story is for another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what happened two years ago?\u201d I asked after dropping it for a whole three seconds. \u201cIs she the reason you missed so much school\u2014why you came to live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you can tell me that you kill people, but you won\u2019t talk about ex-girlfriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Agitation wandered into my tone. \u201cWas she human, like me? Did you love her as much as you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone!\u201d David yelled. \u201cOkay? Just drop it!\u201d</p><p>My heart jumped. I sunk back into myself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr!\u201d He gripped his hair. \u201cNo, Ara, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>My hand moved and I felt his fingers around mine before I realised he was beside me.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you like that. It\u2019s just\u2014they took her away. She was a vampire, and they took her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, please, I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d He studied the ground, as if he couldn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cYou really did love her?\u201d I asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes. But nothing like the way I love you\u2014that has no measure, but I loved her enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she ever come back?\u201d I studied his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want her to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he raised his voice a little, then softened it, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cLook. It doesn\u2019t matter. I just. I don\u2019t want to talk about it yet, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t ask again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he moaned, rolling his head back a little. \u201cYou can ask\u2014just not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you always say.\u201d I looked right into his eyes; he looked ready for a challenge, but too much was going on in my head. I wasn\u2019t up to arguing with him. Instead, my mind wandered through the past few weeks, analysing and going over everything we said or did together, then stopped on the best memory I had stored away up there in my catalogue of thoughts; the butterflies\u2014the look of concentration on his face as they fluttered around us; the seemingly perfect timing.</p><p>David\u2019s head titled down a little and a very sexy smile spread across his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a timing thing at all, was it? Did\u2014did you do that?\u201d I asked, full of wonder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of my many talents,\u201d he said, still grinning.</p><p>\u201cBut, how? Are you magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, almost laughing. \u201cI\u2019m a creature of nature, Ara. Hard as that is to believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA creature of nature! But you kill people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d he scolded softly. \u201cI\u2019m no different to the lion killing the antelope.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcept that the lion doesn\u2019t look like the antelope, or live among its kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but still, like the lion, I blend into my natural surroundings; he has the advantage of a certain colouring, and I have the ability to emulate the human form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but if you\u2019re so natural, how come your species isn\u2019t born\u2014you\u2019re, I don\u2019t know, like, created, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable, girl.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting beside a vampire, and wrought with scepticism. Is it so hard to believe I might be one of God\u2019s creatures\u2014just because I kill?\u201d</p><p>I thrust my shoulders back and sat up straight. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014\u201d He exhaled frustration. \u201cWhat I am is a natural occurrence. I wasn\u2019t created by witchcraft or magic. And yes, some do say it started as a curse, but it was actually passed on by those of an ancient bloodline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bloodline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was human once. You see, it takes a genetic polarity in a human which, when converged with vampire venom, triggers the change in their genetic makeup. They become less human and more of what is commonly called a vampire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA genetic polarity?\u201d I frowned, thinking over his words. I took genetic sciences in school\u2014I wasn\u2019t any good at it. \u201cSo, are you saying you have to have the right gene to become a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, so, even though I\u2019m a supernatural being, I\u2019m actually mostly natural\u2014just also very super.\u201d He grinned warmly, straightening one leg out in front of him, hugging his other knee.</p><p>\u201cSo, if you\u2019re not magic, how did you do that thing with the butterflies?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re just affected by humidity. Vampires? We can manipulate the elements\u2014water and temperature for example.\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cI can get really scientific about it if you like, but most people fall asleep after about ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>He had an explanation for everything. Always. I hated that. \u201cWell, it was the most beautiful moment of my life, so far.\u201d I\u2019d dreamed about those flutters of blue and yellow, surrounding us like we were in some private, mystical bubble, nearly every night since that day. Pity he had to ruin it by combining it with the memory of my first kiss\u2014to a guy who kills people with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2014\u201d David hesitated. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason I did that, Ara, and it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissed you.\u201d</p><p>I hugged my knees, not bothering to tuck my dress under my legs. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never imagined you would one day find me repulsive, and I knew then that I would be leaving you.\u201d He leaned a little closer and lowered his voice. \u201cBut I love you, and I just wanted to be your first kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little selfish, don\u2019t you think? You should have asked me if I wanted my first kiss to be with a murderer.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, pressing his lips into a flat smile. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re mad at me. It was worth it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, because he was right. I could try to be mad at him for that kiss but, in truth, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if he\u2019d just eaten, I\u2019d still have wanted my first kiss to be with him. I just wouldn\u2019t tell him that. I turned my nose up with a flick of my chin. \u201cYou\u2019d be more interesting if you were magic.\u201d</p><p>He smiled so lovingly at me. \u201cWell, there is an element of magic, by human definition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuess there\u2019d have to be with all that speed and healing fast stuff.\u201d I stopped and turned the pages of myth in my mind. \u201cHang on. You did say you heal fast, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d He grinned, hugging his knee.</p><p>My mind was getting lost in information. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRapid cell regeneration. It\u2019s responsible for immortality as well,\u201d he answered with a hint of humour in his voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr I-Have-An-Answer-For-Everything. And what about the whole vampires are demons thing?\u201d I looked at him, my own tone light, quizzical.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you\u2019re not, I suppose. I would\u2019ve had a hard time explaining to Nathan\u2019s mom why you suddenly just burst into flames today.\u201d</p><p>David laughed. \u201cYes, I imagine you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, is that why you smiled like that\u2014when we walked into the church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. The whole demon thing\u2019s kind of a private joke among my kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is there some truth to the myth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, then...why do people think holy water can burn you and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Powerful things, those gossip circles.\u201d He grinned mischievously. \u201cThe whole story started out, originally, when a vampire was found sleeping in his bed. The townspeople believed the man to be dead.\u201d David tapped his chest. \u201cNo heartbeat, you see. So, they buried him\u2014alive, and when he finally woke and dug his way out of the grave, he retaliated with murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetaliated? But, they didn\u2019t know he was alive, did they? It wasn\u2019t deliberate, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did he want revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame reason any claustrophobic, which woke to find themselves buried alive, would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaustrophobic?\u201d I touched my neck. \u201cHow can a vampire be claustrophobic?\u201d</p><p>David laughed. \u201cWe carry over many human traits when we change. We can be moody, thoughtful, arachnophobic, afraid of heights\u2014many things. We\u2019re still mostly human in so many ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this guy was afraid of enclosed spaces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And even if he wasn\u2019t, imagine, for a second, being trapped in darkness, compounded by a force you cannot see\u2014not knowing which way is up or down.\u201d He studied me thoughtfully. \u201cI told you a vampire\u2019s emotions are stronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis claustrophobic vampire woke in darkness, terrified. As he clawed at the soil for three days, his fear became anger and his anger became fury. When he finally took a breath, he vowed revenge on all who ever laid eyes on him. Then, he stumbled into town and obliterated every soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a bastard!\u201d</p><p>David laughed again. \u201cWell, he did leave one alive\u2014a small boy. Does that make him more likeable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy did he leave him alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy, who reminded him of his own son, attacked the vampire with the jagged edge of a broken branch. Amused by the fearless bravery of the boy, the vampire took the spike and jammed it through his own heart, faking his death to satisfy the boy\u2019s hunger for revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow noble of him.\u201d</p><p>David smirked. \u201cAnyway, from then on,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe human race decided, since the wood the child used originated from a tree on consecrated ground, that these Demons of the Night could be taken down by all things holy. Word spread and, like a disease, the rumours grew into the myths you still hear today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I considered his tale.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you know what the name of that small boy was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to tell me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, smiling. \u201cVan Helsing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a true story?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTrue story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...if that\u2019s true, why wouldn\u2019t you just correct them\u2014the humans, I mean\u2014tell them the truth about the whole demon rumour thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, the lies assist with our cover.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThose who can walk in the day, go to church or wear a cross, can\u2019t possibly be one of these demonic creatures, and so, we can remain secret\u2014live in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019ll find most of the myths about my kind were started in much the same manner.\u201d He smiled nostalgically and looked away. \u201cWe do love our grapevines, we who walk in the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrapevines?\u201d My brow arched.</p><p>\u201cHa! Yeah. Borrowed that one from your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was so not cool that you would\u2019ve been better off saying we do love a bit of intrigue.\u201d</p><p>David paused and studied me with soft eyes. \u201cYou would have fit well in my time, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fit in fine here, thank you.\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cSo, why didn\u2019t he wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampire. When they buried him\u2014why didn\u2019t he wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. He was drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get drunk?\u201d My words burst out in a gust.</p><p>\u201cOf course we can\u2014\u201d He laughed. \u201cWe can use drugs, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Do you get addicted, like humans do?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged dismissively. \u201cDon\u2019t know. Never met a vampire who used drugs. But I\u2019ll be sure to ask if ever I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d His sarcastic smile spread the corners of his lips widely.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, on with the interrogation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d He motioned a forward hand to me, as if ushering me through a door.</p><p>\u201cSo, vamp myth one-oh-one; a crucifix won\u2019t burn you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d David reached into the collar of his shirt and pulled out a heavy gold chain with a cross on the end of it. \u201cI wear it whenever I go to church.\u201d</p><p>I doubled back internally. \u201cSo, you are religious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d He smiled and dropped the cross to his chest.</p><p>\u201cBut, you\u2019re also...dangerous?\u201d I concluded.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d He smiled malevolently; a shudder crept up my spine.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to think of those who\u2019d come to learn that as their last lesson. Slowly, I started my questions again. \u201cHow can you believe in God\u2014and then go out and murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s nourishment\u2014necessary for survival. Does a farmer murder a cow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause a cow...\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cBecause they...well...\u201d I threw my hands up. \u201cI don\u2019t know. What do I look like, a priest?\u201d</p><p>David laughed. \u201cI love it when you know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not right!\u201d Anger forced pulsing blood into my cheeks. \u201cYou believe in the Ten Commandments, pray at church, read the Bible\u2014but you can kill the man sitting next to you without so much as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh, hold it right there, missy.\u201d He held up a finger; I snapped my gob closed. \u201cI said I believe in God, not the Bible, not the ways of the church. They are not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are they not the same thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive as long as I, and you will see. Now\u2014\u201d he folded his arms, \u201c\u2014we\u2019re not having a religious debate. There are more important things to discuss at this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d But I didn\u2019t want to talk. I was too mad.</p><p>\u201cCan you remember anything I\u2019ve told you so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can.\u201d He smiled, rolling his head a little to one side. \u201cRecite it for me or I\u2019ll read your mind just to check you were listening.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, fury turning to rage in my eyes. \u201cFine.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re...a...a God-fearing variation of normal human makeup, caused by a hidden polarity in the genes that\u2019s activated when vampire venom mixes with your blood after being bitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very fast learner, Ara-Rose.\u201d His face lit with surprise.</p><p>No, I\u2019m not\u2014I just hang off your every word.</p><p>David grinned. I looked away.</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many of us, you know. If that makes you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Good! \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it stands, fewer and fewer humans over the years have been known to have this gene. It seems to be breeding out. We\u2019ve not had a successful turning in decades. Consequently, my kind has been forbidden to create vampires without approval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForbidden? By who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a society. Just like you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live in peace, mostly, but there are laws we must follow, and consequences. We can\u2019t just walk around doing whatever we please\u2014or killing whomever we please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? So, the killing\u2019s controlled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d I unfolded my arms. Civility among murderers? \u201cWhat other laws do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d He looked over at the window for a second, then took a short breath. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to occupy positions of power or fame, in order to maintain cover. And, if we\u2019re in a situation or accident which would be fatal to a human, we absolutely must be reborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReborn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Start a new human life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that why you can\u2019t be famous or anything, \u2018cause it would be hard to hide after you \u2018die\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Especially these days with things like television and photographs. It makes disappearing really problematic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what else? I mean...can you fly, do you still grow hair, do you sleep upside down in a cave?\u201d</p><p>David scoffed lightly, pressing the back of his wrist to his upper lip. \u201cYou really love your myths, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cUr, well, we do still grow hair, so...sorry, if you become a vampire, you still have to shave your legs. As for sleeping in a cave...upside down\u2014\u201d He merely raised a brow to answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat about fly?\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated. \u201cLike I said...we can manipulate the elements. Some of us have mastered the ability to become completely weightless and move through the atmosphere\u2014suspended above the earth. But not all can, and it\u2019s only for short distances. It takes decades of practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, can you?\u201d I prompted.</p><p>Uncertainty controlled his smile. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so cool.\u201d It was the only cool thing\u2014everything else was disgusting and infuriating, but flying was cool. \u201cSo? What else can you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at this point, I can officially inform you that we are a secret society\u2014so, much of the information about our laws and abilities, I cannot divulge.\u201d He smiled, his eyes becoming small. \u201cEven though I already have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you can reveal yourself? People can know what you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly on one condition.\u201d He paused and took my hand. \u201cThat is why I told you I must leave, Ara\u2014in the hope that it might come to this\u2014to you finding out once and for all about me, about what I am. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve just left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you did to all the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou move on every two years; you must\u2019ve made friends. Am I the only one you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first human I\u2019ve ever told, yes.\u201d</p> <p>And for some stupid reason, that made me feel special, close to him. But I didn\u2019t want to feel like that anymore; I hated what he was, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I actually might\u2019ve hated him, too. But I knew that some part of me didn\u2019t want him to go away. Not for forever. My lip quivered. \u201cSo, you can tell me that you\u2019re a vampire, but you have to leave if you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d He pulled my face against his chest. \u201cSilly girl. No. I can tell you only if I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>My head whipped up to see his face when he went quiet. \u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess the right words are...my significant other.\u201d David almost read over his own words in the air, then, seeming happy with the terminology, looked at me. He smiled, pressing his finger under my chin until my teeth fit back together.</p><p>Significant other? \u201cBut...you\u2019re a vampire. I can\u2019t be your significant other, David. We can\u2019t even be together.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cWe can, if you loved me enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, you know I love you. But you kill people in order to live,\u201d a hint of hysteria touched my tone. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can be a part of that. Not as your friend, not as your lover, and certainly not as a vampire.\u201d</p><p>David froze in place, like a stone carving. The expression of confusion seemed eternally placed within his eyes, and his chest stopped moving as if he\u2019d given up breathing. \u201cBelieve it or not, Ara, it\u2019s kinder to kill them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr!\u201d My lip twisted up in disgust. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear anymore, David. Kinder? I\u2014I just can\u2019t even conceive of the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you have heard enough, then.\u201d A slight nod moved his head, but his face stayed frozen; the smile I loved completely blanketed by pain. \u201cI shall leave you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, don\u2019t go yet.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, but didn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014I just need some time to think. Do you think you can give me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I have is eternity.\u201d He snapped out of his intensely deep stare, shrugging, then leaned down and kissed the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t need that long. But, David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my love.\u201d He stopped by my door.</p><p>\u201cAre you in any danger? Because you told me?\u201d I hugged both legs to my chest. \u201cLike, will they be mad with you?\u201d</p><p>The door swung open and he stood between here and gone. \u201cNo. But if you ever say anything and they were to find out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything.\u201d I rested my cheek on my knee.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He gave a nod and disappeared, leaving my door swinging in the breeze he left behind.</p><p>I sat there, in the middle of my room, hugging my knees to my chest, until the afternoon turned to evening. When Vicki flicked the hall light on and came up the stairs, I ducked in the darkness, waiting until she passed. And I noticed then, crumpled at the foot of my bed, the damaged remains of the blue rose David stole\u2014the representation of the moment that changed everything.</p><p>I jumped up quickly, butt numb, legs stiff, and grabbed the flower, pressing it to my nose. Despite all the damage done, despite the petals falling away, weeping, it still smelled just as sweet as before. Which was comforting to me, because, for all the things that seemed irredeemable, some things were still okay.</p><p>I grabbed my diary and pressed the flower between the last pages, then snapped the book shut and sat on my bed in the dull light shining in from the world outside my room.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cAra, come down and have some dinner, please,\u201d Vicki called from the bottom of the stairs. Again.</p><p>\u201cNot hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d I slammed my diary on the bed and stomped into the hall. It just didn\u2019t seem right to go downstairs and eat dinner with the family\u2014like a normal person. Nothing was normal anymore. I mean, I should probably be telling my dad that I may have gone crazy, because I\u2019m pretty sure my boyfriend just told me he\u2019s a vampire. I smiled, stopping halfway down the stairs. That would be pretty funny\u2014to see the look on their faces if I said that.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Vicki rolled her head forward, raising a brow. \u201cYour dinner\u2019s going cold\u2014move it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d I started down the stairs again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s to be expected.\u201d She walked into the dining room and sat beside Dad.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I sat down too.</p><p>\u201cEmily called while you were resting,\u201d Vicki said. \u201cShe wants to come see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell her\u2014about why I fainted?\u201d Everything around me seemed to rock, then grow larger and wider, before rapidly shrinking back in.</p><p>\u201cAra, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Dad assured. \u201cWe told Emily you have low blood-sugar\u2014that you hadn\u2019t eaten. No one knows anything about your mom.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders dropped; I let out a breath of tension and drew back relief. \u201cSo, David caught me, huh?\u201d</p><p>Dad nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see him catch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s the weird thing. I wasn\u2019t really paying attention.\u201d Dad set the bowl of peas on the table and looked at me. \u201cAll I saw was David by the er\u2014well, David was a few feet away. I heard everyone gasp, so I looked over at you, then he was there, lifting you off the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He should join the track team,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He is really fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Ara?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just really tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you can fool some of the people all of the time\u2014but you can never fool your dad.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just\u2014David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid? What\u2019s he done?\u201d The warm blue of Dad\u2019s eyes turned to ice.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014nothing. He just. He has to go away soon. I\u2019m going to miss him, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away? Where?\u201d His tall posture seemed to shrink back down a little.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t wanna talk about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said slowly, then looked at Vicki.</p><p>With a sigh, I stood up and issued a pleasant smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t eat anything,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine, Ara.\u201d Vicki held a plate out to me. \u201cBut at least take some food up with you. You look skinny.\u201d</p><p>Stifling the urge to scowl at her and tell her to mind her own business, I looked up from my bony hips and nodded, taking the plate. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, honey,\u201d Dad muttered, way too casually. He knew there was something up, but he wasn\u2019t going to ask. Dads are smart sometimes, but even smarter to stay out of it.</p><p>There was no comfort for me in the dark tonight. I couldn\u2019t dream that I\u2019d wake up and meet David across the road tomorrow; couldn\u2019t fantasise about the day we\u2019d get married or how we\u2019d sit on a porch swing, rocking back and forth while we watched our grandchildren play in the yard, because those dreams were the darkness, now\u2014a haunting kind of darkness. They were what kept me going when I didn\u2019t want to breathe; they were what made me think that perhaps I wasn\u2019t cursed. But it was ever clearer that I was being punished\u2014haunted by those dreams forever\u2014because David and I couldn\u2019t possibly be together.</p><p>A dancing flame flickered against the wick of the vanilla candle by my bed; I sat in its gentle glow and blew out the match, breathing the cindering smell of wood as the flame withdrew. Across my room, the girl in my dresser mirror appeared; I touched my fingers over my face, over the scars, watching her do the same. Once, David had made it all okay; he made the scars seem faded, he made the days feel sunny, but now, despite the gentle glow of the candle taking some of the darkness from my room, he\u2019d also made the nightmares that used to hide in the shadows when I was a little girl peek out from the past. All the things my parents said weren\u2019t real\u2014all the monsters and demons\u2014actually were. I mean, there could be a bogeyman under my bed, for all I knew. And David was one of those monsters; he was the epitome of nightmares\u2014the very thing that made me draw my foot from the edge of the bed and hide it under my covers. But a small part of me wanted to accept him. A small part of me\u2014a very small, irrational and rose-coloured-glasses part\u2014didn\u2019t care. I just loved that damn vampire so much.</p><p>But at the same time, I couldn\u2019t separate myself from the idea of a life lost.</p><p>Then again, I wasn\u2019t sure I could live with myself if I let him go.</p><p>For such a short time, I thought I was going to be okay. David rescued me, showed me what real love felt like, gave me my first kiss. No one had ever kissed me like that before, and no one had ever told me they loved me\u2014and meant it. And now that was gone\u2014the hope of being with him always\u2014I just felt empty and more confused.</p><p>Disregarding my resurfaced fear of The Bogeyman, I flipped my legs over the side of the bed and wandered to my desk, opening my diary in front of me.</p><p>Dear Diary,</p><p>It\u2019s funny how love goes; you think you have morals and strong beliefs, but when you strip it all down, the truth is that I want to love him. I want to forget about what he is and just love him. But, by accepting him, I\u2019d be condoning murder.</p><p>On the other hand, I can go on forever not loving him, when there\u2019s nothing I can do to save those people, anyway. Will I punish myself for what David is?</p><p>I looked up from the pages to the phone by my elbow. I wished it would ring and, in my moment of weakness, I could tell my best friend everything. He\u2019d know what to do. But he\u2019d tell me to run. In fact, he\u2019d be on the first plane over here, stick me in a duffel bag, and carry me off to a faraway land, pack me into a crate, and stand guard for the rest of my life.</p><p>Okay, perhaps the phone ringing was a bad idea.</p><p>I dropped my head into my hands.</p><p>Outside, dotted twinkles of silver sparkled in the night sky; once, they were glimmers of hope for me, but tonight, stared back down into my insignificant little life, offering no solace or resolution at all. But matters of the heart; they were never solved rationally. Love is irrational. Love is unfair.</p><p>There would be no going back. No lazy afternoons by the lake, warm and safe in David\u2019s arms. We\u2019d never get married or have babies, never grow old together and get arthritis, and if I became a vampire\u2014never die.</p><p>Before I lost my family, death was always something that, for me, seemed years away\u2014hundreds of years. But in the face of immortality, all I could think of was how restless it must be to know you\u2019d never find peace, never reunite with those who\u2019ve passed, never find out what was on the other side. And sure, you get to live forever, but I bet the novelty would wear off pretty soon\u2014and then what? Then it\u2019s too late. And what if I became a vampire and, after a few thousand years, he got bored with me?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d a voice broke through the silence, \u201c\u2014could never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I shot up out of my seat and pinned my back to the wall beside my dresser. \u201cHow long have you been there?\u201d</p><p>He sat comfortably in the nook of my window, his back against the frame on one side, his foot propped up on the other. \u201cLong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo know that you\u2019re battle of conscience is not winning against your heart.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my hands flat to the wall behind my hips. \u201cOne will have to win eventually.\u201d</p><p>He jumped off the ledge, landing silently in my room. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, please\u2014\u201d I put my hand out; he stopped advancing. \u201cJust stay back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I tried to take a breath, but couldn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked up from his feet, smiling, with a hint of mischief behind his eyes. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m not afraid of that, right now. I\u2014you know how I feel about you. And knowing what I know about you should change that, but it hasn\u2019t.\u201d I touched my chest. \u201cAnd until it does, even a little bit, I won\u2019t trust myself to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s ludicrous, David. You kill people\u2014with your teeth. I should hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you want to accept me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means there\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you\u2019re just in love.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, reinforcing my warding hand when he took another step closer.</p> <p>He sighed, letting his arms fall loosely to his sides. \u201cIf I could perform a memory charm on you\u2014make you forget, would you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I didn\u2019t know; happiness was a part of my life when I was in love with David, the boy. All of this reality was just too unusual. I felt insecure, like I was walking on a glass cliff top\u2014sure I might fall through at any minute. But, would I want to love him if I didn\u2019t know he was a killer? \u201cYes,\u201d I said very quietly, looking down.</p><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t you accept me, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra, look at me,\u201d he said. \u201cLove is complicated, but you can\u2019t deny this is love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try.\u201d</p><p>His eyes, green and intense, searched mine. \u201cYou refuse my affections, you will watch me walk away, give up our love, for what? To make a stand against a natural predator? That\u2019s all I am, sweetheart.\u201d He slowly came closer, laughing softly. \u201cWould you give up your firstborn to protest against lions killing a zebra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem, David. I will be giving up my firstborn. I\u2019ll be giving up everything.\u201d I pushed away from him and darted across to my desk. \u201cI can never have a family, a life, not even a death if I choose you. I\u2019ve been over it\u2014there\u2019s no right way to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be so, but you still have a choice to make.\u201d His voice shook on the word choice.</p><p>My lip quivered and fresh tears stung the edges of my dry eyes. \u201cWhy did you have to make me fall in love with you?\u201d</p><p>David stood stiff. \u201cI didn\u2019t make you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I folded my arms and rolled my chin to my chest. \u201cBut I do love you, and now I have to choose between love or life and, David, I want a family\u2014like Mum had; I want a little Harry. I want to be a soccer mom and do carpooling and argue with my daughter about the boys I think aren\u2019t good enough for her. And then, one day, when I\u2019ve had a good life, with the man I love, I want to know what it\u2019s like to be old\u2014and die.\u201d I looked up, my eyes narrowed. \u201cCan you understand any of this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore than you know.\u201d Misery swallowed his voice, then he evaporated. A breathless second passed before he appeared on the edge of my bed, his face in his hands.</p><p>For the first time since his confession this afternoon, I really let myself look at him\u2014see him for what he was. I pictured the vampire, the monster, and under it, with his shoulders stiff, his grey shirt hugging the knuckles of his curved spine, was the boy\u2014the one with a heart, which was probably very broken right now. \u201cDamn you for being so cute.\u201d I slumped beside him on the bed. \u201cWhy did your uncle want you to leave with him the other day?\u201d</p><p>He laughed into his hands then sat up straight, wiping them over his jeans. \u201cI called him\u2014told him I was in love\u2014that I couldn\u2019t leave you when the time came. And he told me that was exactly why I had to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because I love you enough to wish I could give up everything.\u201d</p><p>That made me feel heavy and a little numb. If David had just gone, I would be so broken right now, but it would be normal. \u201cMaybe your uncle was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ara, please don\u2019t say things like that.\u201d The anguish in his eyes forced me to close mine. \u201cHave you even considered coming with me?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t answer him, because I couldn\u2019t give him the answer he wanted.</p><p>\u201cAra, please. For the sake of a few drops of blood?\u201d His voice edged beyond desperate. \u201cYou would throw away everything? You would turn your back on love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, David,\u201d I said. \u201cI won\u2019t turn my back on love. But I won\u2019t be a part of murder, of death, of fear. It\u2019s more than a few drops of blood. They\u2019re people. Does that mean nothing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does have meaning to me, but not in the way it does to you.\u201d He lowered his head, maybe ashamed of himself. He should be.</p><p>\u201cDavid, I will always love you\u2014to the very depths of my soul, but I won\u2019t live out eternity as an immoral killer,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmoral?\u201d With a slow breath, he floated up to stand and towered over me, casting a dark shadow across my face. \u201cYou think me\u2014immoral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, David, but...I do.\u201d I kept my head down, my eyes on David\u2019s clenched fist.</p><p>\u201cIf you could only see what you are doing\u2014what it will do to me to be without you.\u201d The energy\u2014the kind of force surrounding him that was normally warm and soft\u2014turned cold, chilling the air with a tearing sensation. \u201cI am not immoral, and I do have a heart\u2014feelings to be exact.\u201d</p><p>When our gaze met, my stomach tightened into my throat at the sight of the liquid agony in his very human eyes. \u201cDavid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Can\u2019t you see? Ara, you have no idea what you\u2019re giving up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew my heart, you\u2019d know those words are untrue,\u201d I whispered, looking away from the broken pieces of the boy I loved.</p><p>\u201cIf I knew your heart, Ara, I would\u2019ve known I should never have shared myself with you.\u201d He cut the air with his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said irresolutely. \u201cYou should never\u2019ve told me. I didn\u2019t want to know. I didn\u2019t need to know. Now, I have to lose you still, but it\u2019s worse, because I know you\u2019re out there, every day, taking life. And I kissed you. I let myself love you. And I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it, then.\u201d He nearly choked on his words. \u201cYou want nothing to do with me, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve given me more time. I wasn\u2019t ready for you to come back yet.\u201d</p><p>He took two slow steps away from me, touching his chest as the distance became greater. \u201cWell, have no fear, my love. I shall not make that mistake again.\u201d</p><p>He sounded a hundred years old to me, then. The weight of his existence tore down my walls as I watched him walk away, and somewhere inside me, a little voice screamed out, echoing from the depths of my soul\u2014warning me that if I let him leave now, I would never see him again. \u201cWait!\u201d I called in a breath of desperation, reaching for him as I jumped to my feet. \u201cDavid, wait.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, crouched on the ledge of my window, keeping his eyes on the night below.</p><p>\u201cPlease, give me more time. I\u2019m not ready to let go, yet, I just\u2014maybe we could have until the end of the summer, at least. But, I just need time to think about it.\u201d</p><p>David turned his head and looked into my eyes. Tears streamed down my cheeks, and when the vampire jumped back into my room and stood right before me, I didn\u2019t even flinch. Not one uneven breath escaped me. He leaned down and pressed his cold fingertips to my face, rolling it firmly upward to meet his. \u201cFollow your heart, mon amour,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen nothing in this world makes sense anymore, just follow your heart.\u201d</p><p>I drew a shaky breath and closed my eyes as an intense exchange of hope and fear consumed our souls and, in a flash, as I opened them again\u2014he was gone. Gravity made me stumble forward a step in his wake, his absence leaving my heart burning.</p><p>The night below my window, cool and quiet, regarded none of the tension in my soul. A lonely cricket hummed his perfect song, and I closed my eyes as the last day that life was everything I expected came to an end.</p><p>Squinting in the bright morning sun as my sneakers clapped over the pavement, I started down the street\u2014in the opposite direction of the school. I wanted to be as far away from that building as I could get.</p><p>I drew deep, throat-grazing breath of the near-autumn chill, blowing it out in a slow, controlled breath. I\u2019d almost forgotten how to breathe while running. I\u2019d let myself get so unfit that, instead of feeling free and fast now, I felt like I was trying to jump under water. But the tight stitch, the inability to breathe, and the sweat beading on my brow was all normal. And none of it was fair. I should be ignorant to all of it\u2014sunshine, birds singing, hearing my dad talking in the kitchen, or a car taking off down the street. No one my age should appreciate little things like that. When I wake up, my only dilemma should be which dress I want to wear. It sucked that I\u2019d felt grief so deep I could value the little things. And it sucked that I had to either lose the boy I loved, or become immortal\u2014and the fact that David killed people really sucked. No pun intended. The only trouble was, when I concluded not to love him, it hurt inside\u2014a physical ache in my gut, like the one that made me throw up on the first day of school.</p><p>\u201cHello stranger,\u201d a soft, soprano voice called.</p><p>I stopped dead and turned around. \u201cHey, Emily. Do you live around here?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and motioned behind her. \u201cSpencer lives here. I stayed over last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My eyes bulged. \u201cStayed over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She nodded. \u201cOh, I mean, not like that\u2014I was just babysitting his little sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I folded over a little, trying to catch my breath. \u201cDidn\u2019t you go to the wake, at Betty\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but Spencer\u2019s mom\u2019s a nurse. She got called in on nightshift after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014can\u2019t Spence babysit?\u201d</p><p>Emily scoffed, obviously humoured. \u201cHe\u2019s just not that kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I wandered over and leaned next to her on the brown picket fence. \u201cGive his mom my number then. I love babysitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will. So\u2014\u201d she looked down at my running shorts, then my sweat-covered forehead, \u201c\u2014I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb here and guess you were\u2014going to a ball?\u201d</p><p>We both laughed.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d I looked down at my shoes. \u201cI thought I better start getting fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cFit. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d my tone rose upward.</p><p>\u201cIs it David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d I sighed and sat down on the curb.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess\u2014\u201d she sat beside me, \u201c\u2014he\u2019s got you all confused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a talent of his, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. So, what is it? What\u2019s he done?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s a vampire and he kills people. \u201cHe said he loves me.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open a little, but nothing came out.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I laughed. \u201cI know, hey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, well, he\u2019s never done that before, either. Are you happy?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and sort of shook my head too.</p><p>\u201cHave you said you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Just wondering.\u201d</p><p>I tensed. \u201cIs that...a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhy would it be bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not really too good at this boyfriend thing. Normally, when I have this kind of crisis, I ring Mike, but\u2014\u201d But I couldn\u2019t tell him about this one.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019d laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor being in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. He never really takes that stuff seriously, you know. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always talk to me,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Em. But I think I just need some time to sort my head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd running helps with that?\u201d She tried not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cUh, well, it used to.\u201d I sat back, leaning on my hands. \u201cI used to run with Mike every day. It was like, even running with him, even talking while we did, I always came back feeling like I\u2019d left my problems behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that working out on this run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so good.\u201d I laughed, then stopped. I knew Emily was trying to get me to open up. She was using the exact same tactics as Vicki, without even realising it. \u201cWe had this band of seagulls on the corner of my street,\u201d I said to divert the conversation. \u201cWhenever we\u2019d run that course, the damn things\u2019d barely scatter a few feet in the air to get out of the way. It was really annoying. I always promised myself I was gonna put my foot right up their butts if they didn\u2019t move.\u201d I rested my elbows on my knees, my chin on my palm. \u201cMike called them gullsters...instead of gangsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, though? Did you? Kick them?\u201d Emily looked horrified.</p><p>Leaning back quickly, I said, \u201cNo! No way. Mike would, though.\u201d I stared ahead then. \u201cHe never had any problems kicking butt. I guess that\u2019s why he\u2019s so suited to the Force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s joining the...kind of like, SWAT unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Emily grinned. \u201cThat is super sexy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI guess.\u201d I breathed out slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry about him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Pressing my lips together, I slowly shrugged. I actually worried a lot. \u201cI just miss him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, why\u2019d you decide to move away from your real mom?\u201d</p><p>Gulp. \u201cUh, to be with my dad.\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded. \u201cDo you like it here?\u201d</p><p>After a deep breath, I looked down at the mildly busy street, then tilted my face into the warming sun as it melted the early-morning chill from my cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s not like home. It\u2019s not hot and dry, and there\u2019s no ocean in the distance, no black cockatoos on the lampposts, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still like it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I think I actually love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good\u2014\u201d she nudged me with her elbow, \u201c\u2014because you\u2019re starting to grow on us, Ara. Everyone was really disappointed you weren\u2019t there last night\u2014at Betty\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I smiled sheepishly and looked down at my untied shoelace, dangling, wet and muddy, from my sneaker. \u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I saw the whole save me, David, save me thing\u2014\u201d she held her forearm to her brow, pretending to fall backward a little, then dropped her hand, smiling. \u201cHe was really worried about you, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all were.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just because I didn\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mr Thompson told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He said you called last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She looked up then as a car pulled into Spencer\u2019s driveway. \u201cOh, I gotta go. My mom\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>I stood up and dusted the loose pebbles of asphalt from my shorts. \u201cOkay, Em. I\u2019ll see ya later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming to school today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, Dad\u2019ll give me the day off after what happened yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, don\u2019t be a stranger.\u201d She walked backward toward the burgundy car.</p> <p>I waved and turned toward home, then walked the rest of the street and landed, in a huffing mess, on the porch step near Vicki\u2019s grey cat. \u201cHey, Skitz.\u201d</p><p>He ducked low, growling at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I leaned forward, the creaky step dipping under my weight as I reached for the cat. But I drew my hand back when his growl intensified, moving deeper to the back of his throat, his tail lashing about. Then I noticed something grey and wriggly between his paws, and it wasn\u2019t his fat belly coming to life, either. It was a field mouse.</p><p>\u201cHey, way to go, Skitz. Good little hunter, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>He scoured the scene\u2014probably making sure it was safe to unveil his prey\u2014then tossed the mouse into the air and caught it in his teeth, pausing to scrutinize me.</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d Time to go inside. I stood up quickly, but my heel shattered the step under my foot\u2014dragging my shin through before my knee smashed into the edge of the top step, sending me forward onto my hands. Without thinking, I rolled over and pulled my leg free from the wooden cage, scraping the flesh back the other way, making it sting as a mix of blood and sweat smeared into the shredded skin.</p><p>\u201cOw! Ow! Ow!\u201d I hugged my knee, watching a purple line appear where it had cracked the upper step.</p><p>Not bothering to see if I was okay, Skittles bolted off with his catch of the day. \u201cTraitor!\u201d I yelled, blinking back tears.</p><p>\u201cAra? Are you okay, dear?\u201d I jumped a little as the front door swung open, disturbing the quiet. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad a fight with the porch step\u2014\u201d I took a breath through my teeth, rocking back and forth. \u201cStep won.\u201d</p><p>Vicki tilted her head and sighed. \u201cI told Greg to fix that weeks ago. I\u2019ll go get the first aid kit.\u201d She ran inside, leaving the front door open, and quickly came back to sit beside me on the remains of the once creaky bottom step. \u201cWhat were you doing out here anyway, Ara? It\u2019s very early.\u201d</p><p>I winced as she smoothed some sterile solution down the minced skin on my shin. \u201cI went jogging.\u201d</p><p>She stopped for a second. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were jogging again. That\u2019s really good to hear.\u201d She sounded pleased\u2014with herself.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Guess it is.\u201d Except, it wasn\u2019t a sign of my recovery, but more of my isolation and desperate need to figure my own head out.</p><p>\u201cDid you see Skittles out here, by any chance? I thought I heard his bell. He has a vet appointment this morning and I want to bathe him before we go.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he\u2019ll need one now,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She covered the cut with some gauze and tape.</p><p>\u201cHe caught himself a nice, juicy mouse,\u201d I probed, watching her face for disgust. It licked her expression without any further prompting. Sam would definitely be bathing Skittles now. Victory move. I one-upped him and he wouldn\u2019t even know it was me.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you let him do that, Ara? You know how I feel about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cVicki, he\u2019s a cat\u2014they kill mice. It\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d And as soon as I said it, everything slowed down around me. The cat killed. I praised him for it. I all but patted his head not more than two minutes ago. But I\u2019d never punished him. And yet, for some reason, I\u2019d been punishing David for doing exactly the same thing, in the only way I knew how; by denying him my heart. Deep down, the real truth I didn\u2019t want to face was not that he was a vampire, but that, like he said, if I loved him, then there must be something wrong with me. But I loved him anyway\u2014for who he was, vampirism aside. Mouse catching aside. David wouldn\u2019t kill if it weren\u2019t necessary. He was a good, kind person, but also a vampire. It wasn\u2019t the same thing.</p><p>Vicki waved her hand in front of my face. \u201cAra, are you all right, dear?\u201d</p><p>Blinking, I snapped out of my trance. \u201cUh, yeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come on, we\u2019ll go inside and yell at Dad for not fixing that step.\u201d She took my hand and helped me to stand.</p><p>\u201cActually, Vicki, I think I\u2019ll just go sit on the swing for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She frowned, then smiled. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be inside if you need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um\u2014\u201d I almost laughed, \u201c\u2014thanks, Vicki.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and walked back up the stairs. When the front door closed, my smile dropped. I stumbled clumsily over the hedge fence at the side of the house and into the backyard. Then, as I righted myself and looked up\u2014met with the eyes of a vampire. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>Perfect as always, he leaned casually against the oak tree, with one hand in his pocket and a very sexy smile across his lips. \u201cHello Ara,\u201d his tone seemed to sing the words.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d</p><p>David looked down at his feet as he shuffled up, very human-like, from his lean against the trunk. I loved it when he looked human. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d He offered his hand.</p><p>\u201cI, uh\u2014\u201d I looked at his long, outstretched fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He dropped his hand. \u201cOkay...I\u2019ll go then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2014\u201d I stepped forward, reaching for him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d I smiled sheepishly down at my bleeding leg.</p><p>His eyes followed mine, his brow pinching when he saw the gauze. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I flopped down on the ground in an exhausted heap, my legs and arms sprawled out to the sides. \u201cApparently I\u2019m heavier than I used to be.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, gently bending my sore leg at the knee as he squatted down. I tensed a little, rolling up at the waist to watch him rest a sweet kiss to the purple bruise. \u201cYou will never have to be afraid of me, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a vamp\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He extended his hand and helped me to sit up. \u201cAnd it would take a lot more than a line of blood across your skin to make me hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it doesn\u2019t bother you\u2014the blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sat down across from me.</p><p>\u201cThen, it doesn\u2019t make you want to bi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He placed his finger to my lip and nodded toward something behind me.</p><p>I stiffened. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicki.\u201d He looked back at me. \u201cShe\u2019s watching us from the laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...what\u2019s she doing in there\u2014just watching us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d David\u2019s intense stare softened to a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s bathing a cat, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I spun around to see her struggling with something in the sink\u2014something smudgy and dark-grey\u2014almost slimy, with claw-ending tendrils thrashing out of the tub every few seconds. \u201cWhy is she bathing the cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I have no idea.\u201d</p><p>I turned back, folding my arms, probably wearing a scowl, too. \u201cIt was a rhetorical question. Sam was supposed to be doing it\u2014as payback for...well...never mind.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell him I mucked around with my little brother like a seven-year-old. \u201cThose deep scratches were meant to be for him.\u201d</p><p>David laughed. \u201cRevenge will not bring satisfaction, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays you,\u201d I scoffed, biting my teeth together.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to get back at Sam for hitting you with a towel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d</p><p>David only smiled, ignoring that question. \u201cYou might try stashing dirty cups in his room for Vicki to find, then perhaps she will punish him with the dishes for the next month.\u201d</p><p>I grinned\u2014a wicked grin. \u201cYou are evil, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to little brothers, yes, I have a few tricks up my sleeve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, um...\u201d I checked behind me, then whispered, \u201cCan we go somewhere? Talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to change first?\u201d David grinned, nodding toward my shorts and zip-up jacket, but stared just a little too long at the space right below my navel.</p><p>If only I knew what he was thinking then, when he looked at me that way.</p><p>\u201cInappropriate things, Ara,\u201d said the annoying mind reader.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>His lips moved, twitching, while his smiling eyes changed shape several times. \u201cGo get changed. I\u2019ll meet you in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I said, stopping when my words struck an empty yard. \u201cDamn it, David.\u201d I stood up, dusted myself off and went to get changed.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The warm air of the fading summer skimmed across the glassy surface of the lake, filling my lungs with the scent of grass and clay. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see this place again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d David smiled, already laid out on the picnic rug.</p><p>\u201cWell, because, obviously, this place has no hold for me without you in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you weren\u2019t planning to see me again.\u201d He nodded to himself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I just...I thought, you know, after I broke up with you the other day that, maybe, I wouldn\u2019t get the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to give up on you that easily.\u201d He paused then, thoughtful. \u201cDoes it make you afraid? To be here alone with a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no different to before, really.\u201d I slumped on the rug, across from David, tucking my dress under my legs as I sat. \u201cI\u2019ve always been out here alone\u2014with a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d sadness stole his smile, \u201c\u2014now, you\u2019re repulsed by me.\u201d</p><p>I twiddled my fingers in my lap. \u201cI was wrong to react that way, David. I\u2019m not repulsed by you, not really. I just...I have to separate it in my mind; this boy I\u2019m in love with from this vampire who kills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you separate it? Why not just accept it\u2014accept me, for what I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I accept it in my own way. It\u2019s like, I mean, if you were lost in the wild after a plane crash and had to eat the pilot to survive, no one would think anything of it. Humans are the element of your survival, and...I don\u2019t think that changes who you are inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does, my love. You said it yourself\u2014you couldn\u2019t see me being a guy who liked blood and gore. If I kill, if I enjoy killing, that has to change what you thought I was.\u201d</p><p>After thinking about that for a second, feeling the pull of nerves in my throat, I shook my head. \u201cNo. You\u2019re a good guy. I know you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now. I wasn\u2019t before I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to convince me to hate you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Only make you realise that you can\u2019t just say you accept me for who I am. I am a vampire. I kill people. Some of them you may have met. If you accept me, you have to accept me for everything I am. Not just the lie you tell yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019ll take more time. Baby steps.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBaby steps. Fine. But we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Making the decision to accept that I still love you was the hard part. I should move along from despise and repulsion quite quickly after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnto what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtreme bliss, hilarity\u2014the mind\u2019s way of dealing with what it doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cMaybe true acceptance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you\u2019re not about to come hunting with me or anything, are you?\u201d He smirked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tried not to be offended, but I actually really just wanted to slap him. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He looked down by his leg and brushed a few leaves away that fell from a tree. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t want me to leave with my uncle?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll give me until the end of the summer, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s all we can have.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth turned up ever so slightly. \u201cBut, you won\u2019t give me forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d I laughed the word out. \u201cThat used to have such a different meaning to me.\u201d I smiled and looked away. \u201cI can\u2019t even comprehend eternity, David. It\u2019s too much for my puny human brain to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. Try this\u2014think of the longest day you\u2019ve ever spent,\u201d he said, sitting up.</p> <p>I thought of Wednesday\u2014the day before the funeral; a whole day not knowing if I\u2019d ever see him again.</p><p>\u201cNow, spend the rest of your life like that,\u201d he said, his voice dropping.</p><p>\u201cIs it really that miserable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of it.\u201d He tried to smile, shifting his fingers from the tangled hold in his hair to the ground beside him. \u201cThere are good things. But you get tired sometimes, you know? And then, once in a while, if you\u2019re lucky, you come across something that makes your life worth living.\u201d</p><p>I held the smile on my lips, but it went stale in my soul. \u201cAnd what about when I\u2019m gone? Will you find another person to love, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, you just don\u2019t get it.\u201d He shook his head, leaning back on his hands. \u201cThere was a time where I was just existing, and I never knew any better. But when I saw you, when I held you, you burrowed right into my soul, Ara. You reached a part of me that has never been touched before and I\u2014\u201d He looked away. \u201cI\u2019ll never be the same again. Wherever I go, whatever I do in this world, I will never find another reason to live as good as you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you love me that deeply, can\u2019t you just stay with me then\u2014be human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not human, Ara,\u201d he said, poorly disguising the ache in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never will be human. I\u2019m a vampire. Even if I could get approval to stay with you for the next eighty years, what then? I\u2019d have one measly lifetime with you\u2014pretending all the while to be human, watching you age just a little bit more each day, until every ounce of life withers away from your soul and I lose you for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut at least we would have lived\u2014been a family, had a life together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne life. One. When we could have an eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s it; no negotiation? Your way or the highway?\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my way, girl. Do you think I want this?\u201d He pointed to his chest. \u201cGod, even if I was willing to stick around to watch you die, it\u2019s not up to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, who decides?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe World Council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we reason with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Discussion closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, humour me, please\u2014just stop pushing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why can\u2019t we reason with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they do not negotiate the laws. Vampire\u2019s in my position stick to their Sets\u2014no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we call the communities we belong to\u2014clubs, sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire clubs?\u201d My brow arched.</p><p>\u201cI said sort of like clubs. They\u2019re there to protect vampires from your society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re the dangerous ones, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Do you know what could happen if vampires were discovered? It could start a war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that not be a good thing? You guys would win\u2014then you could live in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point, Ara. And we would never be in peace. Fear can turn good people into an angry mob. And then...what if we lost? We\u2019d end up locked away or in a science lab being tested on so humans could wield or recreate our powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, oh.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWithout a Set, you are exposed, out in the open\u2014no one to help cover up a bad kill, no one to assist with identity change. And I know better than anyone that vampires must be kept under a tight rein\u2014if not, they can become unruly. The law applies to all. Not just those who feel special because they\u2019re in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, it would only be for eighty years, then you could go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. They don\u2019t grant leave to people in my political position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolitical position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m a Set leader\u2014on the minor council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you really ask me to give it up for you, Ara?\u201d One of his eyes narrowed. \u201cBecause I could. I could leave, but I\u2019d be hunted like a dog\u2014face imprisonment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrison?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd why would I want to quit? I\u2019ve worked hard\u2014spent decades doing unspeakable things to obtain my position. I enjoy my job, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can\u2019t I just come with you\u2014but stay human?\u201d I asked carefully.</p><p>He shook his head softly. \u201cNo. It\u2019s against the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, either you become a vampire or I have to leave you behind at the end of the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes...does it hurt...to be changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2014say I decided to be like you, what then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t happen overnight. There are processes to go through. But we\u2019d take our time, prepare you\u2014get you used to the idea first. I wouldn\u2019t rush you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would I kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, is it random or do you choose them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He grinned and picked an ant off the rug, then tossed it onto the grass. \u201cI usually avoid eating comedians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked slowly.</p><p>\u201cBecause they taste funny.\u201d</p><p>I imagined a tumbleweed rolling past. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Sorry.\u201d He shook his head, smiling, then painted his serious face on again. \u201cEvery vampire is different, and the hunt or the kill, it\u2019s very intimate\u2014asking a vampire how he kills is almost as personal as asking what colour underwear he\u2019s wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I didn\u2019t realise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re in an intimate relationship, Ara, so it\u2019s okay for you to ask.\u201d</p><p>I liked that. I felt special. \u201cSo, how do you choose them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt used to be random\u2014usually women. Now, it\u2019s men. I stalk them for a bit, see if they\u2019re worthy of existing, if not\u2014\u201d He shrugged to finish.</p><p>\u201cAnd you enjoy it? The...kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>My body shuddered involuntarily. \u201cAnd you feel for them after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, I do. But only as bad as you\u2019d feel for knocking an old lady over in the street.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, I pictured an old lady falling from her walking frame. \u201cHow often do you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery couple of days. I can go for as long as five days, but it gets very...uncomfortable.\u201d He readjusted his position.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t so bad. At least it wasn\u2019t three square meals a day.</p><p>David chuckled lightly.</p><p>\u201cSo...are you hungry now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I would never be that irresponsible again. To be here alone with you would be dangerous if I were deprived.\u201d</p><p>Dangerous? \u201cBut you said...just before, in my backyard, that I never have to be afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I will never again take risks with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, have you ever wanted to...feed from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught in my throat, and an uneasy silence hovered around us. David\u2019s lip twitched, one eye narrowing ever so slightly, making my heart warm as I read the uncertainty behind his gaze. Then, I burst out laughing. \u201cYou should see the look on your face.\u201d I pointed at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not sure if you should\u2019ve said that, are you?\u201d</p><p>The sweet, familiar smile tugged at the corner of his lip for a second, then, it broke into a broad, honest grin as he laughed along with me. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to frighten or repulse you. I\u2019m never sure what to say.\u201d</p><p>I let my bottom lip slip forward into a pout for a second. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It must be hard for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard?\u201d He breathed out, leaning forward a little more. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you find it hard keeping yourself a secret, you know, your abilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Yes. Especially in emotional situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you always take off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, like that day at school\u2014\u201d He smiled leadingly. \u201cIn the hallway.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cDo you mean when I\u2014\u201d I realised then that he would\u2019ve seen everything I was thinking that day. I covered my cheeks. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIt was worse for me. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, you know. That hallway was full of people, and I just wanted to stand there and watch your thoughts unfold. Then, at the point I couldn\u2019t take anymore, I wanted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo float away or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked up from the ground and smiled. \u201cI was about to lift you in my arms and run, vampire-speed, to the storage room under the auditorium stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would not,\u201d I said, my tone ringing in question.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He raised one brow. \u201cI\u2019m a guy. Not a saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what...\u201d I crossed my legs under me, shifting nervously. \u201cWhat would you have done with me in there?\u201d</p><p>He left the long silence hanging, smiling down at the grass. \u201cI would\u2019ve demonstrated my affections for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...\u201d I played with the hem of my dress, \u201c...how exactly would you have done that?\u201d</p><p>David cleared his throat and sat back up from his lean, dusting the grass and soil off his hands. \u201cThis is getting off subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cSo, that was the reason you left school that day\u2014not because of my strawberry shampoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why leave? Why not just take me to the auditorium closet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d He frowned, curiosity making his eyes smaller. \u201cWould you have wanted me to?\u201d</p><p>Uh, yes. Hell yes. \u201cMaybe.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAnd what about now? Would you still want the same things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cSo, you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I were to kiss your neck?\u201d</p><p>My heart picked up. \u201cUm\u2014\u201d</p><p>He moved closer, taking my hand as he knelt before me. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and he brought my hand up slowly, placing it on his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd, what if I did...this?\u201d He tilted my chin up, exposing my neck, and slowly lowered his face to mine, stopping right in front of my eyes. \u201cYou still okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, breathing out.</p><p>\u201cHow \u2018bout now?\u201d His warm breath moved over my neck, slipping around to my spine as his lips gently made a line of kisses from my ear to my collar bones, his hair brushing my cheek, his shoulder right in front of my mouth, taking my hot, lustful breaths, and sending them back to me with the scent of David.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He rolled back up, keeping his hand against my face, and ran his thumb over my lashes. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWas that okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just the same.\u201d I shook my head, unable to believe it. \u201cAnd I love you just like before.\u201d</p><p>A smile broke across his lips, showing his fangs. \u201cYou cannot fathom the relief I feel, Ara, to have you know what I am and still let me touch you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that scary.\u201d I smirked, rubbing the moisture from my neck.</p><p>\u201cMy human self might not be. But you haven\u2019t met the vampire yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do I get to meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it might frighten you, Ara. And I. Never. Want you. To be afraid of me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m okay, now. If you scared me, David, you could always talk me around.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. After what happened in your room that day, I will never risk scaring you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I felt dead inside,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t touch you; couldn\u2019t be the one to comfort you. I...I felt so helpless, like you were screaming for me\u2014standing behind a glass partition, and I couldn\u2019t reach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you came across as rather in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. Do you know what it feels like when you can\u2019t touch someone? To be the one who placed fear in their eyes, and be powerless to take it away? I was terrified I\u2019d lost you\u2014\u201d his voice dropped, \u201c\u2014and I just wanted to hold you; just make you see me again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And that is why I will never show you the vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my ogre.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed aloud, his teeth showing as he rolled his head back. \u201cYes, and let me tell you, mon amour, after meeting the ogre at the funeral on Thursday morning, I will personally see to it that you never skip another meal again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d I looked down as I spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ll be gone by winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d He reached for my hand.</p><p>\u201cI know. But your world doesn\u2019t sound too appealing\u2014blood and death aside. You have a lot of rules. It\u2019d be like living with your parents for eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to keep everyone in line. If vampires had free reign, the world would be overrun with them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, is that what you do\u2014maintain the law? Is that what the council is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You might say I\u2019m the judge and jury. I see to it that the law gets followed and punish those who choose not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, do you get paid for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho pays you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll vampires pay a percentage of their wages to the World Council. Might call it vampire tax. And that\u2019s how we fund the Set, research facilities, and the lavish lifestyle of the council leaders.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds like a cult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d he laughed. \u201cI suppose it is a bit like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, now that\u2019s the organisation I want to belong to for eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are good things about it, Ara. We have a lot of fun\u2014we\u2019re like a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, if I came with you, even though you have to return to duty, we\u2019d still get to be together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Like normal people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWe could wake up beside each other every day.\u201d</p> <p>And those few words almost sold me instantly. I drew a deep breath, biting my tongue before I could tell him to take me away and turn me. \u201cAnd what about school? And what about my dreams of being a famous pianist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchool, you can still attend. But...as for fame...\u201d</p><p>My stomach sunk. \u201cCould I be famous without a face? You know, just sell my music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked into my lap.</p><p>David moved closer and pulled both my hands toward his chest. \u201cTell me something, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d I whispered, feeling my heart cry with the gravity of the shadows in his tone.</p><p>\u201cIf I were to leave today and promise never to come back, and you knew you would die an old, grey woman\u2014that you would meet your mom and Harry at the pearly gates\u2014\u201d He breathed out heavily through his nose, then looked into my eyes, \u201c\u2014but you would\u2019ve missed an eternity with me\u2014is that something you could live with?\u201d His hand tightened on mine. \u201cCould you watch me leave, knowing you\u2019ll never see me again?\u201d</p><p>The thought filled my mind like a roll of film from a sad movie or a Kleenex commercial: David, walking away\u2014saying goodbye to him for the last time, for forever. He\u2019d drive down the long, winding road, and when he disappeared over the distant horizon, I\u2019d turn around and walk away. My life would go on in the exact direction I planned for. I\u2019d marry, have babies and grandbabies, and a happy, full life\u2014but a life without David. And it hurt. It burned in a way I never wanted to feel. But while love could possibly shadow morals, it didn\u2019t quell my desire to live, to die\u2014to see Mum and Harry again on whatever the other side was.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He slid his fingers along my chin and turned my face toward his. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop making your life about Harry and Eleanor\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>My heart jumped with the mention of my mother\u2019s name. It had been a long time since anyone said that name. A tear fell onto my cheek where the cool air around the lake took the warmth from it, leaving a cold line down my face.</p><p>David wiped it with his thumb. \u201cSweetheart, you don\u2019t have to live in my world, but if you decide to stay human, you do have to live. I care so much for you. And this sadness you keep inside will stop you from finding happiness,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYour every thought, every path you take, is influenced by their death. It has to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you make it all okay. I can\u2019t live without you, David, I\u2019ve already decided that.\u201d His face doubled under my tear-shrouded vision. \u201cJust, living with your lifestyle, that\u2019s a different matter. How do I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to kill anyone, today. But if, at the end of the summer, you haven\u2019t come to accept murder, then you have to accept that we can only ever love each other from afar. Do you understand this?\u201d</p><p>With those words, my tears spilled past my lashes, and the reality of losing him suddenly became so much more potent.</p><p>He softened, touching the back of his finger to my trembling lip. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my love. I never meant for you to hurt like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I sniffed, wiping my tears away. \u201cI just don\u2019t really wanna think about you leaving for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He opened his arm and I slid over, nestling close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll change my mind about becoming a vampire once I\u2019ve had some time to think about it all.\u201d</p><p>He released a very long, very slow and shaky breath; I looked up, leaving the closeness of his body when I saw a tear in his eye.</p><p>\u201cDavid, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His knee came up as a prop for his elbow, his fingers tightly tangling in his hairline, while the sunlight emphasised shadows around his temples, making them seem deep\u2014showing contours of his face I\u2019d never noticed before. \u201cI was so afraid I\u2019d lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>No. You can\u2019t possibly know what I\u2019ve been through these past few days, Ara. There is no way to describe the agony I\u2019ve suffered, worrying that, even driving down here today, that you were going to tell me goodbye.\u201d He cast his eyes to the blue sky, then closed them for a second. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like...I am afraid I\u2019ll wake up in a moment and none of this will be real, you\u2014\u201d he touched my face, \u201c\u2014won\u2019t be real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m real.\u201d I touched his hand.</p><p>\u201cIf I had lost you\u2014\u201d He pulled away, resting his elbow back over his knee, \u201c\u2014If you had told me that you could never love me for what I am, I would\u2019ve died inside\u2014enough that I would\u2019ve spent eternity searching for a way to end my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you\u2014even think like that?\u201d I got to my knees in front of him. \u201cSuicide? That\u2019s a coward\u2019s choice, David. I don\u2019t ever want to hear you say that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, look who\u2019s talking.\u201d He looked up at me, kind of laughing. \u201cDo you really think I don\u2019t hear your thoughts, girl?\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open. He\u2019d obviously been listening to me a lot more than I thought. \u201cThose thoughts are private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you.\u201d He rose to his knees as well, becoming taller than me again. \u201cYou are my soulmate, Ara\u2014your life belongs to me, and I will not let you have thoughts like that. Not ever. Clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not clear. Those thoughts were...\u201d I looked around for the right words. \u201cWere images conjured up in a moment of extreme heartache and loneliness, David\u2014fleeting thoughts\u2014never intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you would never have acted on them?\u201d he asked, looking down at me.</p><p>\u201cGod, no. Never. But you would. That\u2019s the worst part about this. You lecture me, but you\u2014\u201d I stabbed my fingertip into his chest. \u201cYou\u2019d take the first express to purgatory if it meant easing your own heartache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it were possible for me to die\u2014\u201d he held back a smile, \u201c\u2014yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to say that. No matter what happens, no matter what life throws at you, you always have to keep going. I did.\u201d I pressed my palm to my chest. \u201cIt hurt me to keep going when Mum died, but what would you be doing if I just gave up when I wanted to, when the pain got too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it won\u2019t matter what happens to me in our case, because if you stay human, you will never know, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can get through it. You can live\u2014find happiness again.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head decisively. \u201cI won\u2019t be the same man if I lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one stays the same, David. Everything you are is as a direct result of something that\u2019s affected you in your past, whether it was horrible or wonderful\u2014and no one has the right to destroy themselves because they can\u2019t deal with the pain,\u201d I said. \u201cYou have to learn from it. It\u2019s not over\u2014the good in your life\u2014it\u2019s not over until you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>A pompous smirk occupied his face. \u201cPretty passionate about this, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve been there. I almost crossed that bridge a few times.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard, becoming suddenly very still. \u201cWill you come to it again when I leave?\u201d</p><p>Maybe. \u201cNo.\u201d I smiled. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t, either. Look, I know you can\u2019t die, but you have to promise me that no matter what\u2014\u201d I took both David\u2019s hands in mine, \u201c\u2014promise me you\u2019ll keep going, and that you\u2019ll try to make your life good again after I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean gone as in old-and-grey-dead, or gone as in you\u2019re-not-coming-with-me?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYou have to be prepared for it, David. What we have is so wonderful, it will always be wonderful, but it might just be a wonderful memory.\u201d I squeezed his fingertips until he looked at me. \u201cPromise me that if I choose to stay human, you will love again\u2014you will keep fighting for happiness.\u201d</p><p>David wrapped his wrists around my lower back and pressed my waist to his. \u201cI am nothing without you. I won\u2019t promise to go on, because it would be a lie.\u201d He kissed my brow. \u201cWhen you die, when you no longer exist, I will give myself to the monster inside me, Ara. I won\u2019t survive,\u201d he said, then smiled. \u201cYou will just have to promise me forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to. But today, I can only promise my forever\u2014not yours.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled heavily, leaning back, a mischievous grin igniting his eyes as he looked into mine. \u201cI\u2019ll make you see reason. I can be very persuasive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can be very stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that, mon amour, is one of the things I love about you,\u201d he said with a husky laugh. \u201cBut please, just don\u2019t be too stubborn. I only have until the last leaf turns red and falls from the last tree. Then, I must go.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing more to say. A choice had to be made. We could have the summer together\u2014it was our only promise. But everything else would just take more consideration.</p><p>I sat down between his legs, my back against his chest, his soft breath warming the top of my head, and awed the tranquil serenity of the lake for a while. Then, as my mind wandered over everything we just said, it stopped on one particular inquisition. \u201cOkay, so tell me?\u201d I squinted against the sun as I turned slightly to look at him. \u201cWhen exactly did you want to feed from me?\u201d</p><p>David laughed aloud. \u201cIt was right here on this spot, actually. The second time we came to the lake. Do you remember it?\u201d</p><p>He obviously didn\u2019t know how clearly I remembered everything he and I had ever done together. \u201cWhen you should\u2019ve kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was very stupid of me. Not just because I didn\u2019t kiss you when I had the chance, but also because I hadn\u2019t had blood in two days. Which would\u2019ve been fine if it weren\u2019t for these\u2014\u201d He ran his thumb along my lower lip; I closed my eyes, revelling in the tickly sensation. \u201cThen, to make matters worse, I had to contend with your warm, velvet skin, your sweet smelling breath and this.\u201d He placed his hand on my chest. \u201cI nearly completely lost control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but, after that day, I now know what I\u2019m capable of. I need you in my life more than I need nourishment. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2014\u201d he grinned warmly, \u201c\u2014kissing you shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I kinda knew.\u201d I laid back against his chest. \u201cI mean, I knew there was some reason you wouldn\u2019t kiss me, but I just never imagined it was because you wanted to bite me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed my forehead.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I mused, \u201cI suppose that\u2019s the best excuse I\u2019ve ever had for a boy not wanting to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ve been others?\u201d David asked, curiosity lifting his tone.</p><p>\u201cNo, well, one\u2014when I was about five. But that was because of cooties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, yes, cooties. Horrible disease. Caught it once, myself,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cWas it from a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t from a cat, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d David chuckled and pulled me tighter, kissing my forehead again\u2014like his lips couldn\u2019t get enough of me.</p><p>We sat still for a while, quietly listening to the sound of our own thoughts\u2014or maybe just mine. David and I could exist like this, in perfect unity, where the silent whispers of our minds filled the warm space around us. It didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. And despite him knowing every little thought I had, including things like needing to go to the bathroom, it, strangely enough, wasn\u2019t awkward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what I choose, you know I\u2019ll love you for as long as I live, right?\u201d</p> <p>He drew a long breath, becoming so still the only sound around us was the gentle songs of birds along the soft breeze. \u201cThen, I guess,\u201d he said softly, releasing his breath, \u201cI must hope that you will choose to live forever.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped his arms tighter around my shoulders and sat back, imagining it, as a darkened summer glow trilled across the southern sky, lighting the dusk with a brilliant red. The treetops turned orange first, and then, as the shadow of the night descended into the forest, I could no longer see the lake beside us, but marvelled at the heavens\u2014littered with thousands of brightly twinkling stars.</p><p>In that moment, there was no death, no immortality, and farewells were for the unlucky. There was only David and I, and the night\u2014forever.</p><p>For my forever.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p> <p>Leaning my shoulder against the window frame, I watched the sun rise over the hills to the east\u2014the very same hills David ran to when he stole the blue rose. It\u2019d been only four days since I was thrust into the world of the supernatural, but I still felt just as confused. No clarity had come with time passing. No decision had come waking me in the middle of the night, telling me if I should go with him or remain human. I was starting to wonder if it would.</p><p>The morning breeze brushed over the trees outside, forcing those below to hold onto their hats and papers a little tighter as they headed into the school. And I saw them all in a different kind of light now. Any one of them could be like David\u2014there was no way of knowing. They all looked so normal, so human. Like he did, I guess.</p><p>I looked down at my soft, pale white hands and the little blue veins running under the skin, rising slightly over the bones. These were the hands of a mythological vampire, not David\u2019s; his were warmer than mine, and pink and strong, and they shook a little when he held them out in front of him for too long. I wondered how much of that was well-rehearsed human behaviour, or really just the way his hands were, which made me wonder what he would have been like when he was human.</p><p>\u201cMorning, beautiful.\u201d He sprung up on my windowsill.</p><p>I stumbled back, hand over chest\u2014trying to stop my heart from leaping out. \u201cDavid. You have a habit of popping up when I\u2019m thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMm, but I think you already know that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and placed a paper bag in my hand, kissing my cheek as he stepped into my room. \u201cFor the ogre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. Yum.\u201d The warm scent of vanilla and cinnamon wafted out in a moist puff from the bag. \u201cAfraid I\u2019ll bite you if the ogre gets tempestuous again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke\u2014\u201d He pointed at me as he flopped down on my bed. \u201cYour bite is pretty sharp for a fangless wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays he whose bruises recovered in ten seconds.\u201d I walked over to sit next to him. \u201cYou want some?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you last night,\u201d he said softly, pushing the curtain of hair away from my face, totally ignoring my question.</p> <p>\u201cOh, what? You mean you didn\u2019t sneak into my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I came by to check on you, but I never stay if your dreams are peaceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know they\u2019re peaceful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see them.\u201d He grinned and laid back on my pillow. \u201cLast night, you were dreaming about Mike.\u201d</p><p>Dread spread through me, stiffening my arms.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d His lips turned up sharply, showing his fangs. \u201cSo, you remember your dream, then?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed, tucking his hands behind his head. \u201cLooked pretty intense to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re reading into it wrong,\u201d I said, trying my hand at dream analysis. \u201cI wasn\u2019t dreaming about Mike, specifically, just the friendship I had with him...that I now have with you\u2014only that with you, I have so much more. His face was a representation of our relationship, but the body,\u201d I scoffed, motioning to David\u2019s fine chest, \u201cwas clearly you.\u201d</p><p>David nodded, still smiling, with an edge of mockery in his eyes. \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said with a mouthful of pastry. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He sat up, dropping his elbows to his knees, his hands clasped. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cLook, I do love Mike, but it\u2019s a different kind of love. Here.\u201d I took his hand and placed it against my cheek. \u201cYou told me you can see the past if I let you\u2014see for yourself. Read my mind.\u201d</p><p>His emerald-green eyes darted over my face. \u201cReally? You\u2019ll let me read your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, exhaling slowly. \u201cThank you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pulled his hand down from my face. \u201cIf you say you don\u2019t love him that way, then I believe you. I don\u2019t need to see it in your memories. Just don\u2019t break my heart, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I promise. Now, can you stop hassling me and let me get ready for school? We\u2019re gonna be late.\u201d I popped the last bite of pastry into my mouth and kissed David on the lips. \u201cThanks for breaky, by the way. It was delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine it must\u2019ve tasted the way you would,\u201d he said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll never know.\u201d I winked at him, then practically skipped into my wardrobe. After I pulled my shirt off and snapped the clasp of my bra behind me, a warm, honest chuckle filled my room. I peeked around the corner.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you in this photo?\u201d David asked, without looking up from the small square sheet.</p><p>\u201cTwo or three, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy next to you is Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, and he\u2019d just tipped a bucket of bathwater over my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I kinda gathered that.\u201d David nodded, smiling tenderly at the picture. \u201cHe picked on you a lot, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Not much has changed, really.\u201d</p><p>David slipped the photo back into my nightstand where he\u2019d been snooping. \u201cYou were a very cute baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. So, what about you?\u201d I headed back to my wardrobe and shimmied into my jeans. \u201cDo you have any baby pictures?\u201d His pause of consideration turned into a long silence, so I stepped back into my room. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were some.\u201d He nodded, his gaze distant. \u201cMy father was never one for portraits. As Jason and I grew older and would sit for long enough, my uncle had a few done. There may still be one in existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your mother ever have one done?\u201d I asked, and David\u2019s eyes darkened instantly. I covered my mouth with both hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014that just slipped out. I forgot she passed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Ara, it\u2019s fine. Please\u2014\u201d he took my hand, \u201c\u2014don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am. I feel really bad. I should\u2019ve remembered that.\u201d I slumped down on the bed beside him, sucking my gut in a little since I had no shirt to cover it.</p><p>\u201cMake you a deal.\u201d He ran his thumb over my bra strap. \u201cYou can say whatever you want to me, if you do it dressed like this.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cShould I go put on a shirt?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me about her\u2014your mother?\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted to distant places. \u201cI mentioned once that she died when I was a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Childbirth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I clicked my tongue. \u201cAw, David.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt was common for those times, especially with Jason and I being a multiple birth. She simply gave birth, then fell asleep\u2014never woke up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she ever get to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe named me before she died\u2014since I was first born. Jason came shortly after, but, she simply had nothing left to fight with. Before the midwife even cut the cord\u2014she was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, did your father ever talk about her?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m told she was beautiful and loved by many. But, my aunt was the only woman I ever considered my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...what happened to her?\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s smile tightened. \u201cAnother time, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I stood up. \u201cAnother time, then.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but the corners of his lips indented his cheek with a slight dimple.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cDo I have breakfast on my face?\u201d</p><p>He stood beside me, taking my hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor dropping the subject\u2014without the usual fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for letting me into your past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d He nodded, but his tone suggested this might be the last.</p><p>School could not have been more boring this week. David was only in three of my classes, which meant that pretty much every second of my day sucked. After spending Monday and Tuesday in misery land, I got tired of my own moping, so, to entertain myself, started answering every question the teachers asked, even when I didn\u2019t know the answer. At least it was good for a laugh\u2014everyone else\u2019s. In fact, the new nickname of \u2018class clown\u2019 was beginning to stick. In Home Economics, I got scolded for laughing out loud while the teacher was talking, and it wasn\u2019t even my fault. It was David\u2019s\u2014despite him not being in that class. See, earlier, he\u2019d told me that vampires rarely fall in love with humans\u2014much the same as we don\u2019t fall in love with cows, since we eat them. Then, I saw Josh Granger ogling Mrs Tacony. But she\u2019s the biggest cow ever. It completely disproved David\u2019s theory...and then I laughed. Humiliation followed when the whole class looked at me, and the teacher demanded I share the comedy. I said I was sure I heard a fart.</p><p>Suffice to say, the punch David wore afterward barely indented his flesh and totally did not defuse my mood. But he took my moods well, laughed them off, mostly\u2014which was good, I guess, because, like David\u2019s murderous streak, my moods weren\u2019t something I could change. But, murder aside, I found one positive to his vampirism; we\u2019d definitely spent more time together. We were inseparable at school, and he spent every night in my room until, kissing me sweetly, he\u2019d say \u201cGoodnight, my love,\u201d then leave through my window before I could convince him to go further. The downside to all the extra time together was that I really felt it when we were apart. I really missed him.</p><p>In History class, I at least had Emily to keep me distracted. Well, when she wasn\u2019t turning around to giggle at her new crush, that is.</p><p>\u201cSo, you and David seem to be okay now?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah. We\u2019re happy.\u201d He\u2019s a vampire, but we\u2019re happy.</p><p>\u201cOh, and hey, I never got to thank you for hooking me up with Spence.\u201d She smiled, tilting her head into her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYeah, no worries. Did he ask you out on a real date yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, grinning in exaggeration of her expression.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to the Masquerade Ball.\u201d</p><p>And there was the squeak. One of the things I loved about Emily was the way she could display excitement so easily. She was just so...normal. \u201cAwesome. Got a dress yet?\u201d My enthusiasm needed some practice, though.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going shopping with my mom, tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Yeah, I\u2019m not looking forward to being dragged from shop to shop with Vicki, forced to try on everything with fluff.\u201d I laughed, but Emily frowned at me.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Vicki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, she\u2019s my stepmom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Duh.\u201d She slapped her brow. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t like her? I mean, \u2018cause you call her Vicki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, um\u2014old habit, I guess.\u201d I shrugged and turned around to talk to Spencer. \u201cSo, Spence, you gonna save me a dance at the ball?\u201d</p><p>His cheeks turned bright pink. \u201cAh, yeah. If that\u2019s okay with Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. As long as Ara doesn\u2019t mind if I dance with David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Cool with me,\u201d I said, practically digging my nails through my own palm.</p><p>\u201cYou three!\u201d Dad barked from the front of the class.</p><p>Everyone turned and looked at us. I shrunk to about the size of a quarter. Conversation. Over.</p><p>When the bell rang at the end of class, everyone broke formation and dispersed quickly. \u201cAra, come up and see me before you leave, please,\u201d Dad said, not looking at me.</p><p>\u201cYikes. That sounded like an order,\u201d I said to Em.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Ara.\u201d Her shoulders lifted a little. \u201cWill you be in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm, don\u2019t worry about it\u2014he\u2019s my dad. What\u2019s the worst he can do? Ground me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s worse than he can do to me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, slinging my bag over my shoulder as I walked away and stepped up in front of Dad\u2019s desk. \u201cSorry for talking in class, Mr Thompson. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He exhaled, leaning back in his chair. \u201cI appreciate that you\u2019ve had a hard time adjusting to a new school and, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m very happy you\u2019ve made new friends, but there\u2019s a time for work and a time for play. I don\u2019t want to catch you gossiping in class again or I will move you to Mr Adams\u2019 class. Do I make myself clear?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I forced back a grin. David was in Mr Adams\u2019 class. I\u2019d love it if he moved me. \u201cSorry, Dad. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Or maybe it would\u2014just a bit.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Now, how\u2019s that mythology paper coming along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Great. I\u2019m doing mine on vampires.\u201d I just decided.</p> <p>Dad raised one brow. \u201cIs that inspired by last week\u2019s intriguing lecture\u2014on Lilith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it is.\u201d And the fact that my boyfriend just happened to know that history firsthand. \u201cBut, if I determine that I believe the truth behind the myth...are you and Vicki gonna have me admitted into psyche care?\u201d</p><p>Dad laughed once. \u201cAw, honey. We\u2019d never do that. Even if you decide I\u2019m a vampire and try to stake me through the heart.\u201d His face softened away from his grin as he shook his head. \u201cI love you, okay? I know we\u2019ve been a little watchful of you lately, but it\u2019s because we care about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, you know Vicki cares for you, too.\u201d</p> <p>I scoffed unintentionally loud.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just trying to give you space,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll accuse her of trying to replace your mom.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cOkay, Dad. I\u2019ll try\u2014with Vicki. It\u2019s hard, you know. I\u2019m just afraid to let her in, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>His stern expression melted and he stood up. Then, even with his next class filling the room behind us, he still walked all the way around his desk and wrapped his arms around me\u2014really tightly. I patted his back, dreading the thought of everyone watching.</p><p>\u201cUm, Dad. Sorta need to breathe here.\u201d</p><p>The old man pulled back and held me at arm\u2019s length. \u201cI love ya, honey. Now get to class, you\u2019re late.\u201d</p> <p>I waved and threaded my other arm through my backpack, making haste for the exit\u2014with thirty pairs of eyes burning into my spine.</p><p>Warm water splashed over my wrists, spraying up in my face a little. I readjusted the faucet and rubbed my hands together under the soft flow of water, studying my face in the mirror. The last time I looked at myself in this mirror, I felt completely alone, isolated, unsure. But so much had changed since my first day of school, and even my reflection somehow looked different.</p><p>I smiled, drawing my hands away from the basin and dried them on my jeans as the door opened and two cackling girls came in with the steady breeze.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, new girl.\u201d Gypsy bumped her hip playfully with mine.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I shouldered my schoolbag. \u201cDid you guys come in here to bitch about somebody else today, or am I on the hotlist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you are on the hotlist.\u201d She leaned on the counter, folding her arms. \u201cRumour has it you and David Knight are an item.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumour would be correct\u2014this time.\u201d I folded my arms and leaned beside her.</p><p>\u201cYou know there\u2019s only one reason that boy dates girls\u2014and it\u2019s not love,\u201d Summer said, propping her hand on her hip.</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cHe loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Summer\u2019s eyes flicked to Gypsy. \u201cHe says that to every girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does.\u201d I stood up from my lean. \u201cBut, I bet he\u2019s never said it to you.\u201d</p><p>Her head bopped from side to side in the hollow of her shoulders. \u201cWhat if he has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I doubt that.\u201d I shook my head, gazing down my nose at her as I passed. \u201cYou\u2019re a little out of his league\u2014he only likes us ugly girls.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open, allowing for a high-pitched huff. \u201cYou bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Summer. I think that was a compliment,\u201d Gypsy said, looking a little confused. \u201cI think she just said you\u2019re pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a nice lunch,\u201d I called over my shoulder as I stepped out of the stinky toilet block, leaving them and their gossip where it belonged.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>The white glare of the open corridor framed the silhouette of a boy. \u201cDavid? I thought we were meeting in the auditorium for lunch.\u201d</p><p>He unhitched himself from the railing. \u201cWe are, but I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were late, so I went looking for you. Then I saw Summer and Gypsy, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw.\u201d I slid my hands inside his denim jacket and snuggled against his chest. \u201cYou were worried about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He kissed the crown of my head. \u201cI know you can take care of yourself, but I...I just didn\u2019t want them to make you cry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, David.\u201d I hugged him tighter, smiling like a little kid, breathing deep his vibrant, heart-tingling scent\u2014all sugary and mouth-watering. \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Knight!\u201d a booming voice shocked my thoughts from inappropriate paths. \u201cNot on school grounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, Mr Rogers. Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d David held me out from his chest.</p><p>I kept my face down until Mr Rogers passed. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see him coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what was I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarn me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled his secret smile. \u201cGetting sprung showing affection on school campus is not a good enough reason to step away when you\u2019ve got your arms around me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not for you, but he might tell my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d David started walking\u2014without touching me. \u201cHe was a boy once, himself. He understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does my dad. Except when it comes to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we won\u2019t touch at school, then. Will that make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just keep watch, next time. What good is a vampire boyfriend if he can\u2019t use his powers to keep you outta trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, I must be good for something.\u201d He grinned widely, opening the door for me.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a good kisser, but that\u2019s the human in you\u2014not the vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the vampire me hasn\u2019t kissed you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh.\u201d I pretended to feel a shiver down my spine. \u201cWell, maybe you should let him out for a while, then.\u201d</p><p>David leaned closer as we passed a group of students. \u201cMeet me under the stage, and I\u2019ll show him to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d</p><p>The second toll of the lunch bell rang loudly as David went to speak. He swallowed his sentence, remaining quiet until we reached the auditorium. \u201cAfter you,\u201d he said, opening the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you, kind sir.\u201d I curtsied, making him laugh. I loved making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d Ryan stood up and waved from the front of the room.</p><p>\u201cRyan. Emily.\u201d David nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s rehearsal going?\u201d I asked, stashing my schoolbag next to the group of desks.</p><p>\u201cEh\u2014\u201d Ryan shrugged. \u201cHaven\u2019t started. We\u2019ve mostly been making paper airplanes and seeing who can hit the lighting rig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds productive.\u201d I looked at Emily, who rolled her eyes and leaned on her hand.</p><p>\u201cThis might be a little cold,\u201d David said, sliding a tray of food in front of me, then flashed a wildly mischievous grin. \u201cI made it to the cafeteria line first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I sat down between him and Emily, digging my fingertip into the lukewarm nachos, \u201c\u2014you do run really fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Ara, did you get totally busted by your dad?\u201d Alana asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, not really. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in his next class\u2014saw him talking sternly with you,\u201d she said. \u201cEm said it was \u2018cause you were all gossiping during a lecture.\u201d</p><p>My brows rose. That had to be the most I\u2019d ever heard that girl say. \u201cUm\u2014no, he just wanted to find out how my mythology paper was coming along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing mine on fairies,\u201d Alana said in a dreamy tone. \u201cI love fairies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m doing mine on trolls,\u201d Ryan added. \u201cWhat about you, Dave?\u201d</p><p>David looked up from thumbing his phone, and the words he was holding back washed across his face; he hated being called Dave, but he\u2019d never say it. I smiled sympathetically at him. \u201cI\u2019m uh\u2014I\u2019m actually in Mr Adams\u2019 class. We\u2019re doing a different topic this semester,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d another kid added from the other end of our little rectangle of friends.</p><p>While the conversation continued, I excluded myself, watching David focus intently on his phone, wondering what he was doing.</p><p>He grinned without looking up, then inched his body closer so our shoulders touched and his screen sat between us. \u201cI\u2019m tweeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I whispered, reading the reply he\u2019d sent to an EricDelaR. \u201cI didn\u2019t know your kind used social media.\u201d</p><p>He laughed once and slipped the phone into his pocket. \u201cHow narrow-minded of you.\u201d</p><p>It amazed me how much more human he was around everyone from school, and how, now I knew what he was, I could see right through his poorly-executed disguise. His movements were so deliberate; blinking carefully, closing his eyelids a little too slowly, and he shifted on a counted beat.</p><p>One, two, three\u2014I made it to ten and he crossed his ankle over his knee.</p><p>One, two, three\u2014yup, ten again and he uncrossed it.</p><p>He turned his head and smiled, branching us away from the group conversation again. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer an odd count?\u201d His smile gleamed.</p><p>I nodded, and counted in my head. One, two, three; he ran his hand through his hair.</p><p>One, two; he picked up his cup.</p><p>Much better.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Ara?\u201d I looked up, like I\u2019d been sprung talking in class. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing yours on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Ara.\u201d Emily shook her head. \u201cDo you ever pay attention?\u201d I stared blankly at her; she smiled and said, \u201cYour mythology paper. What are you doing yours on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um...vampires.\u201d</p><p>David coughed beside me and shot up out of his chair, dusting soda off his jeans. \u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all right, man?\u201d Ryan frowned.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d He stood up straight, holding a now oddly-shaped cup out from his body, glancing over the wide stares of all the other kids at our table. \u201cYeah. Swallowed the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s cheek tightened on one side, and the others, not thinking anything of David\u2019s strange reaction, went back to their food and conversation.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I whispered, mostly talking through my teeth. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d he asked, his eyes widening for a second.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I stood up. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He jerked his head in the direction of the stage. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back,\u201d he said to everyone else.</p><p>\u201cOkay, don\u2019t be too long,\u201d Emily said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna kick everyone\u2019s butts soon and get this rehearsal into swing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d David nodded, though it looked more like a bow, then took my hand and led me away.</p><p>Is this just an elaborate escape plan\u2014to get me in private?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d David said.</p><p>Hmph!</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>The heavy black door creaked as I pushed it open, and David ducked under the low frame, closing us into the musty darkness, thick with the smell of latex and old books.</p><p>\u201cAra, you can\u2019t do your paper on va\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut his words off with my lips, flinging my arms around his neck; he attempted protest, laughing under the kiss, but, after a deep breath, slid his long, elegant fingers up the sides of my face, finally letting me have my own way.</p><p>\u201cShow me the vampire,\u201d I whispered into the hollow of his mouth.</p><p>He pulled away softly. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I grinned. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re in a perfect place for me to try really hard not to scream.\u201d</p><p>He clicked his tongue, shaking his head. \u201cDo you even understand what the vampire is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA less guarded side of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Very much so. And he may be inclined to bite you or, at the least, be rough with you, perhaps even do things I might regret after.\u201d</p><p>That only made it harder for me to breathe. I knew, deep down inside, that David would never actually hurt me, so the thought of biting only stirred the idea of him as a primal being, all his emotional guards down\u2014just David; raw, instinctual, completely exposed David. And I wanted it bad.</p><p>I jumped up and wrapped my legs around his waist, forcing his lips open with mine.</p><p>\u201cAra, please,\u201d he groaned loudly, but tucked his hands under me, beneath my dress, and finally took control of the kiss. \u201cYou know, you really shouldn\u2019t wear dresses to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it off me, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d His breath burst from his lips in a cool gust. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that. I haven\u2019t eaten enough for this kind of misbehaviour, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday morning\u2014right before I brought you the pastry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two days. You should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He set me down on the ground, and my toes tingled with prickling pins. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, be sensible.\u201d</p><p>I chewed the tip of my finger for a second, attempting control, but it was just too much\u2014his skin, his warmth, his chest under my breath; I slid my fingers into the neckline of his jacket and pushed it away from his shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to take no for an answer, do you?\u201d he said, casting the jacket across the room.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a no,\u201d I teased, moving closer. \u201cSo, you gonna show me this vampire, or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Ara?\u201d He took a small step back. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the sudden change of heart?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not sudden\u2014not for me. I just...I like you.\u201d I walked forward and linked my fingers together behind his neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve kinda come to terms with this vampirism thing, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d he said through a smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I guess...I guess I\u2019m ready to know all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what\u2014even if it scares you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it would, David. I...can\u2019t you tell?\u201d I touched a hand to my chest. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p> <p>He took a breath and cast a long glance to the darkest corner of the closet. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty convincing argument, I must admit.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at him. \u201cSo you\u2019ll do it? You\u2019ll bite me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I show you the vampire, Ara, I can\u2019t actually bite you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if my fangs break your skin, you\u2019ll be injected with venom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, if you\u2019re injected with venom, you\u2019ll...it\u2019s just a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d We stared into each other, both of us clearly thinking it all through, and in the dim light of the room, his eyes almost looked black, as if the pupils had flooded the green, like dark desires overshadowing sensibility.</p><p>He unlatched my hands from around his neck. \u201cWe should get back out to rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I grabbed his sleeve. \u201cWhat if...I mean, when humans bite playfully, we don\u2019t actually break the skin.\u201d I looked at his neck. \u201cCan\u2019t you do it like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He frowned, thoughtful. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never done anything like this with a human before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here.\u201d I leaned closer. \u201cLet me show you how it\u2019s done.\u201d Before he could stop me, I pushed his jaw to one side, rising onto my toes as my teeth glided over his flesh, coming closed again with a mouthful of David between them. Under the moisture of my tongue, his sweet scent became his flavour\u2014the lovely orange-chocolate replacing the gritty, salty taste I\u2019d expected.</p><p>I bit down harder then, with every ounce of force I could muster, catching the tendon in his neck, feeling his jaw stiffen, his arms tense, his ear move away from my cheek as he opened himself up to me, and I loved it.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ara, you have the sweetest little bite.\u201d He placed his fingers loosely around my face, but they went tight suddenly and he pushed me away. \u201cOuch!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I wiped my mouth dry with the back of my arm. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you little leech.\u201d He cupped his hand over the bite then looked at it. \u201cI may not have a heartbeat, but I still feel pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bruising.\u201d I squinted through the dull light to see his neck.</p><p>\u201cI know. I can feel that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d He laughed, scooping his hands under my bottom, lifting me so my legs wrapped around him. \u201cThat felt amazing. It hurt, but damn it was hard to control myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked down to where the apex of my thighs met his stomach. \u201cI wanted to do...things to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kinds of...things?\u201d</p><p>He reached up slowly and slipped the shoestring strap of my dress down my shoulder. \u201cVery bad things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me, then?\u201d I closed my eyes and tilted my chin up\u2014exposing my throat. \u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is a very big turn-on.\u201d</p><p>I giggled.</p><p>\u201cUrgh.\u201d He rolled his head back. \u201cDon\u2019t do that adorable giggle. You\u2019ve no idea how crazy it makes me.\u201d</p><p>I did it again, laughing louder when his upper lip and nose pressed into the sensitive hollow of skin between my collarbones, the stubble on his chin scratching my chest. \u201cThat tickles.\u201d</p><p>He grazed his teeth playfully along my flesh; they felt sharp, like the edge of a blade. I knew the control he would\u2019ve used to stop them cutting, but for some reason, a deep part of me, a part that rose too close to the surface, really didn\u2019t care if he cut me. I wanted to be cut by him.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it normal for me to think this way?\u201d</p><p>He laughed into my skin, kissing but not biting. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you won\u2019t, right\u2014you won\u2019t cut me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t. But I am going to feel your flesh against my teeth.\u201d He turned us to the side and placed me on the table, stepping in closer until his hips once again rested between my thighs. \u201cDo not scream,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt will only excite the monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that not a good idea?\u201d</p><p>His hands flew up and tangled in my hair, his thumbs on my cheeks, holding my face in front of his. \u201cIf you do...you will die.\u201d</p><p>I held my breath, lost in the intensity of his penetrating gaze. But something inside told me not to worry. Maybe it was the way he held me, his hands so tight around my face, or maybe it was the concern in his own eyes that made me sure he would never let himself destroy me. My jaw jutted forward a little, my bottom lip catching his in a delicate kiss\u2014a wordless reassurance. He kissed back, his eyes closed, his lips soft, moist, cold, like the lips of a person who just ate ice. And as it intensified, as his hands slipped beneath my dress again, finding my hips, bare and waiting, I grinned playfully, resting back on my hands. Undress me.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Ara.\u201d He became as taut as a statue. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how close you are to losing your innocence right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d I lifted my dress a little.</p><p>David stood taller, looking down at my floral-print undies. \u201cTo lose your virginity in a closet space?\u201d</p><p>I parted my legs a little more, inviting his touch to where his eyes and thoughts lingered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His heavy breath stopped, his hand slowly reaching toward my upper thigh, then he grabbed it firmly, letting his thumb fall against my delicates. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t play games like this with a dangerous predator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dangerous predator shouldn\u2019t bring young girls into dark spaces\u2014alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a problem if that girl would stop showing the vampire parts he\u2019s wanted to see for the longest time.\u201d He lowered my dress and smoothed it over my legs.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think maybe she\u2019s wanted to show him for the longest time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cWhy do you say things like that? I want to do any number of unsavoury things to you, right now, including kill you. Can you comprehend that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes this so romantic. I know you won\u2019t, even though you want to.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, frowning over a smile. \u201cOnly you could think something like that is romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d I ran my fingers from the tip of his hairline, over his skull and to the back of his neck, feeling his hair slip through them. \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire. Don\u2019t even pretend you don\u2019t think it\u2019s romantic.\u201d</p><p>A breathy laugh parted his lips. \u201cI really love you, Ara. You are just so perfect for me.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my head to the other side, lengthening my neck. \u201cGood. Then show me what it feels like to be under the spell of the vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d His eyes met mine with hesitation. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that...a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean...\u201d He looked at my neck, running his thumb over the pulse. \u201cYou know my teeth are sharper than yours. Even if I only use my front teeth, chances are I\u2019ll cut you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI know you can control yourself when it comes to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but...I\u2019ve wanted to\u2014for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, cut me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Eat you, feel your blood pulse under my teeth, see the life leave your eyes, breath leave your lips.\u201d</p><p>I let out a slow huff. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He laughed timidly. \u201cIt\u2019s a vampire thing, and I\u2014I\u2019m afraid I might enjoy hurting you, Ara. If...if we do this, and the vampire in me takes control, there will be no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in...you\u2019ll kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. Or I will not be able to stop thinking about killing you\u2014hurting you\u2014even after the day is done and we\u2019ve parted ways.\u201d</p><p>I thought about that for a second, feeling a mischievous smile creep its way into the corners of my eyes. \u201cThen it\u2019ll be a true test of our love, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, sweeping my hair away from my shoulder. \u201cIt will be a test of my willpower.\u201d And before I could respond, his teeth started my heart, coming closed tightly around my flesh. I squirmed, a cold shiver running down my spine while hot blood rushed up under the grip of his bite. Everything in me from toes to shoulders tensed, the tendon in my neck going rigid like wet rope, and all the nerves under it screamed out in agony while my heart pleaded for more, my flesh burning in an intensely good way. He kept his fangs distant, but every now and then, they brushed against me like the pointed tip of a blade run softly over flesh.</p><p>\u201cBite me harder, David.\u201d I grabbed his arms, digging my nails in, half pushing him away, half pulling him closer. I felt his body turn cool against mine, like the heat of desire pushed his hunger deeper, making him icy between my legs. And he became more ferocious, losing himself to the bite, his hands searching my body wildly, travelling under my dress, demanding my craving skin crawl into his touch. I crossed my ankles over his hips, imagining my clothes were gone and I could feel his bare chest smoothly against mine.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I squeaked as he bit down harder, pressing me against the chairs stacked on the table. \u201cDavid, it\u2019s hurting a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He shoved the chairs off with a quick push and rolled me onto my back as they crashed noisily to the floor. The people outside laughed raucously, their familiar, human sounds setting my heart on fire.</p><p>\u201cDavid. Stop.\u201d</p><p>My neck burned where he pulled away, but he didn\u2019t stop; he moved to the other side and wrapped his lips hard around my skin as I pushed against him. I felt the scrape of his fangs, sharp, as if he\u2019d cut through, stinging like a thousand hot little needles under my skin.</p><p>\u201cDavid. It\u2019s hurting.\u201d</p><p>He cupped a hand under my bottom, slipping my underwear past my hip on one side as he dragged me closer, thrusting his pelvis into mine. And though I wanted him to\u2014wanted him to make love to me right here on the table, I also wanted him to kill me. I could see it all, as if his intentions became my thoughts. But I didn\u2019t want to die. I didn\u2019t want David to have to live with the regret of killing me.</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d I burst into tears. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d He looked down at me, confused.</p><p>I shoved him away and rolled up to stand\u2014darting across the room to the safety of the wall. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d He appeared in front of me, eyes wide, pupils completely swallowing the green. \u201cDo what, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop?\u201d My voice broke.</p><p>\u201cOh, my love.\u201d He reached for me; I yanked away, the energy between us turning stone cold. \u201cAra, I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t realise you were frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to stop.\u201d I looked up at him. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty clear indication, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But, I\u2014\u201d He rubbed his brow. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you. I only tasted your tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was drawn in completely. Compelled by the scent of adrenaline\u2014the fear\u2014it makes the hunger unbearable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I cupped my hand to the burning on my neck; he hadn\u2019t broken through. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bite me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He frowned as if the suggestion insulted him. \u201cI would never do that. I always had control over that. I just\u2014\u201d he turned away, \u201c\u2014I couldn\u2019t control the vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same? I mean, the bite is the vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cThe bite is the hunger. The lust before is the vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I touched my collarbone. \u201cSo, you wouldn\u2019t have bitten me?\u201d</p><p>He rushed in close and cradled my face in hands. \u201cNot in a million years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, why couldn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cI can hear the resonance of your voice in my head now, but I was so lost in your velvet touch, I could think of nothing but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I wouldn\u2019t have done it, anyway. Not with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with me? What do you mean?\u201d I folded my arms as he walked away. \u201cWhat wouldn\u2019t you have done with me?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring my question, he leaned against the table and reached his hand out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hesitantly took it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you, my love.

Ever.\u201d He looked up from the bruising, the promise of his words filling out the green in his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I want you to?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened, but his smile remained soft. \u201cNo. Not ever again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, I liked it.\u201d I pulled my hand down from my neck and gasped, seeing a red smear.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He caught my wrist, holding it away from him. \u201cI was hoping you wouldn\u2019t notice that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...I mean...how...did you cut me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just from the er...sucking.\u201d One corner of his lip quirked upward. \u201cI drew your skin a little too...eagerly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you smell it\u2014the blood?\u201d I held my hand up to him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you taste it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt broke through as I pulled away. I was trying to ignore it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes it make you want to bite me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me want to taste you\u2014to see if you taste the way you smell.\u201d</p><p>Holding my hand near my nose, I sniffed. \u201cI can\u2019t smell anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I held my hand up in front of his lips. \u201cTaste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I frowned at the empty space in front of me, then spun around a few times until my eyes found him leaning against a stack of chairs across the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He inched away from me as I approached. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. One taste could be enough to make me lose control.\u201d</p><p>My nose crinkled and I looked down at the bloody smudge on my hand, then pressed my tongue to it. Erk! \u201cGross. How can you drink this stuff? I taste like a coin.\u201d</p><p>David laughed softly. \u201cYou silly girl, of course you won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how do you know you would?\u201d</p><p>With a deep, heavy sigh, he reached across and wiped his thumb over the bruise.</p><p>\u201cDavid, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTasting you.\u201d His shoulders lifted once, dropping as he popped his thumb in his mouth and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I said in a shaky voice, taking one step back.</p><p>His eyes flashed open; I jumped inside. \u201cJust like I thought. Vanilla and honey. Kinda like a cupcake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you...\u201d I took another step away. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually?\u201d His lips turned down as thought washed across his face. \u201cI\u2019m fine. No sudden urge to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrangely, the vampire is screaming for me to suck the life out of you\u2014\u201d He rolled his head to one side and studied me quizzically, \u201c\u2014But the human me wants to kiss you and tell you how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I always have liked the human you.\u201d I wrapped myself in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThen, the human me you shall have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said distractedly, kissing my hairline.</p><p>\u201cYou were scary as a vampire, but only because I didn\u2019t know what you were capable of. But now I\u2019ve seen it\u2014\u201d I smiled at the memory of him losing control, \u201c\u2014I liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious, are you?\u201d He whipped me out from his body and held my shoulders. \u201cAra, are you joking? Please? Because, I can\u2019t take that kind of a joke.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, shaking my head. \u201cWhy would I joke about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d His hand fell to his knees.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. You don\u2019t know what that means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that...a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, that\u2019s what it is. You\u2014\u201d he held my face and dropped a quick kiss on my lips, \u201c\u2014are amazing. Do you have any idea how precious you are to me? I never knew such a creature could exist, and now I\u2019ve found you...\u201d His voice slowed. \u201cI have no idea how I\u2019m going to let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame way you stopped yourself from biting me, I guess,\u201d I said, pulling his hand away from my face.</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cThis is a first for me, you know. I\u2019ve never had to do that before\u2014to control myself. It took everything in me not to rip your throat open and drink your blood, and even more to stop enticing you with the spell of lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what made me want to...you know, die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s how we kill. We seduce you into trusting us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you seduce men too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve never seduced a man. And I\u2019ve not killed any girls since we met.\u201d He brushed his curled fingers over my cheek. \u201cI use an attack kill, now. It\u2019s more brutal, more painful for the human, but I can\u2019t bear the thought of killing girls since I found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I see your face\u2014think how I would feel if that was you.\u201d He looked up as, above us, the loud thunder of footsteps sent vibrations through the walls. \u201cWe better get back out there\u2014lunch will be over soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I breathed out. \u201cBut, what will we tell everyone?\u201d They all saw us walk in here. I didn\u2019t even wanna imagine what they\u2019d think.</p><p>\u201cAra, what do you think they will think? We\u2019re teenagers. Let them think what they want. They\u2019ll never guess the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least that part\u2019s true.\u201d No one would guess that I led a vampire under the stage and let him bite me. Or even more so\u2014that I bit him. It didn\u2019t matter what they thought, anyway. I was so damn hungry that if I didn\u2019t go eat, David would become the next victim of the ogre. Then, he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about me becoming a people-eater, because he\u2019d be in my stomach.</p><p>David shook his head, laughing softly. \u201cI can think of a few ways I could be in your stomach, Ara, without being eaten. Of course, you\u2019d still have to put a part of me in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>My lips gaped, a giant huff expelling between them.</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t mean it that way. I meant blood\u2014drinking my blood.\u201d He held his wrist up.</p><p>I dropped the insult and giggled into my hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Ara. That came out sounding...incredibly wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but, it was also funny to watch you react that way.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head and shook it, a sharp intake of air whistling through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cI love you, David,\u201d I said, still laughing at his fallibility.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He reached for my hand. \u201cShall we head back out and face the music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The reality simmered over me then and I shook my head at myself. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just provoked a vampire into biting me.\u201d Therapy, anyone?</p><p>David cleared his throat. \u201cYou said it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I dropped my hands to my hips. \u201cI\u2019ll give you therapy in a minute, if you don\u2019t stop reading my mind.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, wandering across the room to grab his jacket. I loved it when he laughed. It made him seem so normal\u2014so human.</p><p>\u201cExcept, there is nothing human about what we just did,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cStay out of my mind!\u201d I headed for the door in a stormy huff.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He grabbed my arm and held up his jacket. \u201cYou might want to put this on.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him; he pointed to my neck. Oh crap! The bite! If it looked as bad as it burned, people would think David did something really horrible to me.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He held his jacket out, pulled it closed around my chest once my arms were in, and kissed my brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? I bit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be healed by the time I cross the room. But you\u2014\u201d he laughed, running his finger over my bruise again, \u201c\u2014you may take a little longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you heal fast\u2014a week, maybe. If not\u2014a month.\u201d</p><p>Crud! \u201cIf Dad sees it, he\u2019ll freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, he\u2019ll freak if word gets back to him that we were even in this closet\u2014alone.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Didn\u2019t think of that. I wrapped my hand over the bite. The rough denim of David\u2019s jacket rubbed against it, making it sting more. But, since he\u2019d been wearing the coat all day, the strong smell of him was all over me like a warm breath, so I didn\u2019t mind one bit.</p><p>\u201cOh, and one more thing.\u201d He grabbed my arm again. \u201cThe history paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>He kissed my temple quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t do vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never give me a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to\u2014you should just trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. What do you think this is? The eighteen-hundreds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think you are a human, and I\u2019m a vampire\u2014and I have my reasons.\u201d He turned away with a sly smile, and the room filled with light as he opened the door, severing any further discussion.</p><p>Hmph! I\u2019m still doing vampires. You can\u2019t stop me.</p><p>He leaned closer and muttered, \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>A group of David\u2019s friends, only at rehearsal for their stupid comedy skit, burst into a Mexican wave as we walked out, sending me spinning back toward the closet.</p><p>David grabbed me by the coat. \u201cKeep walking, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dave? Man, your jeans are wet,\u201d one of the jock\u2019s pointed to the soda spill.</p><p>\u201cFunny. Real funny.\u201d David nodded and took my hand.</p><p>\u201cNow I wish you had eaten me in there,\u201d I said.</p><p>He laughed as we wandered back to our table. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. No one will pass any further comment on it. I\u2019ll personally see to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He squeezed my hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, you\u2019re back.\u201d Emily smiled casually.</p><p>\u201cAre we? Didn\u2019t notice,\u201d I said.</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to ask what you two were up to in there?\u201d Ryan\u2019s brows rose and fell a few times.</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking,\u201d David said casually and pushed my chair in for me as I sat down.</p><p>\u201cRight, \u2018cause everyone goes to the make-out room to \u2018talk\u2019,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, that\u2019s exactly why we were in there,\u201d David said, then winked at me. \u201cI would never be so inappropriate as to display my affections for the girl I love, in a closet space.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked into their laps. Conversation. Over.</p><p>\u201cSo. Subject change,\u201d Emily chimed in, motioning around the table. \u201cThe memorial concert? The whole reason we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start the rehearsal, then.\u201d I grinned, biting into my nachos, but they tasted boring in comparison to David.</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I saw him grin, and while conversations went on around us, David reached into my lap and took my hand, winding his leg under my ankle. And it felt nice\u2014like the way things should be; sitting at lunch with friends, talking about normal things, concealing the burning desire to run away with the boy you love, and never let him go.</p><p>Thursday passed with a rhythmic pace; note-passing with David when we were in the same classes\u2014only I didn\u2019t need to pass them to him, since he just read my mind; talking with Emily in History, trying to get kicked into Mr Adams\u2019 class, and lunch times with my group of friends in the auditorium, rehearsing for the memorial concert. When the day ended, I said my goodbyes and wandered across the field toward my dad\u2019s house, stealing the quiet for my own private thoughts\u2014for once. The sun warmed my upturned face and the wind caressed the crevices around my nose and under my chin. I closed my eyes, entrusting the safety of the widespread field of grass as I bounced along, smiling to myself, for no other reason than that I was happy.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you learned not to walk with your eyes closed?\u201d</p><p>So much for private thoughts. \u201cWell, I\u2019m happy. If you want me to get across the road safely, you\u2019ll just have to walk me home.\u201d I opened my eyes to look at David. He looked so normal with a schoolbag on his back\u2014just a boy, just as everyone else saw him. His dark side was a secret. No one could ever imagine he was a vampire, and no one would ever know. Except me.</p><p>\u201cSo, I was thinking?\u201d He glided along beside me, at my pace, with his hands behind his back and that cheeky grin slipping into place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMm. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to buy you a dress for the Masquerade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dress? Why?\u201d</p> <p>We stopped for a second, and David took my hands. \u201cThis will be your first real ball. I want you to feel like a queen. And\u2014\u201d he turned and started walking again, smiling, \u201c\u2014I won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...Vicki?\u201d I ran after him. \u201cShe wants to take me shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she can.\u201d He spun around and walked backward. \u201cBut when you find the right dress, I want to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He cut in with a finger to my lips. \u201cI\u2019ll have no more of this. Just accept it, as a gift\u2014a token of my affection for you. It will do me great honour to escort you to the ball in a dress fit for a queen\u2014for my queen.\u201d</p> <p>My throat stopped passage of all vocabulary. I froze in place, my hands and feet numb under the weight of his perfect words. All I could do was nod and swallow the sentence that had been my retort.</p><p>Sam\u2019s schoolbooks engulfed the dining table, leaving one space left for me to do my homework; the kitchen counter. I slumped over my books, munching an apple, spinning my hips from side to side on the swishy stool. I\u2019d deliberately moved my schoolbag off the seat beside me, hoping David would sit there to either help me with my homework or just plain old be close to me, but he went and sat next to my pesky brother instead, and helped him. Except, he wasn\u2019t helping him with his math\u2014he was doing it for him.</p><p>\u201cDavid, will you stay for dinner tonight?\u201d Vicki asked, casually chopping away at vegetables.</p><p>David looked up from the page. \u201cThat\u2019d be great, Mrs Thompson. If Ara doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>A giant, invisible question mark formed above my head. Why would I mind, dummy? Unless you plan to eat us for dinner.</p><p>He smirked.</p> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Vicki beamed, without needing my answer. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing special. Although, I am making apple pie for dessert.\u201d</p><p>My vampire flashed the most incredibly charming smile and said, \u201cApple pie happens to be my favourite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Vicki\u2019s whole face lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s great then.\u201d</p><p>I groaned quietly, rolling my eyes. I think my stepmother has a crush on you, David.</p><p>He nodded to himself, his eyes small with humour, aiming the pen tip to the top of the page. He went on then to explain some number jargon to Sam, and I turned back to my books, a breath away from asking for his help. I really just didn\u2019t get this Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem crap. I never had.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw David look over at me for a second, but as the numbers on the page started to shift into place in my brain, I fazed him, Sam, and Vicki out, and concentrated on my homework\u2014taking a sideways glance every now and then to see David look up at the same time. All I really wanted, though, was to go upstairs to my room so David and I could do our \u2018homework\u2019 in private. The idea made me smile to myself.</p><p>A roll of paper hit my forearm then and bounced up, landing between my wrists.</p><p>David winked at me, rolling his hand in the air as if to say \u2018Open it.\u2019</p> <p>As I unfolded the paper, perfect Victorian cursive handwriting stared back up at me in the words: What exactly would we be doing in your room\u2014other than homework?</p><p>Stay out of my head!</p><p>He laughed and took a sip from his coffee cup; I ditched the paper back at him, but he caught it without even looking.</p><p>Smart arse, I thought. But if you were any decent sort of mind reader, you wouldn\u2019t need to ask what I wanted to do with you in there.</p><p>He looked over at me, his face tight with a frown, his cup just in front of his lips.</p><p>I waited until he dared to take another sip, then showed him what we\u2019d be wearing if Vicki trusted me alone upstairs with a boy in my room.</p><p>Brown liquid burst all over Sam\u2019s homework, spraying from David\u2019s mouth as he jerked up out of his chair, wiping his chin on his sleeve. \u201cAra!\u201d</p><p>That\u2019ll teach you. I giggled, covering my mouth.</p><p>Vicki stared between David and I, and Sam, oblivious to all other life forms aside from himself, simply shook his head, sighed, like we were immature, then went back to his homework.</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d Vicki said, handing David a dishcloth. \u201cWhat did you do to the poor boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said innocently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>David placed the cloth and his cup in the sink, shaking his head the whole time, then popped up beside me when Vicki turned to the stove, and whispered quietly in my ear. \u201cYou need a filter on your thoughts, Ara-Rose.\u201d</p><p>I scraped the side of my face down his chin, closing my eyes for a second when his soft lips left a kiss behind before he walked back over and sat beside Sam, still shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cSo, Ara,\u201d Vicki said casually, \u201cyou have the girls coming for a sleepover this Saturday, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I nodded, quickly looking back at my homework.</p><p>\u201cWhen are we going dress hunting then? I assume you\u2019ll want to do it soon, before Mike arrives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Ara tell you, Mom?\u201d Sam interjected, winking at David. \u201cDavid\u2019s gonna buy her a dress?\u201d</p><p>My head whipped up to look at my vampire; he smiled behind his book, keeping his eyes on the text and nowhere near my infuriated glare.</p><p>Vicki looked at me, then at David. \u201cThat\u2019s a very kind offer, David. Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive, Mrs Thompson. If you take her shopping, I\u2019ll cover the costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDresses can be expensive,\u201d she said in a remarkably condescending tone.</p><p>David leaned back in his chair and lopped his arm over the backrest. I knew he was looking at Vicki, probably thinking, I\u2019m about eighty years older than you, lady. I think I know what things cost. \u201cThere is no price too high. I want Ara to have the prettiest, most extravagant dress money can buy,\u201d he said instead.</p><p>Vicki stared, her mouth gaping. \u201cHow much do you want her to spend?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t, David, please don't. Vicki would definitely spend exactly what he told her to, without any hint of remorse. I, on the other hand, would feel like a dirty thief.</p><p>He grinned, completely ignoring me as he ripped a corner of his notepad, scribbled something down on it, showed it to Sam, who nodded, then passed it to Vicki. \u201cNo less than this.\u201d</p><p>Vicki gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Vicki, how much? Tell me?\u201d I whined.</p><p>She folded the paper and slipped it into her pocket, spinning back to the stove with a bounce in her step. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll go shopping on Saturday morning then, before your friends arrive?\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms and looked at David.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He shrugged, holding both hands out, looking so cute and human my heart melted.</p><p>You\u2019re cheeky, David, but I love you.</p><p>While David had mastered the styles and behaviours of the twenty-first century, practicing them well at school, when it came to automatically switching to \u2018good boy\u2019 mode around a girl\u2019s parents, old habits died hard. He ate with the perfection of his inner English Lord, talking topics over dinner that had my dad more than a little impressed, and even complimented Vicki\u2019s cooking. I kept watching his fork go from his plate to his mouth like a graceful bird flying, wondering how it affected him to eat human food. But when it came to the apple pie, I don\u2019t think he was lying about it being his favourite, because he ate mine too. Then, he scored extra points with the parental units by helping me with the dishes, forever winning Sam over by giving him the night off. Didn\u2019t earn enough trust for my dad to leave the kitchen, though. Instead, he decided to \u2018read his paper\u2019 while David and I stood by the sink, trying to talk about \u2018human\u2019 stuff.</p><p>David finished wiping the counter and re-rolled his sleeves before sticking hands back into the water, then handing me a soapy plate.</p><p>\u201cIs it awful?\u201d I asked, taking it in my towel-covered hand.</p><p>\u201cIs what awful?\u201d</p><p>I leaned closer, keeping one eye on Dad. \u201cEating?\u201d</p><p>David let out a short breath of laughter. \u201cNo. It\u2019s very normal for me. I mean\u2014\u201d He bent his knees so his lips came in line with my ear. \u201cIt\u2019s not totally necessary, but I still enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? So, it tastes okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI guess it\u2019s like chocolate; you don\u2019t need it, and you can\u2019t survive on it, but you can enjoy it now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be like vamp\u2014I mean, like your kind in the movies, you know; how it tastes like ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Things actually taste better,\u201d he added, handing me another plate. \u201cMy senses are very finely tuned, so, taste is enhanced, touch is enhanced. Everything.\u201d His smile was oh-so incredibly suggestive.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I said slowly, running one finger at a snail\u2019s pace down his spine, feeling the soft silk of his shirt bunch up as I glided along. \u201cThis feels better when you\u2019re a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He nodded toward my dad, his shoulders lifting with the slow breath he took after. \u201cAnd, yes. That feels incredible.\u201d</p><p>Dad stood up suddenly and walked out of the room.</p><p>I held my breath. \u201cDid he hear me?\u201d</p><p>David listened for a second, then shook his head. \u201cNo. He\u2019s gone to talk to Vicki about Mike coming to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just realised he might need some help getting that giant sofa out of the spare room. He\u2019s going to ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he trusts you to help move furniture and do dishes, but not be alone in the kitchen with his daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds pretty standard for dads, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe we should tell him you\u2019re a vampire\u2014at least then he\u2019d stop worrying about me getting pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he worry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a vampire. Vampires can\u2019t have babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...\u201d He grinned. \u201cNot entirely true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d My eyes nearly bulged out of my head.</p><p>He laughed and looked at the pile of dishes. \u201cYou know, I can think of at least three better ways to be spending our evening. You want me to get this done in record time?\u201d A hint of mischief shimmered behind his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>He grabbed both my shoulders and gently directed me to stand centre to the room. \u201cCount to twenty,\u201d he said, then disappeared into a blur of grey and black, like watching the road out the window when driving down the highway. The faucet ran, cupboard doors shut and opened, and I stood, mouth open, towel and plate still in hand, until David grabbed it and placed it on the shelf, closing the cupboard door after, dusting off his hands as he stood beside me. \u201cAll done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only counted to ten!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTold you.\u201d He jerked one shoulder up and dropped it. \u201cI\u2019m fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I wrapped my arms along the sides of his waist and pressed my cheek to his shirt buttons. \u201cI knew there was a reason I should keep you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go upstairs? I\u2019ll give you a few more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTease.\u201d I smiled, squeezing him tighter. We both knew he wouldn\u2019t come upstairs with me. It was past ten o\u2019clock, and he had his rules.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of respect for you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it\u2019s annoying.\u201d I pulled my scarf away from my neck a little, allowing the bruises to breathe.</p><p>\u201cLook at you.\u201d David ran his thumb over the skin just beside the mark. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have done that. You\u2019re going to have bruises for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d He covered the bruise again. \u201cI watched you fidget with that all night. I know it\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was way too rough with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked it.\u201d I looked up, my voice and my eyes filling with all the guilt of a child who just stole the last cookie.</p><p>He let a breath out through his smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not the shy, meek little thing I thought you were, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m really not\u2014and, you know, when you did that to me, it made me feel\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d I shook my head, lost for the right word.</p><p>David smiled warmly. \u201cI do. I believe the words you\u2019re looking for are excited, lustful\u2014\u201d his voice lowered before he said, \u201cAroused.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks turned hot underneath. He was right. \u201cWhat does that mean, though? That being bitten makes me want to...to have sex with you?\u201d I whispered the \u2018s\u2019 word.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I prefer to think of it as\u2014\u201d he stroked the backs of his fingers slowly over my cheekbone, \u201c\u2014making love.\u201d</p><p>My breath shuddered. \u201cSurely that\u2019s not right\u2014for me to be turned on by you doing dangerous things to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. It\u2019s called human nature. What\u2019s not right is taking pleasure in taunting me when I\u2019m about to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it\u2014\u201d I chewed the inside of my lip. \u201cIs it wrong for me to want\u2014\u201d Gah! I huffed the rest of my words out in one gust.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David stepped closer, towering over me a little, eyes of concern stealing his smile. \u201cS\u2019il te pla\u00eet, mon amour? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I want you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d Vicki called before she walked through the doorway. \u201cIt\u2019s late, time you were getting to bed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My shoulders dropped. \u201cSure, Vicki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, please?\u201d David said quietly. \u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d</p><p>Come back? I looked up at him. When she\u2019s gone to bed?</p> <p>David nodded. \u201cGoodnight, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d My smiling eyes stayed locked to his as he backed away, kissing my hand.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Mrs Thompson, and thank you for a lovely meal.\u201d He smiled at Vicki with all the charm and sincerity of an eighteenth-century prince. She totally fell for it.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome, David. Any time. Maybe next time I\u2019ll cook something a little more interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be perfectly honest\u2014\u201d the prince bowed his head, \u201c\u2014I\u2019ve not had a meal that delicious in a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Vicki\u2019s chest puffed up, and the smile on her face spread so wide I pictured her as a big feathery chicken that just laid an egg.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d I linked arms with him and led him to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou will. Until then\u2014\u201d he bowed his head, \u201c\u2014tu es dans toutes mes pens\u00e9es.\u201d</p><p>I heard Vicki gush behind me. Sucker.</p><p>But as the door closed, my heart fluttered and a pathetic girlie giggle shook my chest. I didn\u2019t even know what he said, but I bet it was romantic. All I knew, from growing up with Mike saying stuff like that all the time, was that S\u2019il vous pla\u00eet was please, respectfully, and S\u2019il te pla\u00eet was for addressing a close friend, while mon amour was my love. Not that Mike ever said that to me, but I heard him groaning it to other girls when I slept over his house. He really used his French upbringing to his advantage when it came to girls. I wondered if David was doing that\u2014trying to woo me, or if it was just a habit for him to speak French.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Vicki stood beside me.</p> <p>\u201cHm?\u201d I looked away from the front door, shaking off that little shiver David left behind in me.</p><p>\u201cStop staring at nothing. Go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d I rubbed my head. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>As I took the first step, Vicki gently grabbed my hand and smiled up at me. \u201cAnd by the way, David is a very lovely boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smiled, gripping her hand for a second.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s more than welcome here anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d I tugged my hand away and ran upstairs; I just wanted to be in his arms again. Having him in my room past nine at night was a real treat. I wasn\u2019t going to waste even one second more talking to Vicki, even if she was actually being nice.</p><p>I flung my door open to a dark room, slamming it shut with my heel. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra.\u201d Dad waltzed in without even knocking, and flicked on the light.</p><p>\u201cDad? What\u2019s up?\u201d I quickly checked around my room.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to say goodnight.\u201d He smiled warmly, resting his shoulder on the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, you should\u2019ve knocked, Dad. I was just about to get changed.\u201d</p><p>He looked at my clothes, his eyes going wider. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, honey. I forget you\u2019re all grown up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I walked over and gave him a quick hug.</p><p>He kissed the top of my head, patting my hair, then stood back. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d he said again and closed the door.</p><p>I spun around a few times, but the quiet emptiness of my room remained the same. Maybe David was waiting until my parents actually went to sleep. So, I took a shower, washed my hair, and slipped into my nice pyjamas\u2014the ones that actually matched\u2014then jumped into bed to keep warm in the cooling air.</p><p>The cold turned to frost and my tired eyes felt sandy by the time Dad and Vicki finally shut their door. Then, with a stealthy silence that even the cat on the end of my bed didn\u2019t pay attention to, David slipped through my window, lifted the covers and snuggled down beside me, pulling me onto his chest.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d I breathed him in deep; he smelled sweeter than he did before\u2014a more concentrated version of his scent, kind of like a Terry\u2019s Orange Chocolate treat. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you been doing? You\u2019re all hot and you smell so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you...hunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it bother you if I was?\u201d</p><p>A minute\u2019s silence passed in a second. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t think about it, sweetheart.\u201d His long fingers swept my hair back over my forehead, leaving behind a warm sensation under the tingling cool.</p><p>\u201cSo, that smell\u2014it\u2019s the blood you just had?\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little. \u201cKind of. It\u2019s how my body interprets the blood, which is unique for every vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s also why you\u2019re so warm all of a sudden, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, why are your hands cold when the rest of you is so warm?\u201d I traced a line over his index finger.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s cold outside. I\u2019ve been waiting for your dad to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? He wouldn\u2019t have known you were in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so certain about that, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. I like it when you call me that.\u201d I smiled and slipped my fingertips under David\u2019s shirt, resting them on his belly. \u201cI like it even more in French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I\u2019ve never let myself think that around you.</p><p>\u201cYour body temperature changes when I speak French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d My eyes narrowed with a disapproving grin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall in love with a vampire, then.\u201d He kissed the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll remember that next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had better,\u201d he said, sounding a bit English. \u201cStaying human to be with a human is one thing, but if I ever find you in the arms of another vampire, I\u2019ll turn you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted.\u201d I kissed his chest, smiling to myself. \u201cSo, what did you say when you were leaving tonight\u2014when you said \u2018Until then,\u2019 and added a whole string of words I doubt were in English?\u201d</p><p>He laughed once, combing his fingertips gently through the front of my hair. \u201cUntil then, you are in all my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you went hunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think of me...when you hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d He let the word hang for a minute then added, \u201cBut not in the way you might think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you with me, enjoying the uh...the life of a vampire.\u201d He paused and lifted his head off the pillow a little to look at me. \u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p><p>Hm, does it? \u201cNot in the way you might think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Maybe it bothered me that I couldn\u2019t really picture him when he was gone. I mean, if he were human, doing human things, I could picture him at home, on the couch, watching TV or eating dinner with his uncle. But no, my boyfriend had to go into dark alleyways and stalk my species. I didn\u2019t want to picture myself beside him, enjoying the...kill. I had tried a few times before, but it never felt right. My mind would always go back, standing on the sidelines, seeing his victim; the way he\u2019d hold her, pinning her down like he did to me when I tried to scream that day, seeing how he\u2019d bring his lips close to her flesh, and my blood would run hot, watching, but not because I wanted her to die, because I wanted...</p><p>\u201cAra. Stop it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that. I can see what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>The blankets rustled under me as I sat up to look at David, blinking to focus in the dim moonlight shining through my window. \u201cDoes it bother you? I mean, is it because I can picture it, or is it because I picture it wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of the above.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cWell, what then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you were picturing the victim\u2014as you.\u201d</p><p>I meshed my lips together. \u201cOh. I was, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? What you were trying to tell me in the kitchen tonight?\u201d David sat up and grabbed my arm, squeezing it gently.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra? Is that what you were trying to say\u2014you want me to drink your blood?\u201d His eyes narrowed on the inner corners, his lip lifting over his teeth on one side.</p><p>Without a word, I lowered my head and nodded, letting my drumbeat heart fill the empty silence that surrounded my awkwardness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never do it.\u201d He dropped my arm and sat back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d My eyes stayed on my knees. \u201cIs it...is it bad of me to think that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Oh. The awkward silence grew fatter and shrunk in around me. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d How could I explain this? \u201cIt\u2019s just that there\u2019s this strange pull...urging me toward you in a different kind of way. I\u2014I want to feel your teeth against my flesh, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, stop talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why? I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. I said stop talking.\u201d David stiffened.</p><p>It\u2019s not fair. You never let me finish my sentences. I knew it was wrong, and I felt really ashamed of myself, but at the same time...it excited me\u2014the thought, the idea of giving him what was mine\u2014to know it\u2019d warm him and make him smell sweet, to know I\u2019d truly be a part of him.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d David disappeared.</p><p>My mouth hung open. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think like that around me, Ara, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d He leaned against my dresser with his arms folded. \u201cI will never do that with you, so get the idea out of your head.\u201d</p><p>Humiliation and rejection tightened my chest muscles, spreading heat through my limbs until it spilled out over my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAra, don\u2019t cry.\u201d He appeared on the bed, wrapping me in his arms. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m sorry. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me? Why wouldn\u2019t you want to do that with me?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and smoothed my tears from my cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, mon amour. There are just so many reasons not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d have to cut you, for one, and I can\u2019t use my venom to numb the flesh first.\u201d</p><p>I stopped blubbering and looked up from his shoulder. \u201cWe could cut where no one would see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will that be any different? I still have to cut you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Something\u2019s happened inside me, David. I feel confused about it all, like, it\u2019s really gross when I think about it\u2014the idea of drinking blood\u2014but when I feel it\u2014\u201d I placed my hand in the centre of my chest. \u201cIt just feels so right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And, believe it or not, it\u2019s only human to feel that way,\u201d he said, and his breath brushed my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re instinctually drawn to me\u2014to my bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSurely you\u2019ve watched documentaries on animals and insects that kill by luring their prey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why you feel the desire to be bitten. It isn\u2019t real, Ara, which is another reason I will never share blood with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you\u2019re not using lust as a spell now, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...why do I still want you to drink my blood?\u201d</p><p>Beneath his smile, his white teeth gleamed; my eyes traced the sharp edges of his fangs and the straight lines of the front teeth. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re more like my species than you care to admit.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2014\u201d He sat up a little. \u201cOkay, look, it\u2019s a very intimate act\u2014blood sharing. It\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! Sharing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharing? For real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in, like, I can drink yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I pointed to my neck. \u201cYou don\u2019t bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I tried to...I mean...I actually tried to cut you open when I bit you. You didn\u2019t break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...\u201d His eyes widened, his head rolling forward into the cloud of disbelief. \u201cYou tried to cut me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>He coughed out the shock with a smile. \u201cIt won\u2019t work. If I were to share blood with a human, I\u2019d have to make a cut myself\u2014for them to drink from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I looked at his neck more carefully.</p><p>\u201cStop thinking about it, Ara. We can never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it...it leads to other things, okay? Not to mention, it\u2019s seen as a bit bizarre to do it with a human you don\u2019t plan to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it just is. I\u2019m not going into detail, Ara. You don\u2019t need to know anything else about my world. Now just drop it.\u201d After a long pause, David took a deep breath through his nose and let it out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara. Okay. I just don\u2019t want to taint you any further than I already have.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sniffled. \u201cYou\u2019re repulsed by the idea of doing it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepulsed?\u201d His jaw jutted forward. \u201cNot in the slightest. Sweetheart, sharing blood with the one you love is one of the most intimate exchanges of passion. Lust and desire mean nothing in comparison to blood sharing. God knows I want to do that with you. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust...I won\u2019t. Okay?\u201d</p><p>My mouth filled with saliva. I swallowed it down. \u201cI wish I knew what you tasted like.\u201d</p><p>David released a short, breathy laugh. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s a little like milk with too much sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by told?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty old, Ara. I have been with other\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d I held my hand up. \u201cDon\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t. If you promise to drop this blood sharing thing.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hands. \u201cAre you afraid you might kill me if we did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you picturing it?\u201d I asked playfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to.\u201d</p> <p>I watched his eyes, so lost to thoughts I wished I could be a part of. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just try it, like, maybe a small cut at first\u2014just to test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. Stop it, okay?\u201d He firmly planted his hand to my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you like that. I really love you too much to bear the thought of you being in pain\u2014especially just to please me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d I jumped off the bed and ran to my desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d David seized my arm as I grabbed the scissors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna do it myself. Then you don\u2019t have to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, you\u2019ve lost it. You\u2019ve actually gone crazy\u2014give me those.\u201d He snatched the scissors from my hand and threw them back in the drawer\u2014slamming it shut.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I sat down in my desk chair. \u201cI have gone crazy.\u201d Maybe all this had been too much for me. Maybe finding out about David was the last straw. Vicki warned me that trauma and grief could manifest themselves in unusual ways\u2014ways you might not recognise. But she was talking about things like promiscuity and drug use, right?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t manifested grief, Ara. It\u2019s a collection of thoughts and cravings over a period of time that have grown into desire,\u201d said the voice of reason from beside me. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you. But you have to drop this. All right?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, wiping fat teardrops from my chin.</p><p>David ran his fingers through his hair and down the back of his neck, then held out his hand; I looked up at him. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re we going?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his jacket off my desk and slipped it on. \u201cWe both need some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFresh air?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, where exactly are we going to get that from?\u201d I asked in a shaky voice as he scooped me off the ground. \u201cAnd how are you planning to get there?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me close, propping his chin on my forehead. \u201cYou may want to cover your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shi\u2014\u201d I rolled my face into his chest as a jolt forced me to hold my breath.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, his lips against my hair.</p><p>I think so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put you down now, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped moving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I clung to his shirt as he set my bare feet to a cold, slanted surface, and a dewy breeze circled my ankles, howling a warning. \u201cAre we up high?\u201d</p><p>The kidnapper wrapped his arm around my waist and whispered in my ear, \u201cOpen your eyes. See for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d I shut them tighter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of heights, are you, Ara?\u201d He chuckled lightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you for this, David Knight. I ha\u2014\u201d A breath of awe escaped my lips as my eyes inched open and I saw the endless skyline, trailing off to a dark blue horizon, where the hills that were grey in the day looked invisible under the scattered stars. \u201cDavid, it\u2019s so beautiful up here.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI come here all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this where you spent the summer? Spying on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, with a cheeky grin, taking my shaking hand to help me sit with my legs dangling over the slant of my dad\u2019s roof. \u201cBut you know that was only while I was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t do it anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Ara, if I was going to be at your house, I\u2019d be in your room, with you\u2014awake, or I\u2019d be at home, leaving you to rest.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled my head into his shoulder. \u201cSo, if I was depressed again, you\u2019d stay with me more often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he laughed the word out. \u201cYou\u2019re a little suicidal for me right now.\u201d</p><p>I slapped his chest with the back of my hand. \u201cWanting to share blood with you is not suicidal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh boy.\u201d He shook his head, still laughing. \u201cIf you only knew the truth of what you do to me with your thoughts, girl. You have no idea how close you\u2019ve come to death, do you?\u201d</p><p>A cold shiver raced down my spine and sent my heart back into my chest with a jump. But even after the eerie feeling subsided, the shaking remained and my teeth chattered together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so human,\u201d David remarked lightly, wrapping his jacket over my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re so warm\u2014like a human.\u201d The heat within the leather felt like that warm spot in someone else\u2019s bed after they get up, layered pleasantly with the scent of citrus and that woodsy smell his car had. I slipped my arms through the sleeves, then moved to sit between his legs, wrapping his arms tightly around my chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened up here?\u201d he whispered against the back of my ear.</p><p>\u201cThe human in me is, but the girl in me, who knows how much you love her, isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019d never let you fall, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I do fall\u2014\u201d I yawned as I spoke, \u201c\u2014I know you\u2019ll be there to catch me.\u201d I smiled, and as I looked at the eastern horizon, a flicker of silver glittered across the night sky. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shooting star.\u201d David nodded. \u201cMake a wish.\u201d</p><p>With my eyes closed, I crossed my heart and thought, I wish David would get the happy ending he longs for.</p><p>David held his breath, his whole body going stiff. \u201cWhy did you wish only for my happy ending?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, then I know that, even if our happy ending isn\u2019t together, you\u2019ll still be happy.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed and looked away. \u201cI thought you said you were a selfish girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t wish for world peace.\u201d</p><p>He snickered softly. \u201cMy darling, there are more than enough people in the world to wish for that. But it requires sacrifice and tolerance\u2014not hopes and prayers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike us,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, happiness is a possibility for us\u2014we can be together. It just means a sacrifice on one side.\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cAnd tolerance on yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTolerance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. For death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ask a human to tolerate the death of another human. That isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, your species kill each other all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Not personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, you tolerate the death of animals for your nutrition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a vampire.\u201d I smiled ruefully, keeping my eyes on the night sky.</p><p>\u201cWell, my love, I am a vampire. Get used to it.\u201d He kissed my temple.</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me, young lady\u2014your death wish may just become a reality.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cSo...if you drank my blood and we made love after\u2014I could get pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The word burst from his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou said, when you were washing the dishes tonight, that it isn\u2019t entirely true about not being able to have children with a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He wiped his hand across his jaw, shaking his head. \u201cWell, it\u2019s rare. You would\u2019ve heard of it in your much-loved mythology. The incubus and the succubus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way. It\u2019s not like the horror stories, though. Supposedly, the babies are mostly human\u2014not immortal. They can survive on less blood than vampires, but still require food. I\u2019m not sure how it works for female vampires. None of the girls I\u2019ve ever known have fallen pregnant, but for males, we can still\u2014you know\u2014\u201d he shrugged, \u201c\u2014we can still give life. There\u2019s a rumour among my Set that my uncle has a son, born by a human girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you tell me about this, David?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cYou know my desire to have children is one of the reasons I can\u2019t promise you eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s not the only reason.\u201d He stroked his soft cheek down mine. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it necessary to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike so many things.\u201d I ground my back teeth together.</p><p>\u201cYes. But, if you don\u2019t ever want immortal life, then what good would it be to have a child, and have maybe five years together before you grow too old to be with a teenager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would still be better than having only a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but after those five years, I would lose you and my children\u2014not to mention they would one day out-age their father.\u201d</p><p>David? Father? Of my children? I really liked the way that sounded.</p><p>\u201cBesides, even if I was selfish enough to take those five years from you, I\u2019d be away for the first two. I have to return to duty, and what then? You\u2019ll be a single, teenage mother, and you may have missed your chance at love\u2014at a normal, happy life. No.\u201d He shook his head, tightening his hold around me. \u201cI want you to have a good life, Amara-Rose. I want you to be mine, for all time, and I could convince you to come with me\u2014and eventually you would. But I will not let you give up the things you want. Not while they still mean everything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I guess. It was just a shock...to find out that you can still...\u201d I rested my hand in my lap. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m really confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfused about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what I should do. I want to be with you always. Not just until the winter comes. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s not fair, Ara. Haven\u2019t you learned that by now?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, turning around to face him. \u201cNo, David. I refuse to believe that. Life is what you make it. Sometimes things happen that suck, but it doesn\u2019t mean your whole life is unfair.\u201d I shrugged and looked at the stars. \u201cLife is just life, and sometimes you just get played a different hand to what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think that\u2019s unfair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSituations can seem unfair, but all things considering, David, we\u2019re still alive, still breathing\u2014not ill or starving or dying of disease. In that sense, I think we\u2019re kinda lucky, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d I reached out and brushed my chin with his thumb. \u201cAfter all, we did find each other against all odds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And I wouldn\u2019t be here\u2014alive\u2014if you hadn\u2019t come along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? So you think you would\u2019ve acted on those, what did you call them\u2014fleeting thoughts?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scare me, Ara-Rose.\u201d He grabbed my shoulder and spun me back into him, forcing me to hold my breath under his bear grip. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to you when I leave?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer; I didn\u2019t feel it needed an answer. And I wasn\u2019t sure I had one to give, anyway.</p><p>The silence hovered over us for a while then as the dark blue horizon turned almost pale white and the sweet smell of morning dew mixed with the perfumed air from the dying summer rose. David and I both took a long breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, David?\u201d I asked, sensing a shift in his spirit.</p><p>\u201cEvery day I wake,\u201d he started hesitantly, \u201cAnd I tell myself that I\u2019ll let you go; that it\u2019s the right thing to do. And then you say things like that to me\u2014tell me that you\u2019re not sure about living\u2014and I wonder if I should just convince you to come with me; if I should just wish for you to suddenly lose your desire to live life, wish for you to throw your arms around me and beg me to change you.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I look at you and I see you for the sweet, young, human girl, who has never lived a day in her life, and I just can\u2019t do it\u2014I just can\u2019t take your life from you. I have to bite my tongue every time I\u2019m about to say something that would convince you.\u201d He pressed his face firmly against mine for a second, breathing me in. \u201cI\u2019m just a guy, Ara. I\u2019m not perfect. In fact, I\u2019m more perfectly imperfect than a human. I have this evil side in me that is screaming for me to steal you. It\u2019s only the angel on my shoulder that makes me wish a better life for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and sometimes I wish you\u2019d just force me to do it, too. But I\u2019d hate you for it. It\u2019s just so dumb.\u201d I slammed my hands down by my sides. \u201cAll of it. I wish it were different.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, you know what they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They say a lot of things that don\u2019t really make sense. But which one were you referring to specifically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWishing is good time wasted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up, David! God, you\u2019re so negative.\u201d I leaned forward to look at him, groaning out loud. \u201cYou know, you might not, but I still believe wishes come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re still a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what does that make you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! A sick-minded hundred-year-old who has a fetish for teenage drama.\u201d</p><p>I laughed too, and looked out over the treetops. \u201cThere is still magic in the world, Mr Knight. You don\u2019t have to be a child to find it. Even my dad believes in it, and he wasn\u2019t a child when he taught me to believe\u2014taught me how to make wishes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you teach someone to make wishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a special way to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you teach me?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and cleared my throat as I turned to look at David, noticing the tiny silver reflections of stars in his eyes. \u201cWell, when you see the first star of the evening or the last star in the early morning, close your eyes, cross your heart and make a wish. If you keep it secret, then it will come true, one day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you still believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I do. And no one is going to take that away from me with borrowed philosophy about life.\u201d I took a breath of the cool, dawn air. \u201cWhen you find that one of your seconds has been wasted on a wish, and you think you could\u2019ve really used that second\u2014really need it back\u2014then I\u2019ll agree it\u2019s wasted time wishing. But not yet.\u201d I looked back to the sky. \u201cNot while I still have hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy only hope is that you see sense\u2014realise that being a vampire isn\u2019t so bad, and let me bite you\u2014to change you.\u201d David sighed, closing his eyes and crossing his heart.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s that evil side,\u201d I noted with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYes. But I will never stop wishing for it, Ara. I know that\u2019s wrong, but I can\u2019t control my heart\u2019s desires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you control your teeth, then I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you asked me to drink your blood\u2014what if I lose control?\u201d he said playfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having this argument with you. I don\u2019t want to be a vampire. I just want to be with you. Nothing more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. No more talking about it.\u201d He kissed the top of my head and held me to his chest. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve decided you can\u2019t live without me anymore, then we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I already decided that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, when you decide you don\u2019t want to be a frail old lady and die, then we can talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>David breathed out softly. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never met a girl so eager to die in all my life.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and folded my arms across my chest. \u201cNo, David, I\u2019m not eager to die\u2014I\u2019m eager to live.\u201d And for the first time since I lost Mum and Harry, that was finally true. Love had given me a reason to exist, and now, even without love, I wanted a life. We could remain in the bliss of summer romance until winter showed, and I wouldn\u2019t think about the choice I had to make; I just wanted to pretend it wasn't there, because, when the time came to make my decision, he knew, and I knew, we\u2019d be saying goodbye. I could only hope some miracle would come along to save me from the choice of losing the one I love, or killing to be with him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>\u201cWake up. Wake up.\u201d Vicki slapped my bedcovers. \u201cTime to go.\u201d</p><p>I groaned, shielding my eyes as she threw my curtains apart, blinding me with the white glow of morning. \u201cVicki. It\u2019s Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know.\u201d She opened my window, and the fresh scent of cut grass and rain blew in with the light breeze. \u201cGood to see you\u2019ve finally started sleeping with this closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Dad must have closed it.\u201d Or David. I tried to remember last night, but could only half remember falling asleep against my vampire\u2019s chest, which, instead of bringing a rise of anger for him closing my window, brought only a dreamy sensation all through my limbs.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Vicki said, staring at my face. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I flopped back on my pillow. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna go to school today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know full well where we\u2019re going today, young lady,\u201d Vicki said in an insistent tone.</p><p>\u201cYes, which is why I\u2019m staying in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Now, just humour me and your boyfriend, and let him spend some money on you.\u201d</p><p>I pulled the covers over my head.</p><p>\u201cBe nice.\u201d She ripped my blanket away and dumped it on my chair, leaving me cold in the nakedness of my bed. \u201cIs it really so bad that David wants to buy you a dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I pushed up on my elbow. \u201cI have savings, Vicki. I can buy my own dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose!\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cWhere are your manners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my drawer, where I left them.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, sighing, and wandered over to find them, pulling out some jeans and a T-shirt instead. \u201cGet dressed. We leave in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh. Fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I flipped my legs over the side of the bed and stumbled to the window. I wanted to grunt at her, but held it in, folding my arms and resting my head on the glass pane instead. Outside, the dull grey clouds hid the sun, making everything under its suppressed glare seem vividly white\u2014lighting up the entire yard and all the garden debris. \u201cDid it storm last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You didn't hear it?\u201d Vicki folded her arms, looking out at the clouds as they spilled over and the soft pattering of rain filled the desolate street below.</p><p>\u201cNope. Slept like a baby.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just getting over my fear of storms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, lucky Dad closed your window then.\u201d</p><p>A pensive twist to my lips became the first smile of the day. \u201cYeah. Really lucky.\u201d Thanks, David.</p><p>\u201cAnd tidy this room,\u201d Vicki added as she closed my door.</p><p>With a certain amount of dread, I studied the chaos around me; clothes on every piece of furniture, covering every scrap of carpet\u2014looking remarkably like a storm broke loose in here last night.</p><p>I got dressed, then shook my quilt out over my bed and hid my clothes, clean and dirty, in the laundry basket so Alana and Emily wouldn\u2019t think I was a total pig when they came to stay tonight.</p><p>\u201cAra. I\u2019m going to the car\u2014hurry up,\u201d Vicki called.</p><p>\u201cJust a sec.\u201d I ran to the bathroom, locking both doors, then smeared another layer of concealer over the bruises David left when he ate me in the auditorium closet. The leftover proof of my insanity looked mean and ugly\u2014like a swollen, purple infection, leaking some kind of clear fluid. But, thanks to Vicki\u2019s shopping obsession, another layer of this two-hundred-dollar bottle of concealer, that could cover up a nose if you wanted to, saw my mark disappear.</p><p>I stood back and observed my handiwork. I\u2019d actually healed pretty well for such a short time, really, but a part of me wished it would leave a little scar\u2014a permanent mark to remind me that I was David\u2019s and he was mine. And as that thought entered my head, a giant hand, bearing my name, came down across my brow.</p><p>\u201cSick, Ara-Rose. You\u2019re sick,\u201d I said to the girl in the mirror.</p><p>All the common sense I once had evaporated into the background of my subconscious when it came to David\u2014even making me delusional enough to offer him my blood. And in the clarity of daylight, I was glad he didn't drink it. I could see the insanity in it now. But deep down inside, that lust-driven human in me was screaming for him to do it.</p><p>Outside, a horn beeped twice. I patted my pocket, slipped my shoes on, and stuffed the last of my savings into my purse as I left my bedroom. But as I reached the front door, a hand grabbed mine.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be needing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I screeched, watching my purse leave my grip by force of David\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s for lunch, or if I need anything else, you know, for the sleepover or, like, girlie stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try. If you need anything else, I\u2019ll take you shopping later.\u201d He tucked my purse into his pocket and kissed my cheek, then, as the front door swung open and Vicki called out again, he disappeared. A victory grin spread across my face, though, as I slid into the car, patting the roll of bills I\u2019d stuffed in my pocket earlier. He clearly didn\u2019t see that thought, and since he didn\u2019t check my purse to see the grand amount of ten dollars I really put in there, he\u2019d never know about it.</p><p>Human: one. Vampire: zero.</p><p>Vicki parked at the centre of the long, outdoor strip of shops. I jumped out of the car and looked up at the sky. Even though the sun wasn\u2019t shining, as it had been last time I was here, somehow, everything felt so much brighter. The shopping strip was quiet for a Saturday, not that it was usually very busy anyway. It reminded me of my hometown; how there were people out and about, but scattered and far between. I checked my watch, hoping we\u2019d be out of here by the time Emily and Alana came over.</p><p>By eleven o\u2019clock, exhausted from moaning and whining my way around the entire shop, I decided enough was enough, but Vicki dragged me to her favourite caf\u00e9 and made me order lunch. I just wanted to go home. After trying on thirty dresses, the only one I remotely liked was an emerald-green one\u2014like David\u2019s eyes. But it wasn\u2019t really grand enough, so Vicki said. I thought it was fine.</p><p>\u201cSo, I still have to find some pretty new underwear and a mask.\u201d I laid my shopping list down on the table beside my plate.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t get a mask until you have a dress,\u201d Vicki said with a mouthful of salad. \u201cAnd the underwear you get will depend on the fabric of the dress, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, if you get a satin dress, you won\u2019t want lace underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, swallowing a chunk of salt-coated steak. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just get that green dress then\u2014the satin one. I'm kinda done with shopping for today.\u201d</p><p>Vicki stopped chewing, making her glare seem more severe. \u201cAra. David has given you a lot more than that to spend. The green one\u2019s pretty, but you can do better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019m not gonna let him buy the dress, Vicki.\u201d</p><p>She looked up quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t really think I\u2019d just go along with this, did you?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d protest at some point.\u201d</p><p>I smirked, thinking, You\u2019re not as dumb as you look, then.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s up to you, Ara-Rose. But, before we go home, can you please just humour me and try a dress in that store?\u201d</p><p>I looked behind me to the window of glitter decorating the front of a very expensive-looking store, with fairy-tale-perfect dresses beyond. \u201cFine,\u201d I rescinded with a huff. \u201cI\u2019ll be your little Barbie doll for another half hour\u2014but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said kindly; I rolled my eyes and finished my steak.</p><p>We stepped carefully around the silks and tulles falling over the wooden floor as we entered the realm of couture, and a thin girl smiled from behind the counter before turning her attention back to her magazine.</p><p>\u201cThis is beautiful,\u201d I said, spinning slowly to take it all in.</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Vicki beamed.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I held my arms out. \u201cDress me up.\u201d</p><p>Turns out, you should never say that to an old lady who never had a daughter, in a room with a commission-based sales clerk. I unwillingly tried on every dress in the store, like a dummy, lost in some mind-blank brought on by constant movement and the repeated inhalation of the manufacturer\u2019s fabric preservatives and dyes.</p><p>But when they threw a shimmering, sky-blue dress at me, I woke suddenly. It slid onto my body like silk to satin, the carefully tailored lines fitting the contours of my hips like a glove.</p><p>I stepped onto the box in front of the four-walled mirror and smiled as Vicki and the clerk gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a princess.\u201d Vicki almost started crying.</p><p>Spinning around slowly, running my fingers over my hips, I marvelled at the soft organza, bunched together at the waist on one side and shrouded with little diamantes. The strapless corset bustle hugged my body until the full, flowing drop of the skirt glided out from my hips and over the ground\u2014like a wedding dress, but blue. And even better, the clerk had pulled the corset so tight my waist became a half-size smaller and I totally looked like I was wearing a push-up bra.</p><p>Vicki was right. The dress was amazing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it,\u201d Vicki all but squealed.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a thousand dollars, Vicki. I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll just get the green one in the other store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I\u2019m not going to let my boyfriend buy a dress for me. It\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s buying it for you?\u201d the clerk asked, astonished.</p><p>\u201cNo! He\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Ara. It\u2019s so lovely, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid dress. Who cares? I\u2019ll wear it for a few hours, then take it off and never wear it again. It\u2019s a waste of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can do what I want, Vicki. It\u2019s my life!\u201d I jumped off the podium and stormed into the change room\u2014slamming the door.</p><p>The girl in the mirror looked up at me; she was thinking the same thing; the dress was beautiful. I wished I could afford it, because it definitely was the one. But I wouldn\u2019t take advantage of my boyfriend just because he happened to have made a few smart investments in his hundred-year existence. On the other hand, David would love this dress too, and I knew, from the look on Vicki\u2019s face, that I just broke her heart. \u201cMaybe\u2014\u201d I said, reaching out to the girl in the mirror; she smiled.</p><p>No. I drew my hand back quickly. \u201cNo! We\u2019re not getting the dress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d the clerk asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, no\u2014just talking to myself.\u201d</p><p>Myself looked at me solemnly.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cStop pouting. We\u2019re getting the green dress.\u201d</p><p>Vicki walked quietly behind me as I headed to the other store, purchased the green dress with my own money and headed to Summer Magic, Masks and Hats Boutique.</p> <p>\u201cThis one would\u2019ve been perfect with the blue dress,\u201d Vicki offered, holding up an almost transparent blue mask. The little stones around the eyes were patterned out like a butterfly, and as she angled it just so, it caught the light, shimmering like a diamond-powdered oil painting.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I swallowed, switching to \u2018indifferent mode\u2019 with a noncommittal shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s great. But I have the green dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, the only mask here that goes with green is this gold one.\u201d Vicki\u2019s lips spread into a sinister grin. \u201cI know how much you love gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGold?\u201d I tried to swallow the vomit in the back of my throat. \u201cI do love gold. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019ll look great with the green.\u201d</p><p>Begrudgingly, I snatched the mask, purchased it and left the store, gagging on the bitter taste of regret.</p><p>After the first five minutes into the drive back home\u2014in complete silence\u2014I watched Vicki\u2019s face, and the pig-headed me softened a little more. Sam was her only child. He would forever be her only child. I felt kind of guilty for ruining her only chance to do the girlie \u2018going-to-a-ball\u2019 thing.</p> <p>\u201cVicki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I had fun today.\u201d</p><p>She gave a small smile as we pulled up to the garage door, and my heart sunk into the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s David doing here?\u201d I sat forward slightly, looking at his car. \u201cHe was supposed to be here at two.\u201d I was supposed to have this dress hidden by then.</p><p>Vicki shut the engine off. \u201cWe thought it might be better if they started earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Ara? I thought you\u2019d be happy to see David.\u201d Her tone had all the malice of a person who knew that I knew she knew I was totally getting busted\u2014and she was relishing in the idea.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m happy to see him, Vicki.\u201d I closed the car door with my hip and folded the dress over my arm. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to show him my dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d She walked ahead and opened the front door for me, all the while grinning like an evil stepmother.</p><p>The skin on my neck tightened.</p><p>\u201cGreg? We\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re upstairs,\u201d Dad called. \u201cHow was shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo you got a dress?\u201d David, with his fingers wedged into his pockets, looked down at me from the top of the stairs, anticipation lighting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI did, and I think you\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my cheek as I passed him and, as Vicki followed, my shoulders subconsciously hunched around my ears.</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun?\u201d Dad asked, standing behind a big red sofa\u2014wedged in the doorway of the spare room.</p><p>Vicki shrugged and sat on it.</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh?\u201d Dad wiped his brow, winking at me.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t changed a bit when it comes to shopping, Greg,\u201d Vicki whined.</p><p>My vampire folded his arms, his eyes narrowing as he stared at Vicki for a second, then, his head whipped up and he looked at me with an open-mouthed frown\u2014my cue to leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just hang this up.\u201d I headed into my room quickly, feeling a jitterbug run down my spine.</p><p>When I headed back out to help Dad with the spare room, I half expected David to jump out and attack me. But he didn\u2019t. Worse, he continued to help Dad\u2014all the while saying nothing at all\u2014well, nothing at all to me. He was mad. I knew it. I could tell.</p><p>The two boys struggled with the offending sofa while Vicki, who must\u2019ve climbed in past Dad, vacuumed the imprints off the carpet where furniture had been. At last, the bulky lounge shifted, and David pretended to struggle with its weight as he and my dad carried it out of the room and angled it up the stairwell to the attic.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Vicki, then the stairs and the front door, and considered running for a second.</p><p>\u201cCome help with the dusting, please,\u201d she said.</p><p>Against my better judgment, I sauntered into the spare room and took the feather duster from her.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you dust the cornices, too. I hate cobwebs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to a vampire\u2019s house then.\u201d I grinned, imagining David\u2019s house was full of coffins, cobwebs and bats. If David had Vicki and Dad over for tea, she\u2019d conceal a feather duster in her handbag and sneak off to the bathroom every five minutes, but secretly, she\u2019d be removing all of David\u2019s eight-legged pets. Then again, the only reason a vampire would invite Vicki and Dad to tea is if they were the main course.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you think you\u2019re pretty funny?\u201d</p><p>I looked up, snapping out of my reverie in a suddenly Vicki-less room. \u201cActually, I do. I think you\u2019d look rather fetching in a coffin.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s eyes narrowed in obvious confusion. \u201cAra, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cobwebs.\u201d I pointed to the ceiling, then dropped my hand slowly, realising that wasn\u2019t what he was referring to. \u201cOh. The dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014You know what?\u201d I sunk my hip down on one side, propping my hand on it. \u201cBite me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me, young lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a dress. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and backed away as Dad and Vicki waltzed in, carrying the bed head. \u201cVicki, please, let me take that.\u201d The human David took over for the angry vampire, and I secluded myself in my task while the three of them continued furnishing the room around me.</p><p>As time ticked on and my mediocre chores came to completion, I leaned on the tall chest of drawers across from the foot of the bed and watched David, suddenly aware that he wasn\u2019t so much angry that I hadn\u2019t accepted his gift, but hurt. In his day, it was common for a man to send his date a pretty dress. And my declining it was probably seen as very rude. But these were modern times. Things had changed. Women had rights now.</p><p>My head nodded in self-satisfaction, but my heart danced a lonely samba under my rib cage as the afternoon sun lit the room and kissed his golden skin. He made it so hard to be mad at him; I knew he was mad at me, and I was mad at him for being mad at me, but now I was mad because I didn\u2019t want to be mad at him anymore\u2014and that made me feel uneasy because I had a right to be mad that he was upset that I hadn\u2019t accepted a gift.</p><p>He dusted off his hands after he placed a small set of drawers next to the bed, then smiled at me\u2014the conceited I-know-what-you\u2019re-thinking-and-I\u2019m-finding-it-funny smile.</p><p>\u201cEr!\u201d I stomped my foot, balling my fists up beside me. \u201cYou\u2019re so annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Vicki looked up from making the bed, then looked at David as I stormed out of the room and slumped on the settee in the hall.</p><p>Dad walked out after me and stopped by soon-to-be-Mike\u2019s door with a look of intense thought, then snickered and walked away. Vicki, with her arms folded around a spare blanket, followed him\u2014after casting an accusatory glare at me.</p><p>I folded my arms, scoffed in her direction when her back was turned, and refolded my arms.</p><p>\u201cAnother one of Ara\u2019s infamous tantrums.\u201d David, with his towering height, stood in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not throwing a tantrum.\u201d I slid down in the chair, biting my teeth together.</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He turned and headed back into the spare room. \u201cCoulda fooled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoulda? You mean...did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stopped and leaned on the doorframe. \u201cI must admit, that was very clever of you\u2014stuffing your purse with a lesser amount. But you can\u2019t read minds, mon amour\u2014\u201d he tapped his temple, \u201c\u2014so your plan was doomed from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you assumed I was submissive, so yours was too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubmissive?\u201d He dropped his arms and moved over to me. \u201cAra, is that what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You seem to know all my thoughts, so you tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. Look at me.\u201d He knelt in front of me. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>With my movements as rigid as a frozen elastic band, I rolled my head upward, but kept my bottom lip in a completely tight pout.</p><p>\u201cMy love, I\u2019m sorry. I never meant to offend you. I\u2014\u201d He took my hand; I let him, with only a little bit of a fight. \u201cI was being playful, mostly. I truly did not think that my spending money on you would be considered rude or controlling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, David.\u201d My tone sung with reason. \u201cIt\u2019s that when I tried to decline, you got mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad?\u201d He doubled back a little. \u201cYou think I\u2019m mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been ignoring me,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d he laughed my name out. \u201cI\u2019m not mad. Not at all. Jeeze, girl, sometimes you really can make a mountain out of a molehill, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Tears coated the surprise behind my eyes. \u201cI thought you\u2019d yell at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYell?\u201d His brow pulled low on one side, thought washing across his face. \u201cAra, what kind of man do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne that likes to get his own way.\u201d</p><p>As if a rope had just pulled his soul out onto the carpet, his face went pale, his eyes draining of the smile. \u201cI\u2019m so terribly sorry if I\u2019ve given you that impression. I\u2014\u201d He shook his head and dropped my hand. \u201cI truly never meant for you to feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, David, now I just feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t. Look, I\u2019m sorry I was pushy, but if it means that much to you, I\u2019m glad you bought your own dress, and I will be happy to see you wear it with pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d A half a smile crept onto my lips.</p><p>\u201cOui, jolie fille.\u201d He touched his hand to the hollow between his collarbones. \u201cI am your eternal servant. You should never feel pressured to do something because I want you to...\u201d He swallowed, his eyes becoming glassy. \u201cAnd you should never be afraid of me\u2014or my reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t really afraid\u2014per se. Just anxious.\u201d My shoulders dropped. \u201cI just don\u2019t like disappointing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy love, nothing you want with your heart will ever be a disappointment to me. You must know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Now.\u201d I shook my head, laughing softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, David. I\u2014I mean, it\u2019s not that big a deal\u2014buying my own dress. I guess, in some ways, I just wanted to prove that...that I could make a stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, my girl\u2014\u201d He rested his upturned palm along my jaw, \u201c\u2014don\u2019t ever need to prove that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, you\u2019re a vampire\u2014a part of me will always need to prove I\u2019m not weak.\u201d</p><p>He looked down then, his eyes focusing on something far away while his lips turned up; my heart skipped at the sight of his dimples.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling at?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI hope you like scary movies.\u201d</p><p>An eerie feeling swept over me as my gaze followed his to the front door at the base of the stairs. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, Emily,\u201d Sam said as he passed.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Emily chimed in her high but elegant voice, opening the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Em.\u201d I stood up.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, then turned and waved to someone outside. \u201cBye, David.\u201d</p><p>David? Not surprisingly, when I looked back, my eyes fell upon the plain colours of the corridor walls and the rosewood floorboards below the rug David had been kneeling on. \u201cRight on time, Em.\u201d I looked at the clock on the wall as I reached the base of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYep, and I hope you like scary movies.\u201d She held up a USB stick. \u201cIt\u2019s based in Australia\u2014some place called Wolf Creek?\u201d</p><p>I shivered. That\u2019s what David meant. \u201cUh, wow. That\u2019ll be great,\u201d I lied, not really sure why I did that.</p><p>I could almost hear David laughing down the street. Well, I hoped he enjoyed his little joke, because he\u2019d be paying for it when I called him at two in the morning, scared, unable to sleep because the bad man might get me\u2014instead of calling Mike, like always.</p><p>My arms folded in smug gratification. Well, there you go, that was one thing I\u2019d let him pay for.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Emily grinned at Dad as he stood up. \u201cI think Sam has a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, old man,\u201d Sam said. \u201cIf a senior agrees with me, I must be right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dad, with a humoured grunt, stacked a pile of plates in the sink and leaned against the counter. \u201cWell, I happen to know that this particular senior is an A grade student because she doesn\u2019t play video games.\u201d He motioned a hand to Emily, who sat taller\u2014bristling with pride.</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d Sam smirked. \u201cEmily\u2019s only an A grade student because she has a cru\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work ethic,\u201d I cut in, sure Sam was about to say \u201ccrush on her teacher.\u201d</p> <p>Sam bit his lip, offering Emily an apologetic look; she just shook her head, picking the pineapple off her pizza.</p><p>\u201cIf only a good work ethic was addictive\u2014like those video games you play, Samuel.\u201d Dad sat back down at the table. \u201cThe fact is, my boy, you have an example to set for the other students, being that you\u2019re a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeacher\u2019s kid. I know, I know.\u201d Sam rolled his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard the speech, Dad. But, you can\u2019t debate my argument with any profitable reasoning. I learned more about physics by playing Halo than I did from Mr Ester.\u201d</p><p>Dad let out a long breath, pinching the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mr Thompson,\u201d Emily said in an encouraging tone. \u201cAlana and I still believe in the importance of homework, isn\u2019t that right, Lani?\u201d</p> <p>Alana looked up from her plate and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cI\u2019m with Sam on this one. Burnout taught me the logistics of driving a car.\u201d</p><p>Dad jostled with a little chuckle. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2014\u201d he sat back, folding his arms, \u201c\u2014that there\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t have your licence yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have your licence?\u201d Emily practically spat the words out.</p> <p>\u201cUm...no.\u201d I sank into myself.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI uh, I\u2019m not very good at driving,\u201d I lied. Truthfully, I just didn\u2019t see the need to be behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Alana and I could teach you,\u201d Em offered.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll leave the driving lessons to the experts,\u201d Dad chimed in.</p><p>\u201cBut, if your methods aren\u2019t working, Mr Thompson, maybe she could learn from those of us closer to her age,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>Sam stifled a giggle; Dad raised a brow at him. \u201cWhen did I become the old guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, about forty years ago, Dad.\u201d I laughed.</p> <p>\u201cHm. Should\u2019ve seen it coming. So\u2014\u201d he said with a change in tone, \u201cwhat are you girls up to tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary movie,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cYay.\u201d I waved an invisible flag, with mock enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Which one?\u201d Sam sat up, suddenly more eager to be a part of the conversation again.</p><p>\u201cNo way, pest. Girl\u2019s night,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAw. No fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s not fair, son. Get used to it,\u201d Dad said distractedly\u2014the common disease of resorting to philosophical one-liners taking the intelligence out of any point he may have been trying to make.</p><p>\u201cWell, Sam, if you want to paint your nails and look at pictures of Ara\u2019s hunky BFF, then you can have a girl\u2019s night with us,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll pass.\u201d He slumped back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cAll right, well\u2014\u201d Dad stood up and took the last of the plates, \u201c\u2014Sam and I will get the dishes, and you girls can go talk about boys.\u201d</p><p>Awkward. \u201cYeah, um, that\u2019s our cue to go.\u201d I stood and motioned the girls to follow.</p><p>Three pairs of feet dangled off one side of the bed, three heads off the other, while the sun slipped behind the house, bringing darkness down the walls, and the dancing rainbows around my room faded, but Emily and Alana\u2019s stories distracted me from the dying colours in my life, reminding me of a time when I once thought the world was normal.</p><p>\u201cSo, whose idea was it to hang the crystals over the window?\u201d Alana asked. \u201cIt was so magic in here with all those rainbows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, Pollyanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPollyanna?\u201d She rolled onto her belly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s from an old movie my mom used to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Never seen it.\u201d Alana looked at Emily, who shrugged, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cSo, Ara, are you gonna show us these pics of Mike, or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Em, but, you\u2019re with Spence now, do you really need to be checking out other guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m checking him out?\u201d She sat up beside Alana. \u201cI\u2019m just curious as to why your eyes light up when you mention him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey so do not light up,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cUm, actually, Ara, they kind of do,\u201d Alana said carefully.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you sparkle.\u201d Emily waved her fingers around. \u201cSo\u2014\u201d she shuffled to the edge of the bed, \u201c\u2014let\u2019s see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I rolled up with a huff and wandered over to my desk. \u201cI don\u2019t have many, though. I only grabbed one box when I moved\u2014and it was the wrong one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich box did you mean to grab?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cJust some old family ones.\u201d I shrugged as if it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI\u2019d switched the boxes about a week before and just didn\u2019t realise until I was already here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not ask your mom to send them over for you?\u201d Alana said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Guess I could.\u201d I bumped the drawer closed with my hip and plonked down on the ground with the box in front of me. Alana sat beside me, waiting anxiously while I fingered the lid, trying not to peel back the carefully placed rainbow and kitten stickers Mike randomly stuck on there when he was bored one day.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Alana reached past my wrist and grabbed the first picture the light touched, then jumped up and handed it to Emily, who smiled instantly.</p><p>\u201cOh. He is cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d My lip curled.</p><p>Emily laid back on my pillow, her silky blonde hair spilling out around her like liquid. \u201cHell yeah. He\u2019s kinda rustic, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Alana, with another picture in hand, nodded. \u201cIs he a surfer?\u201d She flipped the image around for me to see; Mike, in his board shorts, on the beach\u2014golden and tanned, with yellow hair falling scruffily over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suppose.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cHe does surf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how cute he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he sorta is...in a way.\u201d I pretended to cringe.</p><p>\u201cIn a way? Ara, he\u2019s actually really cute,\u201d Alana said. \u201cEven by my standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you two never uh\u2014\u201d Emily let the suggestion in her tone lead that question.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s really not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d She grinned, and the pathetic liar in me showed herself on my face. \u201cOh, my God. You so had a fling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Emily insisted.</p><p>\u201cDid not.\u201d</p><p>Alana studied my smirk. \u201cAra, you\u2019re a terrible liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrat.\u201d My shoulders sunk. \u201cOkay, maybe I did, kind of, throw myself at him. Once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Emily sat up and crossed her legs under her. \u201cWell? Come on, girl, fill us in!\u201d</p><p>My head dropped to one side with a groan. \u201cOkay. Um, so, it was my friend\u2019s eighteenth...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, wait, wait, wait.\u201d Em waved her hands about, coming to sit down in our little circle around my box of Mike. \u201cOkay. Go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I laughed at her, half frowning. \u201cSo...I had a drink at her party. Well, okay, maybe three.\u201d I laughed. \u201cOr more.\u201d</p><p>The girls gasped, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou rebel,\u201d Alana breathed the words out.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s not one of my proudest moments. But, the legal age for drinking in Australia is eighteen,\u201d I added. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not that far off\u2014not like here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh! So lucky,\u201d Emily scoffed.</p><p>\u201cSo, anyway. I walked to Mike\u2019s house to stay the night so my mom wouldn\u2019t find out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid his mom know you were drunk?\u201d Emily sat forward.</p><p>\u201cLet me finish.\u201d I held a hand up; Alana laughed. \u201cIt was actually Mike who picked up on it, like, before I even got in the door.\u201d</p><p>Emily and Alana exchanged glances. \u201cHow did he know you\u2019d been drinking?\u201d Alana asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been a cop since he was eighteen,\u201d I said. \u201cHe knows the signs, and he knows me\u2014and I don\u2019t act like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. I thought he was just getting into the Force,\u201d Alana asked.</p><p>My head moved in a \u2018no\u2019 as I popped a candy in my mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s just getting in to the Tactical Response Group. That\u2019s where he really wanted to be. But he\u2019s been a beat cop for forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Emily led, \u201cwhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well, so, he took me upstairs to his room and sat me down for a severe talking to. But, I just thought he was hilarious. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he take that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was trying not to laugh, too, but...then I kind of went and threw my arms around him and kissed him\u2014told him I\u2019d always loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh! I would\u2019ve, too,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cDid he kiss you back?\u201d Alana asked, completely arrested by my tale.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014\u201d I lowered my head, \u201c\u2014for a moment. But then he stopped\u2014pushed me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Emily winced.</p><p>\u201cThat must have hurt?\u201d Alana\u2019s voice softened.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I mean, I felt rejected and all, but it was...he yelled at me. He had never yelled at me before\u2014for anything.\u201d I laughed it off, but I\u2019d pushed that memory so far down that remembering it came as a shock. I\u2019d almost convinced myself the kiss never happened.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d he yell at you?\u201d Alana asked.</p><p>\u201cWas it because you kissed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was because...he said he was just really disappointed in me\u2014for drinking. He was worried, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. So he didn\u2019t like you the way you liked him?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shrugged casually. \u201cBut it was a mistake. I don\u2019t really feel that way about him. It was just the alcohol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr did you just tell him it was liquor-lust to save face?\u201d Emily smirked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him anything.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI kind of ran home after that\u2014never talked about it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. So...how will things be when you see him on Tuesday, then?\u201d I could see the word awkward appear in bold all over Emily\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I hoped. \u201cSo, have you guys got a dress for the Masquerade yet?\u201d</p><p>Alana, detecting my need to divert, knelt up and placed the picture she was holding into the box. \u201cI\u2019m wearing the same dress my mother wore, and her mother, and so on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s so cool.\u201d I started gathering the pictures into a pile.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm. It was actually first worn by my great-great-grandmother at the very first town Masquerade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is totally cool.\u201d Emily handed me a stack of pictures. \u201cI haven\u2019t found one yet. I\u2019m still looking. Just...nothing seems to suit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that really hard to believe, Em.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, what about you, Ara? Have you got a dress yet?\u201d Alana asked.</p><p>I grinned, placing the lid on the box. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, you do.\u201d Emily squeaked. \u201cLet\u2019s see it, let\u2019s see it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I bounced to my feet. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a sec.\u201d</p><p>They both positioned themselves on my bed, anticipation alight in their eyes, and I bounded into my wardrobe, stopping dead as I closed the door behind me and saw a giant white bag hanging on the hook.</p><p>My breath quickened, my throat constricting to the size of a straw when I slowly tugged the zipper down the length of the bag and saw blue. \u201cDamn vampires!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Emily called.</p><p>\u201cOh, ah, nothing. Just got bitten by a mozzie.\u201d I sucked my finger, drawing away the mock-irritation of a mosquito bite.</p><p>Alana and Emily laughed. \u201cYou sound so Aussie when you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am Aussie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Emily called, \u201cyou just never sound it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they say practice makes perfect.\u201d I looked back at the blue dress inside the bag, wondering where those conspiring renegades had stuffed my pretty green dress. And when my eyes brushed past my old purple sweater and faded blue jeans, I saw it there\u2014shoved away like some ratty old coat. \u201cHu!\u201d I scoffed, reaching for it.</p><p>So, David wanted to play dirty?</p><p>Well, there was no way I\u2019d wear his superficial affection, in any form.</p><p>I hung my green dress on the other hook, then zipped up the white bag and wedged it into a tight space near the wall, dusting my hands off after. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>But, before I even stepped away, the sudden weight of guilt nearly forced my shoulders to the ground.</p><p>Would it be so bad\u2014wearing the dress? my inner princess reasoned. I mean, what could it hurt? After all, David\u2019s already paid for it.</p><p>The dress and I stared at each other across the silent battleground of conscience. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a pretty dress and I did love it.</p><p>I pulled it back out and hung it on the hook.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t hurt just to try it on again\u2014see if it really was as perfect as I\u2019d been dreaming it was all afternoon.</p> <p>Without allowing a second for my conscience to overreact, I unbuttoned my jeans, tore off my top and bra, and crawled into the dress\u2014leaving it on the hanger until I had my arms through, then unhitched it from the hook and let it slide into place around the shape of my body.</p><p>It was hard to think I\u2019d be telling him to return this when it felt so amazing on my skin.</p><p>As I reached around to tighten the satin bows at the back, I felt a cool touch on my wrist.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d someone whispered; I spun around mid-gasp and a tall, handsome vampire placed an elegant finger to his lips. \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShh.\u201d He smiled and nodded in the direction of the girls.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re so cute.\u201d</p><p>By turn of his hand, I faced the wall again, closing my eyes when his deft fingers took my ribbons and twisted each one through the loops of the corset, tying them up; it tickled so softly, drawing warmth from inside my chest, making my knees weak. I rested a hand to the wall for support.</p><p>\u201cAll done,\u201d he said, but as I tried to turn around, he held me in place by my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Using the tip of his very cold finger, the vampire traced a line ever so slowly from the base of my neck, all the way down my spine and across my shoulder blades, resting just under where my bra would sit. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this part of your body before.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the urge to dissolve under his touch, I held tight to good sense. \u201cDavid, you can\u2019t just come in here, touching me like that, and expect me to fall into your arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>I spun around to protest against his pet name, but all my anger dissipated as liquid adoration melted the green in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou look so beautiful in that dress, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d I frayed my fingers down the diamantes on the bodice.</p><p>\u201cA beauty, I fear\u2014\u201d he touched his chest, \u201c\u2014that is a perfection I do not deserve.\u201d</p><p>Well, safe to say no one\u2019s ever said that to me before.</p><p>He placed both hands in his back pockets and lowered his shoulders, shaking his head. My frown broke into a grin. He just had this way of looking at me, like, behind one eye he showed the human, the cheeky boy from school, while the truth of his thoughts hid within the other; he\u2019d smile from somewhere inside himself, looking at me like he\u2019d never seen me before. And every time he did that, I was lost. All I wanted now was to take this dress off and tell the girls to go home.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Ara.\u201d David laughed and kissed my cheek. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry up, Ara. What, are you still sewing the seams?\u201d Emily joked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a corset, Em. Good things take time.\u201d I turned back to look at David but, as usual, he left without saying goodbye, leaving me to find only emptiness.</p><p>I drew a breath to quieten my heart, then stepped out to show the girls my dress.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Emily jumped up and ran to me. \u201cAra, you look like a princess.\u201d</p><p>Alana shook her head, walking slowly over. \u201cNo way, she looks like an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the way it sets off her eyes. They\u2019re bluer than the sky against that dress, Ara.\u201d Emily ruffled the layers of my skirt, then sighed. \u201cI wish I could find a dress like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. Hey, why don\u2019t we all go shopping next week? We\u2019ll find something just as perfect for you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Emily nodded eagerly. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>Alana cringed. \u201cI\u2019d rather not. I hate shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, not hate it, but I\u2019d rather do other things,\u201d she said.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m sure you and I are kindred spirits, Lani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cExcept I have better taste in boys.\u201d</p><p>As I turned away, chuckling softly, I caught my reflection in the window; the sky was dark, and though the howling wind and the pattering rain outside made my stomach sink\u2014for fear there might be a storm on the way\u2014I saw only a smile on the face of the dark-haired beauty in the glass.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Ara!\u201d Emily grabbed the price tag, her mouth gaping. \u201cWas this dress really a thousand dollars?\u201d</p><p>Crud! My shoulders rolled forward. \u201cActually, yes. David bought it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alana picked up the tag and flipped it over, searching for a sale price, I guess.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to feel special. I tried to stop him, but he did it anyway.\u201d And without that cheeky grin distracting me, I found it so much easier to be mad at him.</p><p>Emily sat down on my bed, her gaze distant, hands folded into her lap. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, Ara. I never thought I\u2019d see the day when David Knight fell in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you not think he was capable?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t. I was sure that, ten years from now, when we met for our high school reunion, he\u2019d be America\u2019s most eligible bachelor.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea how right she was. Ten years from now, I\u2019d be so much older than him, and our high-school-sweetheart-romance would be a memory I thought about when I was alone. \u201cHe might still be,\u201d I added with a light giggle. \u201cJust because we\u2019re in love now doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re gonna get married or anything.\u201d Only, I knew we would\u2014if things were different. We loved each other enough to commit to a lifetime together, but I just couldn\u2019t commit to eternity\u2014and David couldn\u2019t commit to a life.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Emily stood up. \u201cHe spends a thousand dollars on a dress, because he wants you to feel special, and you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re going to marry him?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, feeling utterly defeated. I wished I could tell her the truth. I knew she\u2019d understand\u2014be able to give me advice and take some of the burden of life and death decisions off my shoulders. If it just slipped out, if I just said it, right here, right now, maybe David wouldn\u2019t be that mad with me\u2014maybe he\u2019d understand that I needed someone to talk to. And if Emily helped steer my decision toward becoming immortal, then David would only be grateful, right?</p><p>I opened my mouth and, as Alana sat down in my desk chair, with my pillow in her lap, the squeaky hinge woke me to reality. I snapped my big gob shut.</p><p>Emily squinted, studying my face. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore to what?\u201d I shrugged casually and started untying my dress.</p><p>\u201cIs it...are you still in love with Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I never said I was in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I don\u2019t understand?\u201d</p><p>Of course she couldn\u2019t. How could anyone? David was perfect. Why would I not want to marry him? \u201cWhat\u2019s to understand, Em? David and I\u2014we\u2019re in love, but we want different things in life.\u201d I grabbed a shirt off the end of my bed. \u201cEventually, we\u2019ll have to go our separate ways. We both know that. David understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you trying to convince, Ara? Us, or yourself?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>I held my dress in front of my chest, pulled the shirt over my head and, once covered, stepped out of the dress and threw it on the bed. \u201cWhat does it matter? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re losing him, Emily.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt matters because I care about him. We\u2019ve been friends for years, Ara, and I\u2019ve never seen him like this. He\u2019s happy. And it was like he knew you were coming\u2014like he predicted it, or something, because, about a month before we even met you, he changed\u2014became the David everyone else can tolerate.\u201d</p><p>About the time I arrived at Dad\u2019s. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he smiles. He laughs,\u201d Emily continued. \u201cAnd the only time that hasn't been true, since the moment he finally asked you out, was the day of Nathan\u2019s funeral. What\u2019s going to happen to him if you don't love him like he loves you?\u201d</p><p>Her ignorance just made me insanely mad. \u201cWho says I don't?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said you had no plans to marry him. Ara\u2014\u201d She pointed to my door, \u201c\u2014that boy is practically picking out goddamn rings. You have no idea how lucky you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Actually.\u201d I sighed, dropping my arms to my sides as I sat on the bed, wishing I could fall into her shoulder and cry hysterically. \u201cI hate that we can\u2019t be together. More than you know. But it isn\u2019t my decision to make. Not really. There are outside factors stopping us from being together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should it matter? When you love someone, you give up everything for that,\u201d she said.</p><p>I kind of laughed. I didn\u2019t know Emily went so deep. Everything she said was true, though, and it hurt. I just wasn\u2019t brave enough to risk everything for love. My mother taught me better than that\u2014taught me to follow my head, because the heart could lead a girl down paths that may destroy her life. I just wanted to forget about decision-making for the summer; just wanted to enjoy the time I had with David and maybe, somewhere in time passing, the answer would just come to me. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst advice I\u2019ve ever heard, Emily.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and drew a long breath. \u201cYou\u2019re just too blind to see the logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe too sensible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys\u2014\u201d Alana ditched a pillow between us. \u201cStop fighting.\u201d</p><p>Emily sat on my bed, shaking her head. \u201cSensible people die alone, Ara\u2014like my gran and my Aunt Betty. My dad says if you don't fight for love, you have nothing to fight for.\u201d</p><p>Despite numerous arguments I could squash that statement with, I decided to sever the conversation instead. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. Shall we watch that movie now?\u201d</p><p>The quiet hum of restful breathing filled my room under the howling of the wind outside. I laid awake, wishing I could put my bedside light on to illuminate the dark, scary corners of my room. I hugged my copy of Wuthering Heights and internally sent despise in waves of anger to the mattress on the floor. I should\u2019ve told Emily I hate scary movies.</p><p>My phone lit the roof green for a second; I flipped over and reached across the gap between my bed and nightstand, cautiously, in case The Bogeyman reached up to grab my hand, then tucked my arms back in quickly with my phone in hand. The message on the screen read: Call me if you need me.</p><p>I smiled and texted back: Thanks, David.</p><p>But, it wasn\u2019t him I wanted to call.</p><p>The green glow remained on my face and hands, and Emily stirred as the keypad bleeped when I pinned in the digits of a familiar number. I knew I should call my boyfriend, but in the darkness, surrounded by the fear of a storm outside, all I wanted was to hear the homeliness of Mike\u2019s familiar voice. And with the mere buzzing of the ringtone down the line, the eerie feeling of isolation slipped away a little. Pick up. Come on, Mike. Please, pick up.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful. What\u2019s up?\u201d he asked, bringing me home with the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mike,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked quickly. \u201cAre you okay, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleepover,\u201d I said. \u201cWatched a horror movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby girl. Why do you do it? What movie was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m never sleeping again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will\u2014you always do eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a few weeks, though.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019ll be there in a few days, then I\u2019ll sleep by your wardrobe and keep the monsters from coming out to get you.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, yeah, I remember that night. How old were you then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, fourteen, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sending a hug through the phone for ya, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered, actually feeling a little better with that thought.</p><p>\u201cHey, I was thinking \u2018bout you before you called. You must\u2019ve read my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking about this time\u2014me in a blender or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, I don\u2019t only reflect on memories of you in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Seems like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was one memory. Once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was only the ice cream truck one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think of one, realising then that I was wrong. \u201cSo, now you expect me to document every conversation we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, what is wrong with you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, when you twist my words around until we get in a fight. Don\u2019t do that. I\u2019m not trying to fight with you, baby. I was just...I wanted to call you...I was thinking about you\u2014then you called. It surprised me, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be used to it.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve been that in tune with each other, Ar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>He paused again.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>Emily rolled over and stirred with the disruption of my voice through the perfect silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still here, Ara. I just...I need a few seconds, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m just moving into the spare room.\u201d I walked into the hall, my toes balancing over the quiet spots in the floorboards that I\u2019d memorised.</p><p>\u201cIs that the room I\u2019ll be staying in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I grinned and leaped through the dark, landing on his bed. \u201cI\u2019m sitting on your bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you can keep it warm \u2018til I get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, I\u2019m gonna stay in bed for the next few days,\u201d I said sarcastically.</p><p>He paused again, then, after a long breath through what sounded like his nose, asked, \u201cSo, how are things with the boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so good.\u201d I winced; how was the truth so automatic with Mike? \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of decided to break up after the autumn ball.\u201d I think.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, baby girl. I\u2019m sorry. Why? I mean, why would you do that? I thought you guys were a sure thing?\u201d Mike\u2019s sympathetic tone brought my tears out from hiding.</p> <p>\u201cI don't want to, Mike. But he. He has a. Kind. Of. Problem.\u201d I sniffled before the sobs came breaking through.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, baby? You can tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mike, but\u2014\u201d I could feel Mike in the room with me, the way he\u2019d normally hang up the phone, right about now, and no more than two minutes later be knocking on my window. But that wasn\u2019t possible anymore, and after he left here and headed back home in two weeks, it\u2019d never be possible again. \u201cI\u2014he has a secret and I have to keep it,\u201d I said, sniffling. \u201cI want to tell you. But I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, baby, you know damn well if there\u2019s a secret someone says you shouldn\u2019t tell, you absolutely shou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Mike. Okay?\u201d I took a moment to compose myself. \u201cAnyway, none of it matters. He has to leave, and after the last leaf of autumn turns red and falls from the last tree, he\u2019ll be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mike scoffed. \u201cWhat the hell is that? Some fairytale timeline, bull crap? Leaves turning red? Ara! Did he hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Mike. He didn\u2019t hurt me. I mean, not physically. I\u2019m hurting inside, like I always do, but it isn\u2019t his fault. It\u2019s my decision that caused it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What? Your decision? Ara. If he hurt you, I swear to God, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mike, he never hurt me, okay? He asked me to come with him. To go away with him.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence passed. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar away. I\u2019d never be able to come back.\u201d</p><p>I actually felt a dense cloud wander into his breath, making everything silent before imminent explosion occurred.</p><p>\u201cDon't worry, Mike. I told him no,\u201d I added quickly before he could freak out, even though it was a lie.</p><p>The explosion came across the miles in a loud whoosh of air, the phone line interpreting it as static. \u201cSo, you\u2014what, you\u2019re breaking up when?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen winter comes\u2014maybe before. He said I could count on him staying until at least the end of summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how...\u201d I heard him sniffle. \u201cHow are you coping with that?\u201d</p><p>The sadness of the idea felt so final, so eternal now that I\u2019d said it aloud. \u201cNot sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you still have me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed out in one short burst of air. \u201cI know. I\u2019ve always had you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not really a consolation, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't be like that, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry. I just...\u201d He paused for a few ticks of the clock on the wall. \u201cDo you hate me, Ar? Is that why you didn't take my calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate you? Why would I hate you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of...because of what happened that night.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since that night, I allowed myself to think about it all\u2014to really think about it. Did I hate him? He turned me down\u2014rejected me. But you can't be held responsible for the desires of your heart; it wasn\u2019t his fault he didn't love me. \u201cIt would be easier\u2014if I hated you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts me to think of you wanting to hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how I feel about you, Ar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't think you do. I don't think you get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can't...you can do no wrong, baby. All that stuff\u2014everything\u2014it doesn't change the fact that you will always be my best friend. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mike. I just...can we just forget it ever happened, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready forgotten.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and stood up from Mike\u2019s soon-to-be bed, then looked out at the twinkling stars in the sky to the west; they reminded me of David\u2014after our blissful night on the rooftop\u2014and for the rest of my life, they always would. Which was funny, really, because, while thoughts of my dark knight remained with the midnight sky, thoughts of my Mike, my warmth, would always be the beaches and sand\u2014the blue skies. Two separate parts that made my days whole\u2014made my world.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Ara?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking how much I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know, but you\u2019ll be gone soon, too.\u201d</p><p>Mike sighed. The sound strengthened the memory of his face; his prominent jaw, with a kind of arrogant set to it that was completely softened by his charming smile\u2014the kind of smile that made you a part of his world when he offered it to you. I could see his shaggy, sandy-coloured hair, the blonde tones lighter in the summer, and his autumn-brown eyes, deep, like leaf-covered pools.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you, Ara? What world of thought have you slipped away to this time?\u201d he asked in a soft, almost whisper.</p><p>\u201cA world I don\u2019t want to be in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hold tight a few more days, kid. I\u2019ll be there to pull you out soon.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back before dark,\u201d I called to Dad, closing the lid on Vicki\u2019s sewing box.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain\u2014you\u2019ll need a coat,\u201d he yelled from upstairs.</p><p>I stuffed the pilfered pin into my pocket, taking a quick look at my bare arms, then tiptoed out the front door, pulling it quietly closed behind me.</p><p>\u201cTake a jacket,\u201d David said sternly.</p><p>\u201cGod!\u201d I jumped back from the vampire. \u201cYou gotta stop popping up like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine.\u201d I went to obey, then stopped, folding my arms. \u201cActually, no. If you want me to bring one\u2014you can go get it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes slowly narrowed above his tight jaw, an invisible rope bringing his shoulders back, making them straight and hard. I swallowed, about to shift my hand and place it on the doorknob, when a breath of wind swept my hair back and David grabbed my hand, leading me to the car\u2014with my jacket over his forearm.</p><p>\u201cI love how you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d is all he said.</p><p>We sat quietly on the first half of the drive out to the lake, not a peaceful silence either\u2014a deliberate one. I had nothing good to say to him today after that whole dress incident last night.</p><p>\u201cVicki seems happy about your dress,\u201d David chimed, a flash of pure white teeth gleaming through his dark pink lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d I folded my arms.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Ara. You\u2019re not really mad, are you? It\u2019s a dress, let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the dress I have a problem with\u2014\u201d And all of a sudden, we were arguing again. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that you went behind my back. You picked through mine or Vicki\u2019s brain until you found what you wanted, then took it upon yourself to force me in a direction I didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>David smiled. \u201cBut you love the dress.\u201d</p><p>Even though I refused to look at his charming smile, I could still feel its warmth. My arms dropped to my sides. \u201cI do love the dress. But I\u2019m just afraid it\u2019ll always be like this, David. That you won\u2019t respect my decisions.\u201d Like the one to stay human.</p><p>\u201cI never thought of it that way.\u201d He looked down at the steering wheel. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara. I must have misinterpreted your thoughts yesterday when we talked. I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll take the dress back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d I choked on my own words. \u201cJust...in future, even if my thoughts indicate the opposite, listen to me when I say no.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSo, you\u2019ll wear the dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, of course I\u2019ll wear the dress. I love the dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you know I do.\u201d And all the irritation over the dress evaporated with one flash of his turned lip and irresistibly cute dimples, making the sun rise again in my world. \u201cThank you, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other night, when you closed my window. It rained and I would\u2019ve been very cold if you\u2014\u201d My words dissipated with a gasp of air; I projected forward, nearly striking the dash as the car screeched to a halt in the middle of the road. \u201cDavid! What the hell!\u201d I pried my fingers from their grip of fear on the seat, then slapped him hard\u2014not hard enough, though. He didn\u2019t even flinch.</p><p>\u201cWhen was this, Ara? Which night are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday. Why?\u201d I rubbed at my now throbbing hand.</p><p>\u201cTell me exactly what you think I did.\u201d He grabbed my face, turning it from one side to the other, then let out a breath.</p><p>\u201cUmm, you closed my window.\u201d I pushed his hand off my face. \u201cWhy the sudden freak-out?\u201d</p><p>After a moment of stillness, he looked over his shoulder, then back at the dash. \u201cBecause, Ara, I never close your window.\u201d</p><p>My blood ran cold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure my brother came to visit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How do you know my dad didn\u2019t close it?\u201d</p><p>David reluctantly turned his gaze to me. \u201cThe scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s nearly exactly the same as mine, only, I should\u2019ve followed my gut when I realised it was on things I never touch\u2014things I\u2019ve never been near.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying there was some strange vampire in my room? While I was sleeping? Oh my God.\u201d I shook my hands around, taking short breaths. \u201cI think I\u2019m hyperventilating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ara. Really. He would never hurt you\u2014you have nothing to worry about.\u201d He placed a calming hand to my shoulder.</p><p>I didn\u2019t feel convinced.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s like me, my love\u2014in so many ways,\u201d he said, rubbing my back. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy. He was just curious about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did he sneak into my room? What is it with you Knight boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I wouldn\u2019t let him meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my personal life is not his business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it not? He\u2019s your brother.\u201d</p><p>He looked forward, almost pouting. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like my uncle.\u201d</p><p>I reached across and touched his arm. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what the big deal is? Why didn\u2019t you just let him meet me? It would\u2019ve saved all this...\u201d I motioned to us, stopped dead in the middle of the desolate road. \u201cDrama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t fit into your world as well as I do\u2014anymore.\u201d David wrapped his fingers over his thumb, cracking it absentmindedly. \u201cI was afraid he might scare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScare me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled into his lap, tossing a sideways glance at me after. \u201cHe can come across as a little...malevolent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you tell me not to worry that he was in my room? With me? Alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he didn't do anything...unsavoury? I mean, touch me, breathe on me\u2014look at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my brother. He\u2019s\u2014for all his faults, violence and depravity are not among them. He wouldn\u2019t do anything...dishonourable to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you study me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvoluntary reaction.\u201d He shrugged; he looked so human when he did that. \u201cIt was silly of me. If he\u2019d bitten you, you\u2019d already be a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think he\u2019d have done that?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his chin. \u201cI don't know. I guess I was just worried he might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Isn't it against the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but, I\u2014\u201d His gaze drifted into the world of nothing, coming back with a trace of alarm. \u201cIf you ever see me or speak to me and you feel something is slightly off, just\u2014just ask me something only I\u2019d know, and don't think about the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Can he read minds, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And not just human minds, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like, dogs and cats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I held back the urge to laugh. \u201cSo, he\u2019s more talented than you. I bet that sucks.\u201d</p><p>He brushed my hair from my face and stared at me intently, a hint of a smile returning to one corner of his mouth. \u201cWhat would suck is having your fourteen-year-old brother inherit the height in the family, while you were left...short.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey! I am not short.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and turned back to the steering wheel. \u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you make up in annoyance what I lack in height.\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cSo, can I meet him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho, Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered swiftly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need\u2014he was obviously satisfied.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr! That\u2019s so creepy.\u201d I dusted myself off as if I\u2019d walked through an empty web.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara. I\u2019ll talk to him, okay?\u201d</p><p>I swiped my hair from my face, looking out the window. \u201cYou better.\u201d</p><p>David put the car in gear and we pulled away again, gaining speed a little faster than usual. I sat watching the world go by for a minute, sorting out my inner fears by imagining everything; that vampire slipping through my window, standing over me, his face and his smile just like David\u2019s, while his eyes told a different story. And that damn cat. He was on my bed that night. How could he call himself a guard cat if he couldn\u2019t even alert me to strange predators sneaking into my room? I bet he would\u2019ve slept through my death, had it been a murderous vampire. \u201cSo, you said I\u2019d already be changed if he\u2019d bitten me. How long does it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA day or so. For some it can take only hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s based on the strength of your immune system; the venom kills it slowly, and when it finally gives out, you change permanently into a vampire\u2014assuming you have the gene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it won\u2019t matter, because you refuse to become what I am. So\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid! Tell me. What if he\u2019d bitten me, and I didn\u2019t have the gene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d he went quiet again until he looked at me, \u201c\u2014you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Hold on. So, you bite someone to feed off them? If they have the gene, they become a vampire, and if not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d He nodded, scratching the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ve never turned someone. Of all the people I left alive in my years, not one has survived. My uncle is the only person I know who\u2019s done it successfully.\u201d He picked at the crumbling leather where his fingers had gripped the steering wheel during our abrupt halt. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy task; the exact method\u2019s a closely-guarded secret\u2014to prevent unauthorised transformations. All I do know is if Jason and I hadn\u2019t been compatible for the change, we would have grown ill.\u201d</p><p>Grown ill? \u201cSo, it\u2019s kinder to kill them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked back at me. \u201cOur venom numbs the skin and induces euphoria; they desire the bite\u2014we drain them and...they die,\u201d his voice softened. \u201cIt\u2019s peaceful; serene. But if we leave them alive, the venom becomes parasitical; they get a fever, their immune system deteriorates, as do the cognitive functions, then, they fall into a coma. It\u2019s a degrading and...painful death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan someone survive\u2014if they don\u2019t have the gene?\u201d</p><p>His eyes scrunched tightly for a second. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of a few cases; they recover from near death\u2014go on with normal life, like it never happened. But it\u2019s rare, and they\u2019re never quite the same again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I could choose to give up my life\u2014to be with you\u2014and it might not work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility. But, do you remember that feeling you had at the lake? The uh\u2014\u201d He smiled, rubbing his chin, \u201c\u2014gravitational pull?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I know you\u2019re my soulmate.\u201d</p><p>I pulled the seatbelt away from my neck a little so I could turn in my seat. \u201cAnd that means I can be changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of. You see, soulmates are designed for each other, Ara. If you couldn\u2019t be changed, the phenomenon wouldn\u2019t have occurred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that with the person who changed you\u2014with your uncle?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo. You only feel it with your soulmate, and it\u2019s especially rare to feel it with a human. My uncle took a risk changing Jason and I, on the hope we would be more like him, genetically. And there was nothing to lose anyway. We\u2019d just signed up to join the army. He wanted us protected if we ever went to war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s how you became a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that? He could\u2019ve killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe swore an oath to protect our bloodline. It was either death by Arthur or by something possibly a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he risked killing you\u2014to save you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove works in mysterious ways, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove? Love is not plunging two barely nineteen-year-old boys into a world of murder.\u201d</p><p>His knee sunk as he pressed his foot to the clutch and changed to a lower gear, bringing the car smoothly onto the gravelly roadside, then sat staring at the dash for a second. \u201cBeing a vampire\u2019s not all bad, you know.\u201d He twisted the key in the ignition, shutting it off.</p><p>\u201cI know. I'm sorry, David.\u201d I reached across and grabbed his hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply your uncle didn\u2019t care for you or anything, I just\u2014\u201d Was just implying that if he loved the boys, why would he possibly think a life of vampirism was better than death?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived a good life, Ara. I have no regrets about immortality.\u201d He smiled down at our hands then, opening my palm to trace a line down the middle. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t either, you know\u2014once you got used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to the killing, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a bright side.\u201d He ran the tip of his finger down the Fate Line on my palm. \u201cYou never age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seventeen. I think I have a few years before ageing is going to bother me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he teased, \u201cYou\u2019re already changing. Look\u2014\u201d He pointed to the line. \u201cThis is shorter than it was a week ago.\u201d</p><p>I snatched my hand back. \u201cAre you saying my days are numbered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled to himself. \u201cJust that things are...changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing stays the same forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, physically, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think your maturity levels stayed the same as your eighteen-year-old human self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d His emerald eyes met mine. \u201cThis coming from a girl who thinks throwing a tantrum is an acceptable manner of getting her own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it gets me my own way. It actually does.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOnly because your dad\u2019s treading on eggshells around you until he\u2019s sure you won\u2019t run away or commit suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do my tantrums work on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, taking my hand. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I sat back in the chair and let my hand fall into my lap. \u201cI wish we could be like two characters in a book; that some miracle could keep us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, my love, but this is life,\u201d David said. \u201cAnd our reality is that fiction doesn\u2019t mix with fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I\u2019m sitting beside a vampire right now,\u201d I said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing fictional about vampires is the possibility of one falling for a human.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself.</p><p>He stole my hand back and sat quietly then, tracing his fingertip down the middle of my palm again.</p><p>\u201cIt really bothers you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lines\u2014the changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of many things, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not just the future, but maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He laughed and folded my fingers around his, but the smile faded from his eyes and a flicker of something foreign flashed for only a second before it disappeared. \u201cI\u2019m just being melodramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d I squeezed his hand a little tighter. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014No.\u201d He patted my hand and released it, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s just enjoy this day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but, you\u2019d tell me, right? If there was something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat, unbuckling my seatbelt, but as I turned to open the door, looked up at the vampire standing there.</p><p>He offered his hand. \u201cWould you like to go back to the island today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I took his hand. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>Raindrops broke the glassy stillness of the water, distorting the deep red reflection of autumn foliage. Ripple upon ripple stretched closer to the shore, pushing the clusters of orange and brown leaves in laps up onto the clay banks. David and I stood at the cusp of the lake, hand in hand, watching the watery road out to the island.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s magnificent this time of year, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always magnificent,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I wish I\u2019d worn a skirt instead of jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d he hummed, giving an automated smile.</p><p>I stood between him and his distracted glare. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d He managed to look at me this time.</p><p>\u201cI know there\u2019s something wrong. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nothing that needs discussing right now.\u201d</p><p>Above us, the dark grey clouds closed in, swallowing the last smudge of blue left in the sky, making the sudden dread in my gut go deeper. \u201cSo?\u201d I closed my eyes for a second, pushing the swell of worry aside. \u201cAre we going to the island, or are we gonna stand here and get incredibly wet?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at the sky. \u201cPerhaps we should go home. I\u2019m not sure even the island can contain that storm.\u201d</p><p>I hugged myself, shivering a little as dots of rain fell over my bare shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou cold?\u201d David asked, rubbing my arm.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI can feel the autumn coming on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so follows the winter,\u201d he said absently, his shoulders dropping. \u201cCome on then.\u201d</p><p>My hand linked with his. \u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The island. Never know when it might be our last chance to go back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always go back there\u2014even when you\u2019re not with me anymore.\u201d</p><p>His nose and chin stayed pointed at the island, while his eyes slowly drifted onto me, narrowing, the question on his mind a breath away from his lips. But I squealed, my arms flailing out in an octopus manner when he bent down and scooped me up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting us to the island faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Crap!\u201d I buried my face in his neck, my teeth making a cage as the forces of gravity tried to hold me down under the vampire\u2019s need for speed. It felt kind of like going upside down on a roller coaster, gravity pushing at my head, compressing my arms and legs, possibly trying to cube me.</p><p>We stopped abruptly and my gut kept going as my feet touched the ground. I folded over, feeling heat rush into my cheeks and ears.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be sick?\u201d David laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I reached up and grabbed his arm, using it to steady myself. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take slow breaths. It\u2019ll ease off.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, rolling to a stand under the majesty of our secret little island. Even if I was about to puke, the cool cave of foliage stole my thoughts enough to make me forget how fast I\u2019d just travelled, and the fruity tingle of wild flowers filled my senses, making it easier to breathe.</p><p>\u201cBetter now?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>In my peripheral, a vibrant purple petal caught my eye; I turned to David and smiled.</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he said, tucking my hair back with the flower.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I still have the one you gave me here last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, sliding his hand down my arm to take my hand. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d I tore my eyes away from the canopy\u2014the way the gaps in the leaves, if I looked only at the grey behind them, looked like blurry, floating lanterns.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d As our eyes met, a flash of sadness turned his pale green. \u201cSomething which, I\u2019m afraid to say, is not good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d My small voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d warn you when it was time for me to leave?\u201d</p><p>My stomach sunk; I bit my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cWell...the\u2014\u201d his voice steadied with a chest-lifting breath, his gaze fixing on my lips, rising up to my eyes. \u201cThe time has come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been called to return to duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks? But, that\u2019s not enough time. How can I\u2014how can you expect me to...\u201d I fought several arguments with him in my head, not winning any of them. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t do this. You have to tell them no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the worst part, Ara.\u201d He took another deep breath. \u201cIn that two weeks, I am expected to operate the Set from the New York offices. I will only be able to see you at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight? Two weeks? And that\u2019s it? For forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you change your mind and become a vampire,\u201d he said in a low, dry tone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDavid. I can\u2019t make a decision like that in two weeks. How can you possibly expect me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have to, Ara!\u201d He looked at me long enough to see the hurt infect my face. \u201cThe time is now. Like it or not. You have to choose. When the full moon rises in a fortnight, I will be boarding a train and leaving for Le Ch\u00e2teau de la Mort\u2014with or without you beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me. Mike\u2019s here for the next two weeks. How am I going to choose between life and immortality while he\u2019s distracting me?\u201d I wiped fat raindrops off my shoulder, moving out from under the giant leaf collecting them. \u201cCan\u2019t you reason with them? Can\u2019t you do something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra. You don\u2019t understand the ways of the Set. I\u2019ve been ordered to return by the head of the World Council\u2014the king, for God\u2019s sake. One does not refuse an order from the king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d He dropped his head with a dejected breath. \u201cTwo weeks to get my affairs in order was a generous courtesy. He needn\u2019t have offered that at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn ways.\u201d He looked up at the leaf above us and grabbed my hand, leading me to the shelter of a larger tree. \u201cThe man I entrusted to run things in my absence has proven less than reliable. I must return and pull things into line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you have a life here. What about school and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Set do not care! It\u2019s a part of being on the Council. I knew this when I joined; I accepted that with all of its glory and all of its responsibility. I must leave. That is all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>The pattering of rain filled the silence in around us while it all sunk in. \u201cBut, what will I do without you\u2014how will I get through the days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething tells me you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He smiled conceitedly, shaking his head once.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I demanded, stepping closer.</p><p>He stared at the ground. \u201cI was listening last night. When you spoke to Emily and Alana\u2014about Mike.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. My lips parted for some kind of explanation, but only air came out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happened? Wasn\u2019t it?\u201d He looked back at me. \u201cThe reason you were crying the night you asked your mom to pick you up? The night she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Ara.\u201d He gripped the back of my head and pulled me into him, squishing my cheek against his warm, soggy cotton shirt. \u201cHe was a fool to turn you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was probably smart.\u201d</p><p>David leaned back a little and cupped my face delicately in his hands. \u201cI guess that explains your over-analysing when I wouldn\u2019t kiss you. I\u2019m sorry. If I had known\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You did the right thing. Better to feel undesirable for a few days than to be dead, right?\u201d I laughed a short release of tension.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d My eyes drifted past David\u2019s to nothing in particular.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019il te plait, mon amour, tell me the truth. It will hurt more if you lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d New tears came for a new kind of pain: betrayal, unrequited love, the loss of a friend. I hadn't cried for Mike yet, and I needed to so badly.</p><p>I closed my eyes, and a tight cramp twisted my heart. If Mike had loved me that night, I wouldn\u2019t be here. But he didn\u2019t, and now I had David\u2014only to lose him, too.</p><p>\u201cI love you more than I love him.\u201d</p><p>David stiffened, straightening away from me. \u201cBut he\u2019s better for you. You can live with him\u2014die with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t love me, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me,\u201d he said coldly.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d My eyes closed involuntarily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know I told you once that I don\u2019t love him. It\u2019s just that\u2014I\u2019m really confused.\u201d I looked at him; he looked away. \u201cWhen Mike rejected me, I locked all the feelings I have for him deep inside. I felt so damn stupid. I didn't even want to admit them to myself.\u201d I touched a hand to my chest, my words a breathless whisper. \u201cI was just trying to forget it happened.\u201d I searched for compassion in David\u2019s eyes, but only a hard man glared down at me, his jaw stiff. Everything around me felt cold; the air, my arms, my face, even my heart.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, with this information coming to light, we no longer need our last two weeks together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid. No,\u201d I said, grabbing his arm, but my words disappeared under a roll of thunder. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We\u2014we can work it out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to work out. You love Mike, and you don\u2019t want immortality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that. Please, we can make our own future. I believe in magic still. I believe there\u2019s hope for us\u2014for our lives, tog\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He placed a finger over my lips and brought his face down to align our eyes. \u201cNo, Ara, my love. It is all too clear to me now. I have to be the strong one, for both of us\u2014\u201d he dropped his finger, \u201c\u2014and you have to be the one that goes on. You must go on, have babies, beautiful babies, and be happy\u2014live that dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it, David?\u201d I shook my head, my eyes still, watering. \u201cYou\u2019re the only dream I want to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. Live. You\u2019ve been waiting for me to tell you I\u2019ll stay, that all of this is some nightmare. But, my love\u2014\u201d His eyes softened, a hundred years of sadness flaming within them. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>I managed one syllable before the smoke of his words stung my eyes, forcing the volcanic eruption of blubbering.</p><p>\u201cDon't cry, sweetheart. I love you, and you will always belong to me. But I can\u2019t keep lying to myself, believing you\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, maybe I will.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again. \u201cEven then, it would only be to save me from eternal solitude. And for that reason, I just can\u2019t take your dreams away. Your human life is your greatest gift and my greatest sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>I sniffled, wiping my hand over my nose. \u201cIt doesn't have to be that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, my love. Look\u2014\u201d He pointed to a blue and black butterfly, dancing in the shelter of a silky leaf. \u201cYou see, you\u2019re much like that butterfly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He wrapped both arms around my waist from behind, tucking his chin against my shoulder. \u201cShe started her life in the shadows, close to the ground. She lived and existed only as others saw her; a caterpillar, nothing more. Then, one day, she bloomed into a beautiful, brightly-winged creature\u2014so free, so pure. Something she could never have been had someone taken her away.</p><p>\u201cHer life is short in comparison to most. But she will live each moment, flying, spreading her beauty, her life through the tree tops, so that when her existence comes to an end, as the sun goes down on her final day, her spirit will go on, and there will always be a beautiful butterfly to carry on her name.\u201d David kissed the top of my ear, smoothing his hands against the skin on my belly just under my top. \u201cI love you, and your spirit will go on. As long as you have happiness, I have everything I will ever desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what will you do without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the rain.\u201d He looked up at the sky; I looked too. \u201cI exist each clouded day whether the butterfly flies or falls. A human life is but only a blink in the eye of eternity. I will go on when you are gone, I will have no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, or move on?\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around me. \u201cI will never move on. The pain I will feel for eternity without you is a sacrifice I am willing to make to save you from forever longing, wishing you\u2019d been given the chance to live. I owe that to you\u2014\u201d He nodded once. \u201cFor the love I feel\u2014I owe that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it? You\u2019re making the decision for me?\u201d I turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cI have to, Ara. I\u2019ve been watching, waiting, scanning your thoughts to find some hint of promise for us. But you don't, anywhere in your thoughts, want to be a vampire. And yet, you keep making me wait for your answer. And stupidly, I keep waiting.\u201d</p><p>I had nothing to say. He was right. Life was just too important. I\u2019d seen it in action; the beauty, the magic it had to offer. And I feared, if I gave that up for immortality, I\u2019d never forgive myself, or worse, never forgive David. \u201cJust give me two weeks more. For forever, please? Just let me have the last two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo more weeks?\u201d He stepped back. \u201cWhile you spend those days with another man\u2014one you happen to love?\u201d</p><p>My head hung in shame. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hate me for loving him, David. I loved him for such a long time before I ever even knew you existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that.\u201d He exhaled, stepping into me. \u201cI just...I suspected it. I'm actually angrier at myself, Ara\u2014for not listening to my own gut\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done if you\u2019d asked me and I\u2019d told you I loved him?\u201d I rolled my face up to look at him. \u201cWould you have left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the stupid thing about all of this.\u201d He sighed, casting his gaze to the heavens.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, even if you had admitted your feelings for Mike\u2014\u201d he touched my cheek and smiled, \u201c\u2014there\u2019s no way I\u2019d have left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t leave yet.\u201d Hope filled me. \u201cGive me the nights\u2014for two more weeks. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to ask. You know I will. How can I not savour those last few nights?\u201d</p><p>I melted against him again. \u201cThank you, David.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, he turned my face so my blue eyes met his shimmering green windows. \u201cI just need to hear you say it, though\u2014from your own lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean...that I\u2019m not coming with you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI haven't made my mind up yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop playing these games, Ara-Rose. Tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the truth, David. My mind makes up its mi\u2014well, my mind makes decisions all the time, doesn\u2019t mean I agree with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d He drew back a little further. \u201cAra, just say it. Just tell me you\u2019re not coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because that\u2019s not what I\u2019ve decided on.\u201d I folded my arms.</p><p>David turned away from me, extending his arm to grasp a tree branch. \u201cYou will eventually have to say it, Ara. Either way, a decision has to be made. Wholeheartedly or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then...ask me on the last day of our two weeks\u2014that way I can be sure you\u2019ll stick around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night of the Masquerade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d I carefully touched his elbow until he turned his face to me. \u201cYou can ask me on the last dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last dance?\u201d He dropped his hand from the branch, his brow staying up in an arch of mockery. \u201cOn the last stroke of midnight?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, smiling. \u201cPerfectly corny.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed me gently by the arm and pulled until my chest fell against his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t really yelling, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter. I shouldn\u2019t speak to you that way, despite how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI yell at you all the time.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cBut you\u2019re harmless. When you yell, it\u2019s merely amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Glad to know you take me so seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly as serious as you take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I slapped his chest softly.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSo, I guess that means you don\u2019t take me very seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I smirked, then remembered the gift I had in my pocket.</p><p>\u201cGift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of my head, vampire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>I ignored that and reached into my pocket, keeping my hand there, unsure if I should do this. \u201cIt\u2019s a little corny, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like corny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smiled warmly. \u201cI figured the old guy in you might like it.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s lips quirked up on one side, his eyes lighting with curiosity. \u201cYou\u2019re getting good at keeping your mind clear when you want to hide something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I grinned and pulled out a small white square of cloth. \u201cYou know in movies, how the fair maiden would sometimes give her knight a handkerchief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d David swept the beads of water through his hair, \u201c\u2014it wasn\u2019t a custom that started in movies, but, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...well, since you have this strong set of beliefs about staying with me at night, I figured you could at least take a part of me home with you.\u201d I pressed the cloth into David\u2019s palm. \u201cIt has my scent on it.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed it. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you were sleeping with this under your pillow the last few nights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You saw that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I thought you might have had a cold or were...crying.\u201d</p><p>I pouted, reaching back into my pocket. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve actually had this diabolical plan going all week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...it isn\u2019t just my scent I want you to have.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay?\u201d His brows pinched with confusion; my shoulders lifted as I clamped my index finger onto the pin in my pocket, then drew my hand out. \u201cAra!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my perfume,\u201d I said quickly, before he could get mad, then dropped a dollop of blood onto the hanky. David\u2019s fingers tightened around mine for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way I could think of to give you a part of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou silly, sweet girl.\u201d He shook his head, then kissed mine. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>Ouch. \u201cI must\u2019ve pricked it pretty deep.\u201d I squeezed the base of my finger. \u201cIt\u2019s still bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t squeeze it\u2014you\u2019ll make it worse.\u201d He pocketed the hanky and took my hand, pausing for only a moment of hesitation, then slid my fingertip into his mouth, closing his lips tightly around it. His smooth, tepid tongue pushed my nail up to the roof of his mouth, sliding slowly down the length of my finger; he closed his eyes, his shoulders lifting with each calm breath. I wasn\u2019t afraid. I wasn't worried he might lose control. There was no urgency to his touch; just a deep longing that I could feel emanating from his skin, coming off him in waves.</p><p>He opened his eyes as he slid my finger past his lips, dropping a gentle kiss there. \u201cAra, you taste amazing\u2014like a creamy dessert wine. Sweet and yet so powerfully intoxicating.\u201d His eyes changed colour around his words, just like they did in the storage closet at school; the green became darker, encircling the growing pupil, almost entirely consuming the whites of his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d</p><p>I stared up at him, blinking each time his warm breath touched my lashes. \u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTelling myself not to touch you, not to...to want you\u2014to drink from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh God, David, don't you know how badly I want that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And that\u2019s what makes it so much harder for me to refuse you.\u201d</p><p>My eyelids fluttered involuntarily. \u201cI don't want you to refuse me.\u201d</p><p>He tried an accusatory glare, but the look washed away quickly as he ran his tongue over his lips one last time and the history of my blood clearly fell against it. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine what?\u201d</p><p>The vampire surfaced within his eyes; he cupped the side of my neck, his body inches from mine, his breath suddenly weighted, fast. \u201cI\u2019m going to drink from you. But not with your clothes on.\u201d</p> <p>I looked down at my jeans, then back up at the vampire. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires like skin; we need skin. If we do this with clothes on\u2014\u201d he looked away for a second, \u201c\u2014when I get carried away, I might rip them off you. I don\u2019t wish to explain to your father why I\u2019m bringing you home naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I laughed, but a sudden sinking feeling shot through my arms, like a hot blast of toxic, adrenaline-inducing drugs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He placed a steadying hand over my heart. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything to hurt you. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d I disentangled my fingers from their ball-grip. \u201cIt\u2019s just that no one\u2019s ever seen me...naked before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m afraid...that you might be...disappointed.\u201d</p><p>I tensed, waiting for him to laugh, but he only slid the backs of his fingertips along my cheekbone and stared deeply into my eyes, reaching down to take my wrist with his other hand. \u201cWhat if I were to undress, and suddenly you decided I was not as...hot as you thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I smiled. \u201cImpossible. You\u2019re totally hot, and besides, as if I\u2019d care. I love you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at me. \u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d I frowned at myself. \u201cNaked then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He released my wrist and fingered the base of my tank top. \u201cNaked.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders rounded, hunching slightly as he lifted it, revealing the strip of white skin above my jeans, then my belly button and my ribs. I stiffened all over, realising I hadn\u2019t planned my undergarments to suit this kind of...misbehaviour.</p><p>\u201cDon't worry,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cYou won\u2019t be wearing them for much longer anyway.\u201d</p><p>And so many pictures of all the things we would do ran through my mind; I knew David could see each and every one of them.</p><p>I lifted my arms above my head, and a breath of a smile swept across my lips as David dropped my top to the wet grass and stepped back, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cAra, my love.\u201d That look warmed his entire face. \u201cYou are incredibly perfect.\u201d</p><p>I quickly covered my purple and pink candy-striped bra. \u201cEven in a bra from the same boutique as Bozo the Clown?\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s burst of laughter caught me off guard, making me smile. He reached out, took each of my hands, and pulled them away from my ribs. \u201cThis\u2014\u201d he nodded to my bra, \u201c\u2014is just another thing that makes you so damn sweet and cute. You\u2019re seventeen. I didn\u2019t expect black lace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I look like a flamboyant zebra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I feel naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not\u2014yet.\u201d His eyes slowly drifted to my jeans. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I nodded, holding my breath.</p><p>In one yank of my button-fly jeans, the denim parted, revealing my pink underwear. I drove my thumbs into the waist and shimmied them down my hips, feeling the air cool my skin where the rain made it soggy under my jeans. David watched, his eyes falling past my underwear to the apex of my thighs, down my skinny white legs and to my knees, his lips splitting into a grin when I carelessly stumbled and tripped, kicking my ankles free with about as much finesse as a drunkard.</p><p>As I stood expectantly in front of him, more naked than I\u2019d ever been with anyone, the whirling winds circled the clearing, sweeping my hips, my arms, my belly, touching all the places I knew David was dreaming about. And for the first time in my life, I felt beautiful before his eyes.</p><p>The patters of rain stopped completely then and the beads of water glistening in David\u2019s hair and over his lashes looked almost out of place. His golden skin showed through his white t-shirt, made almost see-through by the rain, hugging the curvy bulk of his chest and arms. He spread the collar and slipped it past his head, peeling it away, all sticky and soggy, from his skin, then dropped it to the grass beside my clothes. I smiled at the pile; he smiled, too.</p><p>The sun wandered in for a peek at this innocent step toward danger, making the water on David\u2019s skin sparkle. He looked as though he was starring in the wrong storybook.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI like the sun on your skin.\u201d</p><p>He angled his arm outward and studied it, running a hand down the droplets, his eyes flashing to another thought for a second.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you just thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Uh\u2014just that...\u201d He laughed. \u201cI hope the rain didn\u2019t soak through my jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, watching him unbutton them.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, slipping them down his hips. \u201cMy briefs are white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I said, but as soon as I heard my own words, the white of his shirt, all see-through with the water, registered in my mind. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He winked and tossed his jeans aside, allowing me a moment to scrutinise. My waterfall gaze drifted over his broad shoulders and the tight skin across his chest, down the cagey ripples of his ribs, stopping at the thick band of his underwear. Above those, there wasn\u2019t the obvious six-pack I kind of expected, just that nicely contoured \u2018V\u2019 leading up smoothly to his ribs.</p><p>A girly giggle twitched at my lips. \u201cI always wondered if you were a boxers or briefs guy.\u201d</p><p>David looked down, then shrugged. \u201cThese are kind of in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re sexy and\u2014\u201d I pouted. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get wet.\u201d</p><p>He threw his head back, laughing. \u201cQuite frankly, I\u2019m relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d The heavens forced my gaze away from him, \u201cThey won\u2019t be dry for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He curled his palm and caught a few raindrops. \u201cI should be taking you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>My toes angled inward, my lip hiding behind my teeth as his suggestive smile brought my blood up to my heart in a heat wave. \u201cI want you to come closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His words landed all hot and moist on my face, his chest suddenly inches from mine. \u201cAnd it\u2019s taking everything in me not to want you right now.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou can want me.\u201d</p><p>David folded over a little, his brow coming to rest on mine; I looked up into the anguish his closed eyes tried to hide. \u201cLay down,\u201d he whispered, stepping back.</p><p>The grassy bed beneath my feet felt sticky, the summer\u2019s dying heat making the rain rise off it in a warm cloud. David stayed standing, stiff and tall as a tower, while I pressed my palms to the grass, my elbows shaking, and edged jaggedly onto my back, trying to look relaxed.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he demanded sweetly, still not opening his.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, but after six long breaths and two fistfuls of grass pulled from the soil, only an empty breeze had caressed my half-naked body. I opened my eyes. David?\u201d</p><p>I watched him expectantly, waiting for him to look at me. He didn\u2019t. He was fighting that battle within\u2014the war between the vampire and the human\u2014and as he dropped to one knee, then the other, his fists tight, my main concern was not the possibility of my own death, but that he might deny himself the pleasure of my blood.</p><p>\u201cYou remember not to scream, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, biting my lower lip.</p><p>Without a second thought, both his hands cupped my face, then slid down my jaw and over the curve of my neck, slipping my bra strap off my shoulder. \u201cJust stay still, Ara.\u201d</p><p>The air coming into my lungs felt empty. \u201cAre you...are you going to take my bra off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>My eyes opened to his breath on my chin, his lips within reach, his body immensely close but not touching; wanting but not taking, practically floating down the length of mine like he was just a layer of heat in the atmosphere. Every nerve in my brain called out to him; every part of my body, tingling hot, begged him to press himself against me.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t move. He just smiled to himself, leaning on his elbow beside me. \u201cWell, do you want me to take it off you or not?\u201d</p><p>I could feel my pulse, racing like a twitch in my neck; felt my body succumb to the lust\u2014scream out its own instinct-driven desire to die at his hands. But I wasn\u2019t ready to undress completely. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>His eyes stayed on the bare patch of skin, his lips softly landing there as he smoothed the strap back in place. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, then quickly reached down to scratch my sticky leg. \u201cThe grass is just really itchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I run to the rock and get the picnic rug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, eyes wide. That would just give him too much time to think about what he didn\u2019t want to do to me.</p><p>He smiled to himself\u2014his secret smile\u2014and cupped my neck, his thumb sliding down over my chin easily with the rain\u2019s assistance, coming to rest just under my jaw, tipping it up to expose my throat. \u201cYour life is in my hands right now,\u201d he whispered against my pulse. \u201cAnd the most beautiful thing about that, Ara, is that all I can read in your mind is desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's because you don\u2019t scare me, Mr Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, keeping his eyes on mine as he reached down and took my hand, folding it open to press a firm kiss on the softer, more delicate side. \u201cI like you this way.\u201d</p><p>I looked at his nail sitting ready at my wrist, one firm indent away from releasing my blood. \u201cThen what are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone to stop me.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cI trust you, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He traced a shallow, horizontal line, drawing slivers of red out over my milk-white skin, like pinhead rivers running quickly for the sea. But I didn\u2019t feel the cut\u2014just the pressure of his fingers gripping my bone.</p><p>Only a beat passed after that before the black in his eyes washed the human away\u2014the vampire taking control, pressing his teeth down on the outer edges of the wound to open it further. Thousands of tiny bubbles raced up my veins, making my fingers want so badly to flex out and either shove him away or run along his jaw.</p><p>My blood could finally reach him\u2014was deep inside him right now, touching his heart, coursing through his veins, warming everything I could never physically touch. I wanted it to stay there forever. I wanted the sun to go down around us, and rise again tomorrow, leaving us here like this, always.</p><p>I rolled my face to the leaves above, watching them swirl around, while my lungs filled with humid air, the rain moistening the back of my throat with each shallow breath. And the feel of David's thumb in the cup of my palm, holding my hand in place against the stubble on his chin, made me feel so close to him\u2014to the human that loved me; the human that was buried deep beneath desire right now.</p><p>But the trust was magic\u2014almost euphoric, as if the world around me was just a soft echo\u2014like being lost in the perfectly tuned note of a song I\u2019d never heard. I could float away, were it not for David grounding me, keeping me here. I finally knew what it felt like to be his victim; a human that could nourish him, but loved enough to be left alive. I felt the lick of death, felt the peace others must feel when they finally give over to it\u2014how nothing in the world really mattered anymore. In a funny way, it all just seemed kind of silly to worry about the things we did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slowly, David drew away, leaving a moist, cool patch on my wrist, and smiled down at me. A stain of crimson love bled from his lips in rivulets, seeping out over his perfect smile.</p><p>My chest and shoulders lifted with each deep breath, guiding my soul back to the present.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, my love?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cI might actually have found Heaven on Earth.\u201d</p><p>David studied my face for a second, then cupped the back of my head and rolled me up, slipping behind me, slowly looping his arms around my shoulders, like the wings of a mother swan. \u201cI think you\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p><p>I giggled quietly, resting my feet beside his, our knees bent, committing the feel of his bare chest on my slippery, rain-soaked spine to memory. If I ignored the breeze making my wet bra cold, I could actually pretend we really were naked together. \u201cThank you, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>For letting me have my own way, for wanting it, too, for not denying that he wanted it, for being more than just an ordinary boy\u2014for... \u201cFor being real.\u201d I tucked my brow against his ear and slowly tickled the back of his wrist, imagining his blood in my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to imagine it, Ara,\u201d he said, kissing the bone above my eye. \u201cIf you want it, you can have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I turned slightly at the shoulders to look back at him.</p><p>He lifted his wrist and shut his eyes tight for a second, and when I snuggled my spine against his chest again, saw red gush out over his skin. He tipped his arm, balancing the liquid there as he slowly offered it to my lips.</p><p>Without hesitation, I opened my mouth and scooped up the runaway drops with my tongue, wrapping my lips around his arm, the warmth of sweet orange-chocolate flooding my mouth like liquid made of satin ribbons.</p><p>\u201cDescribe it to me,\u201d he whispered into my hair. \u201cIn your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>I swirled the warm blood around on my tongue and let it slide down my throat, into my stomach\u2014like the first hot cocoa of winter; smooth and rich, warm\u2014like his voice. You taste like...like...</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He slid his index finger against my lip then down my chin, gently pulling my face away from his wrist. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, my love. I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019ll do to you.\u201d</p><p>Through the whir of the world spinning around me, I turned my head and looked up into David\u2019s eyes, filling with that amazing, almost transparent shade of green, but brighter than ever before\u2014Dorothy\u2019s Emerald City illustrated in the gaze of a vampire. \u201cDavid, I think I can see your soul.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes around a smile. \u201cYou are so damn sweet.\u201d</p><p>I licked my teeth, tasting his blood again. \u201cMm, no, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, huh?\u201d He looked at my lips, moving slowly onto his knees in front of me. \u201cLet me taste it.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to touch David\u2019s, his tongue skimming across mine, pushing it away from the sharp edges of his fangs. Warm sweet butter and salty copper mixed in our kiss, and it almost felt like David and I were thinking the same thing\u2014thinking how amazing it was to taste the essence of him and me; everything that made us exist broken down to flavour between our lips\u2014tangible, real.</p><p>My body sung with ideas and desires too long refused.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d David whispered into my breath.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d I angled my face to the sky, laying back on my elbows as his lips travelled down my neck, over each and every one of the tiny scars there.</p><p>\u201cI know how you feel.\u201d</p><p>I moaned, my breath expelling in a half gasp as his lips circled my navel suddenly. \u201cMm. I don\u2019t think you do.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, my wet skin making the path of his breath obvious.</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d I parted my knees and let him kiss my inner thigh, feeling his wet hair drip against my undies. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know every inch of your body by only the memory of my lips.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flung open as he kissed fabric, folding it down over my hips a little.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t go there\u2014today.\u201d</p><p>Droplets of rain tickled my flesh, skimming silkily over my belly, staying on my skin until they reached my back, soaking away into the ground then. It was cold, I could tell, and I hoped the goosebumps over my skin, probably making my legs prickly, didn\u2019t turn David off touching me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not prickly, Ara,\u201d David said, caressing the underside of my knee delicately, bringing my ankle up over his hip as he drank the rain from the curve of my waist.</p><p>I drove my fingers into his wet hair, following the movements of his head against my skin. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to feel you against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d he said, and when I hooked my fingers just under his elbows and tugged him upward, his bare chest and arms slipped across my body, stealing a quick gasp as I felt him on top of me for the first time. It was like a hunger finally fed; a wave finally meeting a rock, dissolving into spray. For everything else in the world that made me cry, in this moment I finally found life. I wanted to tear away the wet remains of fabric between us and feel him inside me.</p><p>He laughed breathily into the flesh just below my ear. \u201cAra, I can't think straight when you think that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t then. When you think straight, you deny me what I want.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and pushed up slowly on his elbows, elevating his chest from mine.</p><p>I stared him down, beads of water blinding me, the rain pouring into our quiet little world as if it had no care for the fact that our forever was limited. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d I said. \u201cI know you\u2019re about to tell me we have to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have good reason for that.\u201d He rose onto his knees, keeping his hands beside my shoulders, his body forming a shelter over mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat reason?\u201d</p><p>David nodded to the now dark sky. \u201cThat rain\u2019s gonna get heavier any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This sucks! You never give me my own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my love, is because your own way involves me taking something from you I'm not willing to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy virginity?\u201d</p><p>A cheeky grin spread across his face, golden under the grey sky. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my holy, freakin\u2019 God. You have got to be kidding me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I'm not.\u201d</p><p>With the cold conclusiveness of reason, the small split in my wrist started stinging. \u201cWhy? Is my virginity like kryptonite or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Even better.\u201d He dropped a quick kiss on my mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s sacred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacred?\u201d My arched brow thickened the sarcasm.</p><p>He breathed out through his nose, closing his lips into a thin smile. \u201cYes, my love. You will always remember your first. If you choose not to come with me, one day you will fall in love with someone else, and you\u2019ll want to be pure\u2014untainted\u2014for him. If I take you now, you can never go back. I would hate for you to regret any of our interactions one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid. This is the new world. It doesn\u2019t work like that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be so, but it still works that way for me.\u201d His wide, sincere eyes looked right into mine, his voice intense with conviction. \u201cIn my society, virginity is a virtue to be praised and cherished, not something girls give away without reflection or care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, please? It\u2019s what I want for you.\u201d His harsh tone forced me into silence. \u201cSometimes you can think too much with your heart and not enough with your head. I have to be the adult here. I have to protect you from yourself\u2014from your human nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, David, I can take care of myself. I\u2019m a big\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to protect you,\u201d he scolded then softened. \u201cEven if it means I\u2019m falling apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it\u2019s fine.\u201d I looked to the side, tears coating my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome on then\u2014\u201d He pulled away a little, helping me to my feet, standing closer while I closed my eyes, waiting for the world to stop dancing. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, rolling my undies back to the correct position.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get you home before you catch a cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I threw my arms around his ribs and cupped my wrist, forming a chain of unyielding force. \u201cWe\u2019re staying a little longer today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? And...\u201d He tried to lift my chin; I held fast, refusing to even look at him. He gave in. \u201cWhat exactly are you going to do if I decide to force you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, you\u2019re so sure of yourself,\u201d he said, but I heard the smile in his tone, and the fact that he did nothing else except tangle his fingertips in the hair at the nape of my neck and hold me, proved I was right.</p><p>My bones turned to rubber inside my flesh, loving the closeness of skin on skin, with my vampire. And though the summer rain continued, I felt only warmth. His blood had awakened me, like a powerful drug, and mine had filled his veins\u2014giving him life, fuelling his movements. There was no fear\u2014no weight to the truth right now that, one day, he'd be gone, and my arms would fall empty to my sides\u2014the feel of his embrace gone, his body gone, his smile just a memory fading, and his lips, never more a kiss that belonged to me.</p><p>But I owned it now.</p><p>I smiled into his skin.</p><p>Despite everything that waited, despite everything I knew would happen, it felt like I could exist eternally, living forever in this one breath of closeness with my everlasting knight. For today, there was no tomorrow.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose?\u201d Vicki called from downstairs.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I answered quickly so she wouldn't come up and spot my vampire pillow.</p><p>\u201cEmily\u2019s on the phone,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cErgh! Why\u2019d she call the home line?\u201d I said to myself. \u201cI have a mobile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was probably hoping your dad would answer,\u201d David said, his voice a gentle hum against my ear through his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, she needs therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then you could go together.\u201d</p><p>I slapped his arm; he pretended to be hurt, rolling up a little.</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose! Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d I called to Vicki.</p><p>David grabbed my hand as I fell away from his arms. \u201cDon\u2019t go? Emily can call back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I\u2019m up now. I won\u2019t be long, okay?\u201d</p><p>He groaned, then rolled over, snuggling into the pillow where my body had just been. \u201cBe quick. It\u2019s cold here without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Since David closed my curtains when he came through my window earlier, I didn\u2019t notice the grey day until I stepped into the fresh, cool air of the hallway. The windows all around the house were open, same as every weekend, and the soft lemon scent of Vicki\u2019s bathroom cleaner mixed with the moist weight of freshly cut grass, drying the back of my throat as I drew a deep breath. I tucked my hands under my arms, wishing I\u2019d put on a sweater to come down. \u201cMorning, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He smiled over his newspaper. \u201cMorning, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny good news?\u201d I hurried past him to the phone on the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I always say,\u201d he moaned, lowering his nose into the paper again.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. No need to say it, Dad.\u201d I took the phone from Vicki. \u201cHey, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara. What are you two doing today?\u201d</p><p>By \u2018you two\u2019, I assumed she was referring to David and I. \u201cLazing around. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s going bowling tonight. You guys wanna come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d Bowling versus bed with David. I leaned against the wall. \u201cMaybe. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay, well, yeah. I\u2019d say we will, but I\u2019ll have to check with David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. When will you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I hang up the phone.\u201d I grinned, watching Vicki. She had no clue what I was talking about, thank God.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, Ara. You rebel. Did he stay last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Nothing like that. Just...early,\u201d I hinted, hoping she\u2019d catch my drift\u2014and couldn\u2019t help smiling suggestively.</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. So, like, sneak through the window sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d I giggled; Vicki looked at me with a raised brow. \u201cSo, six then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, see you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya.\u201d</p><p>The phone clinked, and suddenly I was back in the kitchen with my parents.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Emily want?\u201d Vicki asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going bowling tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you and David going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so far. I\u2019ll have to check if he wants to\u2014but I\u2019d say we probably will.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is David coming over today?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s already here. \u201cDon\u2019t know. But I\u2019m going to get some more sleep before he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep? It\u2019s nine in the morning, Ara,\u201d Vicki stated.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a teenager. Aren\u2019t we supposed to hibernate?\u201d</p><p>The only other sound Vicki made as I walked away was a loud sigh. What could she say, really? This is what she wanted; a normal teenage girl.</p><p>The soft strumming of guitar filled the hallway with an easygoing air as I stomped back up to my room. When I pushed my door open, expecting to see the outline of a vampire, my smile dropped as the bright yellow light of morning shone through my open curtains\u2014onto my empty bed. My eyes darted quickly to the iPod, in its dock, with a song playing at a volume my dad would approve of. And as I watched the rain spatter on the glass of my window, blurring my vision of the outside world, I listened to the words, gathering that my vampire meant them as a musical sticky-note saying, My love, I shall return soon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not that that\u2019s what the words were, but that\u2019s how David would say it.</p><p>With the absence of an all-hearing vampire in my room, I took a moment to be human, then jumped into the welcoming, enveloping heat of the shower, washed my hair quickly and jumped out, wrapping the towel around my chest and tucking it under my arm.</p><p>As I stepped back into my room, a sudden breeze swept through my window and knocked all the papers off my desk. \u201cDamn it, David,\u201d I said to myself, squatting down to pick them up. I was sure that was closed a second ago.</p> <p>\u201cIt was. I opened it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgh! David!\u201d My heart splattered in my chest; I looked up from my precarious squat on the ground to the vampire perched on the windowsill like a pterodactyl. \u201cYou scared the living bejeezus out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing out there?\u201d I stood up, tapping the edges to force them into a neat stack. \u201cYou ruined my homework pile. Now I have to reorder these before I hand them in to Dad tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d He shrugged, obviously in no hurry to remove himself from the path of the whipping breeze.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you just sitting there?\u201d I looked at him suspiciously. \u201cAre you hiding something?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, one of his eyes narrowing slightly into his smile as he looked over my wet, towel-covered body. \u201cI\u2019m just admiring the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better mean the stunning panoramic view of the hills and my backyard, David Knight.\u201d I dumped my disordered papers on my desk and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cNope. I meant my beautiful, almost-naked girlfriend.\u201d He jumped down from the ledge, slowly pushing the window closed behind him. \u201cSo\u2014bowling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d I said, inhaling the fresh cologne wafting off this suave boy as he stepped in front of me, hair all wet and brushed back, for once, showing his forehead. He looked more like a man today in that black hoodie and grey V-neck shirt than he ever had before. It almost made me sad that he\u2019d never grow older than nineteen. \u201cSo, do you actually want to go bowling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m with you, I will do anything.\u201d He smiled down at me, his eyes becoming small with warmth. \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t stand in front of me like this, my love. You make me think inappropriate things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Sorry. So\u2014\u201d I took a wide step back, \u201c\u2014are you any good at bowling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget\u2014\u201d he used a louder voice to call out as I disappeared into my wardrobe, \u201c\u2014I lived through the fifties. Bowling was huge then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re any good at it,\u201d I stated, slipping my emerald-green sweater over my head.</p><p>\u201cTrue. It\u2019s more like I have to try to be bad. I\u2019m a little too precise. I\u2019ve also been known to break a pin or two.\u201d</p><p>I turned around, buttoning my jeans, and met cheek-to-chest with the rain-dotted fabric of David\u2019s jacket. \u201cHey! How did you even know I was finished getting dressed in here? I could\u2019ve been naked.\u201d</p><p>He tapped his temple, grinning.</p><p>Hmpf! \u201cIs there any point in me even dressing in a different room\u2014with you and your mind-reading invading my privacy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEtiquette?\u201d He shrugged. Then, as his eyes traced over the low, rounded neckline of my sweater, his finger copied. \u201cI like this.\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes. \u201cI like you touching me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d His finger came away, a sudden tone of urgency making my eyes open. \u201cAre you up for a little outing today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I have a few notes and references to finish on my paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich paper?\u201d He followed me out of the wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cThe mythology one\u2014on vampires,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cThe subject I told you not to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>David smiled, nodding toward my suddenly very neatly reordered pile of papers. \u201cOr do you mean the report I just finished for you? The one on angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngels?\u201d I ran over to my desk and flicked through the pages. \u201cNo! I spent hours working on that, David!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And it was a great report. But I told you not to do vampires\u2014you didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why?\u201d I spun around and leaned on the desk. \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you know things you shouldn\u2019t, and if you happen to publish any minor detail of fact, and my Set were to somehow find out, I could be punished, and you\u2014\u201d His words trailed off.</p><p>\u201cI...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be killed. It\u2019s not worth the risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He rested a finger to his lip. \u201cYour dad doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here, remember? Look, I didn\u2019t want to tell you that because I didn\u2019t want you to worry. I just hoped you\u2019d listen to me\u2014for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was naive.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>David smiled too. \u201cI know that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s what you were doing\u2014when I came out of the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He laughed, wiping a hand across his jaw. \u201cYou actually snuck up on me\u2014for once. The evidence was still in my hands. I had to leave it on the windowsill and hope it didn\u2019t blow away while you were standing there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve just told me the truth.\u201d I stepped into him, tucking my arms along his ribs. \u201cThat would\u2019ve made me change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that for the future.\u201d He kissed the crown of my head.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014what punishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said they\u2019d punish you if I published any facts. What would they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, maybe a seven-day-burial, a month being tortured by the First Order, or a personal favourite of my Set...a complete draining,\u201d he said casually.</p><p>\u201cDraining?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d He nodded, his mouth small. \u201cThey drain every ounce of blood from your arteries and leave you parched and partially insane in a dark room for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they drain you? You heal like superglue\u2014how do they get the blood out fast enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey place a metal vise, right here\u2014\u201d he pinched his fingers, then spread them outward a few inches above his wrist, \u201c\u2014it holds the arteries open\u2014prevents closing and healing of the wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to tell you. I knew you\u2019d ask these questions and not let up until you had all the gory facts, well\u2014\u201d he stopped with a non-committal shrug, \u201c\u2014either that or not speak to me for three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, with that in mind, a paper on angels will be great.\u201d I pointed into his face. \u201cAnd I better get an A.\u201d</p><p>David laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you will. So\u2014\u201d he scratched his nose, \u201c\u2014an outing then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>He walked away and opened my bedroom door, then turned back with a grin. \u201cI thought I might teach you a little about history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I live with a History professor.\u201d Our hands linked back together. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can teach me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that,\u201d he mused. \u201cCome on, meet me at the front door in twenty seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty?\u201d</p><p>He kissed my cheek and, with less than a sweeping breeze, disappeared out the window\u2014closing it behind him.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Sam called. \u201cPrince Charming just pulled up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to call him that, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh. You\u2019re such a pain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than being a troll.\u201d The front door opened. \u201cHi, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d David said.</p><p>Do me a favour, I thought, for David\u2019s purpose, tie his shoelaces together when he\u2019s not looking?</p><p>\u201cI see you two still haven\u2019t managed to find common ground.\u201d David walked in and looked up expectantly at me.</p><p>\u201cHard to find a way to relate to a serpent,\u201d Sam said, keeping his nose in his book. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just have to dumb myself down a little so we can hold a decent conversation one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I have to put up with?\u201d I said to David, grabbing my coat as I shut my door.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d I stomped down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cSleep well?\u201d he asked, pecking me on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cBetter than ever before.\u201d I grinned suggestively.</p><p>Sam groaned, rolling his eyes. \u201cGet a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrow up, Sam,\u201d I said, slamming the front door behind David and I, but an almighty crash from inside stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sam\u2019s high-pitched screech echoed across the street. \u201cWho tied my laces together?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at David.</p><p>He shrugged and smiled.</p><p>The car door opened, and a cool breeze eased the dread compressing my lungs. Across the road, wiry branches guarded iron gates, warding visitors away from the dwelling of the dead or, perhaps, imprisoning them. And the worst part was, something told me that was our destination.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I grabbed his sleeve, folding myself against his arm. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on\u2014it\u2019s okay. I wanna show you something.\u201d He took my hand and led me through a gap in the creaking gates, lifting the heavy chain so I could duck under. The air smelled murky with rotting leaves under the diluted scent of dead roses, their brown petals blown away in the wind, littering the cobblestone path like confetti.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. I\u2019m taking you to an older part of the cemetery\u2014there are trees there and it\u2019s not so\u2014\u201d he looked around the yard; I looked too, at the way the low cloud in the sky made everything look dark grey and... \u201cEerie,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>\u201cYeah, eerie is exactly what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly and held me close as we strolled past rows and rows of headstones.</p><p>In the distance, a murder of crows blackened the day, gathering at the feet of a caretaker tending a grave. They cawed loudly, their sinister fables setting me on edge.</p><p>\u201cSee that grave there?\u201d David pointed to a cracked plaque, barely able to stand within the stone grasp of its template.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm. Marcus Worthington\u2014died eighteen-forty?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine. Goes by the name of Philippe now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...he\u2019s not actually buried there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. In fact, many of the graves in any ancient cemetery are actually empty. The bodies either still living, or removed for scientific research hundreds of years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. I suppose it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not in one of these graves.\u201d I snuggled against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the thing\u2014\u201d He pointed to a towering oak tree at the top of a small hill, sheltering five small headstones from the threatening storm. \u201cSee that group of graves up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my family\u2019s plot.\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking. David grinned and walked ahead.</p><p>Oh boy, when he said history, I had no idea he meant this kind of history. I caught up to him, huffing and puffing a little, and stood by his side, watching his nostalgic smile fall on the first headstone.</p><p>\u201cSee this?\u201d He pointed down.</p><p>\u201cHere lies Thomas Arthur Knight. Beloved father and husband. Died nineteen-oh-four,\u201d I read aloud. \u201cWho was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father.\u201d</p><p>My head whipped back up to look at David. He stuffed his hands in his pockets, wearing a cheeky grin.</p><p>\u201cYou were nine when he died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurning ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who was this?\u201d I stepped around the base of the grave, so as not to walk on the dead, and dusted some dried orange leaves off the next stone. \u201cMary Elizabeth Knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d his tone softened on the word.</p><p>I looked back at the grave with wide eyes, kneeling down to dust a few more leaves from the base, then traced my fingers over the stone carving of letters. \u201cDied in childbirth, eighteen-ninety-four.\u201d</p><p>The inscription on her headstone made me sad. She never made it to motherhood; they couldn\u2019t even give her the dignity of citing that she\u2019d been a beloved wife and mother? Only died in childbirth. It seemed so cold.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t cold, sweetheart. Not intentionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven still,\u201d I said, dusting off my jeans as I stood back up, \u201cit sounds cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He nodded, considering the grave. \u201cMy father was destroyed when she died. He was expected to put up a strong front, but his grief was so deep that he became a recluse\u2014couldn\u2019t even make arrangements for her burial. In the end, Father John had to step in and take charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The worst part is\u2014\u201d he pointed to the word Mary, \u201c\u2014no one ever called my mother by her real name. She was known as Elizabeth. That name should have marked her final resting place, but the priest didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you change it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Arthur wanted to. He and my mother were...close, but my father forbade him. Even when Father passed, Arthur would not go against the right of a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow noble of him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d David took my hand and led me away, \u201c\u2014he\u2019s been around a while. He\u2019s old-fashioned.\u201d When we stopped in front of the next two headstones, David smiled, rocking back on his heels. \u201cThese two are the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason Gabriel Knight. Nineteen-sixteen,\u201d I read, but it was the second one that grabbed my attention straight away; my heart jumped into my chest when I saw his name written there, even though I was standing right beside him;</p><p>David Thomas Knight\u2014beloved son and hero.</p> <p>1894-1918.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was an explosion. A bomb.\u201d His tight smile caged laughter. \u201cThere was no way anyone could\u2019ve survived it. Pertinent to our laws, I had no choice but to move on and become somebody else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you the only one killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully, yes. But, I had established quite a good life for myself; had plenty of money in the bank, a house, friends\u2014but no will. So, with my brother and only kin supposedly dead, my estate became ward of the government, and I had to start all over again.\u201d He laughed; I covered my mouth. \u201cTalk about learning from your mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, what good would mistakes be if you didn\u2019t get to learn from them?\u201d I shrugged, then looked down at the next headstone in the plot. The name didn\u2019t match the others though; hers was Deveraux.</p><p>\u201cShe was my mother\u2014\u201d David answered my thought, \u201c\u2014my aunt by blood, but mother by choice.\u201d He stepped away and drew the dried brown vine hugging the stone top away, revealing a name and an inscription on the bronze plate:</p><p>Arietta Mary Deveraux</p><p>Beloved Mother and Aunt.</p><p>Lies beneath, sent to the earth with child in arms.</p><p>Safe for eternity in the embrace of the Lord. 1908.</p> <p>My skin tightened with little bumps. \u201cChild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d David whispered. \u201cShe died the second the child was born.\u201d He focused on his toe as he scuffed up a chunk of grass. \u201cWe buried them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen-oh-eight? So you were only...\u201d I counted in my head for a second.</p><p>\u201cI turned fourteen a few months after she died,\u201d David said.</p><p>I watched the grief trickle across his brow before he contained it. \u201cAfter all these years, you still feel it? You still feel her loss so strongly?\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip. \u201cThere are some things you can never move on from, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, she died in childbirth\u2014like your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The way he said that, his voice laden with detest, made my blood run cold.</p> <p>\u201cWill you tell me what happened?\u201d I asked cautiously.</p><p>David looked up at me quickly, then, leaving my words alone behind him, walked over and sunk down on the grass with his back against her stone\u2014as if he\u2019d sat there a thousand times before. \u201cYou look like her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHer hair was long, like yours, but as gold as the sun. And her eyes\u2014\u201d he closed his, dropping his head as a slight smile lifted his lips, \u201c\u2014as blue as the ocean. She would have loved you.\u201d He patted the spot next to him; I sat down, my back against the stone, too, my legs crossed. \u201cShe would have been proud of me to have found such a sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she knows\u2014somehow.\u201d I wanted to take his hand, but there was an air of tension around him\u2014threatening, like he\u2019d explode if I touched him.</p><p>\u201cSo you believe in the afterlife\u2014believe they\u2019re watching over us?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI guess I have to. Otherwise it all just feels too final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is final,\u201d he said coldly, obviously not realising how deep that hurt. His gaze frosted the distant horizon, his hands tight in his lap. \u201cEver since the day she came to retrieve us from the orphanage after my father passed away, she treated Jason and I as if we were her own sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in an orphanage?\u201d I cut in.</p><p>\u201cIt was temporary\u2014while they waited for her to arrive from England.\u201d He seemed to watch a memory on the grass between his feet. \u201cBut we were treated kindly there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, no Oliver Twist scenario?\u201d</p><p>David laughed once. \u201cNo. Nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your uncle? Why didn\u2019t he take you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet rules,\u201d he stated.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Of course, silly me.</p><p>\u201cWell, in Arthur\u2019s defence, when Arietta passed, he managed to have many rules bent in order to have Jason and I in his charge. It\u2019s never been done before, or again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose butt did he kiss?\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cThe king\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, and something in the brevity of his words made my curiosity on that subject flee. \u201cSo, how did Arietta die?\u201d</p><p>He picked up an orange, star-shaped leaf, scratching the veins with his thumbnail. \u201cI knew you couldn\u2019t resist asking me that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. You don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d I folded my hands into my lap and looked up at the tree above us; the leaves rustled lightly in the breeze, and despite this being a place the dead rested, I felt comfortable here, like it was just some pleasant picnic spot\u2014somewhere to sit and think about the past.</p><p>\u201cShe always wanted children,\u201d he said out of the blue; I sat still, holding my breath in case he should change his mind. \u201cShe loved my brother and I, but wanted a daughter. She used to play hopscotch with the little girls on the sidewalk outside our house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love hopscotch.\u201d</p><p>David smiled at me. \u201cThe summer after my father\u2019s passing, Arietta was walking to the market when a sailor stopped her on the roadside. He asked if she was okay, and she asked why he would inquire such an odd question to a stranger who showed no signs of distress. When he said he was concerned for her pain\u2014since it must have hurt when she fell from Heaven, she fell completely and unconditionally in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he sounds charming.\u201d I grinned woefully. \u201cIn a corny kind of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was charming and kind. He treated Jason and I as if we were his own sons. Victor Stronghold was his name, and soon, became Arietta\u2019s. And we were happy.\u201d He nodded. \u201cVictor took us fishing and camping, taught us how to play baseball and showed us maps of the world. But happiness was short lived. They had tried for so long to have a child, and when the days of waiting for the stork to arrive became years\u2014we all lost hope.</p><p>\u201cI was nearly thirteen when Uncle Arthur came to visit. He and my aunt became close. Victor was called away to duty in the Navy for six months and\u2014\u201d David scratched his brow, \u201c\u2014when he returned, Arietta was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was your uncle\u2019s baby?\u201d I asked, my eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cYes. Victor was devastated and humiliated. He left town for a few months, but returned later and begged her to stay with him\u2014despite her indiscretions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have really loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently. But she refused\u2014repeatedly. I remember them fighting about it...at night...while we cowered in our beds, frightened Victor would hurt our aunt. One night she announced to him that she\u2019d be marrying Arthur. So he left, and life went on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. So, just to be clear. Arthur was a vampire then?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe was. He planned to change Arietta after the child was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>David plucked the dry edges of the leaf in hand and flicked the debris onto the wind. \u201cThe doctor predicted the child would arrive in spring, but the snow had started to melt and the days turn warm and still, nothing happened. I stayed home from school for more than a fortnight to watch over her until, one day, she packed my lunch and sent me out the door\u2014told me she would be fine.\u201d He rested the back of his head against the stone. \u201cI remember it all like it was yesterday. So many things aligned to allow tragedy to upturn our lives that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Arthur was running errands on the other side of the Port\u2014a day\u2019s travel by foot\u2014\u201d He straightened his leg, \u201c\u2014and Jason and I would not be home until sunset, at the earliest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d I waited, but he\u2019d obviously continued living the story inside his mind, forgetting to share. \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He rolled his head sideways to look at me. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I can talk about this, Ara. It\u2019s too...\u201d I watched his flat palm smooth circles over the left side of his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s too painful.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I\u2014\u201d He sat up more and reached for my face. \u201cI could show you\u2014if you would let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can share memories,\u201d he said, his voice trickling with hope. \u201cIt\u2019s...it won\u2019t be very clear, since I haven\u2019t mastered this technique yet, but it will save me the lengthy monologue.\u201d His lip quirked on one side.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I grabbed his hand, rolling my cheek against it. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d He shuffled closer and rested his other hand on my cheek. \u201cTry not to fight it when you see memories that don\u2019t belong to you. Just watch\u2014like a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>A faint image, like a photo taken on a sunny day then placed in a dark room at a perpendicular angle, appeared on the backs of my eyelids. I drew a deep breath and watched the slanted image, kind of squinting a little, even with my eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m not too good at this.\u201d David\u2019s breath brushed softly against my ear. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Is it supposed to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said and settled back internally to watch the movie.</p><p>The evening sky hugged the ground in the distance, red bleeding into night, and as far as the eye could see, the undisturbed horizon ran off into hills, tan roads snaking inward and disappearing among them. The last dregs of light turned the grass orange where it lined the dirt road under a boy\u2019s feet. He whistled and waved to his neighbours as he passed, but in his green eyes, the depths of his worries flared. He walked with an edge to his step, half hurrying, half skipping, as if to pretend he felt no concern. But when he looked up to a house at the end of the street, the open front door seemed to stop his heart.</p><p>Silence seized the sound of children laughing, dogs barking, and his own quiet thoughts. I couldn\u2019t understand why, but I could sense something was off. So could the boy.</p><p>Two breaths passed before the thump of his knapsack hitting the ground brought all life, all sound, back.</p><p>The movie played in slow motion, making the distance between the picket gate and the porch steps seem like a hundred yards as he ran, his heels kicking up clouds of dust behind him. But everything stopped, the colour draining from the day, shadowing out the warmth as no one greeted the boy\u2019s call. He stood in the frame of the door, his eyes tracing the raw pine staircase, the archway to the left, and finally falling over a table knocked to its side; shattered blue pottery lay among twelve rose stems, the red petals crumpled and torn, smudged into the hardwood floors all around his feet.</p><p>\u201cArietta?\u201d he called again, expecting to hear her reply. He held his breath, this boy with gold-brown hair and fair skin, and bravely entered, though he could feel the grip of tragedy climbing the walls. He toed the edge of the table, shifting it away, seeing four curled fingers, tipped red with blood, the rest of the arm slightly hidden by the gate of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAunty?\u201d He ran to her side, falling to his knees at the sight of her fragile, slender body, twisted awkwardly, as if she had fallen from something impossibly high and landed without bones in her body. Stringy tendrils mocked what was once hair of gold, and as the boy reached forward and stroked it from her cheek, he turned her face toward him and let out a shallow, empty cry, falling back on his heels.</p><p>A face unrecognisably human stared back at him; eyes swollen shut, a deep void where the other half of her skull should be\u2014her lip torn up to her nose, several teeth missing.</p><p>My heart, which had been steady the whole time, suddenly beat faster.</p><p>The boy got to his knees again and, swiping tears from his youthful cheeks, lifted the bodice of her dress and fell heavily upon her blackened belly. He felt helplessly around the dome of skin, searching for the feel of life within, and while his body shook from the fear of truth, he turned his head to read something inscribed on the wall beside him. The memory blanked out the words, leaving only the feeling that followed, and I knew they were a passage from the Bible, condemning infidelity.</p><p>David covered the belly of his aunt and sat up suddenly, his ears pricked, his shoulders tense, eyes wide. Then, he launched to his feet and extended his hand toward the door. \u201cJason. Don\u2019t come in!\u201d</p><p>A boy, an exact copy of David, stopped dead in the doorway\u2014his boisterous smile slipping away at the sight of his blood-covered brother.</p><p>\u201cGet Uncle, Jason. Get Uncle!\u201d David yelled his command, but Jason was already gone. Swift and graceful, he tore down the street, his lanky limbs blurring with speed until he disappeared from David\u2019s sight.</p><p>David turned back to his aunt and fell to his knees, weeping. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Aunty. I should...I should have been here\u2014\u201d His body submitted to grief, but stopped suddenly as the deathly figure beneath him groaned. \u201cAunty!\u201d He held his breath. \u201cAunty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa-v-id\u2014\u201d She moved her hand to reach for him, her soft gaze suddenly slipping past him to a white look of terror. Like a tidal wave preparing itself for slaughter, the silence drew in around them, then cracked apart, like a shattering vile of terror; the woman clutched her belly and rolled upward, screeching for all the pain Hell had summoned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAunty? What can I do?\u201d The boy\u2019s voice trembled with helplessness. \u201cTell me what to do, and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave him! Save my baby!\u201d She rolled away, covering her stomach in a tight, protective embrace.</p><p>The memory faded out to white dots around the edges of the film, and the birds in the tree above us sang a melody I had no mind for a moment ago, but was completely aware of.</p> <p>I lifted my eyelids, blinking against the grey day, and turned my head to look at David\u2014the grown up David. \u201cYou found her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI delivered her baby.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cBut you were just a child. How did you do that?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed a hard lump. \u201cI was simply there to hold her as she was born. I did little else, and there was nothing I could do to help my aunt.\u201d His fists clenched. \u201cNo one came to the sound of her screaming. No one called for a doctor. She was a woman scorned for her sins, and they let her die like a dog.\u201d His lip stiffened and anger flooded his voice, a kind of anger I\u2019d never, ever seen in him. \u201cI wrapped the child in my jacket and laid in my aunt\u2019s arms until nightfall.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I heard footsteps on the porch outside, I was numb\u2014completely numb. I simply stood, held the baby out to my uncle as he burst through the door, and told him, \u201cI lost her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cArthur took the child from my arms and, though I knew nothing of the world, I saw a piece of his soul die then; he closed her eyelids and covered her face delicately with my jacket.</p><p>\u201cI will never truly understand what my uncle lost that night and, at the time, I thought nothing of the fact that he fell to the floor beside Arietta, with his child crushed against his chest, and laid there until the dawn. Only now do I see it for the madness it stirred within him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he ever recover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan someone recover from that?\u201d David asked rhetorically. \u201cHe went on with normal life, like any wise vampire on the World Council would, but he never spoke of her. Even now, the mention of children sends his eyes soulless.\u201d David reached over and wiped a warm tear from my cheek, then smiled softly. \u201cThe police came; they took Victor and charged him with aggravated assault. He was jailed for a month, then released with a warning, since the evidence was inconclusive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? He killed her and he got a month?\u201d I almost rocketed forward in protest.</p><p>David nodded and clapped his hands together, letting his elbows fall loosely over his knees. \u201cAnd life went on. Uncle Arthur left town for a while, promising to return when he had made arrangements for Jason and I.\u201d He brushed his palm across the headstone behind him and nodded toward it. \u201cWe buried her on a warm spring day, with her baby in her arms, where she will lay evermore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDavid, that\u2019s so sad,\u201d I whispered, feeling the rise of little bumps over my cold skin.</p><p>\u201cHers has been a loss I have never moved past.\u201d He inclined his head to his position on her grave. \u201cAnd this is where I\u2019ll sit one day, feeling the grief for another\u2014with no hope of ever holding her again. Only...the name will read a different story; it will be one of true love, lost tragically to eternal sadness.\u201d He looked down at the ground. \u201cFor me, Ara, your death will be only but a breath away; a second in time and you will be gone. You have your whole life ahead of you, but for a vampire...it\u2019s nothing but a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, David. I wish with all of my heart it were different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But you will never feel the pain of it as I will.\u201d He sniffed once, nodded, then looked at me. \u201cWhen you die, I will never see you again. Can you comprehend what that feels like for me?\u201d</p><p>His words were almost enough to make me change my mind in that breath\u2014to save him from this horrible reality. It all just seemed so hopeless.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He stood in front of me, his hand outstretched. \u201cI heard the ogre complaining about ten minutes ago. Let\u2019s get some food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Gravity bequeathed me with excess weight as I rose to my feet and followed David, stealing a glance back to the hill where Arietta would stay. Once, she had been promised immortality and now, she was in the ground\u2014never to know her child\u2019s name. I could see myself sitting up there beside her; my feet led me away, but my heart remained where, one day, my body would return to meet it. And that idea scared me to the point of shaking\u2014the idea of death. It never used to, but seeing those graves painted the truth on a canvas of reality\u2014textured in rough strokes of dark grey, blue, and black.</p><p>It was real. Death was real, and it was coming for me\u2014a little closer every day.</p> <p>But it was normal\u2014the way things were supposed to be.</p><p>Sitting by those graves made me see how deep David\u2019s pain would go. He would lose me one day, and I wasn\u2019t sure I could live with the fact that he\u2019d mourn me forever. It felt wrong, like I was being selfish. But I couldn\u2019t lose the hope of seeing Mum and Harry again, or just switch off the desire to have a child, and I wouldn\u2019t give away the magic of life for an eternity of blood\u2014even if that same fate meant saving David from eternal agony.</p><p>Emily cursed, fumbling with the tray, nearly dropping the whole thing as she placed it on the counter in front of our designated lane at the bowl. She straightened the cups, then held up the list of orders. \u201cOkay, fries and shake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d I put my hand up.</p><p>\u201cBurger with egg?\u201d</p><p>Spence put his hand up.</p><p>Like a game of popping weasels, hands shot up, claiming various orders down the line of teens. David took his nachos and smiled at Emily, but the smile faded quickly to the seclusion of thoughts distracting him like a theatre show in his head.</p><p>Ryan and Alana slid into the seats next to me and pointed out some of the other kids from school, already playing on lanes further down the alley. It seemed this was the thing to do in this town on a Sunday night; in fact, I was pretty sure the student body of Evergreen High made up most of the customers here tonight.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s one way to eat fries.\u201d David grimaced at my French fry, dripping in chocolate shake over my cup.</p><p>I shoved the chip into my mouth and muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s yummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t knock it \u2018til you try it,\u201d Ryan interjected, grabbing one of my fries and helping himself to a dip in my shake.</p><p>David smiled inquisitively, reaching over to help himself as well.</p><p>\u201cWell, what d\u2019ya think?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He frowned at first, then his face lit up. \u201cIt\u2019s good\u2014salt and sugar.\u201d He nodded, then looked away quickly.</p><p>\u201cDavid, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer, keeping his eyes forward. \u201cI feel like I just want to force you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, slowly turning back to the front.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He looked down at his plate. \u201cIt\u2019s just...being at my aunt\u2019s grave today really put things into perspective for me; I don\u2019t want to miss you like that, Ara.\u201d</p><p>Warm blood flooded my heart, a wave of sympathy almost forcing me to splutter out the words, Let\u2019s go now. Take me to the bathroom and turn me\u2014but I stopped myself. \u201cDavid. I\u2019m sorry, but look, I\u2019ll see you for the last dance at the ball, and who knows what I might decide in that time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come with me if he loves you, Ara.\u201d David sat up straight. \u201cMike can give you a life\u2014he\u2019s better for you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t love me. So it won\u2019t be an issue.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d David pushed his nachos away and walked over to our lane, slipping into the human role as I sat back, watching him. He blended himself among Em, Spence, Ryan, and Alana rather well, laughing and talking, but his soul was dark beyond those eyes, and no one but me seemed to notice. Even Emily, who paid attention to pretty much everything he did, was blinded by the foggy spectacles of her new romance.</p><p>David looked at me then and jerked his head quickly, reaching out as he did.</p><p>I let my lip pout for a second.</p><p>I\u2019m okay, he mouthed, a smile proving it.</p><p>So I hopped down off the stool, strolled over, and took his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou know, bowling shoes make your feet look big,\u201d he said, looking down at them.</p><p>My toes curled. \u201cArrogant comments make your mouth look big. Besides\u2014\u201d I nodded down at his shoes, \u201c\u2014you look like you just stepped out of a circus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think bowling shoes are a good look.\u201d Emily popped up beside us and tapped her toe in the circle of our conversation. We looked down at her feet, and my blood boiled. How could her feet look perfectly dainty in those shoes? She wore the same size as me!</p><p>\u201cDave, man. Your turn,\u201d Ryan called.</p><p>David dropped my hand and walked away, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Emily shrugged at me.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d I said affectionately and headed over to the lane.</p><p>She laughed behind me.</p><p>Bowling had never been my forte, and even though David rolled a perfect strike every time, with the exception of one, because I shot him an inappropriate thought which put him off his game, we still lost. Ryan and Alana took home the win; a giant, stuffed bowling pin\u2014purchased by all the losers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you guys at school.\u201d Emily waved as we headed out the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stay out too late, kids,\u201d Ryan joked from behind the stupid, stuffed pin.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be at school tomorrow, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Emily stopped walking beside Spencer.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go away,\u201d David jumped in. \u201cMy uncle is taking me on holiday, so tomorrow is my last day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no\u2014Ara\u2019s going to be so lost,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>My cheeks went hot; David grinned when I turned my face away. \u201cWell, I hope so,\u201d he beamed, \u201cthen I can be sure she won\u2019t give her heart away to someone else while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance of that, David. I think you might be stuck with this one.\u201d Emily winked at me.</p><p>Cool, strong arms wrapped my waist and pulled me close to a firm, tight chest. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the concert and the ball?\u201d Alana stepped around the giant toy and her wide, jet-black eyes reflected the neon lights behind me.</p><p>\u201cI can come back for the concert, but as for the ball\u2014well, I may make the last dance.\u201d He snuggled his cheek against mine.</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck, David. I hope you make it home safe,\u201d Emily said, her tone holding way too much gravity.</p><p>David tightened his grip around me.</p><p>\u201cO...kay. See ya, guys.\u201d I waved again and dragged David toward the car.</p><p>He opened the door and grabbed my wrist as I bent to climb in. \u201cWhat is it, Ara? What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot clearly. You had about four different thoughts at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um...well, I was wondering why you didn\u2019t tell them you\u2019re never coming back.\u201d</p><p>David smiled. \u201cWe never do that. That\u2019s why telling you about leaving in the first place was such a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? So you just disappear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Mostly. We send letters to people in positions of authority, like schools or employers, once we\u2019re safely away, but if there had been any suspicions surrounding our stay, announcing plans to leave could create unrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I traced the rubber seal along the base of the window. \u201cBut, there\u2019s no suspicion this time, so why not just tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing that. People mostly keep their suspicions to themselves, and besides\u2014\u201d he pulled my finger away as I peeled the rubber back, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s the way we do things. We\u2019re consistent in our behaviours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you told me you were leaving.\u201d I smiled sheepishly, forcing down a rising yawn.</p><p>\u201cWhich is rare, mon amour, like I said. Now, come on\u2014\u201d he offered the seat in the car, \u201c\u2014let\u2019s get you home before you fall asleep where you stand.\u201d</p><p>I sat down and the door closed behind me, giving my head support as I drifted away, feeling my seatbelt clip around me a second later, followed by a cool kiss on my hand, then nothing more until the quiet thud of door woke my mind a little.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d David whispered into my brow, lifting me from the car.</p><p>Quietly conscious of his embrace, I rolled my head into the hollow of his shoulder and fixated on the gentle, soapy smell of his shirt, seeping into my nose with each restful breath.</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s exhausted,\u201d Dad\u2019s voice hummed as a pale ring of light broke the darkness under my eyelids.</p><p>\u201cShall I carry her upstairs?\u201d David asked, holding me a little closer.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, sure. No need to disturb her further.\u201d</p><p>The front door closed behind us. I stayed in the blissful elation of dream world, in David\u2019s arms, until the cold touch of my pillow fell along my cheek and I sunk into the softness of my mattress. My shoes came off and a still silence filled the room; it sounded like no one was there, but I could feel David\u2019s presence. \u201cGoodnight, my love.\u201d He pressed a cold kiss to my brow.</p><p>I lifted my mind out of sleep just long enough to whisper, \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI planned to,\u201d he whispered, and the bedroom door closed, leaving me in darkness.</p><p>Outside, the sound of Dad\u2019s voice farewelled David as his car pulled away from our house. And the only other sound, after Dad\u2019s footsteps trailed away behind his bedroom door, was the quiet, rhythmic tick of the clock on the wall by the front door, timing my dreams while I slipped away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just before the grasp of sleep possessed me, two cool, strong arms fell around my shoulders, and I let myself wander into the peaceful harmony of the night, against David\u2019s chest.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>The sweet, chocolaty smell of David stirred my senses through the night, waking me with surprise when I looked up and saw the golden morning sun on his cheek. \u201cYou stayed!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He stretched his arms out above us. \u201cYou asked me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t mattered in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d he said, his arm landing back down around my shoulders. \u201cIn the past, I didn\u2019t only have two days left with you.\u201d</p><p>That put a dampener on the day.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d He rolled me onto my back, his long body against the length of mine. \u201cJust don\u2019t think about it. In fact\u2014\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but smile, his eyes drifting to a thought. \u201cWhy not go back to thinking about that dream you were just having?\u201d</p><p>My mouth popped open. \u201cYou saw that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy love\u2014\u201d He kissed my nose, \u201cI saw everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod damn mind readers!\u201d With a feisty huff, I threw the covers back and headed for the shower\u2014and maybe a few minutes of unheard thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYour thought patterns are not mollified by short distances, Ara. I can still hear you,\u201d he called out as I shut the bathroom door.</p> <p>\u201cArgh! Stop it.\u201d I covered my ears, as if that would help, but I couldn\u2019t stop seeing those images; David and I\u2014naked, tucked in a loving embrace. And the worst part was, all of it was my own imagination forming dreams out of desires. It was like writing a porn entry in a diary and having someone read it out loud. It was just too personal to share.</p><p>I took off the jeans and green sweater I slept in last night and stuffed them in the laundry basket, burying my undies and bra in case David needed to use the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already seen your underwear, my darling girl,\u201d he called out. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide them now.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders dropped with a vocalised breath. At least there was one good thing about having a mind-reading vampire boyfriend\u2014I\u2019d had plenty of practice at emptying my thoughts and focusing on nothing. I was sure, in some odd way, that could be a good skill to have.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of skills,\u201d David said from just outside the bathroom door, \u201cwe need to rehearse for the benefit concert. I\u2019m not even sure which song we\u2019re supposed to be playing now.\u201d</p><p>I reached into the shower and twisted the faucet on, then stood back and waited for the water to get hot. \u201cUm, we\u2019re doing that one from that movie\u2014the one Nathan liked.\u201d</p><p>David chuckled softly. \u201cHe liked a lot of movies, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know which one I mean,\u201d I said, getting frustrated. \u201cI can never remember the title.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you still doing a solo performance?\u201d His voice echoed slightly too loud through the door, making me cringe a little in case Dad should hear.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we\u2019re also doing Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d</p><p>David didn\u2019t respond. I waited, looking over my thin body in the reflection of the shower glass for a second, but when the silence lasted, I stepped into the welcoming steam whorls and ran my hands over the water falling through my hair. The running water and locked doors offered me a kind of privacy I wasn\u2019t used to anymore\u2014one where I could imagine my thoughts were unheard...just like my shower singing.</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d I jumped out of my skin at the sudden thud on the door. \u201cSave some water for future generations, please.\u201d</p><p>Geeze. \u201cYes, Dad\u2014just rinsing my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take your mother that long.\u201d</p><p>By mother, he meant Vicki. \u201cShe has short hair, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He groaned aloud.</p><p>\u201cHmph. You\u2019d do a lot more than just groan if you knew I had my boyfriend in my room right now,\u201d I said under my breath. Thing was, Dad would freak if there was a boy in my room, but I bet he\u2019d take it really well if I told him David was a vampire. I think he\u2019d see it as a rare opportunity to hear tales of History firsthand.</p><p>I sighed heavily, feeling the full weight of everything I learned about David and his history yesterday. I pictured him there still, by the grave, but when he folded over and buried his face in his hands to hide his tears, it was my name carved in stone behind him. And one day, that scary thought would be a reality.</p><p>Slowly, my hand rose up through the swirling steam cloud and rested against the foggy glass. Droplets of water melted around the base of my palm, and as I exhaled a breath of sorrow, the delicate touch of David\u2019s long fingers appeared on the other side of the cold barrier. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Ara,\u201d he said in a deep, soothing whisper. \u201cPlease, please just don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I not cry?\u201d We rested our heads against the glass. \u201cI don't want you to hurt that way, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He shut his eyes tight.</p><p>I could feel a kind of magic between us that I was sure I\u2019d never find anywhere else in the world; it was like, even though our flesh wasn\u2019t touching, I could feel him against me\u2014feel him from somewhere deep within. And when he wasn't around, I felt a kind of emptiness that seemed unnatural. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough to miss you for the rest of my life,\u201d I whispered, watching the hot, steamy water run wasted down the drain below my feet.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d He exhaled, and as quickly as he\u2019d appeared, he was gone again, leaving my hand against the glass, alone.</p><p>The phone rang while I struggled, in the privacy of my wardrobe, trying to pull my light blue cotton dress over my head; it rolled up, catching on my not-quite-dry skin, and stuck halfway down my waist. I tugged harder, a rise of frustration nearly turning to tears. I didn\u2019t want to miss that call if it was Mike ringing before he got on the plane. What if it crashed and I never got to hear his voice again? What if it\u2014</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d David\u2019s melodious voice filled the room.</p><p>I froze, listening.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s getting dressed.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, don\u2019t tell him that! He\u2019ll freak out, thinking you\u2019re watching me, or something. I pulled my dress down and tripped all over myself to get out of the wardrobe. \u201cI\u2019m here. Gimme the phone.\u201d</p><p>David grinned, holding his index finger up. \u201cNo, no, nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d I huffed impatiently, offering a flat palm.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s all she\u2019s talked about for the last couple of weeks,\u201d he said, then laughed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. That\u2019s enough.\u201d I snatched the phone from him and, assuming I knew who he was talking to, said, \u201cHi, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl. How\u2019s things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. You at the airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just thought I\u2019d make sure you hadn\u2019t forgotten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve talked about, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I poked my tongue out at David.</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been looking forward to it, too. And I expect the biggest hug you\u2019ve got tucked into those skinny little arms tomorrow, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, I\u2019ve been practicing my squeezing,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWith David?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, but you get a different kind of squeezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine then, I know where I stand.\u201d I could hear the amusement behind his feigned insult.</p><p>\u201cStill in exactly the same place as always,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, have fun today, and...I\u2019ll see ya tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, bye.\u201d I had to dig my heels into the carpet to stop from bouncing around like a little girl. And as the phone disconnected, severing the lines of communication to my best friend, an empty feeling swallowed my soul for a second until I looked at David. But he looked troubled\u2014leaning back in my chair, drumming his fingers on the desk, his thoughts a million miles away. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me\u2014snapping out of his stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d A very cheeky grin lit his eyes. \u201cHe did not approve of my being here while you were getting dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s overprotective. I know the sort, Ara, he will ask questions about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you read his thoughts over the phone?\u201d I said as I walked over and leaned my butt on the desk.</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cNo. I can only read certain electrical wavelengths\u2014which don\u2019t communicate over the phone. But I\u2019ve been around humans and been subject to their thought-patterns long enough to make conclusions from very little detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike one of those cool detectives on those crime shows?\u201d</p><p>David laughed, resting his chin on his hand. \u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think you\u2019ve summed Mike up, huh?\u201d</p><p>He scratched the corner of his brow, taking a deep breath. \u201cAll I know is it\u2019s a good thing I won\u2019t be here during the day. I can\u2019t be around you if he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be tempted to kill him,\u201d he muttered with a certain amount of animosity; my mouth fell open a little. \u201cHe thinks he has some claim to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d My cheek tightened on one side with a half-smile. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re cute when you\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, be serious.\u201d David leaned forward, elbows over his knees, looking at the floor between his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe I should leave now. It\u2019s just too risky. If he gets wind there\u2019s a guy in your room every night, you know what he\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d I sat on the desk, letting my bare feet dangle. \u201cYou might think he\u2019s got some weird Spidey sense that can track the scent of another male like a mother to cigarettes on her son\u2019s breath, but I\u2019m not sure I really care if he finds out I have a guy in my room at night\u2014not right now I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me. \u201cAra, if he finds me in your room and we\u2019re forced to meet in person, it will only be a matter of time before he starts asking all the wrong questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll give all the wrong answers. I won\u2019t tell him the truth about what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the questions he asks you that I worry about\u2014it\u2019s the ones he asks himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, will it be that bad if he figures out what you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean aside from the fact that he\u2019d steal you away from me, take you across the country, lock you in a closet, then fly back here and start a pitchfork rally against me?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, rubbing my hand over my neck where droplets of cold water dripped down from my hair. \u201cYou know, the chances are he\u2019ll figure something\u2019s not right, anyway. I mean, especially when I refuse to laze around and watch movies with him at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But\u2014\u201d He reached up and wiped an escaped droplet from my chest. \u201cWell, I suppose it\u2019s only for two weeks, right? Maybe we\u2019ll be lucky to fly under the radar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my being away during the day will be good practice for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice? You mean for being without you for forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to justify it, David.\u201d I hopped down off the desk and leaned on my dresser\u2014away from him. \u201cYou working for two weeks before you leave has no bright side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything has a bright side.\u201d</p><p>I raised a brow at him, then looked away, scoffing internally.</p><p>\u201cYou will be happy again, one day.\u201d David\u2019s voice softened as he whispered in my ear, suddenly beside me. I spun into his arms and let my head fall against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI wish you could stay for just a few more years.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened ever so slightly around my shoulders. \u201cI do too, my love, but even if I could stay with you, why would I? So I can watch you fall in love with someone else, or see you miss your chance?\u201d I looked up to see his jaw stiffen and his eyes narrow. \u201cI don\u2019t know which is worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still won\u2019t promise you goodbye, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will\u2014\u201d he nodded, \u201c\u2014because you can\u2019t promise me eternity. And one day, I know there\u2019ll be some boy who\u2019ll come along and sweep you off your feet, just as I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will not let you lose your chance at love, at life, Ara.\u201d His voice rose an octave. \u201cWhen you feel it\u2014that pull toward love, I want you to take it. I want you to go with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll never truly love another\u2014not the way I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it will be enough,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can have your life; you can watch your babies grow, become an old lady and\u2014\u201d he smiled, \u201c\u2014get arthritis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow that all seems kinda silly now.\u201d I rolled my eyes at myself.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not silly, my love. It\u2019s not silly at all.\u201d His eyes softened, his thumb gently waking the hairs on my face, calling them to stand on pleasant ends. \u201cOur love is a gift, Ara. It\u2019s more intense and inexplicable than any love I\u2019ve ever known, and it will always be a part of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust not a physical part,\u201d I said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cLove is stronger than the physical being. I don\u2019t need to feel your lips, your touch, or to hear your words to know you will always love me. And you know that, too, deep inside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll feel another\u2019s.

I am a mourner without tears, a wild stallion locked in a stable\u2014powerless to change my position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, David.\u201d I looked down.</p> <p>\u201cI know you are, Ara.\u201d He hooked his finger under my chin and rolled my face upward. \u201cBut you should not have to apologise for the desires of your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heart should learn to shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. I love you the way you are. Never change that.\u201d He touched my chest.</p><p>\u201cDo you...\u201d I looked up into his green, loving eyes. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll ever stop missing each other, or that maybe, one day, you\u2019ll be able to forget me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget you?\u201d His tone dropped all comprehension. \u201cDo you not understand? My love, I won\u2019t just miss you. I will exist as if I were a rose without the grace of rain. There will be no peace for me\u2014ever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why?\u201d I pushed away from him and took a step back. \u201cWhy did Fate bring us together? Why did we find each other only to be forced apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found each other, my love, but maybe Fate had nothing to do with it. What if we just weren\u2019t meant to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we were a mistake\u2014a cosmic glitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but, if so, you are the one mistake I will never regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be somebody\u2019s mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCosmic glitch then,\u201d he said kindly, and I smiled. But, sadly, I knew exactly what he meant, because I felt the same way. Neither of us would recover from this, but it\u2019d been worth all the pain. I knew a love more perfect and more devastating than any other feeling I\u2019d ever had in my life, and I owed that to this man, who had very unfortunate timing.</p> <p>Our eyes met in a standstill of anguish and indecision. Neither of us could find the words to make everything okay\u2014it would never be okay.</p><p>The school bell ringing in the distance broke the silence in my room. It seemed so stupid to me then; school, life, everything in the wake of the thought that I\u2019d lose David forever. Going to school, living life like normal was an empty, silly idea.</p><p>\u201cYou better call the school and tell them you\u2019re sick today,\u201d David said, standing across the room, his shoulder against the window frame. \u201cRoll call will start soon. They\u2019ll alert your dad if you\u2019re not there.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even see him move. I wanted to walk over and touch my fingertips to his spine where the morning light shadowed and highlighted the contours, but I wasn\u2019t sure why he walked away\u2014or if he wanted me to touch him. I stayed motionless, watching David\u2019s thoughts fall away from the hold of his gaze and onto the world below my room, while my thoughts consumed the empty space around us. I didn\u2019t care that he could hear them, and I didn\u2019t care that if Vicki came home early from shopping she\u2019d find David and I ditching school. Nothing mattered to me in the same way it used to. It all just seemed inconsequential with the idea that these were the last touches of light I would ever see on his skin. I would never know the summer sun glistening behind his emerald eyes again, never see it kiss his hair with tones of gold, and never again feel it warm his fingers while he played my guitar, sitting in front of me in a world of childhood dreams, as innocent as a sweet smile.</p><p>All we had was one last day, where we would watch the sun set before our eyes, and bring with it the darkness of eternal nights. There would be no way to prevent it; it would come, and even the nights would disappear in a countdown around us until he was gone.</p><p>But I would forever be David\u2019s girl. I knew I\u2019d look for him in the face of every man I passed for the rest of my life, and though my physical existence on Earth would end one day, I knew in my heart that I would love him, too\u2014for eternity.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He turned suddenly and smiled, offering his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste this day on solemn thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do then?\u201d I took his hand.</p> <p>\u201cI wanna teach you a song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat song?\u201d I asked, grabbing the guitar when he pointed to it.</p><p>\u201cOne I wrote.\u201d</p><p>I stopped for a second and watched him sink down on my bed. \u201cYou write songs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse I do.\u201d He patted the space of mattress between his legs. \u201cSit here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO...kay.\u201d I sat with my back against his chest, and David took the guitar, positioning it across my lap in front of us. \u201cWhat\u2019s the song called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Knight of the Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d I asked, letting David take my fingers and place them on the strings.</p><p>He paused. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout leaving me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not a goodbye song; it\u2019s a love song...\u201d his tone softened away to near silence. \u201cIt was just written with the tears of farewell.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, that made it hurt more.</p><p>David smiled against the side of my face, then took my hand again. \u201cAfter the first chord, place your fingers here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that chord? I\u2019ve never seen it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I invented it.\u201d He kind of laughed, then strummed it once.</p><p>My eyes went wider. \u201cWow. That\u2019s really...intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He arranged my fingers on different strings and pressed them down firmly, as if to ask if I had it. I nodded. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll whisper the chords as we go along. I want you to know this song by heart, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He moved my fingers back to the A Minor\u2014the first chord. \u201cSo you can play it when you miss me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to think about that right now. \u201cWho says I\u2019m going to miss you?\u201d I said playfully instead.</p><p>\u201cMy love\u2014\u201d he pulled me closer, reaching his right hand around to the guitar, \u201c\u2014if you never, not for even one second, miss me once I\u2019m gone, then I will be happy eternally. But we both know that won\u2019t be the case,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sure of yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u201cOnly with good reason.\u201d He pecked my cheek, drawing a smile to my lips, and gave the song life in the same breath, his fingers dancing in an elaborate pattern over the strings. We changed chords then, and the flow of my favourite notes, nearly each and every one I ever loved, filled every corner of the darkness in my heart. I could\u2019ve sworn the room even illuminated with bright, white light. It was as if he\u2019d written down every song that ever made me feel something, and combined them, crafting the notes with an ethereal life-force.</p><p>He whispered the next chord in my ear, moving his fingers with mine.</p><p>I wanted to separate myself from this world, try not to feel all the pain, the loss, the dying hope of the future climbing to the surface, making me want to cry. I just couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d be gone soon. Two weeks. Just two weeks, and I would never, ever see him again; never feel his breath on my skin again, never look into those emerald eyes, never kiss his soft, dark-pink lips.</p><p>He said it wasn\u2019t a goodbye song, but it had all the sadness of parting in the flow of its notes. How could I not cry; how could I not fall to my knees right now and beg the universe for one chance? Just one little piece of hope that there\u2019d be a happy ending for us. I\u2019d give anything. Anything for that.</p><p>The song floated softly to a haunting end, leaving the room silent for a heartbeat. I tried to take a breath but it came out of my lungs instead of going in, making the grief shriek from my lips.</p><p>I covered my face as David pried the guitar from my tight grip and placed it on the ground, pulling me against him on my pillows. \u201cShh. It\u2019s all okay, my love. Everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t believe that. He couldn\u2019t even convince himself.</p><p>He stroked my hair back, tucking me up like he\u2019d never let go. \u201cI\u2019ll never stop loving you, Ara. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, hiccups quietening to soft sobs. \u201cAnd you know I will too, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded against the top of my head, kissing my hair after, and the last of my strength dissolved. I closed my eyes and drifted away in his arms, allowing myself to dream, for a moment, that things were different\u2014that David and I could be together for the rest of my life.</p><p>Our future danced around in my head like a short film\u2014a black and white. I walked toward that boy at the end of the aisle, whose green eyes reflected the awe in his heart as they fell over my white dress, his joy dissolving my nerves, making the people in the pews disappear. It was just he and I, alone, on the edge of fulfilling one of our hearts\u2019 greatest desires.</p><p>As I finally came to stand beside him, he took my hand and smiled down at my bouquet; a soft, simple piece of completely white roses, with one immaculately blossomed red one set centre.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that one for?\u201d David\u2019s soft, warm breath brushed the top of my head, waking my mind a little.</p><p>\u201cThe part of my heart that will never belong to anyone else; the part of me that will always be only yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow appropriate,\u201d he said, and shifted under me as he reached into his pocket. \u201cI have something\u2014a gift for you\u2014which comes bearing the exact same sentiment.\u201d</p><p>I looked up to the golden light of the morning sun on my walls, my eyes drifting from David\u2019s lips, down the curve of his arm around my waist, to his closed fist. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He unfolded his fingers, revealing a pool of delicate silver chain, slightly covering a heart-shaped locket. \u201cSo you may never forget that you\u2014\u201d he pointed to the engraved rose, \u201c\u2014are in my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I turned the locket over and ran my finger over the fine inscription on the back; though I wasn\u2019t sure, it looked like it was written in French. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTu m\u2019appartiens.\u201d He kissed my cheek and smoothed my hair back, leaving a cool tingle behind where he linked the chain around my neck.</p><p>As it fell onto my chest, just below my collarbones, my hand rose up instantly to hold it tight. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He slowly pressed his lips to my ear. \u201cYou belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor as long as I live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, mon amour. For all time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d I said, sitting back against him, and he wrapped his arms across my waist, holding me that way until the sun went down, stealing away the last day of our forever.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Orange shadows stretched across the highway in the early morning sun, and my thoughts, distant and reflective, seemed lost far beyond the car window too. I leaned my weary head on the glass, trying to hold on to that last moment before everything changed.</p><p>Today, for the first time, I woke to the sting of normality; coffee, with its unusual ability to make everything seem okay; toast on the table when I came down, feeling the early morning chill on my bare arms, and quiet conversation with Dad\u2014trying not to wake the rest of the house.</p><p>Even though Mike was arriving today, excitement was not the first feeling I had as my alarm startled me from peaceful slumber; it was devastation, weighed down with a tight ache in my throat called sorrow. It was kinda fitting really, that the last time I saw Mike, I was in exactly the same state of mind as I was now\u2014miserable. I really thought Mike\u2019s coming to stay would ease the pain of losing David. But I was wrong.</p><p>Dad moved his gaze from the road and smiled at me; I knitted some semblance of a grin across my face, but the world couldn\u2019t make me smile for real, and in two weeks, when David left forever, I\u2019d never smile again. Unless I became a vampire.</p><p>Thing was, with the days of losing him coming closer and closer, the idea of killing for love seemed less horrific. Not enough that I was ready to tell him that\u2014or think it around him. I just...I just needed guidance\u2014a sign.</p><p>The music in the car became louder when one of Dad\u2019s favourite songs came on, and as we turned onto the long stretch of highway toward the airport, a black billboard with a white circle of light caught my attention. I spun in my seat and read the words as we whizzed past: Let Fate Decide.</p><p>Let Fate decide?</p><p>Dad turned the radio off then, leaving me feeling exposed in the silence as an idea took shape. I sat back in my chair, smiling. Maybe if I couldn\u2019t decide what to do, I could ask a higher power to grant me an epiphany\u2014or at least an answer. Mike loved me, but he, in no way, loved me like I loved him. It would take some miracle for his heart to change, just like the kind of miracle it would take to convince me to go with David and be a murderer. So maybe that was it; maybe that was my answer. If Mike magically confessed his undying love for me, I\u2019d stay human, live my life, have babies, and one day die. But, if I was right, if he really only loved me as a friend, then it\u2019d be a sign that I should throw away childish beliefs about meeting ghosts of the past in the hereafter, let go the hope of one day being a mother, discard all my moralistic beliefs, and go with David\u2014become a vampire.</p><p>It was perfect; like rolling the dice and saying \u2018seven\u2019.</p><p>Dad looked sideways at me and changed gears as we slowed, coming into the airport. \u201cYou excited?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cKinda nervous, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Part of me wanted to tell Dad about the \u2018Tragic Rejection Moment\u2019 between Mike and I, but the sensible part said, \u201cIt\u2019s just been a while, is all. I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ll be friends like we used to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoney.\u201d Dad pulled over in the pick-up zone and placed his hand on mine. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine. You may have been apart for a while, but Mike\u2019s been there the whole time. I\u2019ve been talking to him every couple of days\u2014giving him updates on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d I groaned. \u201cReally? I mean, I knew you were talking, but\u2014updates? Come on\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dad shrugged. \u201cHe asked. I told.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you thought telling me that would make things better.\u201d I folded my arms and looked out the window.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you to feel like he abandoned you by not pushing you to talk to him. He\u2019s just been giving you some space.\u201d</p><p>I unfolded my arms and looked beyond the glass entrance of the terminal to the people flooding the airport, gathering around the baggage collection for flight 728. Mike\u2019s flight. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d I unlatched my seatbelt, ignoring the intoxicating surge of adrenaline seeping into my arms and chest, making my heart pick up about ten paces. I wished I could see him\u2014just make him out among the crowd so I could sneak up on him\u2014see how different he looked before he saw me.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d Dad grinned, watching me edge in my seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d I beamed as I sprung from the car.</p> <p>People gathered their bags from the conveyer belt and hugged their families. I pushed against the tightly packed bodies, using my elbows to almost swim through the crowd, my gaze shifting side to side.</p><p>\u201cYou lost, sweetie?\u201d a man asked when I studied his face carefully under his sandy-blonde hair.</p><p>I shook my head and hurried past him, stopping dead when I saw a guy on his phone by the Coke machine; sandy-coloured hair, broad shoulders. I squinted, jutting my neck forward as I took baby steps in his direction\u2014seeing only flashes as the crowd of people stole my view several times.</p><p>Then, certainty flooded through me when he threw his bag over his shoulder and flipped his phone in the air before stuffing it in his back pocket.</p><p>That was him!</p><p>I stopped walking; he was so much taller than I remembered, and bigger, too. His blue shirt fit tightly around the softballs in his arms, but there was still that something in the way he held himself\u2014a sort of tall stance with a kind of confidence that came from being an officer of authority. He looked good. Good enough that I felt my cheeks flush as the perfect word to describe him entered my head...sexy.</p> <p>\u201cAra?\u201d He spun around suddenly, eyes lighting up.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move. I\u2019d imagined this moment so many times in my mind; how I\u2019d run into his arms and he\u2019d lift me off the ground and kiss me\u2014like he loved me.</p><p>However, that was always only a dream, and I left that behind\u2014found another reason to exist. But, as I looked upon my old crush for the first time in so long, my new reason to exist seemed to fade for that one moment, and whether it was by habit or longing, I wasn\u2019t sure, but for that moment, I still wanted Mike just as bad as before.</p><p>\u201cAra? Baby?\u201d He ushered me to him. \u201cWhat ya waitin\u2019 for, girl, come here.\u201d</p><p>With no mind for the family walking in my path, I darted forward, forcing them to part as I launched toward Mike, barely giving him a chance to drop his bag before I jumped into his arms. We stumbled back a few steps with the force of my eager embrace\u2014a physical reaction my steady-legged vampire could never have, unless he was pretending to be human. And I loved how human Mike was right then.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, baby. That\u2019s happiness to see me.\u201d His widespread fingers pressed firmly against the back of my ribs.</p><p>I squeezed his neck, wrapping my legs around his hips\u2014probably showing my undies to every dirty old man who cared to look. He just felt so good to hold; a little piece of the past, with a warmth that could only be human\u2014as if he\u2019d carried some of the Perth sun all the way to the U.S. with him.</p><p>I rested my cheek in his neck and let myself cry like a little girl. \u201cI missed you so much.\u201d</p> <p>Mike\u2019s arms became a band of restriction, stopping air from coming into my lungs. \u201cI missed you too, kid.\u201d</p><p>When he went to lower me, I held on tighter. \u201cNot yet. Just...not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ara. Let go. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d He unwound my arms from his neck and placed me on the ground. I pulled my dress down to cover my legs. \u201cLet me get a look at you.\u201d He shook his head, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten thinner. Are you eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like my mum.\u201d I clutched the edges of my dress in fists of nerves. \u201cAnd, yes, I do eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He reached for my locket.</p><p>\u201cOh, um. A friend gave it to me.\u201d I took it from his hand and dropped it back into place.</p><p>\u201cYou belong to me?\u201d His brow folded over one eye.</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah. It\u2019s um, a good friend?\u201d I offered, but from the way his lips meshed tightly and his eyes narrowed, I knew he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d The corner of my mouth turned up involuntarily.</p><p>He just blinked a few times, then drew a deep breath through his nose and placed his arm around my shoulder. \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike? You\u2019ve been here for a whole two seconds. Don\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, Ara. It sounds\u2014possessive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous,\u201d I said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cJealous, huh?\u201d His face lit up and his eyes warmed with so much familiarity that all the pain of the separation over these last few months melted away. He grabbed my hand. \u201cSo what if I am? You\u2019ve always been my best friend. Then, out of nowhere, you meet some random guy, fall in love with him, and he brands you with his mark. Now, all of a sudden, you belong to him?\u201d</p><p>Brands me? A quick breath came cold into my lungs as I reached for the yellowing bruises on my neck\u2014the ones from the indiscretion under the stage. But when Mike\u2019s eyes narrowed as he looked at my hand, I tensed from toes to shoulders, realising that wasn\u2019t the mark he was referring to.</p><p>He grabbed my wrist and pulled it away from my neck, gasping loudly when he saw what was hiding beneath my carefully styled, bruise-covering hair. \u201cWho did this to you? Was it him?\u201d</p><p>I shrank into myself, looking around. \u201cMike, stop it. Please. People are staring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Look at you. What kind of a guy would do this to a young girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really. Then what\u2019s the story, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, he wasn\u2019t trying to hurt me, okay? Just stop worrying about me all the time.\u201d</p><p>Mike grabbed my chin and studied the marks on both sides of my neck. \u201cStop worrying, huh? Well, it certainly looks like I should be concerned. Have you seen this? Have you looked at yourself? Jesus, girl.\u201d He released my face gently. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident. I\u2014I bit him,\u201d I said bashfully. \u201cWe were just playing around. I let him do it to me, and he\u2014well, we got a little carried away.\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s arms dropped to his sides and disappointment filled his watery eyes. \u201cDid you sleep with him?\u201d</p><p>I shook my lowered head. I felt so foolish.</p><p>\u201cAra. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He looked around the busy terminal, rubbing at the frown on his face. \u201cJust. Why would you let him do this to you? How do you think I feel to come here after missing you for so long, so worried because I can\u2019t be here to protect you, and I find this\u2014\u201d He held his hand out, presenting the bruise. \u201cGod, Ara. You should have more respect for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d My face crumpled and fell into my hands. \u201cI already feel bad enough about it.\u201d About wanting him to do it. \u201cI don\u2019t need you making it worse.\u201d</p><p>He clicked his tongue, then wrapped both arms around my shoulders, muffling my sobs against his chest. I hated the fact that our dramatic reunion in the middle of the airport was on display to hundreds of people\u2014all watching. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you, Ar.\u201d He rubbed my back. \u201cOkay? I\u2019m not mad at you. I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d He sighed and pulled back, wiping the tears from my cheeks with both thumbs. \u201cI\u2019m mad at myself. I never should\u2019ve let your dad take you away. I should\u2019ve come after you\u2014or kept you with me.\u201d He sounded utterly defeated.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHe\u2019d never\u2019ve let me stay, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would\u2019ve let you stay with me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head again. I was glad I came here; glad I met David\u2014even though I was going to lose him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt me, Mike. David? He didn\u2019t hurt me. I wanted him to do it. I liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra? You\u2019re just a girl. You shouldn\u2019t be playing games like that with boys. He should\u2019ve known better,\u201d Mike said in a singing tone. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I just lost it, is all. I just never expected to see you with bruises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I said I was sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry, Ar. I do get it, okay? I really do. And I\u2019ll let it go. Just, please don\u2019t let him do it to you again. Promise?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, secretly crossing my fingers behind my back. I wondered then, if explaining to Mike that David\u2019s actually a vampire might ease his disdain for the whole biting situation\u2014since it could\u2019ve been worse.</p><p>When Mike laughed, I half expected he\u2019d read my thought, but he simply shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s really damn good to see you, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s kinda weird. I feel like I\u2019m imagining this.\u201d</p><p>Mike reached across and pinched me. \u201cFeels pretty real to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d I rubbed my forearm. \u201cThat hurt, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrow up,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cHmpf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d My arms dropped back down to my sides. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Mike bent and grabbed his suitcase, then shouldered his backpack swiftly, wrapped his arm around my neck, and we wandered slowly out to the parking bay where I left Dad.</p><p>\u201cMr Thompson. Good to see you again.\u201d Mike shook Dad\u2019s hand firmly.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s good to have you here.\u201d Dad cupped his other hand over Mike\u2019s in the \u2018double\u2019 handshake. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing a lot about you these past few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Mike asked in a leading tone. \u201cAra talks about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dad grinned. \u201cI started to wonder if you were my daughter\u2019s only friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Mike looked at me with that cheeky, cocky grin. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre not.\u201d I punched him in the arm.</p><p>He leaned away, rubbing off my pathetic effort at violence.</p><p>When we pulled into the driveway at home, Mike turned in his seat and smiled at me. \u201cYou never told me how beautiful this place is, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, I guess.\u201d I shrugged, not meeting his eyes.</p><p>Each tree had turned a different colour with the near-autumn air, and as the leaves fell from the branches one by one, they gathered in piles or floated down the curve of the road, leaving a wash of yellows and reds and oranges all over Maple Terrace. But my fairy-tale timeline meant that for every leaf that fell away, so too did the days I had left with David.</p><p>Sure, it was pretty, but all that beauty was slowly and surely delivering me to heartbreak.</p><p>\u201cAra would prefer it if they were Gum Trees, I think,\u201d Dad said and hopped out of the car, laughing to himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Ara?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cYou sulked the whole way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m fine.\u201d I climbed out, too, slamming the car door behind me.</p><p>I was sure Mike groaned to himself, but he arrived at the trunk with a smile on his face. \u201cI\u2019ll take that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, that\u2019s heavy.\u201d Dad nearly dropped Mike\u2019s bag as he passed it to him. \u201cI must be getting old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. You\u2019re not old, Mr Thompson. I\u2019m just bloody strong,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI\u2019d have to be to keep up with this one.\u201d He ruffled my hair.</p><p>\u201cHey, get off.\u201d I patted it back into place.</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Greg, Mike\u2014you\u2019re like one of the family. And who knows\u2014\u201d Dad winked at me, \u201c\u2014with the way my daughter talks about you, maybe one day you will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaaa-aad.\u201d I buried my face in my hand.</p><p>Mike chuckled. \u201cNot likely, sir, unless you have another daughter I don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>\u201cI have a son,\u201d he suggested then frowned.</p><p>\u201cHm. Yeah, not really on that side of the fence,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll just have to adopt you, then.\u201d Dad patted Mike on the back as they headed inside, leaving me, shouldering a rise of hurt, to trail behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhen did he become the favourite?\u201d I muttered under my breath.</p><p>The warm smell of bacon and toast wafted into the entranceway, with the sweet aroma of sugared coffee lingering in a pleasant layer over the top. I stepped in and closed the door, smiling at Sam as he ran upstairs carrying\u2014or dragging\u2014Mike\u2019s suitcase.</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want me to take that, Sam?\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cNow, now, you just let the boy worry about that,\u201d Dad said, leading Mike into the dining area. \u201cI think I smell breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I smell heaven,\u201d Mike added.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and pushed past him and Dad to sit at the table and watch them all play \u2018happy families\u2019. Mike was such a suck-up. He knew exactly how to get into oldies\u2019 good books and he was holding no bars back. It was also one of the things I really loved about him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMike, good to finally meet you.\u201d Vicki left her practically permanent kitchen position to hug him. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, Vicki. Really good,\u201d Mike said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally put a face to the voice.\u201d</p><p>Great, so Vicki had been talking to him on the phone, too. Just bury me now.</p> <p>Vicki smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve made you some breakfast\u2014figured you\u2019d be hungry after all that travelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, great,\u201d Mike said and sat at the table next to me. \u201cThe airport food was pretty average.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Ara tells us you\u2019ve been accepted into the ah\u2014what was that called again?\u201d Vicki asked, fussing over the plates.</p><p>\u201cVicki,\u201d I moaned. \u201cDad\u2019s already interrogated him. Do you have to do it too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind an interrogation, Ara.\u201d Mike elbowed me gently. \u201cIt\u2019s uh\u2014it\u2019s called the Tactical Response Group. We get to use cool guns, basically.\u201d He grinned at Sam as he sat down.</p> <p>\u201cDo you get to shoot people?\u201d Sam asked, leaning right across the table to be in Mike\u2019s bubble.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mike\u2019s voice softened, \u201cthe only place I like to shoot people is on Halo. Other than that, we try to avoid it as much as possible. But I have a Taser?\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cAwesome. Hey, do you play on Live\u2014\u201d Sam\u2019s voice became background noise while the boys talked video games and Vicki served breakfast around all the commotion, sitting quietly down after. Without touching my food, I leaned on my hand and listened to the sound of normal; how the laughter, forks clinking on plates, and cups resting with a clunk on wood could echo familiarity and content. Once upon a time, being normal meant having a life with two parents, no grief, and no scars. Now, normal meant I could sit in my kitchen, eat food with my family, and at the end of my life\u2014die.</p><p>A few months ago, I didn\u2019t know how much I had to be grateful for, but the hourglass of Fate could rock and tip everything out of balance at any time. I knew now that I had to take each breath of normal with a kind of appreciation I never understood before, because imagining, with David\u2019s interpretation of eternity, if I didn\u2019t have any of this\u2014I looked at Dad and Vicki, leaning closer to each other as they laughed\u2014I would miss it all terribly.</p><p>\u201cWell, Vicki\u2014\u201d Mike wiped his mouth with a napkin and rested his arm on the table, \u201c\u2014that was the most amazing breakfast I\u2019ve had in a long time. Ara\u2019s right, you are a good cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra said that?\u201d Vicki\u2019s wide eyes landed on me. I wanted to brush them off. \u201cWell, thank you, Ara, and thank you, Mike. I really enjoy cooking\u2014especially for people who eat it without salt.\u201d She glared at Dad.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dad shrugged, holding his hands out.</p><p>Mike laughed and placed his napkin on the table. \u201cWell, my mother raised me with the strong belief that it\u2019s considered an insult to the chef when one puts salt on his food.\u201d</p><p>Vicki\u2019s smile pushed her brows up. \u201cSee, Greg? You could stand to learn a few table manners, yourself.\u201d</p><p>Sam laughed.</p><p>\u201cHm, Ara?\u201d Dad cleared his throat, ignoring Vicki and Sam. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give Mike the grand tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s seen a house before, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yours, though,\u201d Mike said, seeming to offer me the position of Tour Guide.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Come on.\u201d I stood up, but when I reached for his hand, he quickly drew it away. Even Dad and Vicki saw it, disguising their shock with a swift glance at their plates, while I ate the swell of mortification.</p> <p>\u201cThanks again, Vicki.\u201d Mike grabbed his plate and mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Mike.\u201d</p><p>I walked off in a huff, looking back at Mike. \u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing.\u201d He dumped the plates in the sink as we passed the kitchen and headed through the arch to the forbidden formal room.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is the dining room...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo dining rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, for all those dinner guests Vicki entertains.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mike nodded, crossing his arms. I don\u2019t think he realised I was joking.</p><p>\u201cAnd out there is the backyard.\u201d I pointed beyond the windows.</p><p>\u201cIs that the swing? Where you sit when you\u2019re sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a slide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d He flicked his hand out and knocked my ponytail.</p><p>\u201cUh!\u201d I held up a finger. \u201cNo mucking about in here. You\u2019ll hit the chandelier.\u201d</p><p>Mike looked up. \u201cHm. Look at that. A real chandelier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plastic,\u201d I remarked and walked on, leading him to the TV room that met back up with the front entrance. \u201cWe watch TV in here.\u201d</p><p>Mike stood by the suede sofa and considered the giant LCD sitting neatly on the white cabinet. \u201cNo drinks in the lounge,\u201d he read the \u2018house rules\u2019 painted on the wooden wall-plaque. \u201cNo name-calling. No...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I grabbed his shoulders and spun him toward the door. \u201cWe all know the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He tried to walk back to the TV room. \u201cI wasn\u2019t done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can read them later. I wanna show you your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But only because I stink.\u201d He lifted his arm and sniffed his own odour. \u201cI need a change of shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d I pushed his arm down.</p><p>\u201cNow, Sam,\u201d Dad\u2019s voice absconded into the entrance.</p><p>\u201cWhy does she get to stay home?\u201d Sam said, and I imagined him pointing off in some random direction as if pointing at me\u2014the \u2018she\u2019.</p><p>\u201cBecause she has a friend who just arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always some excuse. It\u2019s like she never goes to school.\u201d</p><p>Mike rested his forearm on the balustrade, half laughing, and looked at me. \u201cYou never go to school, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot.\u201d I kicked up the carpet at the base of the stair.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it been\u2014\u201d he nodded toward the dining room, \u201c\u2014having a little brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much different to putting up with you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and looked around, his eyes taking in the stairs, then the window above the front door, and landing back on me. \u201cI like this. It\u2019s a nice house, Ara. It\u2019s good to see the places you\u2019ve been talking about all your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, later I\u2019ll show you where I landed when I broke my arm that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d He tugged on a strand of my hair, making me lower my foot from the first step to look up at him. \u201cI really missed ya, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, and my eyes moved slowly from his camel-skin boots, over the light denim jeans and traced swerves over the ripples under his shirt, stopping in a hold on his warm eyes. The caramel colour had always reminded me of autumn\u2014once my favourite season\u2014but there would have to be a different comparison for his eyes now that my autumn would forever be a reminder of losing David. Maybe...</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d His face blurred and sharpened into focus.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear anything I just said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s shoulders dropped and he nodded to himself. \u201cCome on, why don\u2019t you just show me upstairs?\u201d</p><p>I knew he was upset. I didn\u2019t want him to be upset. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, flashing him a cheeky grin.</p><p>\u201cAra. Come on. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m not in the mood for games.\u201d</p><p>My brow arched. \u201cRace you?\u201d</p><p>And the mask cracked, bringing warmth back to his eyes. \u201cAh, forget that,\u201d he said, taking a quick step toward me. \u201cThis is more fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I squealed, rapping my fists on his leg as he swept me up like a football, legs kicking behind us, and bolted up the stairs. \u201cPut me down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d He laughed over my protest, so I angled my head just so, and bit his thigh. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>I landed on the carpet on my hands and knees.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just bit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just dropped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Defensive reaction.\u201d He rubbed his leg.</p><p>I stood up, dusting myself off and we both held eye contact for only a second before laughing. \u201cTruce?\u201d I held up my pinkie.</p><p>\u201cTruce.\u201d He linked his with mine, then pulled it close to his body, wrapping his other hand behind my head to bury my face in his chest. \u201cCome here, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I missed you, too.\u201d I patted his back a few times then stepped away.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d He looked from one door to another. \u201cWhich one\u2019s my room?\u201d</p><p>I pointed to the spare room.</p><p>\u201cWhich one\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>I nodded to the one behind him; he took a look, then hobbled over to his door, his hand firmly on his thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh, grow up, Mike. I didn\u2019t bite that hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d He stood tall, dropping the act. \u201cI might need a tetanus shot.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to whack him, but knew it would start the war all over again. So I took the moral high road instead and opened his door for him, ruffling his hair as the light from his room swept the carpet by my feet. \u201cDoes poor baby need a cuddle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet, you,\u201d he said playfully and his eyes widened as he looked into his room. \u201cOoh. Nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And you can thank David for putting the bed up,\u201d I said, and crossed the room to close the window. \u201cDad was trying to put the foot at the head and the same on the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I pushed the curtains further apart to allow for more light, then turned around and opened the door adjacent to the window. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a bathroom here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, my own bathroom. Nice.\u201d Mike leaned his head around the bathroom door, then smiled back at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have a TV.\u201d I walked to the wardrobe\u2014the door on the left of his bed\u2014and rolled out one corner of the LCD. \u201cWe usually roll it away to make more space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve got a stack of our favourite movies on my hard drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d I nodded, pressing my lips into a thin line.</p><p>Mike stared down at me with a half-lit smile, his hands on his hips like he was questioning a suspect, and a narrowed look in his eyes that made me clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep staring at me like that, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s just\u2014\u201d He went to walk away, but stopped and gave that same look again. \u201cDid you dye your hair or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I toyed with the ends. \u201cDoes it look different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I laughed. \u201cThat makes perfect sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He shook his head and hooked his fingers under the handle of his suitcase. \u201cI just haven\u2019t seen you in so long. I think I forgot how you looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, didn\u2019t you have a picture?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged dismissively, placing his suitcase on the end of the bed. \u201cProbably somewhere. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve referred back to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2018spose I could. Guess I just didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, looking up from the padlock on his bag. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the long face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...well, it\u2019s just David,\u201d I said, instead of blubbering that he clearly didn\u2019t miss me like I missed him. \u201cI told you\u2014he has to go away for a few weeks before he leaves indefinitely, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll miss him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>Mike softened then and grabbed my wrist, pulling me into his chest for another way-too-tight hug. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, kid, you got me. I\u2019ll keep ya company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I pushed out from his arms. \u201cBut, I\u2019ve relied on him so much to get me through. I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what was I, if not the one who helped you get through things, before you came here?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Ara. It\u2019s not the end of the world. And he\u2019ll be back to say goodbye, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. It was all I could do for fear of crying hysterically.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He patted my arm. \u201cSo just...cheer up and enjoy this time with me. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I huffed.</p><p>\u201cAnd sit down. You\u2019re making me feel edgy just standing there, hovering by the door.\u201d He motioned to his bed.</p><p>I looked at it for a long moment. It didn\u2019t seem right to sit on his bed now\u2014now that I had a boyfriend.</p><p>Mike looked at the bed too, then smiled. \u201cWhat? Did you booby-trap it\u2014like last winter when you and your friends thought it\u2019d be funny to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said swiftly, then wandered over and slumped down in the centre, with my feet dangling off the side. \u201cI just\u2014I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m comfortable being in your room now, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mike nodded, letting his gaze slip past me to the window.</p><p>I rolled onto my side and propped my head up with the ball of my palm. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a change of shirt\u2019s first on the list.\u201d He unzipped his suitcase. \u201cThen, I wanna hear all about this boyfriend of yours.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at the sound of his accent, how, alone, in a quiet space, the Aussie in him became more prominent, more noticeable\u2014not a strong accent, just enough to surprise me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He frowned.</p><p>\u201cOh, um. It\u2019s the accent,\u201d I said. \u201cIt sounds so...foreign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard yourself? You\u2019re all American.\u201d He put on a mock American accent, but it sounded more Canadian.</p> <p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t knock the accent.\u201d I rolled onto my back and looked up at the ceiling. \u201cTook me weeks to get it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it sounds very authentic,\u201d he said warmly.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>He chatted away then, zipping and unzipping pockets in his suitcase, laying things in the drawers across from the bed then closing them gently, while I watched in a sort of dream-like state. He still didn\u2019t seem real. I half wondered when I was going to wake up.</p> <p>When the suitcase scuffed along the floor, I looked at Mike as he kicked it under the bed and laid a clean shirt on the blanket. \u201cHey, wanna see what I\u2019ve been doing lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I pushed up on my elbows.</p><p>He yanked his shirt from the back of the neck and pulled it over his head, and my mouth dropped. \u201cYou like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been working hard to get into the Tactical Group.\u201d I smiled at him one last time before a shiver ran down my spine, forcing me to look at the roof again. \u201cThere\u2019s no way not to appreciate that kind of workmanship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they expect a certain level of fitness,\u201d he said, ruffling about at the foot of the bed, \u201cit\u2019s my duty to exceed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you certainly didn\u2019t look like that the last time you took your shirt off, so...duty fulfilled,\u201d I scoffed, and everything went dark with the strong scent of Mike. \u201cEw. Wash this thing. It stinks,\u201d I joked, peeling his shirt off my face then tossing it back at him.</p> <p>He caught it, held it to his nose, then shrugged and threw it behind him. \u201cCome on\u2014move over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d The giant jumped onto the queen-sized bed and sunk his elbows heavily into the softness beside me, making me roll slightly into him.</p><p>I shoved my palm against his arm and rolled onto my back. \u201cGod, you take up so much space.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and tucked his elbows under his ribs to hold his head off the bed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you could just get off my bed.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as he shoved me gently. \u201cLike I said; make me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone could make you do anything, Ara-Rose, my life would\u2019ve been much easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d I flicked his earlobe.</p> <p>\u201cOuch.\u201d He laughed, cupping it. \u201cThat actually hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d He pretended to flick mine, pressing the tip of my nose when I shied away. \u201cPain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWide load.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m joking,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>He drew a long breath through his nose, his gaze tracing circles over my features.</p><p>I smiled back up at him, seeing the fine lines I\u2019d memorised and the little pupil-sized scar on the bridge of his nose that he got when I threw a rock at him for being a jerk one day. I felt at home in the comfortable silence\u2014the kind we were used to.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d he said in that husky whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>When his face came closer to mine, I almost held my breath, thinking he was going to at least kiss my head, but he rolled onto his back with a rather large huff and linked his fingers behind his head. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Long trip, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially changing over at LAX. I was stuck at Customs for an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour?\u201d I blew my fringe off my face. \u201cThey must\u2019ve been moving fast that day.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed softly and grabbed a pillow from the top of the bed, stuffing it under his head. And as his breathing slowed and the noise in the house died down after Dad and Sam went off to school and Vicki started the car up then drove down the street, I looked out at the clouds through the top of the window, just happy to be by Mike\u2019s side again. Mostly, I could only see the eaves of the roof jutting out above the glass, but beyond that, the summer sky went on forever\u2014leading to the place, the world David was living in today. Even though I knew he was a fast runner, part of me wondered how he was going to get all the way back here from New York every night and still be back there in the morning to start work. Then I wondered what he actually did while \u2018operating the Set\u2019.</p><p>As the shadows and the yellow glow of the sun moved across the floor and to the wall, I rolled onto my side and watched Mike\u2019s chest rise and fall with his quiet breath, while the vein on his neck pulsed lightly on each heartbeat. It was something so small\u2014seeing someone\u2019s body live, function\u2014but until I\u2019d spent so long with a vampire who didn\u2019t need a heart, I\u2019d never really appreciated the miracle in our design. I wanted to reach inside his chest and feel the blood pulse through his heart, feel it full and fat and living, feel the life in his veins\u2014the life David took from others. And, looking at my best friend sleeping so peacefully, so trusting, a small occurrence crept up; how could I ever take that. How could I reach into a person\u2019s life and take them from the world\u2014destroy their family? Destroy their future, their hopes and dreams. What if it were Mike? Or my dad?</p><p>It was all very easy to brush it off and think, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know this person,\u201d but at the end of the day, how would I feel if a vampire killed someone I loved?</p><p>\u201cWhat you thinkin\u2019 \u2018bout?\u201d Mike\u2019s voice startled me.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, I thought you were asleep.\u201d I tried to smile\u2014it was a pathetic effort.</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d He sat up and shuffled to the edge of the bed. \u201cWhat was on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d I stated.</p><p>He sighed and dragged me, by the hand, to sit beside him. As the weight of his heavy arm fell around my shoulder, I nestled my brow under his jaw. The deep, almost candy-musk scent of his cologne made a flash of his bedroom, back home, pop into my mind.</p><p>\u201cYou smell good,\u201d I noted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the cologne you bought me for my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I sat up and looked at him, incredulity littering my grin. \u201cI thought you said it reeked like an unopened coffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. I did say that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d His gaze became thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cYes. Among other things.\u201d I looked down at my hands.</p><p>\u201cI was a bit of a dick, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYou were only young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So, in that case, I reserve the right to be an annoying cow, since you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But only \u2018til you turn eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d I grinned, then, It growled.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Mike poked my belly; \u201cThe ogre! I see some things haven\u2019t changed at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s changed, Mike\u2014not really.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, boring into mine. \u201cWhat\u2019d you mean by that, Ar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d I internally slapped myself on the head with a novelty-sized baseball bat.</p><p>Mike stopped for a second, halfway between getting up and sitting back down, then shook his head and pulled me off the bed. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s just feed the beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Then, later, I\u2019ll take you across to the school so you can meet my friends.\u201d I bounced on my toes a little.</p><p>\u201cFriends, hey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019ve made this whole new life for myself, Mike. I'm, like, totally normal now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never be normal, Ara. You\u2019ve always been\u2014special.\u201d That comment should\u2019ve been followed with the usual head-tilt-eye-wink-combo, but instead, his gaze delved into mine. Golden brown eyes, like maple syrup, creasing in the corners a little with his smile.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mean that in a derogatory sense,\u201d I said.</p><p>He rolled his eyes, groaning. \u201cCome on, I need food\u2014it\u2019s past lunch time already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me twice.\u201d I ran down the stairs ahead of him.</p><p>And everything was just the same as before\u2014before all the tragedy and the awkward I-don\u2019t-love-you-the-way-you-love-me stuff. I threw pieces of fruit at Mike while he prepared food and we talked about old times, movies, music, home, and it was easy\u2014for a moment.</p><p>Mike, with the sleeves of his dark-blue shirt rolled up, stood chopping onions and coriander at the counter, looking so tall and so grown up that I tried not to look at him\u2014tried not to feel...anything.</p><p>But the strange sensation in my body, flooding me with pulsing hot blood every time he smiled, made me long to be in his arms.</p><p>Then, that confusing pendulum of indecision kept changing things. I\u2019d go back to square one and think, no, Ara, what are you saying\u2014you don\u2019t want him to love you, because that means Fate has decided you should let David wander the earth, miserable, for eternity.</p><p>I felt kind of like Sherlock Holmes, examining clues, pacing around in my own head; to live or to love? That is the question.</p><p>But, if I had to spend the rest of my human life with anyone other than David, the only person I\u2019d want would be Mike. So, I guess the question would be: to live and love for all my life, or to kill and love eternally?</p><p>I was beginning to wonder why I got out of bed this year.</p><p>When the plates no longer contained food and the last of the enthusiastic catch-up wore down to more planned questions, Mike shook his head and smiled. \u201cKnow what I found the other day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember that picture we took at the golf course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day you tried to teach me how to play?\u201d I started laughing, already replaying the tragic ending to that day in my mind\u2014tragic for the window of a golf cart, that is.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mike laughed. \u201cYou were so much smaller then, and you still had that gap.\u201d He pointed to his front teeth.</p><p>I ran my tongue over my gums. \u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t look at any pictures of me over the last few months?\u201d</p><p>Mike looked down at his hands, smiling under reddening cheeks. \u201cWell, maybe a few.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThen how did you forget what I looked like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t, really. You\u2019ve just...You know, you\u2019ve grown up so much while we were apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have. Did you think I\u2019d stay a little girl forever?\u201d Although, that was a likely possibility.</p><p>\u201cI just never expected time would change you so much while I wasn\u2019t around to see it. You\u2019re\u2014\u201d he considered carefully, \u201c\u2014well, you\u2019re a woman now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman? Mike, I\u2019m seventeen. No older than when I left.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not your age, it\u2019s something...else. I don't know, maybe it\u2019s just that you\u2019ve been through a lot. Guess it\u2019s bound to leave its mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean scar.\u201d</p><p>He reached across the table for my hand; I reluctantly placed it in his. \u201cI\u2019m here now, baby girl. I didn\u2019t know how much I was missing you until I saw you. Now it feels almost like my heart might tear out if I have to leave you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll change your mind after two weeks with me. Then you can go back and get on with your life,\u201d I said, then laughed in an attempt to bring nonchalance back into the room\u2014since it suddenly got very intense.</p><p>He nodded as he said, \u201cI\u2019m beginning to rethink that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRethink it? Rethink what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you, Ara\u2014you belong in my life, you always have. I... look...I have to tell you something.\u201d His shoulders lifted a little. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get mad, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d My limbs tightened.</p><p>He looked down at our hands for a second, then back at me with those caramel eyes, warmed with a smile but infused with anxiety. \u201cThe truth is, I came here to say goodbye. One final goodbye before I let you go for good. You seemed to be getting on with your life, but, now I\u2019m here, I can\u2019t do it.\u201d He shrugged and one corner of his lip turned up. \u201cSo, I\u2019m going with plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s plan B? Hire a time-machine for the week and change the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAr\u2014\u201d He gave that deep groan and intense stare he always gave when I was being silly. \u201cBaby, I... on the plane over here, I was sitting next to two old ladies, and I was so stuck in this cage of uncertainty I actually talked their ears off.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear.</p><p>\u201cI don't know what the best way to say this is, and I don't know when\u2019s the right time\u2014so I'm just gonna come out with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Don't say it yet.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, already decided. \u201cBaby, I love you.\u201d</p><p>My heart imploded; I pulled myself together quickly, opting for Ignorance Road. \u201cI know you do, Mike, and I know you\u2019ll always be my bestie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but... that\u2019s not what I meant and you know it.\u201d</p><p>I sat frozen, my lips shaped to the word Ah! And then it all folded inward, tears streaming down my face as it crumpled like I\u2019d eaten a lemon.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re not supposed to cry when a guy says he loves you,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>I sobbed into my hand. \u201cTell me you don't mean it.\u201d</p><p>His upturned palm appeared under my cave of asylum; I ignored it, looking away. \u201cI do mean it, baby. I... I want you to come home with me when I go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shot up out of my seat, hugging myself. \u201cDon't say that. Don't say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d He stood up, reaching.</p><p>I pointed a stern finger toward him. \u201cTake it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake it back! Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I can't take it back.\u201d He touched his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, uh-uh.\u201d I waved my hands around, blinded by tears. \u201cNope.

I can see you\u2019re a little upset, so, I'm gonna just\u2014\u201d He motioned to the table. \u201cI'm just gonna sit. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I stood shaking, breathing like a tired puppy.</p><p>As soon as Mike sunk into the seat, he breathed out profanity and dropped his head against his hand.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you don't mean it?\u201d I could feel myself rocking back and forth. \u201cPlease tell me you just feel bad for me because my mum died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think this is?\u201d He stood up again. \u201cA pity party?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, hopeful.</p> <p>He went to reach for me but stopped and swiped a hand across his nose. \u201cIs that what you want it to be?\u201d</p><p>I folded over a little, feeling myself die, breath by breath. \u201cPlease just take it back, Mike. Please? I know you mean it but...please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His voice broke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...I can't hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don't know what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>He took a quick stride toward me and wrapped me in his arms. \u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>I sobbed a snotty mess of heartache into his shirt, making it wet, and he just held me around my shoulders, almost delicately, as if he didn't have the right to touch me.</p> <p>\u201cI'm so sorry, baby. I know it\u2019s a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cJust stop talking. Don't make this any worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. It\u2019s really okay.\u201d He half laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Nothing is\u2014and it\u2019s never going to be okay again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d he asked in a gentle tone.</p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s dead, Mike, okay? And you can't make it better by telling me you love me. It doesn't work like that.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cEven if it could change the past, that isn\u2019t something I\u2019d lie about, baby. Come on, you know me better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I wiped the tears from my face with the back of my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d You have to be lying.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike started again.</p><p>No! I took short, quick breaths. The breakdown that had been looming all this time flitted to the surface. I held my hands over my ears, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cWill you just listen?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014please, Mike, please don\u2019t do this.\u201d I felt Fate taking a step closer to me every time he opened his mouth, swathing me in the cloth of mortality, binding me to this dice I rolled.</p><p>\u201cAmara, calm down.\u201d He pulled my hands away from my ears. \u201cPlease listen. You never\u2014that night\u2014you never let me explain it to you. We were trying to make the transition from childhood friends to something so much more\u2014something I was afraid you weren\u2019t ready for. God!\u201d His arms tightened around my body, almost completely consuming my shape in a snug cloud of safety. \u201cI have never been able to forgive myself for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive yourself? Mike! It was me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed his thumb over my lip to shush me. \u201cNo, it was my fault. I wanted you. I wanted you so damn bad, but I couldn\u2019t do those things with you while you were drunk. It would\u2019ve been irresponsible of me.\u201d He rolled my face upward until our eyes met, keeping his thumb to my lips. \u201cI wanted you to love me, but not like that\u2014not intoxicated, not when we hadn\u2019t talked about it. When I told you no, you got so upset, I just didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014I let the ball drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this now?\u201d It came out as a whisper, perhaps less. \u201cWhy not then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI chased after you, Ara. I searched the streets for an hour. I called your house, no one answered. Then\u2014\u201d</p><p>We both knew the ending to that story.</p><p>He wiped the tears from my face and kissed my brow.</p><p>I could feel my hands shaking again as sensation came back into my limbs. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me before I left Perth then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. You wouldn\u2019t see me, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why not on the phone\u2014after I left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? So you could feel worse, or so I could feel worse? I couldn\u2019t come to you, Ara. It\u2019s been killing me, I\u2014\u201d He dropped his head into his palm and closed his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep anymore. I play it over in my mind all the time\u2014the things we should\u2019ve done that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings you said no to.\u201d</p><p>He clutched the base of my jaw gently in his hand. \u201cI know. But I just didn\u2019t want you to have regrets in the morning. I knew I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to look away from his penetrating stare, the way his eyes seemed to read mine. But he held my chin and forced me to keep looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been watching you for months,\u201d he continued, \u201cjust waiting for you to realise how I felt about you, and then, that night, you took me by surprise. I didn\u2019t know how to tell you what I really felt, and I was so afraid if I did, and you were just confused because you\u2019d been drinking, that it\u2019d ruin our friendship forever. It was just one stupid misunderstanding and I lost you\u2014for good.\u201d Mike smoothed my tear-soaked hair from my temples and along my chin. \u201cAra, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so upset, baby. It\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is!\u201d I pushed his arms off me. \u201cIt is for me. You don\u2019t get it. You don\u2019t know what this means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, baby. I get it. Your mum and Harry died becau\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s not that. You\u2019re not even close. God, you don\u2019t know anything about my life.\u201d I turned away, seeing him take a step toward me as I fled the room, but he stayed where I left him.</p><p>The weakness in my mind forced itself outside my head, travelling down my legs, making it hard to climb the stairs. I just had to make it to my room before I fell.</p><p>I burst through my door, half folded over, and slammed it shut with my foot before collapsing into a pair of strong, cool arms. \u201cMy love. It\u2019s okay. Just calm down.\u201d</p><p>Salty pools distorted the face of my vampire, spilling past my lashes as I blinked away my disbelief. \u201cWhat are you doing here? You\u2019re supposed to be at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt...\u201d He touched his chest. \u201cI felt something shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShift?\u201d I wiped my face.</p><p>\u201cI think it was you.\u201d He wrapped me up safely in his arms. \u201cWhat is it, my love? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves me, David,\u201d I blubbered. \u201cWhat do I do now? He loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d his voice was liquid with worry. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, sniffling. \u201cFate. Fate de-de\u2014\u201d I couldn\u2019t get it out. \u201cDecided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Ara?\u201d</p><p>I tried to speak, but even my thoughts wouldn\u2019t form the truth for him to see\u2014the truth that I let my future fall in the hands of Chance and now I had my answer. Now, I knew what I had to do.</p><p>He looked at me for a long moment, obviously trying to find a thought among the mess of confusion in my mind. \u201cJust cry, sweetheart\u2014for as long as the tears will fall.\u201d He kissed the crown of my head, then swept me up in his arms and carried me to the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be here. I\u2019ll hold you until you fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>I settled against his chest, and even though he had no heartbeat to show his emotions, I could feel the pain my every thought inflicted on him; feel his body stiffen every time I saw Mike\u2019s face in my mind; feel the thorn through his soul with every beat of my heart that wasn\u2019t for him. But he stayed with me, loved me a while longer as my heart tore itself apart and shattered in two; one piece for David and one for Mike\u2014who really owned that part of me all along. And as the sky turned dark, in his arms I drifted toward a deep, exhausted sleep.</p><p>Restless images flashed in downward scrolls like an old film before my eyes\u2014the movie jagged, cut, stuck together\u2014an incomprehensible storyline. The colour was gone, leaving only greyed hues through an unfocused lens.</p><p>Faceless strangers stared as I passed each row of seats, and I held my bouquet closer to my heart, protecting what was within. They could see the red rose, sitting in contrast to the white flowers surrounding it\u2014the only colour in this grey little world. I could feel their curiosity, heard their whispers, but no one would understand, so I held my head high and walked on, each step taking a lifetime, as if I was being slowed by a force unseen.</p><p>I could see the man at the end, where the light touched the lip of the steps; standing tall, proud, confident. He was waiting there\u2014for me\u2014hands behind his back, eyes watching, face shadowed by the darkness of this never ending walk.</p><p>The light around him faded more for each step I took, so too did the dull, lifeless toll of church bells, ringing somewhere out there in the world beyond my future.</p><p>As I finally reached his side, my red blossom wilted, tar seeping up its veins, soaking away the colour around the shrinking petals until, finally, they fell like black snow toward my ruby slippers. David and I held our breath, watching them leave their life behind, decaying into ash around our feet.</p><p>\u201cSee, you don\u2019t need it anymore,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need what?\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward the ash. \u201cLife.\u201d</p><p>I looked up into his proud eyes and held my breath. It was time. It had to be now or never. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, David,\u201d I said, placing the remains of the pale bouquet in his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not what it means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean, then?\u201d</p><p>I slowly drew a breath, hesitating on the preface of his destruction. \u201cThat I don\u2019t need you anymore.\u201d</p><p>His eyes brimmed with liquid, making the green appear as colour among the greys.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I said in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I reached behind me and took the firm, strong hand that grabbed mine. \u201cTo live.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to own no comprehension at first, but as my mind woke a little with the feel of his cool arms coming away from my body where I hadn\u2019t felt them before, I saw his eyes switch from realisation to deep sadness. He nodded, taking slow steps backward; his elbows, his arms, his waist, tapering into the darkness until, finally, the shadows consumed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, David,\u201d I said, waiting, knowing what would come next. A lifetime seemed to pass before the ground quivered beneath my feet, the ashes around my ruby slippers rising into the air, floating like dust particles in a smoky cloud. And inch-by-inch, the ground crumbled toward me, narrowing in my little world. I felt for Mike\u2019s hand, turning to look back at the emptiness of my own faults. But he was gone. The only thing out there was Fate; I could hear Her laughing, could feel Her eyes on me, watching on as the ground came away completely, empty air wrapping my form, dragging me down in an eternal fall toward the darkness of mortality.</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d My whispered cry became an echo as the timespan of forever spread out around me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Gasping, I jolted awake, grabbing the edges of my blanket.</p><p>David?</p><p>I looked behind me, under me, beside me\u2014he was gone.</p><p>No. Oh, God, he saw it\u2014the whole thing. I covered my mouth with both hands and closed my eyes tight as I remembered the dream. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</p><p>The clock in the hall ticked loudly, each second timing the beat of my heart and bringing the rise of realisation a little closer to the surface; Fate decided.</p><p>Mortality.</p><p>Death.</p><p>Life.</p><p>Mike.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean I agreed.</p><p>Exhaustion made me flop back down on my pillow, and as my hand fell beside my face, something cool and smooth touched my fingertips, filling my senses with the floral perfume of roses.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sleeping beauty.\u201d Mike leaned against the doorframe with a tray in his hands.</p><p>Sound suddenly came rushing back to my ears. \u201cMorning? How long was I out for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night.\u201d He shrugged and walked into my room. \u201cYou cried for a long time at first, then you went quiet. I came to check on you, but you were asleep.\u201d He set the tray down on the bed beside my legs, bringing the smell of toast in behind him. \u201cStill your favourite flower?\u201d He nodded toward the rose.</p><p>\u201cYou left this?\u201d I picked it up, being careful of the thorns on the stem.</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you.\u201d I sniffed its sweet, soft scent, fading as the autumn destroyed everything that was once beautiful in the summer. \u201cYou have no idea what this means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Mike sat beside me, moving the tray onto my lap.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I just can\u2019t believe it, Mike. All this time, I thought I was wrong. I thought I misread everything between us.\u201d I put the rose down. \u201cI need to know\u2014is this how you really feel, or is it guilt?\u201d</p><p>Mike grinned and looked down, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cWill it matter? You love David.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cI heard you talking in your sleep,\u201d he said sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Was there no privacy in this world?</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m just gonna throw it out there and you can do with it what you want.\u201d He turned his body to face me then took both of my hands. \u201cI am in love with you, Ara-Rose. You were never wrong about that. You never misread anything, okay? I love you.\u201d He squeezed my hands on each of his end words. \u201cI\u2019m a complete moron, and I\u2019m so bloody sorry for that. But I loved you before your mum died, so I\u2019m pretty damn sure it\u2019s not guilt, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d His words soaked through me. \u201cI can\u2019t respond yet, Mike. I need to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He nodded. \u201cSo, for now, I\u2019ve arranged with your dad for you to have a few days off school\u2014give you some time to clear your head.\u201d He winked at me and smiled, but it faded quickly, leaving the serious Mike behind again. \u201cYour dad loves you, you know. He was worried about you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell him\u2014about why I was crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I told him everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what!\u201d I jolted forward, nearly sending the breakfast tray flying. \u201cMike, how could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He pulled my hand away from my mouth. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t want him to know what happened the night your mum died, but he\u2019s your dad and he loves you\u2014no matter what.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot now that he knows she died because of me, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. Don\u2019t say that.\u201d He grabbed my arms firmly and pulled me in for a short hug. \u201cI\u2019m the loser that turned you down. I\u2019m the one to blame. Not you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Mike.\u201d I gently shook my head and closed my eyes, calling on the strength I\u2019d come to know since meeting David, trying to believe my next words. \u201cIt was no one\u2019s fault. It just happened and, I guess\u2014\u201d I opened my eyes to Mike\u2019s smile, \u201c\u2014I guess it\u2019s natural to look for someone to blame, but neither of us intended that to happen. We should both stop blaming ourselves.\u201d</p><p>He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cYour dad was heartbroken when I told him you were carrying the blame. He hadn\u2019t even guessed it, you know. He\u2019s been so worried about you, and when I told him you felt responsible for what happened to your mum, he was actually relived that that\u2019s all it was. He doesn\u2019t hate you, baby, he can\u2019t hate you. He loves you too much. That\u2019s why he let you have a few days off\u2014to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes you,\u201d I noted begrudgingly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an excellent judge of character.\u201d Mike grinned; I smiled back. I couldn\u2019t resist it. He just had this presence about him that excluded everyone from his inner circle of love, but when he smiled like that, it meant you belonged.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you told him about us. I yelled at him, you know\u2014when he accused me of loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that such a bad accusation?\u201d Mike asked, a little insulted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d He laughed, then leaned over my body with his face right up close to mine. \u201cSo? What do you want to do today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d I unfolded my arms. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to just sit around and watch movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that. But, I get to hold the popcorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! You always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fight you for it.\u201d He tickled my ribs.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I giggled, wriggling about, trying to pull his hand away without knocking the tray.</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike!\u201d I squealed. \u201cStop it or I\u2019ll wet myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStopping.\u201d He raised his hands above his head and sat back.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d I said. \u201cWorks every time.\u201d</p><p>Vicki heaped another pile of butter-scented potatoes onto Mike\u2019s plate. \u201cSo, what did you kids get up to today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatched movies,\u201d I said with my mouth full.</p><p>\u201cAnything good?\u201d Dad asked, sprinkling salt on his dinner; Vicki just sighed at him as she sat down in the soft light of our candlelit dinner.</p><p>\u201cCouple of oldies. Ara made me watch some black-and-white with a curly-haired kid in it,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>Dad looked at me. \u201cWhat movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, Shirley Temple,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, good ol\u2019 Shirley.\u201d Dad nodded.</p><p>\u201cI used to love Shirley,\u201d Vicki said dreamily. \u201cI grew up watching those movies.\u201d</p><p>Sam slid down in his seat. \u201cYou grew up watching the invention of the light bulb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, son,\u201d Dad said sternly.</p><p>\u201cWhy the long face, Sam?\u201d Mike asked, passing the peas to Vicki when she motioned for them.</p><p>\u201cI got a B on my English paper...\u201d</p><p>Big deal. At least you didn\u2019t inadvertently tell your boyfriend you\u2019re in love with another man.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a B?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cDad expects a B-plus-A-minus average,\u201d I said and smiled at Dad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I expect that, Ara-Rose,\u201d Dad said, \u201cI just know you\u2019re both capable of it. If you aren\u2019t achieving those results, it means you\u2019re not applying yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t my fault!\u201d Sam dumped his elbow on the table. \u201cMr Benson hates me, he\u2019s always in my face about stuff I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel. Teachers do not degrade papers based on their opinions of students,\u201d Dad cut in. \u201cYou need to start accepting responsibility for yourself.\u201d When he glared at the tabled elbow, Sam quietly removed it. \u201cYou got a B because you prioritised video games over homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVideo games have more value to me than English homework, Dad. How will knowing what a verb is or deciphering Shakespeare get me a job out in the \u2018real world\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Mike asked, cutting off Dad\u2019s large mouthful of Sam-serving air.</p><p>\u201cVideo game design,\u201d Sam said into his chest.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Mike nodded.</p><p>Sam looked up. \u201cReally? You think that\u2019s cool?\u201d</p><p>Mike looked at Dad; Dad sighed and separated himself from the conversation by pouring gravy. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s a great business to get into\u2014especially now with all the developments in graphics and, not to mention, you can actually make more money in the gaming industry than the film industry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad doesn\u2019t agree.\u201d Sam\u2019s eyes dropped their hopeful glimmer. \u201cHe says I need to be serious. That designing games isn\u2019t gonna get me a stable income.\u201d</p><p>Mike just laughed. \u201cIt won\u2019t\u2014if you don\u2019t have a good education. How many companies do you think will hire a kid who can\u2019t even commit to homework?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked puzzled. \u201cWhat difference will that make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about what you learn at school. It\u2019s also about proving you have the ability to put your head down and do the work, especially if you care nothing for it. If you can\u2019t do that, Sam, you don\u2019t have the right to a job you love doing, and I can tell you\u2014\u201d Mike scoffed, \u201c\u2014even in a job you love, there\u2019ll be moments you hate.\u201d</p><p>Sam became smaller in his chair.</p><p>\u201cPoint is, mate, you work hard through the crap so you can enjoy the other eighty percent that\u2019s good. Not to mention, if you want to design games, you will need English\u2014and math.\u201d Mike winked at me. \u201cCreativity, passion, and some mad computer skills won\u2019t be enough if you want a stable income. You need that piece of paper they call a degree. That\u2019s all there is to it. So, in that way, your dad\u2019s right. But\u2014\u201d he held a finger up while he shovelled a spoonful of potato in and swallowed, \u201c\u2014if you just do all the hard work while you have nothing else to worry about except being a kid, when you grow up and you want the job stability you care nothing for now, you won\u2019t have to fight for it\u2014it\u2019ll be yours.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyes changed, narrowed with thought, then he stood up and dumped his napkin on his beef and gravy.</p><p>\u201cSam, where are you going?\u201d Vicki asked.</p><p>\u201cI just realised I didn\u2019t do my essay,\u201d he called from the stairway before we all heard his bedroom door close.</p><p>Dad grinned and patted Mike on the shoulder.</p><p>Then, the conversation went on without me, while I pushed the food around on my plate. I just wanted to go upstairs and wait for David to come. Despite enjoying watching movies with Mike, I found myself checking the length of the shadows outside his window for most of the day\u2014just waiting for night to fall.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d Mike asked quietly, leaning closer.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I nodded, forcing a smile. \u201cI\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should get an early night.\u201d He pushed my fringe off my face.</p><p>Vicki held back a smile, watching us, then quickly looked at Dad.</p><p>\u201cYou do look a little tired,\u201d Mike added after a lengthy silence.</p><p>I stared into his face with narrowed eyes. I wasn\u2019t really tired at all. I just said that so I could excuse myself early to be with David. \u201cWell, I feel tired,\u201d I said, wondering if \u201cyou look tired\u201d was guy-speak for \u201cyou look hideously haggard. Go see a beautician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you head up now and take a shower?\u201d He nodded toward the archway. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re getting any closer to consuming your dinner by transforming it into a plate.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my canvas of mash and gravy. \u201cCan\u2019t yet. Gotta do the dishes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra\u2014\u201d Mike\u2019s brows lifted, sarcasm hovering in his tone. \u201cI\u2019ll do the dishes for you. Just go get some rest.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo way. You\u2019re a guest. Guests don\u2019t do dishes, right, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Dad looked at Mike, then shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not\u2014if he\u2019s offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad! You never side with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara, but Mike\u2019s not really a guest, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s practically family.\u201d</p><p>My mouth hung open, allowing only a breathy scoff to show my disapproval.</p><p>\u201cBesides, Ar, you always made me do the dishes at your old house,\u201d Mike added with a cheeky grin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d I bit my teeth together.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. \u2018Cause it...it just is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike scratched his eyelid and sighed. \u201cGo to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d I folded my arms; he merely glared at me with one brow arched and a look of intent behind his half smile. \u201cArgh, fine!\u201d I stood up, slapping my napkin on the placemat. \u201cYou\u2019re all traitors.\u201d</p><p>As I reached the stairs, Mike\u2019s laugh echoed out in response to some comment of Dad\u2019s\u2014probably about my mood swings.</p><p>Stuff it. As if I cared. They could have their little laugh\u2014maybe they\u2019d annoy me just enough to make me accept the offer to run away from all of them forever.</p><p>That\u2019d show \u2018em.</p><p>My room greeted me with the crisp scent of fresh linen under a diluted waft of coconut soap and strawberry shampoo. \u201cDavid? You in here?\u201d My gaze subconsciously flicked to the window; closed.</p><p>Maybe it was too early.</p><p>I took a shower, changed into some pyjamas and curled up in bed with a book. But I couldn\u2019t focus. That dream I had last night\u2014the ruby slippers, the bouquet, the look of acceptance on David\u2019s face as he backed away\u2014kept playing in my thoughts. And a gooey filling of dread burned a giant hole in my heart with its acid.</p><p>What if he wasn\u2019t coming back? What if he took me literally\u2014what if he thought I agreed with Fate\u2019s decision?</p><p>The book landed on its side between my bed and the wall as I jumped up and, with rather quick steps, walked to the window and threw open the curtains.</p><p>No. No way. He promised he\u2019d never leave without saying goodbye. He was just late, that was all.</p><p>In one sweep, I sent my orderly homework into a spread of disarray over my laundry-rug, then climbed over the wood top and tucked myself into a ball against the cold glass of the window.</p><p>Pale blue light filtered in from the world outside and lit the edges of my desk and bed, casting soft shadows across my floor. The streetlight below seemed to sing loneliness down onto the vacant sidewalk, and clouds hijacked the stars from the sky. There was nothing out there that resembled life tonight, and strangely, though my heart was beating, there was nothing here that much resembled it either.</p><p>With a long, dejected sigh, I lowered my head onto my knees and closed my eyes.</p><p>A loud chime set my heart ablaze with a start; I looked up from my knees, instantly regretting having moved my stiff neck. I rubbed the top of my spine and looked around my room, then down into the street below, counting the chimes I heard in my head.</p><p>One, tw\u2014There were only two. There should\u2019ve been more than that. I came to bed at seven. It couldn\u2019t be two in the morning.</p><p>My window was still shut fast into place, no sign of any vampire having entered, and as I rubbed the tingle of pins away from my toes, realisation sunk right into my heart. It really was two in the morning. David never came. He just left me here to fall asleep in the windowsill\u2014by myself, cold and alone.</p><p>I buried my head in my arms, holding back the tears. What did I do to him? Why didn\u2019t he come back to see me? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A tear rolled down past the tip of my nose and fell onto my thigh, trickling down into a salty pool on the windowsill.</p><p>It was the dream. It had to be. But that dream didn\u2019t mean anything, and he didn\u2019t even give me a chance to explain.</p><p>The gentle sobs of my heart breaking stopped abruptly when the door handle twisted and light spilled into my room, creeping in a yellow line along my floor, up my desk and over my toes. I rubbed my nose and eyes into my knees to dry the tears, feigning sleep.</p> <p>The deep, husky voice of my best friend reached me with a breath of concern. \u201cBaby girl, what\u2019re you doing asleep here?\u201d he whispered to no one in particular.</p><p>His wide, broad arms fixed a hold under my knees and around my back, then swept me off the windowsill, over the desk and into his body like he was some kind of ultra hot fireman rescuing me. I stayed floppy in his arms, breathing long and deep as if I were asleep, and the softness of my bed\u2014much warmer than the cold glass my elbow was leaning on\u2014cocooned my body safely, Mike tucking my feet under my quilt, bringing it up around my shoulders as I rolled away.</p><p>\u201cNight, baby.\u201d He pressed a quick kiss to my temple and left the room, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mike,\u201d I whispered quietly, allowing a smile to appear for one second before it melted away in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alive!\u201d Mike waved his hands dramatically as I zombie-walked into the kitchen and sat on the stool.</p> <p>\u201cBarely.\u201d I laid my head on my hands, watching Mike by the stove.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d He held up a spatula.</p><p>\u201cNot for plastic kitchen implements, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a comedian today, huh?\u201d He turned back to the stove, grinning. \u201cSo, are you hungry or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d I grabbed an apple and took a bite. \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s at school, Vicki\u2019s gone to the movies with her friend, and your dad\u2019s at work.\u201d Mike turned back and winked at me. \u201cIt\u2019s just us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, so, is that why you think it\u2019s acceptable to wear a pink apron?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, untying it. \u201cThought that might cheer you up a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I need cheering up?\u201d I turned my wrist over in question\u2014the apple still in hand.</p><p>\u201cAra, I know you better than you know yourself. You need cheer. So\u2014\u201d he grabbed the fry pan and tipped the contents onto two plates in front of me, \u201c\u2014I made your favourite. Pancakes!\u201d</p><p>I glared at him sceptically. \u201cIs there maple syrup?\u201d</p><p>Mike grinned, placing his hand on a bottle of brown liquid right by my elbow, and slid it slowly over. \u201cWould I forget the syrup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\u201d I snickered and snatched the bottle.</p><p>He walked around the counter and slid onto the stool next to me, dumping a fork by my plate. My attempt at moodiness slipped away completely, though, when the first bite of his light, fluffy pancakes touched my tongue. Like sugar-coated puffs of heaven, the golden exterior of the pan-fried breakfast melted with the syrup at the perfect ratio of sweet and savoury\u2014sending trickles of warm delight down my spine.</p> <p>I stopped eating and studied him\u2014the chef, the wonder-cook, the man who knew no failure.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, baby?\u201d Mike asked, mid-shovel.</p><p>Yeah, you\u2019re making it really hard not to love you. \u201cI uh\u2014I just remembered I have rehearsals today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRehearsals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. For a benefit concert we\u2019re doing to raise money for this kid who died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. What time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Mike sat taller, eagerness replacing his grin. \u201cWanna go for a run with me instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Actually, I\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Maybe we can make a picnic out of it. What\u2019d ya think?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and filled my gob again. \u201cYeah. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you wanna talk about it?\u201d Mike dropped to the grass by our picnic blanket and gulped a few swigs of water.</p><p>\u201cTalk...about...what?\u201d I huffed, letting my hands catch me on the ground, then rolled onto my back to watch the midday sun overhead.</p><p>Mike screwed the cap on his water bottle, swiped the sweat from his brow and leaned forward with his elbows draped over his hairy knees. \u201cThe reason I came in to find you asleep on your windowsill last night.\u201d</p><p>As if controlled by a body-stiffening remote, my limbs went long. I laid very still, suddenly no longer aware of my exhaustion. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that won\u2019t gel with me, baby.\u201d A bottle of water appeared over my face; I sat up on my elbows and took hold of it. \u201cYou need to talk, and whatever it is, you kn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business, Mike.\u201d I sat all the way up, unscrewed the lid and rolled the bottle to my lips, letting the cool liquid melt the heat in my throat. \u201cJust stay out of my room if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>He let out a short sigh, not an agitated or a hurt one, just more...frustrated. \u201cHere. Eat.\u201d</p><p>I studied the sandwich for a long breath, then snatched it with just a little too much hostility. \u201cThat won\u2019t work on me anymore, Mike!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra? Where are you going?\u201d Mike jumped up and ran after me as I headed toward the swing set across the park.</p><p>\u201cWherever you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I dumped the sandwich on the ground\u2014with a pang of regret\u2014and said, \u201cBecause I\u2019m not going to let you talk me into opening up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy giving you a sandwich?\u201d He stopped, making a point of laughing at me.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I looked at the discarded lunch. \u201cWhenever you want me to open up, you feed me. And it always works, but this is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fine.\u201d He held his arms out to the sides, still laughing. \u201cI won\u2019t ask. We\u2019ll just hang. \u2018Kay?\u201d</p><p>The sandwich stared up at me; I really wished I hadn\u2019t thrown it away. I wondered if maybe I could dust it off and eat it still. I knew I hadn\u2019t been eating enough the last few days because my arms and elbows looked so bony and pale that the scab David left from drinking my blood looked red and malicious.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d Mike went to touch my arm; I dropped it to my side, not having realised I was picking at the scab.</p><p>\u201cPush me on the swing?\u201d I said playfully.</p><p>The mask of concern dropped from his lips, but stayed in his eyes even as they lit with a smile. \u201cSure, baby.\u201d</p><p>And that was that. He didn\u2019t even mention my weird sleeping habits again\u2014or my mum, or David\u2014only Vicki and my relationship with her. But I assured him things were getting better, and he said they must be since I willingly called her \u201cMom\u201d the other day.</p><p>When the park emptied and a strong breeze swept half of our picnic away, we packed up and jumped in Dad\u2019s car, then headed home.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Mike asked, looking at my knees; I looked too. My legs were so stiff and rigid that my knees turned completely white.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I just\u2014I never really feel quite safe in cars, now. It\u2019s like, before, I knew they could crash and that they were dangerous, but now I know what that feels like, I don\u2019t feel so invincible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlind faith gone, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But you still have it.\u201d I nodded to the road. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel the fear of these deathly metal machines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m just one of the lucky ones, Ara, but the same could be said about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a real sense of what danger is now. I know that\u2019s a pitiful consolation, but at the same time, you\u2019re seventeen and you have an understanding about life that no other kids your age could. Cars are dangerous and people are blas\u00e9 about that power. I\u2019ve seen enough accidents in my time on the Force to know how little people value the power of these metal machines.\u201d</p><p>The car slowed as Mike flicked on the indicator and changed gears; muscle by muscle, my legs unclenched, and as we rolled at less than half the recommended speed limit, Mike turned his head and smiled at me warmly\u2014ignoring the honking horns from behind us.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>When we pulled up in the driveway at home, the engine going quiet, a finger appeared in my peripheral. \u201cMight wanna tie that up so you don\u2019t trip,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cUh, crud.\u201d I bent over my legs and twisted my lace into a bow, then looked up as the door popped open.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, unbuckling my seatbelt and jumping out. As the door closed after me, the look on Mike\u2019s face became apparent. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t yell at me for opening the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked at the car, then shrugged. \u201cGuess I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this new, grown-up you.\u201d</p><p>Deliberately scanning his broad shoulders, his proud, tall stance and school-boy grin, I said, \u201cAnd I like this new, hot-guy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself. I was joking.\u201d</p><p>He faked a pout and we walked up the fixed previously-broken porch step.</p><p>\u201cAfter you, my lady.\u201d He bowed, opening the door for me.</p><p>\u201cThank you, kind sir.\u201d I ducked through.</p><p>\u201cYou are more than welcome, my pretty friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d Dad said as he came down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good day?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Mike, then back at Dad. \u201cActually, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s good,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to unpack the car. I\u2019ll see you upstairs for a movie?\u201d Mike looked at me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d He walked away, and Dad\u2019s gaze seeped into my skin. \u201cWhat, Dad?\u201d I asked with a smile.</p><p>He leaned in, kissed my cheek and said, \u201cI\u2019m just happy to see you happy again.\u201d Then, he followed Mike into the kitchen, leaving me alone in the wake of his odd suggestion.</p><p>I was glad he\u2019d fallen for the illusion that I was happy; he needed it\u2014needed to relax a little and not worry so much that I was suicidal. And even though, right now, I could feel a small sliver of happiness, as I looked up to the coming night through the small window above the front door, I knew that feeling was fleeting.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>It might\u2019ve been a dream, but it was as close as I\u2019d been to him in two days; I rolled over in bed and flipped my pillow to the dry side, wiping the moist layer of ageing tears from my cheeks.</p><p>Outside, the thunder rolled again; it\u2019d been that way all night. Bad weather was brewing, but it hadn\u2019t the strength to burst out and become a storm. I didn\u2019t mind the thunder tonight, though, because I understood its pain\u2014how it felt as though it just couldn\u2019t get free\u2014to be where it was supposed to be. It was trapped, caged in by the wrong conditions.</p><p>I rolled over and watched the numbers change on my alarm clock, the gentle green glow reminding me of David\u2019s eyes. But each time I\u2019d fallen asleep tonight and opened my eyes after twenty minutes to see that glow, it only made me feel hollowed out, reminding me how his eyes looked in the dream I just woke from; he was scared, running\u2014trying to get away from something. Maybe from me. Maybe from the Set. I didn\u2019t know. All I knew was that he wasn\u2019t here and he never said goodbye. What if he\u2019d been arrested for hanging out with a human? What if they\u2019d read my History paper and were torturing him right now?</p><p>I sat up, clutching my pillow, my heart racing.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re up,\u201d Mike whispered softly, pushing my door open a crack. \u201cYou ready to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you wanna go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a long drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never mentioned leaving this early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He grinned, opening my door fully. \u201cI planned to wake you\u2014figured I\u2019d save my ears from all the whining last night about getting up early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d have whined?\u201d</p><p>Mike just raised his brows, rolling his head down a little.</p><p>\u201cOh, fine.\u201d I jumped out of bed. \u201cI\u2019ll get my bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight wanna put some clothes on, too.\u201d He nodded to my pyjamas and closed the door.</p><p>I threw on my bikini, shorts and a shirt, then slipped into my flip-flops and met Mike at the car\u2014dragging my feet the whole way.</p><p>We stopped off to grab an egg muffin from Macca\u2019s, then took to the highway, leaving this sleepy little town behind for the day. As the sun peeked out from the eastern hills, I rested my head on the window and tried not to fall asleep. \u201cSo, why are we going to a beach four hours away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d Mike shrugged, tossing his coffee cup into the brown paper bag our food came in. \u201cI liked the pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, I suppose,\u201d I said, then reached for the dial on the stereo. \u201cI wanna play that one again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked that?\u201d Mike put his window up as he spoke, and my cheeks tingled where my hair had been whipping my face.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, it\u2019s a little morbid\u2014for my tastes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. There\u2019s nothing morbid about Metallica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is about that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one song out of how many?\u201d</p><p>I stared up at him, not one ounce of care showing in my expression. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll play it again. But no more knocking the music,\u201d he warned with a joking air to his tone.</p><p>We arrived at the beach just as the Sunday sun woke the rest of the world. Mike parked Dad\u2019s car in the only empty space left near the boardwalk and wandered casually around to open my door.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d He bowed, offering his hand.</p> <p>\u201cMerci,\u201d I replied politely, returning the bow.</p><p>\u201cAh, so the boyfriend finally got you speaking French, too, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know he spoke French?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me for a second, his eyes falling on my silver locket. \u201cI just assumed, because of the uh\u2014\u201d He pointed to his own neck.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I touched the locket. \u201cYeah. He did\u2014does\u2014speak French.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mike said, sounding awfully cheery, \u201cIt suits you\u2014French. You should speak it more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I don\u2019t wanna learn it, then wake up one day and realise all the disgusting things you\u2019d been saying to those girls all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d His whole upper body jerked toward the heavens with his burly laugh. \u201cYeah. Second thoughts; don\u2019t learn French.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, folding my arms across my body as Mike walked to the trunk, flipping the keys around on his index finger.</p><p>\u201cNice beach, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, fussing about, pulling things out.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I turned and faced the coast, the gentle summer breeze greeting me to the day. Down by the water, families built sand castles and couples walked hand in hand, stopping to kiss and marvel at the horizon. I once had that fantasy\u2014to be right there, standing toes in the ocean with David, kissing as the sun went down, which made coming here with Mike feel kind of strange\u2014kind of...sad.</p> <p>\u201cWell, what\u2019re you waiting for?\u201d Mike offered his hand to the view before us. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You don\u2019t want help carrying all that?\u201d I nodded to the picnic basket, the blanket and a dozen other things.</p><p>He closed the trunk and shook his head. \u201cJust go, baby.\u201d</p><p>Without further encouragement, I pulled off my shorts and shirt, left them on the ground for Mike to grab on his way down, and flew to the call of the ocean, my feet barely touching the sand before I hit the whitewash with the grace of an elephant. The waves enveloped my ankles, cooling the burns on the balls of my feet, leaving behind a tingle, like sherbet mixed with cola, as they receded.</p><p>I could almost believe I was back home in Perth. And even with my eyes closed, unable to see the origins of the noise around me, I could feel the brightness of the day, filling me with the hope that some things in life were still normal. I placed my hands to my knees and bent closer to the water to catch the light breeze coming off it, feeling my toes sink into the soft, grainy sand as the waves swam back out to sea.</p><p>\u201cYou still look like a little girl\u2014standing there in that rainbow bikini.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes to the portrait of summer and Mike\u2019s arm around my waist. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not a little girl anymore, Mike.\u201d I pushed his hand off my skin.</p><p>\u201cI know. I just thought you looked cute, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t do cute,\u201d I said sarcastically, but a band of \u2018gullsters\u2019 beside us drowned out my retort with their hideous squawking. I jumped inside a little, clutching my locket. \u201cGod, I\u2019m not used that sound anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrat!\u201d Mike said, waving his hand at the gulls. \u201cGet outta here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare kick that bird.\u201d I grabbed his arm as he stalked toward them.</p><p>\u201cI never actually hit them, Ara. I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, what if you did? By accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would apologise...profusely.\u201d He bowed his head. \u201cBut you know what I wouldn\u2019t apologise for?\u201d The corners of his eyes sharpened as he smiled and leaned slowly closer, then, the world came out from under me; I flew through the air, landing on my back in a massive, cool splash, with Mike\u2019s hand catching the base of my neck before my head went under water.</p><p>I opened my mouth to yell, gurgling the salty burn of a wave down my nose and throat instead. \u201cYou asshole!\u201d I coughed, sitting up as he jumped back. \u201cI\u2019m so gonna get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to catch me first.\u201d He started running.</p><p>I hesitated only for a moment; we both knew I\u2019d never catch him, but it was damn well worth a try.</p><p>Each time I reached for him, he darted out of the way\u2014like we were both south poles on a magnet, but at last, I managed to grasp the rim of his shirt; I closed my fingers around it, wearing a victory grin for only the breath it took him to roll his shoulders, leaving me, and the shirt, face down in the sand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to do better than that, baby.\u201d He laughed boisterously.</p><p>I pushed up on my hands and sat hugging my knees, hiding my face in my arms. Sand was stuck to the water all over my body, making me feel like a crumbed steak. Well, it was time this steak got a little revenge!</p><p>\u201cAra, you okay? Did I hurt you?\u201d Mike asked, leaning over me.</p><p>Wrong move. He didn\u2019t even see it coming; I grabbed the back of his neck and pushed the entire force of my shoulder into his chest, rolling his head under my arm as I flipped him into the water. His weight came as a shock. He never used to be that heavy. But he went down hard, wetting my legs, arms, shoulders, and the kid a meter down from us, as the water exploded out from under him.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, clasping his hands over his belly, taking a breath after a wave receded. \u201cGirl; one. Guy; nothing.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, an impish grin making my eyes small, wondering if I should point out that we both knew he let me flip him. \u201cWell, you taught me that move, oh-wise-Master.\u201d I sat down on the edge of the ocean. \u201cYou should be weary of your students; they usually supersede you.\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his stomach and smiled at me, the magic of the ocean lighting him like a happy feeling. He seemed more alive, more spirited, sort of...free here. He belonged on the beach, with the sand and the blue skies.</p><p>\u201cWhat ya thinkin\u2019?\u201d He jumped up, ruffling his hair into a mess as he landed beside me.</p><p>\u201cI was just remembering home.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cThinking how easy all this is. Like, sometimes, when I\u2019m with you, I forget they\u2019re gone.\u201d I wrapped my arms around my legs and linked my fingers together. \u201cThe sunlight, the beach, all of this stayed with you when I left, and now you\u2019re here...it\u2019s like you\u2019ve brought it all back with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged again. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna lose that when you go.\u201d</p><p>He gave a gentle smile and let his elbows hang loosely over his knees. \u201cYou know it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I dragged out each vowel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His smile dissolved. \u201cI just miss you, too, you know. I went to the beach a few weeks ago\u2014watched the storm come in across the bay, and it didn't feel the same without you.\u201d</p><p>I half smiled, allowing memories in. \u201cDid you sit on the fishing jetty while it was raining?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded, dusting a line of yellow sand off his shin. \u201cBut I just didn't get it anymore. It was just cold and I felt silly.\u201d</p><p>I drew a really long breath; the salt in the ocean was so strong I could almost taste it, as if the air were made of sand, brushing the back of my tongue each time I swallowed. Even though this beach wasn\u2019t nearly as pretty as the one back home, it was good to feel the crisp water and the weight of my body sink into the sand again.</p><p>But the heat reminded me of the truth, because, while the sun may have burned into the side of my face like a hot iron, the breeze was icy and strong\u2014not humid and wet, like home. It was nature\u2019s truth, and it screamed out so clearly that autumn was coming, and that David would be gone for good.</p><p>I ran some of the cool ocean water over my cheek, and the heat dissipated with a soft tingle.</p><p>\u201cThis looks better,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cDon't!\u201d I spun my face away from his cold, wet touch.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Ara. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d He leaned around and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I frowned, touching my jaw. \u201cYou just startled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still defensive about those scars?\u201d</p><p>I lifted one shoulder and dropped it again.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hideous.\u201d I looked away, fighting back tears.</p><p>\u201cHideous?\u201d Mike\u2019s voice trailed up. \u201cAra, you can barely see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you touch them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...the sun was reflecting off the water beads on your skin. It looked pretty. Like little diamonds. I just wanted to touch you.\u201d</p><p>And I just wanted to run away. In my mind, the scars had faded to an almost invisible memory. When I looked in the mirror, I never even noticed them anymore; tiny little dots covering one side of my face and neck, silvery and very indistinct. But Mike noticing them made me feel uncovered and monstrous\u2014like they were all over me.</p><p>\u201cAra. I\u2019m serious. They\u2019re barely visible.\u201d He shuffled closer and turned my face. \u201cYou\u2019re still just the same beautiful girl you\u2019ve always been.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s where he was wrong. I wasn\u2019t the same. Nothing about me was the same. Not on the outside and not from the inside.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike called as I stood and walked down the beach, dusting sand off my butt.</p><p>No one understood. No one could possibly understand. He didn\u2019t see the scars because he didn\u2019t want to see them. But they were there. They would forever be there as a reminder of who I used to be\u2014who I had tried so hard not to be anymore.</p><p>I wandered past a little girl with dark hair sitting by a lumpy-looking sand castle, carefully placing shells around it in a swervey pattern. She smiled at me, her little face so warm and honest I smiled back, even though I didn\u2019t want to. I was just like her once, and it made me insanely jealous of the normal life she had\u2014that everyone had, even Mike. No one could possibly know the demons I faced; not the ones from my past and not the physical ones that had left me alone\u2014scarred in my heart, just living out my days, waiting for death.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Mike\u2019s hand clasped my arm; I stopped walking with a jolt. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away from me like that. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d The venom in my tone made the little girl look up from her bucket and spade.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Ara? You know how beautiful you are. Why would you pretend you don't?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think I'm doing? Pretending?\u201d I turned away. \u201cGod, you\u2019re so insensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, baby,\u201d he called. \u201cIt\u2019s just...I just don't get it. You can't even see the scars. I\u2019d have to know they were there to notice them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you lie to me?\u201d I spun around.</p><p>\u201cBaby. I\u2019m not.\u201d He stepped into me and his eyes narrowed as he studied my face\u2014tracing the curve of my jaw where only David\u2019s eyes had previously been allowed. \u201cDo you still see them there? Honestly?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, turning my face away.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. I...I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I think it might be some kind of psychosis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I frowned up at him.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you see when you look in the mirror, but all I see is perfect white skin on the face of the prettiest girl in the world.\u201d</p><p>I touched my scars with my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He gently grabbed my wrist and pushed my hand down from my face. \u201cI promise, on my own future grave, you have completely healed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I whimpered in a breaking voice, keeping my eyes on my toes.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mike\u2019s shoulders dropped enough for me to see it through my peripheral.</p><p>Then, even with the warm sun, the salty air, and all the families around us, I felt the rise of pain I\u2019d held in\u2014the pain I never got to share with Mike\u2014bubbling up in my chest, then my throat, like an aching blockage of air. I needed him to hold me; I needed him to make everything okay. \u201cI\u2019ve needed you here so, so badly, Mike.\u201d My lashes burned on the edges as hot tears filled my eyes and the beach disappeared into a blur.</p><p>\u201cAra, baby\u2014\u201d He caught me against his chest, the rough sand scratching my jaw. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed you, Mike. I needed you,\u201d I sobbed almost inaudibly. \u201cAll this time, and you haven't been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh baby, I wanted to be here. I just\u2014I thought you hated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d I sobbed harder. \u201cI'm so sorry, Mike. I did.\u201d</p><p>He clicked his tongue. \u201cOh, baby, what has life done to you?\u201d</p><p>The little girl by the water stared at me as her mother grabbed her by the wrist and quickly led her away. And I didn\u2019t care if I scared families off. The funny thing about breaking down is that you can\u2019t choose when to do it\u2014it just hits you like a storm; a flash of heat, an overpowering surge of anger, and then\u2014the pouring rain. I was just glad Mike was finally here to shelter me from it all.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s okay,\u201d he spoke softly to someone behind me. \u201cShe lost her mum recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, poor dear,\u201d an elderly-sounding lady said. She said something else, but I didn\u2019t hear. Mike pressed my face tightly against his bare chest\u2014causing a sort of unintentional vacuum seal over my ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sobs slowed and I scratched the salt away from my cheek as I looked up at him. \u201cYou really can\u2019t tell my face is horrifically scarred?\u201d His opinion mattered to me more than almost anyone else\u2019s\u2014even more than David\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He held both my arms and leaned back a little. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell at all. You are perfect, just like you were before. You still have flawless, tight, smooth skin. Okay? So, stop feeling so bad about yourself, baby.\u201d He bent his knees so his eyes came in line with mine. \u201cYou are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and ran my fingers over the scars. It was hard to even feel the slight bumps anymore; they used to feel like little pins rising up from under my skin. \u201cI hate looking at myself, you know. I don\u2019t look like me anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou look the same to me. Maybe a little older\u2014wiser, even.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI really missed you, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really miss Mum and Harry, too.\u201d I looked at the water, trying to stop the memory of their faces; \u201cI keep thinking I\u2019m just gonna go home and they\u2019ll be there, you know, like always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you don\u2019t want to move back with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never said that, Mike. Okay? Look, you just came in and, out of the blue, on the first day you get here, tell me you love me\u2014no mind for the fact that I have a boyfriend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Mike said. \u201cAra, you knew him for a day before you decided you were in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not. It took me ages to decide that.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cA week then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I jerked forward, pointing to his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me I was being silly for not following my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to say? Forget him, he doesn\u2019t like you, he\u2019s just pretending? I\u2019m your friend. I care about you. I wanted you to be happy.\u201d He dropped one hand to his side. \u201cI just never thought you\u2019d actually believe you were in love with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBelieve I\u2019m in love with him? What would you know about it? You don\u2019t even know your own heart.\u201d I shrugged out of his grasp. \u201cYou think you love me...but you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra\u2014\u201d Mike reached out, warning me of the staring people around us with a look in his eye.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t care if they look. Let them look. I\u2019m not going to stand here while you tell me what\u2019s in my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop trying to touch me.\u201d I jerked away from him. \u201cI do love David, Mike. I do. You have no idea how much\u2014and you never will,\u201d I added coldly and folded my arms as I turned away.</p><p>\u201cOh, never, huh?\u201d He followed, raising his voice as much as I had. \u201cSo this freaky, overly-possessive thing you have with David\u2014is that true love, is it\u2014is that how it works?\u201d he asked in a conceited tone. \u201cSo, when you love someone more than anyone in the world has ever loved anyone else before, you let them hurt you and leave bruises on you?\u201d</p><p>I huffed.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t see that cut on your wrist, Ara.\u201d</p> <p>My steps came to an abrupt halt; I unfolded my arms and looked down at my left wrist.</p><p>\u201cYes. I saw it!\u201d His voice became huskier. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t do that. I know you better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid did it. Didn\u2019t he?\u201d He came up out of nowhere, spinning me around sharply and held my wrist up. \u201cIs this what love is, Ara? Is it? Because I love you more than this. I would never hurt you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me now.\u201d I twisted my wrist in his grip and yanked it out through his fingers. \u201cJust leave me alone, okay? I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d he called.</p><p>Forget it. I didn\u2019t need to stand there and have him tell me I knew nothing about love; I\u2019d felt its spiny sting\u2014I knew exactly what it was. Mike was just worried because he thought David hurt me. But of course he did; love is pain. And maybe it was wrong of David and I to do what we did, but it felt right in the moment, so I didn\u2019t care what Mike thought. Not that he\u2019d know it was blood sharing, anyway. In fact, I actually couldn\u2019t even imagine what he thought David had done to me.</p><p>\u201cAra. Stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said leave me alone, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said from a few feet away. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you walk off by yourself. You\u2019re a young girl in a bikini, for God\u2019s sake. Anything could happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, because I\u2019m walking on such a deserted strip of sand?\u201d I faced him, gesturing to all the beach-goers.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be alone to have something bad happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said conceitedly, because it was the bad things that made you end up alone.</p><p>\u201cLook, you can walk off and throw your little tantrum, but I\u2019m going to follow you wherever you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Across the carpet of sunburned backs and multi-coloured towels, the salty, plastic smell of sunscreen wafted between us, and even in the brightness of the day, the compassion in his eyes shone out like a beacon among the darkest sea. The last of my dummy-spit released with a huff, and I dropped my hands to my sides.</p><p>Damn him and his kind eyes.</p><p>All I wanted then was to fall back into his arms\u2014back to where we stood before\u2014before I yelled at him and told him he knows nothing. \u201cMike, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d He shook his head and launched forward into a half run, sweeping me into him. \u201cYou don't need to say a word, baby. Okay?\u201d</p><p>The hot sun beat down, making sweat trickle down my temples, but I closed my eyes and held my breath in the intense squeeze of his arms\u2014a hold so tight I knew he never wanted to let go, knew he loved me. Not like he loved the ocean or the sunset, but like the way I loved David. True, honest, and intense love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara. I know you love David, and I know he loves you. I shouldn\u2019ta said those things. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d He brushed my hair from my face, then lifted my locket for a second. \u201cI love you, too. I really do. I love the way your eyes turn deep blue when you\u2019re sad; the way you bite your lip when you play piano; I love your smile and the way you view the world, Ara. I absolutely love everything about you.\u201d He paused and his eyes darted over my face. \u201cI just wish you could understand that\u2014wish you\u2019d forgive me for making the biggest mistake I ever made\u2014and love me back.\u201d</p><p>I folded my face against his chest again; the sand had dried in the heat, soothing the itch along my jaw, and the sound of his heart through the thick of his skin had an oddly comforting hum to it. I could tell from the way he took shallower breaths that he was waiting for me to say something. But I couldn\u2019t grace him with a response, because I had nothing good to say to him. He could never understand the love I had with David, or the way we interacted with each other, and he probably thought I was sadistic for allowing David to hurt me, but he\u2019d never understand the true intensity of the passion behind it, either.</p><p>Slowly, and more surely than ever before, I was starting to consider going with David.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>No one even looked up as I stepped into the auditorium and dumped my bag by a chair. \u201cHi, guys,\u201d I said, unwinding my scarf from my neck.</p><p>\u201cHey, stranger,\u201d Spencer called from the stage.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Emily said as I sat beside her in the front row.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been, girl?\u201d Ryan landed in the next seat and gave me a skinny-armed hug.</p><p>\u201cJust hanging out at home.\u201d I sat back in the chair. \u201cGood turnout for a rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded, her eyes on a notepad. \u201cMost of them are just here to watch\u2014or distract those who are trying to practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe have to be out by ten, but no one\u2019s taking things seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I slid down in the seat and put my feet on the crate in front of me. \u201cWell, do you mind if I take the stage now\u2014I gotta get back early tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Emily said to her page. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Except, I didn\u2019t really want to be around this place any longer than absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s David? Is he coming tonight?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>Emily looked up from her book; I shrugged, reaching for my locket.</p><p>\u201cOh, I thought he said he\u2019d make it for dress rehearsals.\u201d Ryan looked a little confused.</p><p>\u201cHe did\u2014\u201d I tipped the crate with my foot, trying to look disinterested, \u201c\u2014but I guess the plan changed.\u201d Or the heart.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your new pal...Mike?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, he\u2019s taking my brother to a movie tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d Ryan nodded. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll fill in on guitar for David, if you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s just get this over with then.\u201d I gave a reassuring smile to Emily\u2019s frown as I stomped up the stairs, then stopped dead. \u201cHey, where\u2019d the piano come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s on loan from Musicology,\u201d Emily called out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Musicology?\u201d I sat down on the stool in front of the baby grand, flipping out imaginary jacket tails first.</p><p>\u201cMusic store,\u201d Ryan said, walking past me to grab his guitar.</p><p>\u201cOh, cool. The keys feel nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait \u2018til you hear her.\u201d Ryan sat on a stool near Alana, who turned the pages on her music stand. \u201cWe\u2019re calling her Betty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalling who Betty?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe piano,\u201d Alana said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked at it. \u201cWhy Betty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe song...\u201d Alana said, rolling her eyes in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cBlack Betty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I looked down at my fingers as they positioned themselves on the home-plates. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll start with Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded and found the page in his sheet music, then repositioned the capo on the neck of his guitar. \u201cHip, bubbly, Ucayali-style or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonging misery,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ryan nodded. \u201cNice. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>They played, all of them, including the version of me who took over when the real one could no longer bear to feel. In those moments, sometimes I felt like I was watching from outside myself, while another version of me lived inside my own mind\u2014recreating this land of misery to a world where I could smile. I tried so hard to imagine David sitting in place of Ryan, smiling over at me. But no matter how hard I tried, the image wouldn't alter, and wishing with all my heart wouldn't change things either. It would be a waste of time.</p><p>Ryan gave a nod of approval, and I smiled back because, in truth, our song did sound amazing. The three instruments harmonised so well with each other, even though my fingers were a little stiff and the flow of emotion through them was rigid, if not absent.</p><p>When I opened my mouth to sing the words, my voice cracked and we all burst out laughing. All the sea-salt I swallowed the other day made my throat dry and hoarse; I sounded like a broken gramophone. But I was glad Mike took me to the beach, because despite our argument, the rest of that day went really well; just two old friends hanging out, eating salty fish and chips, talking about nothing, as the sun went down.</p><p>While my mind wandered into the other days we\u2019d spent together, the performance moved to the next song on our list; an instrumental piece from one of Nathan\u2019s favourite gangster movies.</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d I stopped playing for a second.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He looked over the music stand, and Alana lowered her violin.</p><p>\u201cOn that last bar, can you give me a B flat, instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014yeah, okay,\u201d he said slowly and frowned, but did it anyway, and then his face lit up when I came in with the piano.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Cool, so, just remember; B flat on the second verse, okay?\u201d I said, flexing my fingers. \u201cEm? You got the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yep,\u201d she said from the base of the stage. \u201cEight-thirty.\u201d</p><p>I closed the cover on the keys. \u201cI\u2019m gonna call it quits, guys. I need to get home.\u201d Mike would be back by now.</p><p>\u201cOkay, cool.\u201d Ryan placed his guitar on the stand and turned to Alana.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara?\u201d Emily\u2019s light footsteps made a dull thud as she came up the stairs and stood beside me. \u201cUm, I hope you don't mind, but...being that your act has the most heart, I thought I might place you last in the set\u2014you know, kind of thought if people leave on a sad note\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, all cool.\u201d I held my hand up. Em obviously didn't realise that closing a show was actually a great honour.</p><p>\u201cAnd, um, that sounded amazing, by the way.\u201d She ran her fingertip over the glossy top of the piano, her reflection appearing upside-down.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Looks like I still have enough soul left in me to play music.\u201d I smiled, trying to sound light.</p><p>\u201cYou miss David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Kinda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back.\u201d She shrugged, then smiled and walked off to bark orders at the next act.</p><p>It really was such a shame David never fell for Emily. She would\u2019ve been a perfect match for him; she wasn\u2019t complicated or moody, like me, and she would\u2019ve given him eternity.</p><p>A jaded smile grasped my lips while I watched her, falling into Spencer\u2019s embrace, tilting her face up so he could kiss the tip of her nose; they were so in love, like normal teenagers\u2014so innocent and so easy. They\u2019d never know the complexities of my life, and could never even imagine them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somehow, that made me angry, or maybe it was jealous. Or maybe it just made me feel more\u2014alone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all bad.\u201d Ryan sat beside me on the piano stool.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not?\u201d I switched on my happy face.</p> <p>He elbowed me softly. \u201cDavid? I know you were missing him just now.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my thumbnails, clicking them over each other. \u201cYeah. I kinda was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019ll be back before you know it. So, chin up, m\u2019kay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cThanks Ryan.\u201d But he was wrong. We were just another town David was moving through, and I was just another ending to a tragic love story. None of us would ever see him again.</p><p>I scribbled on a piece of paper and rested it in the lip of my windowsill, then headed for the door. I couldn\u2019t leave my room for the evening without making sure David knew my priorities, should he see fit to come back; one tap on Mike\u2019s window and I\u2019d magically materialise in my room.</p> <p>\u201cSo, how was rehearsal?\u201d Mike closed the DVD drive and grabbed the remote as I shut his bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cCrowded.\u201d But lonely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing you play.\u201d</p><p>I bounced onto his bed and propped my back against his pillows. \u201cI wish you were doing a duet with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we\u2019ll have to sneak over to the school during lunch and use the piano one day.\u201d His face lit with a cheeky grin as he slumped down next to me\u2014right on top of the popcorn bowl, scattering it across the sheets, like pebbles on tiles.</p><p>\u201cAh, crap!\u201d We both cursed.</p> <p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll get that.\u201d Mike knelt by the bed, took the bowl from me, and started scraping the salty snack off the edge with his broad, square palms.</p><p>He\u2019d always had such big hands. So strong and protective. Like somehow, if he was holding me and the world was burning around me, I wouldn\u2019t be afraid.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, kid?\u201d He looked up.</p><p>Forgetting his question, I grabbed his hand and turned it over, placing my palm against his, feeling the salt of popcorn all over the tips of his fingers. My hands were thinner, more petite than his, the top of my oval-shaped nail only just falling in line with the first fold of his fingertips. \u201cI missed your hands.\u201d</p><p>He laced his fingers through mine, then flipped our hands over and traced circles over my knuckles, seeming distant, almost sad.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Mike?\u201d</p><p>He moved the popcorn bowl to the nightstand and shuffled up to sit beside me. \u201cYou have her hands, you know? Your mum\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I tucked my arm under my rib and snuggled against his chest. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>I had a lot of my mother in me; her hair, her heart-shaped face. But I got my dad\u2019s eyes. Harry had her eyes. Harry had her smile\u2014my smile. But they were gone. The only thing left from that life now was Mike\u2014and I was so glad I at least had him.</p><p>It made me wonder\u2014about his hands\u2014how they made me feel so safe, and his eyes, how every thought behind them placed me first, and that smile, the way it\u2019d warm my heart, making me a part of his world every time he gave it to me, without fail\u2014if I went with him to Perth, would it always be like this? Would we be happy, get married and have little dark-haired babies with caramel-coloured eyes and strong hands? I liked the idea\u2014liked the idea of always feeling like this; loved.</p><p>Mike looked down at me, watching my eyes expectantly, like he was waiting for me to say what he knew was in my heart. But, after a quiet moment, he pulled me back to his chest and pressed play on the remote.</p><p>As the opening credits rolled across the base of the screen, I closed my eyes and listened to the hum of human normality. I loved it\u2014loved Mike, and I wished I could tell him that. Wished he knew. We\u2019d laid like this so many times as friends, but in his arms, tonight, I felt the difference\u2014felt his love, felt how real it was. And it drove a strong urge within me to look up at him and say, \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. Let\u2019s go home to Perth.\u201d</p><p>But I knew that when the movie ended, and I crawled away from the warmth of his arms and went back to my cold, empty room, I\u2019d look beyond the eastern hills, feeling the inexplicable gut wrench that made me want to scream to the world below\u2014tell them to find David, beg him to come back and change me into a vampire.</p><p>My desires were at odds with my heart, and the war raged inside me, unresolvable still.</p><p>I could give my heart to Mike tonight, but if David so much as passed me on the street, ever again, I\u2019d throw it away. I was sure of that. So, I said nothing. Just closed my eyes and played it out as a fantasy instead\u2014imagining my life with him from this exact moment onward. And I smiled.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike swept his hands through the front of my hair, his low voice coming from above my brow.</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d I muttered sleepily, keeping my eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cYou still with me, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He kissed my head and the volume on the TV decreased. \u201cJust sleep.\u201d</p><p>The smell of morning and the crass sound of a crow somewhere outside brought my mind back from sleep. I rolled up on my elbows and looked around the room\u2014my room.</p><p>Wait, my room?</p><p>Feeling as though I was holding my breath, I clarified everything in my mind; my room was dark, the curtains closed\u2014obviously by Mike; unopened by David. The house sounded quieter than usual. Even the gentle hum of cars and the distant chatter of school kids outside was absent from the day; it almost sounded like a Saturday, but without the lawnmower.</p><p>Last night, while I fell asleep in my best friend\u2019s arms, a few things became so clear to me that I was afraid clarity would be gone come morning. But the feeling I had as sleep arrested me remained the same.</p><p>I jumped out of bed, dashed my curtains across and looked to the eastern hills. Somewhere over that rise, somewhere further than I cared to imagine, my David went away. I could feel him; feel his soul aching beyond the rising sun. He never told me where he lived, or even which direction he ran to each night, but I could feel him over there\u2014somewhere.</p><p>Down below, nestled into the long, yellow-tipped grass in the backyard, the oak tree sat gloriously, staring back up at me. As many times as we\u2019d studied each other, I had also let my heart skip a beat, expecting to see David beneath its leafy bows. But, for some reason, as I watched the gentle motion of the rope swing, absently touching the brittle bark for a second before floating along the wistful breeze, I felt none of the surprise, the ache, that he wasn\u2019t there. The only thing present in my heart was that warm feeling I had in Mike\u2019s arms last night, which suddenly burned into a flaming heat.</p><p>With a tight fist, I rubbed my chest and grabbed the edge of my desk to remain upright. Was it possible that Mike managed to crawl his way a little bit deeper into my heart while I was sleeping? Could it be possible that my brain finally understood the fact that David was gone\u2014that even tomorrow, when I looked for him on the stage where he should be performing our duet, I wouldn\u2019t see him? Did I finally get the message?</p><p>I backed away from the window, clutching my locket, and turned to face my dresser mirror, studying the girl staring back at me. \u201cHe is gone, isn\u2019t he?\u201d she said. Well, I think she did, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And I knew he wouldn\u2019t return for anything. Not for the concert, not for all the tears in the world, not if Skittles got stuck in the tree, and not even if I threw myself from the window and splattered all over the ground.</p><p>David Knight was gone\u2014for good.</p><p>But I didn't feel anything. Nothing. I should\u2019ve be crying or kicking things. The admission of fact should\u2019ve changed something in me. Anything. But it didn\u2019t.</p><p>The girl in the mirror looked out at me; I looked away. That reflection told a different story to the reality of the world behind me. My room was light and airy, with the softness of summer morning all around, while her world\u2014the world beyond the glass\u2014was a dark forest, backdrop to the face of this lonely girl, trapped, staring out from beyond her prison of secrets. Love was the key\u2014my starry night, my David\u2014but he left.</p><p>I remembered back to the day I first thought of him as the night, and how, in that same thought, I smiled for Mike because he was always my blue sky; my happiness.</p><p>In the mirror, the contours of the girl\u2019s face became shadowed as the sun rose around her, light touching the darkest shadows of her illusory cage. The iron bars behind her dissolved into white tree trunks, and the leaves became visible as green star-shaped foliage for the first time.</p><p>Blue sky. The night was gone now, but there would always be the blue sky.</p><p>But was it enough?</p><p>I looked away from her again, seeing her hopeful smile dissolve before I turned my head. The roar of thunder all around me became the obvious call of the ogre; I clutched my hand across my belly and listened to his cries for nourishment. The last thing I wanted was to go downstairs and have breakfast with Mike. The feeling, the desire to hold onto him, to make sure I never lost him like I did David, burned in me; I was sure I\u2019d tell him I love him and ruin everything when I changed my mind again as the night descended.</p><p>I needed to think. I needed to let it all sink in. I felt catatonic, empty, hollow. Afraid, because the feeling in me\u2014of not feeling anything\u2014felt like suddenly waking up deaf.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d the girl in the mirror said.</p><p>\u201cRun?\u201d I looked back at her.</p><p>She smiled and nodded. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>A sneaky tempo guided my steps as I passed the dining area where Vicki and Mike sat laughing and drinking coffee. Then, without first eating, bolted out the front door.</p><p>My shoes tapped the pavement softly at first, but as I reached the end of the drive, they picked up. I zipped my sweater around my neck\u2014trapping my locket inside. It wasn\u2019t cold, but for some reason I felt exposed and naked. Like I was being watched or followed. I think a part of me knew that if Mike caught a glimpse of me running from the house without him, he\u2019d come after me. And I really didn\u2019t want that. I really needed to be by myself for a while.</p><p>There was a part of me that kept trying to believe the reason David hadn\u2019t come was because he\u2019d been held up at work or hadn\u2019t realised how much time had passed since we last spoke. But the part of me that knew David also knew he wasn\u2019t that absentminded.</p><p>Fact was, he wasn\u2019t here because he had no intention of coming back.</p><p>Feeling unbelievably weak and tired, I beelined for a park bench and graced the seat with my bottom. The leafy shade of the tree felt nice, almost protective. I looked around the park at the children playing in the distance\u2014the moms and dads pushing their kids on the swings, and even the big sisters running to their little brother\u2019s aide when they fell over or got sand in their mouths. It made me miss Harry\u2014miss being a big sister.</p><p>I flopped back on the backrest with my chin tilted to the cool breeze and let my troubles consume me. The only moisture left in me now was the salty, sticky mask of sweat the wind was drying off my brow. I still loved the way a breeze felt on my face, though; it took a month for my wounds to heal enough that I\u2019d let Dad take me in public\u2014on a plane, over to his home. My days were spent in a motel, in the dark\u2014away from civilisation. I never even let Mike see me. Dad tried to let him in once, but I screamed and freaked out like I was going to tear myself apart. I couldn\u2019t let him see me like that. I felt so ashamed\u2014felt like a monster, and worse\u2014looked like one.</p><p>By the time Dad brought me here, there were only a few yellowing bruises left, and I could bear the wind on my face\u2014never to take it for granted again. It brushed my hair over my cheek in a tickly touch, like a thousand butterflies dancing on my skin, and in the simplicity of the sunny day, surrounded by trees and grass, I could almost imagine I had no problems. Even the song of the birds seemed to have a tune to it, like I was in some twisted version of a Disney film. I half expected the woodland animals to gather at my feet as I broke into song.</p><p>For the first time in weeks, I lowered my head and took a good look at my fingers. They were my mum\u2019s hands, but they were bony and looked weak now. Heartache had taken the spirit from them, and though I wanted nothing more than to find the nearest piano and expel the song I\u2019d had stuck in my head all morning, I wondered if I could truly play\u2014for the feel of it\u2014from the heart, anymore.</p><p>I slumped back on the bench again. I didn\u2019t even know what was in my heart now. I used to be sure it was Mike, then it knew nothing but David.</p><p>Now they seemed to share a little piece each.</p><p>When my stomach growled again, I checked the watch Sam gave me for my fifteenth birthday\u2014the sport watch he told me was to help time my runs so I\u2019d realise I wasn\u2019t as fast as I thought\u2014and smiled, unable to see the time through a sudden rush of tears. He was a good little brother\u2014Sam. As much as I hated him sometimes, he was my brother. And in my heart, I\u2019d never really let myself believe that. But I was still a big sister, and though no one would ever replace Harry, I knew that if anything ever happened to Sam, he\u2019d be just as irreplaceable.</p><p>And that\u2019s the thing about love, really, isn\u2019t it? That there is no replacing the ones we love. I\u2019d never replace David\u2014not even with Mike.</p><p>Suddenly, the rise of emotion I should\u2019ve had this morning when I finally admitted David wasn\u2019t coming back, presented itself\u2014screaming out from my heart in the form of a song.</p><p>A vibrant, tingling sensation warmed my fingertips; like static electricity before it charges out on something metal.</p><p>I jumped up, ignoring the dizziness and narrowed vision of low blood-pressure, and ran for the school.</p><p>I needed to play.</p><p>The dark room echoed as the door closed behind me and the shadows swallowed me whole. No one looked up; no one turned their heads, because the only sentinel was the pitch black. Everyone was at lunch, the auditorium set for the concert tomorrow night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I kicked the door ajar a little, placed the doorstop in the crack and hugged myself as I headed down the aisle, walking the path of the thin blue line of light from outside. The warmth of the day remained behind, making me shiver as I reached the stage. I looked back for a moment, seeing only a faint outline of the seats along the aisle, then felt my way up the stairs, keeping my hands out in front of me in case I tripped.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-hello?\u201d I waited in the middle of the stage, hearing nothing. No one whispered back. \u201cHello? Is anyone there?\u201d My voice stayed low, almost as if I didn\u2019t want an answer.</p> <p>All around me, the shadows carried eerie secrets, like a person may be lingering within\u2014waiting for me\u2014while the strong feel of being watched crawled over my skin, tightening my pores. I knew I shouldn\u2019t be in here. Knew I should be at lunch, be attending school today like everyone else. I hesitated a moment longer. If I was caught in here, I\u2019d be in trouble.</p><p>But, like a beacon of salvation, the piano greeted me with all its glory, sitting majestically centre stage. I took a seat and looked down at my hands on the keys. Here, in front of the piano, I felt narrowed in\u2014safe inside some magical, invisible orb, where no one could see me. For one moment I just needed to sit; just to exist in the space where music was the centre of my world; where the only thing that mattered was the notes, the keys, and me.</p><p>My heart was trying to make sense of things\u2014of the fact that David left me because I had that stupid dream, even though I had no control over it. And I guess, in a way, that was the problem; what we dream does have meaning. What we think, feel, desire\u2014it matters. And it hurts.</p><p>But life taught me that searching for reasons why it sucks is as futile as screaming out to the heavens \u201cWhy, God, why?\u201d</p><p>No one will ever answer, because there is no answer. No one is watching from above; no angels are standing by to answer our prayers. We are the authors of our own lives, and what we suffer is due to our own error. How we endure is determined by our will to survive.</p> <p>I would survive this. I had to stop asking, had to stop wondering if there was some point to all this\u2014some lesson to be learned\u2014because, in doing that, I was holding myself back from moving on.</p><p>David told me to move on\u2014told me to love another, but contradicted that by being hurt at the possibility.</p><p>My heart was Mike\u2019s before I came here\u2014before it all happened. And, sometimes, I wished I\u2019d never met David at all\u2014wished I didn\u2019t know what it felt like to love someone that way.</p><p>My thoughts came back to the auditorium while I took a deep breath.</p><p>Though I sat motionless, aside from my hands scaling across the keys, the room seemed to be spinning slowly around me. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was dizzy or just lost in some ultra-realism with slow-motion camera panning, but nothing felt right\u2014or looked right.</p><p>I played the scales slowly back and forth a few times, listening carefully, seeing my future in the physical form of the notes; Mike, our children\u2014their little round faces smiling out at me from the space between thought and reality. I saw our lives\u2014long and happy. And he would love me, and I would love him just as much.</p> <p>But I still just didn\u2019t know if it was enough.</p><p>Confusion consumed my emotions and took control of my hands; I played harder, slamming the notes. All of the anguish, the loss\u2014I wanted it to go away. I wanted David to stay, to marry me, to have babies with me and grow old together.</p><p>The notes became slow and high once again. It\u2019d never happen. I had a choice to make. To choose life or eternal love\u2014if David would still even have me. He probably didn\u2019t even want my answer anymore. And I didn\u2019t expect to see him at the Masquerade next Sunday.</p><p>I wanted to hope he was happy somewhere out there, that he\u2019d moved on\u2014but it hurt when I tried.</p><p>I closed my eyes tight and let my heart die a little more, as it had been, slowly and surely, every day since my first kiss.</p><p>David, if you\u2019re out there, somewhere, please know how much I miss you. Please know how sorry I\u2014</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d Mike\u2019s angry voice broke through my thoughts. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>The room fell silent instantly as I pulled my hands from the keys and placed them in my lap, lowering my head.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have any idea what I\u2019ve gone through this morning?\u201d The stage thudded under his feet. \u201cI was about to call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolice? I was at school\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that rubbish. I knew you didn\u2019t attend school today because your dad\u2019s been out there searching for you since we realised you weren\u2019t in roll call!\u201d</p><p>There was nothing for me to say. I kind of knew he\u2019d be worried. \u201cWell.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cGuess you found me, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t. Your dad did. And he was so mad he couldn\u2019t even come in here to talk to you, Ara. He called me.\u201d He pointed to his chest. \u201cHow could you just run off like that? Not tell anyone where you were going. Jesus, girl.\u201d The fabric on the stool dipped as he sat beside me, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your permission to go for a run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you were doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Is that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, stop being a child. You know damn well you should\u2019ve told someone where you were. Don\u2019t try to make me out to be the bad guy. I\u2019ve been driving all over town looking for you. We had no idea what time you left or how long you\u2019d been gone.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s twelve-thirty, for God\u2019s sake, girl.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my lap, running my thumb over my locket. \u201cStop yelling at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m mad. I was so worried about you I nearly shook Emily when I asked her if she\u2019d seen you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! You talked to my friends?\u201d I smacked the stool with both hands. \u201cMike, how could you\u2014now you\u2019ve gone and made a huge drama out of thi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ara. You made the drama. You took off without leaving a note to say you hadn\u2019t gone to school. You\u2019ve been gone all bloody day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, no one asked you to come looking for me.\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that may be the case, but you\u2019ve caused a lot of worry. People care about you, Ara\u2014\u201d He reached for me; I jerked away. \u201cI care about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? You don\u2019t care about me. You just feel sorry for me. You just feel responsible for me, like you always have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra? Don\u2019t say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it!\u201d I shot up off the stool and fled to the heavy curtains near the wall. \u201cYou did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?\u201d He sat taller. \u201cAra, I would never say something like tha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. The day I arrived here, when my dad made me speak to you on the phone. You said you were tired of being responsible for me, that I had to grow up, and if I wasn\u2019t such a baby then none of this would\u2019ve happened!\u201d</p><p>Mike stood up, reaching for me. \u201cAra, that was not what I said and you know it. You\u2019re adding words to what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I? Or is that what you wanted to say? Is that what you really meant, only you didn\u2019t have the guts to say it?\u201d I yelled across the stage, feeling rather well-placed for such a theatrical display of emotion.</p><p>\u201cMy exact words to you that day, and my exact meaning were, I feel responsible for what happened to your mum and Harry. And you said it was your fault, that if you hadn\u2019t run away it wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve happened. That\u2019s when I said that running away was a childish thing to do. And that was all I said, Ara. The fact is, I was responsible for you. I let you down. I did not say you caused this. I never said, felt, or meant that. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t. I know the way you looked at me. I saw you look away when you first saw me after the accident; I remember how disgusted you were in me that night for daring to feel what I felt for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think?\u201d He briskly stepped forward and grabbed my arms. \u201cThat I was disgusted? In you? Ara, I was disgusted in myself for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor telling me how you truly felt?\u201d I shrugged out of his hands. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be. Because that should be allowed. If you don\u2019t love someone, you have a right to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do love you. You know that.\u201d He swooped into me again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d I ducked out from under his arms and ran to the edge of the stage. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. Please\u2014\u201d</p><p>I took a glance over my shoulder to see his bulky silhouette by the piano, reaching out to me, then jumped off the edge, bent my knees as I landed on the ground, and walked away with my arms folded.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>At a run, Mike\u2019s footfalls fell down on the hollow-sounding floor, then stopped as a soft tap of shoes on carpet came up behind me. \u201cBaby, talk to me. Please don\u2019t be like this. I just want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy!\u201d I spun around. \u201cIf you wanted me to be happy, then you\u2019d never have told me you love me, Mike. Now I\u2019m just confused and empty.\u201d</p><p>Mike doubled back, dropping his hand to his side as the blade of my words hit his heart. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you know? You don\u2019t know anything about me, Mike. Maybe you used to\u2014in fact, no\u2014scratch that. If you did, you\u2019d never have rejected me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, I didn\u2019t reject you. I just asked you to wait a second while I processed what was happening between us. You shook me up, girl. I wasn\u2019t expecting you to throw your arms around my neck and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well\u2014\u201d I looked up at him, keeping my arms folded, \u201c\u2014it was a mistake. You and I. All of it. Nothing but a big, fat mistake. Now, it\u2019s time I fix things\u2014put them all back in the right place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d He grabbed my wrist; I yanked it back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, I. Love. David, Mike. Not you.\u201d The lie came out through my lips like a hot breath; I couldn\u2019t even gasp the words back in\u2014they just fell out.</p><p>When Mike dropped his head, even the shadowed darkness did nothing to hide his pain. \u201cSo that\u2019s it then?\u201d His voice quaked. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to throw it all away because of some boy you just met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not just some boy, Mike. He\u2019s my one true love.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded, clenching his fists beside him. \u201cYou\u2019re not a child anymore, Ara. It\u2019s time you grew up. All this true love and fairy-tale bullshit!\u201d His angered voice touched my nerves. \u201cIt\u2019s not real. He is not your true love. He\u2019s a random stepping stone, a fall back guy\u2014a\u2014a bloody infatuation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't say that word!\u201d I screamed at him, clenching my fists. \u201cI never want to hear that word. You don't know. None of you know. You don't have a clue what I feel\u2014what I've gone through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me then, Ara\u2014\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cTell me, so I understand.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him for a moment longer, swiping my shaking hand across my nose before I sunk to the ground, curling into a ball. \u201cI can't do it. I can't do it anymore, Mike.\u201d</p><p>He fell to his knees and wrapped me up in his arms. \u201cWhat, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm so tired. I'm so goddamn tired. I just can't do it anymore.\u201d It was all too much. I missed David like I needed air, like I couldn\u2019t breathe anymore. Mike made it all feel better, made the air thinner, easier to take, but I couldn\u2019t fix it. I couldn\u2019t fix how hurt I was that he pushed me away in the first place. I just couldn\u2019t fix it.</p><p>\u201cAra. Baby, talk to me. Why are you shaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all gone.\u201d I closed my eyes tight. \u201cIt\u2019s all\u2014all of it. I don't wanna do this anymore, Mike. I don\u2019t wanna do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>Mike took a deep breath, letting it out with a loud groan. \u201cLook\u2014I hurt you. I\u2019m sorry for that, okay? But you don\u2019t love him. Not like you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t. I love him more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d Mike said softly, \u201cI\u2019m not giving up yet. I know you better than you know yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what to do,\u201d I sobbed, pressing my fists into my eyes. \u201cJust tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome home with me. Let me love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won't make it okay. It\u2019ll never be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Ara, we can't take back what happened. We can only try to move forward. But if you let me, I\u2019ll take care of you. I\u2019ll hold you until all the hurt just hurts less. Please\u2014let me do that.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, jagged breath. \u201cI can't. I can't, because when I do\u2014when I decide to, I die inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Ara? Why do you feel that way? I\u2014I don't understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, Mike. You can\u2019t, because you don't understand love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He drew back a little. \u201cThis isn't just about losing your mum and Harry, is it?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cSo...it\u2019s about David?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious? All this is about David?\u201d He motioned to my ruined self on the floor of the school auditorium.</p><p>I nodded again, my chest quivering, my snotty nose snivelling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAra, I know you don't want to hear this, but I'm gonna say it anyway, okay?\u201d He touched my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPlease don't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to, baby. You\u2014you\u2019re not okay. You need a hand to guide you right now, and I\u2014I know you better than anyone. This isn\u2019t normal\u2014the way you feel. This is grossly magnified by grief. This love you feel for David\u2014it isn't real.\u201d</p> <p>I looked up at him quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Mike.\u201d The beast inside me grew\u2014rising up from the ashes of disaster as I clambered to my feet. \u201cIt\u2019s you I don't feel for.\u201d</p><p>He stood too. \u201cAra, that\u2019s not true and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true,\u201d I screamed. \u201cI stopped feeling for you the day my family died. And I don\u2019t care if that hurts you, because you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra\u2014\u201d He edged closer. \u201cDon\u2019t. Please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but...I want you to go home, Mike. We\u2019re never gonna be what we were. It\u2019s all just too broken now. I just can\u2019t forgive you for pushing me away.\u201d Then, hurriedly, before guilt could set in, I turned and headed for the door. But the light barely even touched my face before I realised what that would have done to him. I couldn\u2019t see him, but I could feel the cold in the room from the detachment of his soul.</p> <p>The thing was, if he couldn't understand what I felt for David, then he couldn't understand how to love me. We\u2019d never be right for each other.</p><p>Holding my head high, with pride moving my feet, I kept walking, even though I knew, deep down inside, beneath the ogre, beneath the pain I always felt, I loved him, and I wanted him to take me home.</p><p>\u201cSay it again!\u201d Mike ordered, grabbing my wrist, whirling me into the cage of his arms. \u201cSay it like you mean it and I\u2019ll go. But you don\u2019t, Ara.\u201d He studied me carefully, his eyes darting over every inch of my face. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean it. Say it!\u201d He shook me.</p><p>My lip quivered and a cold tear rolled over my cheek. It was suddenly very clear that he wasn\u2019t as sure I loved him as he said he was. He believed me when I said I didn\u2019t care for him\u2014just as I\u2019d wanted him to.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, is it? Nothing? You have nothing to say to me?\u201d His voice cracked above the controlled hysterics. \u201cAfter all these years, after...after all the...\u201d He let go of my arms, backing away as his hand covered his mouth. \u201cOh, God. I did this. I did this.\u201d</p><p>Even though my face crumpled with the saturation of regret, I refused to let myself hide in my hands. He needed to see I was hurting, too. He needed to know how I felt. If I couldn\u2019t tell him now, I\u2019d lose him forever. But I couldn\u2019t speak. My chest felt so tight the words wouldn\u2019t come. If only he was like David, I could say in my mind, I\u2019m so sorry, Mike. I love you. I love you! And I want you to know that. I just...I\u2019ll always love David, though. Always.</p> <p>Above the silence, a mighty growl suddenly broke through.</p><p>Mike looked up at me, his eyes then falling to my belly as the ogre made a last demand for nourishment.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last eat?\u201d He looked back at my face, and in the pale light from outside, I noticed the hint of a smile around the corners of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>A loud huff of air burst out through his wide grin. \u201cI shoulda known.\u201d His arms flew up and wrapped around me, pulling me into his chest with a jolt. \u201cI shoulda known you could never say things like that.\u201d</p><p>As my breath struggled through his strangle hold and into my lungs, I tried to push away from him, to protest against his sudden change in direction. But he squeezed me tighter and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo way, baby girl. I am not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>So, with a sigh, my shoulders dropped and I gave in, let him hold me\u2014let his warm, strong embrace make me feel safe and loved again. The way he always made me feel.</p> <p>\u201cJust say it though, please?\u201d He held my shoulders, looking down into my face. \u201cJust so my heart will believe my ears. Please just tell me you didn\u2019t mean any of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I didn\u2019t, Mike,\u201d I said very softly.</p><p>His chest shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I yelled at you, baby.\u201d He gathered me up; I folded into him willingly, letting him make an apology for something he need not apologise for. \u201cI was just so worried. If I\u2019d lost you\u2014if you were gone, I...I just don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>Even though I knew he was referring to the fact that I ran away this morning, a small part of me wondered if what he really meant was, if I didn\u2019t love him, or if I truly wanted him to go back home.</p><p>And that made me feel happy, in a silly kind of way, that he could love me so much, to be so devastated if I would not love him in return.</p><p>When we walked through the front door back home, Dad didn\u2019t even bother grilling me. I half expected to become the steak to his side of fries with way too much salt. But he just hugged me\u2014held me tight, like I mattered more to him than anything in the world\u2014then handed me back to Mike before walking away, without saying a word.</p><p>I looked to Mike for reassurance.</p><p>\u201cFood?\u201d he said with a gentle smile.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah. Food sounds great.\u201d</p><p>The last chimes of the principal\u2019s speech resonated in my thoughts. Even with my eyes closed, I could feel the pale glow of the spotlight over me as my fingers scaled across the keys, breaking the hearts of those in the crowd tonight.</p><p>Of all the worlds my mind created, this, where I lived each day, was the most painful one; the world that hovered on the wrong side of truth\u2014the one I could not escape from, even if I closed my eyes or woke myself up. In this world, everyone I loved was gone, and the boy the crowd mourned, Nathan, was gone too. No matter how much we played for him, he would never hear our songs, but I would play for them anyway\u2014for all those who lived only in my memories. Including David.</p><p>I truly believed he\u2019d come tonight, but mine was the last performance, and so far, he hadn\u2019t showed. So, I sang the words of the song from memory, not from my heart. All the joy, all the passion I once felt when singing was non-existent\u2014dead, weighted like heavy rain. But my music teachers taught me well how to perform when everything around me was falling away. No one in the crowd would have known how much I was suffering for the painful realisation that all this was real. That David really was gone.</p><p>We finished the song to a standing ovation. Mike wiped a mock tear from his cheek; I smiled at him, then took a bow and sat back down at the piano for my solo.</p><p>After a deep breath, I closed my eyes, and in the moment it took to open them again, the room went dark and ultimately quiet. A wispy cool encircled me; the absence of life filtering emptiness into my world. I sat taller and looked around the vacant auditorium.</p><p>I was alone; everyone was gone.</p><p>How long had I been sitting here?</p><p>A whisper of a memory salted my thoughts, making me look down at my bone-white, numb fingers. I remembered playing. I remembered the faces of the audience\u2014how, afterward, they greeted me and shook my hand. I had smiled and nodded, while inside, I was dying. I could see it all as it happened, but couldn\u2019t remember living it. I wondered if Dad or Mike were looking for me\u2014worried about me.</p><p>My posture sunk a little as I made myself smaller and took a few shallow breaths. Truth was, I really didn\u2019t care if they were worried. I just wanted to play, rain my heart into a song until it no longer felt like it was bleeding.</p><p>Ignoring the tension of the impending grilling, I placed my fingers to the keys again. Each note poured through them like rainbow-coloured grief\u2014strings of light that, with every pull on my heart, tore away another part of my soul; brought to the surface another emotion, another painful memory I thought I\u2019d locked away for good.</p><p>Through all of this that I\u2019d suffered, I knew that, inside, I was destroyed. I would never be the same again. I tried once, to move on, to be normal, but with the loss of David, of my one true love, I knew that moving on was never in the cards for me. Whatever my existence here was fated to be, happiness was not it. David was not it.</p><p>Like a strong link to a powerful memory, the faint hint of a familiar scent touched my lungs. I drew a deep breath of orange-chocolate, and my body rejoiced the sensation of oxygen, as if I\u2019d not taken a breath since I last held David.</p><p>My head whipped up; I looked back to the chairs that only hours ago had been filled with friends and family, and all of a sudden, in the middle seat, softly lit by the light from the corridor outside, I saw a face.</p><p>David.</p><p>He stood up slowly, like a ghost weighed down by the anguish in the world.</p><p>How long had he been there? What had he heard in my thoughts while he was watching me?</p><p>\u201cI know this is hard.\u201d He appeared behind me, his smooth, ethereal voice shattering my heart. \u201cBut you knew this. Breaking up was never going to be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s what this is?\u201d I asked in a quiet voice, looking down. \u201cWe\u2019re broken up, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it wasn\u2019t so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to\u2014\u201d I spun around on the seat and stopped dead when I looked at him; it ached inside to see his face after I was sure I\u2019d never lay eyes on him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat wouldn\u2019t be so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo...to be like you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t be like me. I\u2019ve spent so much time thinking about it\u2014desperate to find some way this could work. But, Ara? There\u2019s no saying you even carry the gene. What if we tried and you\u2014\u201d He shook his head again. \u201cNo. You have to take a chance at life. You have to live it to its fullest before I could even dream of changing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He placed his thumb to my lips. \u201cIf you die, Ara, without ever knowing life, motherhood, I could not live with myself. It is better to have lived your life in heartache, than never to have lived at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I do know that. And\u2014\u201d I pictured my future, my children, my wrinkled skin. \u201cAnd I want a life, but...but the heartache is worse than I thought.\u201d</p><p>David looked at my hand, over my heart, and nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>We held our gaze for a long moment, leaving our future resting on the pause of a few simple words. After a while, I sighed, turning my face away when the words refused to come.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right for you, you know.\u201d David broke the silence, though the tension stayed as thick as blood.</p><p>My quiet breath sunk.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be with him. I want you to go back to Perth with him.\u201d</p><p>I looked up quickly.</p><p>\u201cI see in his thoughts, Ara. I watch him with you. He loves you\u2014deeply.\u201d He lost his voice on the last word, closing his eyes as he said it.</p><p>\u201cI know, David. I know he loves me, and\u2014I love him too.\u201d I had to whisper, afraid my words would wound him forever; like somehow, making my voice low might take away some of the sting. \u201cBut I can\u2019t go with him. I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t leave you here al\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. Be smart.\u201d David dropped to his knees in front of me. \u201cI can\u2019t have you here, lingering in a place I may one day return. That\u2019s not living. You have to go\u2014you have to be far away so I can never find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t do it. I won\u2019t return and ruin your life and, knowing how close you are\u2014that I could just drive to you\u2014would be more agony than I could bear.\u201d</p><p>The tears in my eyes turned to thick droplets as they spilled onto my cheeks and over my lips. He was right. It would be selfish of me to wait around here for him\u2014to hope he might change his mind and become a fake human. If he left his Set, he\u2019d have nothing, and one day, I\u2019d be gone anyway. At least, for now, we suffered the absence in union\u2014desolate union.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just don't make me say goodbye, David. Go, leave me, but don't make me say it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and sat beside me on the piano stool. I tried to steady my pulse, pushing away the memory of the first time I saw that dimple; how I wanted nothing in the world except him\u2014just him. Life or death or murder meant nothing\u2014I just wanted him. \u201cThis is not goodbye, Ara. Not yet. I still have a few more days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cUntil the last red leaf falls, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil the last red leaf falls,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>I touched my fingertips to David\u2019s face, and he held my hand to his cheek, closing his eyes. My heart picked up with the desire to lay against him\u2014safe in his strong, loving arms\u2014held tight, like nothing could ever bring me harm.</p><p>If only we could run away\u2014run from everything. Run from reality and the supernatural, run from fate and tragedy. But we couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you go\u2014what will you do when I\u2019m gone?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked down and then smiled as our eyes met again. \u201cSee the pyramids.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAlways wanted to fly a silver plane, too.\u201d</p><p>I managed a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever forget, Ara, how much I love you.\u201d He placed both hands on my face, then turned my head slowly. \u201cAnd you still, and always will, belong to me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, rolling my cheek into his thumb as he wiped a tear away. Then, he slowly lowered his lips to mine, and like so many times before, they fit to perfection, as if we were made for each other\u2014but so cruelly unsuited to each other. We\u2019d kissed for love, kissed for lust, for happiness and thankfulness, but this was a kiss of sorrow, of loss and despair, yet so full of love\u2014so soft and so gentle.

I just can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d His voice overflowed with confusion as he held the locket in his open palm.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too painful for me. I can\u2019t keep this as a memory of you. I need to forget. I need to try to move on, and every time I do, this is a constant reminder that you\u2019re no longer a part of my life.\u201d My voice broke\u2014shattered, as I delivered the words I knew were tearing out his heart.</p><p>His rounded eyes burned through me, deep into my soul; he wanted me to feel what he felt right then, but I already knew. I could feel it myself\u2014in my bones, breaking my resolve.</p><p>I looked away. It hurt too much to see that on his face. It would only destroy me over and over again.</p><p>The locket sat in David\u2019s outstretched palm, shimmering like moonlight on sand in the soft, dull light of our eternal darkness.</p><p>Placing my thumb against the heart, I closed his fingertips around it and held my grip there for a second. \u201cThis is not goodbye, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet, anyway.\u201d He nodded solemnly as he placed my heart into his pocket, and then, like so many times before, without a word, without a smile, the darkness was the only thing I saw in his place.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>With my back against the wall outside Mr Benson\u2019s class, I hugged my books\u2014the books David usually carried\u2014and watched everyone pass. They didn\u2019t talk to me. They hardly even gawked at me anymore, and the horrid yellow linoleum just seemed to be a part of the scenery, ironically, like me. Didn\u2019t mean it fit, though.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you hear?\u201d Emily came bounding over.</p><p>\u201cDepends. What was I supposed to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe benefit? We raised enough to cover Nathan\u2019s funeral.\u201d Her lips practically touched her ears. \u201cAnd due to an anonymous donation, Mrs Rossi won\u2019t have to pay the hospital bill, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s really great.\u201d We moved aside for Mr B to get into class. \u201cSo, who\u2019s the donor?\u201d</p><p>Emily glared at me. \u201cAra, the point of being anonymous is that no one knows who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I closed my eyes for a second. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019m not really with it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever?\u201d she asked; I shrugged. \u201cSo, what happened to you anyway, after the show? You just...disappeared.\u201d She fluttered her fingers as if throwing a handful of butterflies into the air.</p><p>\u201cI uh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Mike? \u2018Cause you guys seem pretty friendly.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cIs Mike taking you to the ball? Since David had to go New Hampshire?\u201d</p><p>New Hampshire, huh? \u201cI haven\u2019t asked him. But, I guess he will. It\u2019s been really busy around my place lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, tell me about it. We haven\u2019t even gone shopping for my dress yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God. Emily. I\u2019m so sorry. I totally forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you, not with a hunk like that hanging around.\u201d She elbowed me softly, hugging her books to her chest.</p><p>\u201cCan I make it up to you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d She lifted one shoulder and dropped it. \u201cHey, why don\u2019t we go tonight? Maybe have some dinner out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know\u2014\u201d I grinned, \u201c\u2014that may be just what I need. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix fine with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds\u2014great.\u201d Really great, actually.</p><p>We parted ways and I suffered the trials of obligation for the next seven hours in silence. It was during this desolate wandering I had a revelation; school was so boring. I decided I wouldn\u2019t be coming tomorrow and probably not for the rest of this week, actually. I wanted as much time with Mike as I could get before he boarded that plane next Monday and, if I decided not go with him, disappeared from my life forever.</p><p>It seemed to be the way with people I loved; I\u2019d get to hold them, love them only long enough to realise I couldn't live without them, and then they were gone. A blink of an eye.</p><p>There was no going back to the simplicity\u2014the uncomplicated rose-coloured glasses of love. Love was not enough anymore, and if love were truly blind, then I\u2019d surely be running away with David.</p><p>But the heart must not be allowed to rule the mind. At least, that\u2019s what I kept telling myself. Though, I was starting to wonder which one was which.</p><p>Mike sprawled out across my bed and sorted through the playlists on my iPod while I fussed about in my wardrobe, choosing a dress to wear out. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this shopping trip for again?\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cUm. Emily needs a dress for the ball. I was supposed to go with her last week, but...\u201d I shrugged to myself.</p><p>\u201cBall?\u201d The words came from directly behind me.</p><p>I spun around, cupping my hands over my bra. \u201cMike? Get out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, kid, I\u2019ve seen it all before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I scoffed, shoving him. \u201cGet out. You can talk to me when I\u2019m decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty decent, now.\u201d His smug grin made me smile, but common sense took over and I shoved him again.</p><p>\u201cOut. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d He laughed as he backed away, palms raised. \u201cSo, are you going to the ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d I looked at the dress, hanging in all its glory on the hook beside me.</p><p>\u201cWas David supposed to take you?\u201d Mike asked from right behind me again.</p><p>\u201cHey. I said out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer me and I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that cheeky grin, Michael Christopher White. I said out. Now, out.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the finger I pointed in his face. \u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to. You should give a girl some respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do respect you.\u201d He pulled me close, cupping his warm hands on my bare waist. \u201cI\u2019m also just very attracted to you. So\u2014\u201d he grinned, running his thumb from my rib to my hip, \u201c\u2014can I escort you to the ball, since the flesh eater isn\u2019t here?\u201d</p><p>Flesh eater? Oh, right, he was referring to the bruises on my neck. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about him like that, Mike,\u201d I said. \u201cBesides, I thought you hated getting all dressed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho me?\u201d His eyes flashed with mischief. \u201cAra, I would like nothing more than to dress like a penguin and dance with the most beautiful girl in the room. Besides, we both know I look hot in a suit.\u201d</p><p>I glared up at him, making my eyes small. His hands clasped together so tightly behind me then that I couldn't really move. I wanted to tell him to get out, but I also wanted him to stay. I just wanted it to feel right. But it wasn\u2019t right. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019d ya say\u2014will you let this lowly Aussie hunk escort his princess to the ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll let my best friend do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll go buy a suit tomorrow then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries, baby.\u201d He rested his head on mine, cradling me close, continuing his welcomed intrusion.</p><p>\u201cUm, Mike,\u201d I said into his warm, firm chest, my lips practically eating his shirt with each word. \u201cKinda need to breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d He let me loose. \u201cI always forget how fragile you are.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cOkay, now, out. I need to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Vicki called. \u201cEmily\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend her up,\u201d I called back and glared at Mike.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He laughed at my \u2018nose in the air\u2019 stance, then turned around, but didn\u2019t leave. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take Sam to another movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are getting pretty close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s a good kid,\u201d he said, leaning on the wall, forgetting he was supposed to be looking away.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be sad when you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I just won\u2019t go then?\u201d I could hear the question in his suggestion. He wanted me to ask him to stay.</p><p>I shrugged instead, buttoning my jeans. \u201cI\u2019m not having this conversation with you right now, Mike. I have too much on my mind.\u201d</p><p>He went quiet, nodding, then wedged both hands into his pockets, took one last long look at me and left with a cheeky grin on his face.</p><p>After a less than successful shopping trip, Emily and I sat empty handed at the caf\u00e9 and ordered a burger. \u201cMike seems nice.\u201d Her eyelids fluttered. \u201cYou were definitely right about his cuteness.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, swallowing my mouthful. \u201cHe feels really bad for practically shaking you the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Really. I get it. He was worried.\u201d Her smile subsided to a frown. \u201cReally worried, actually.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling pretty awkward.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s David?\u201d she asked. \u201cHave you two run up a huge phone bill yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blinked a few extra times, looking at her plate.</p><p>I placed my burger down. \u201cI uh...I actually haven\u2019t spoken to him since he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that? Has he lost his phone again?\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d My jaw tightened to hold back the quivering lip. \u201cWe broke up, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she screeched; everyone in the caf\u00e9 turned to look at us. \u201cWhat do you mean? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe...he wasn't going on holiday, Em. He...was moving away\u2014permanently.\u201d</p><p>Her face contorted\u2014an illustration of her thoughts. \u201cBut...he didn't even say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He hates goodbyes,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cBut, he was my friend!\u201d</p><p>The waitress nearby stopped walking and looked at Emily.</p><p>She cleared her throat, blinking back tears. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t just leave without so much as a goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Em. He did.\u201d</p><p>Her lip trembled. \u201cBut...I knew him longer than you. Why would he just...that\u2019s so mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re surprised? You know what he\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She scowled at me, like this was my fault. \u201cBut he was never mean to me, Ara\u2014never intentionally, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don't think he left to be mean, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he leave\u2014did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>I sunk my chin against my hand with a huff. \u201cHis uncle got a call to move, and David had to go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis uncle?\u201d She frowned. \u201cDavid doesn't live with his uncle anymore.\u201d</p><p>I sat taller. \u201cHow do you know\u2014did you ever go over his house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHouse? Ara, he lives in an apartment.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped through my legs and onto the floor. \u201cSo you went there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um.\u201d Ouch. \u201cWell, I'm sorry he didn't say goodbye, Em. Maybe he\u2019ll call you or something.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her meal, folding her bottom lip over her top one, her eyes awash with thought. \u201cHow are you coping then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Fine.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her eyes glassy. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>I laughed once. \u201cNo, really, I knew this was coming, so I'm okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDid you know at the sleepover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She nodded. \u201cNot planning to marry him. So, that\u2019s what you meant that night?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm okay.\u201d</p><p>She stared me down. \u201cAra, I\u2019m your best friend. You don't have to be strong around me.\u201d</p><p>Funny thing was, she had become my best friend, and I knew I could tell her about David\u2014and she\u2019d understand. \u201cThanks, Emily. But I really am okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say where he was even going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Only that he won't be back. That\u2019s why we broke up.\u201d</p><p>I could see the thoughts flickering across her brow, in her eyes and over her lip, changing, forming into questions. \u201cWhy didn't you go with him? I mean, if I loved someone as much as you loved David, I would\u2019ve just jumped in his suitcase.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cUm, well, because I didn't want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe...he wants a kind of life that I...well, we want different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cWell, I want a family one day, and he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants a career in...\u201d Punishing naughty vampires. \u201cPolitics. He can't have distractions, like a family.\u201d Or food he\u2019s in love with.</p><p>\u201cKids?\u201d Emily practically spat. \u201cYou let David go because you want kids?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, knowing it was a poor argument.</p><p>\u201cI don't get you, Ara.\u201d She dabbed her teary eyes with her napkin.</p><p>\u201cNot much to get, Em. It is what it is.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, leaving her burger abandoned on the plate. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. We should probably go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said softly, grabbing my bag as I stood up. \u201cYou okay, Em?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m...yeah.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, linking arms with her as we left the cafe. \u201cHey, Em? About your dress? We only have five shopping days left\u2014are you sure you didn\u2019t like any of them?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cNo. None of them really felt right. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019ll just go in jeans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it might be a bit tricky for Spence to co-ordinate his tux with denim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s no big deal, really. If I don\u2019t find a dress\u2014I just won\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I frowned. \u201cI guess you don\u2019t.\u201d I hadn\u2019t really thought of that. I was so caught up in our only options being to either find her a dress or have her go in something old and tatty, I never even considered the idea that there were other choices to be made.</p> <p>Which made me realise...I had options, too\u2014just like everyone else.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019d been going about this whole immortal-love-or-eternal-sadness thing all wrong. I\u2019d been feeling trapped by the choice between two paths\u2014David or Mike\u2014but it was the confines of my own mind narrowing those choices.</p><p>I walked a little taller as we reached the parking lot, thankful that Emily was distant and distracted herself, allowing me to escape to my own thoughts.</p><p>Fate had stepped in and offered me an alternative to eternal blood. But maybe I didn't have to choose either of them; maybe I could choose to be on my own\u2014to go in a different direction altogether and forget love.</p><p>Since Mum died, I\u2019d spent so long blaming myself and living with guilt and anguish that I\u2019d forgotten I was a girl of my own rights, and that there was such a thing as choosing how to feel.</p><p>Like when Dorothy made it home from Oz, she learned that she was never really gone in the first place\u2014that all the fear and loneliness she felt in that world was in her own mind.</p> <p>I have control over my own life, and I get to choose what it is that breaks me...</p><p>\u2018Dear diary,</p><p>Power of choice lasted about as long as it took me to sit in the nook of my window, diary in lap, and look out at the empty night. Emily was heartbroken about David tonight, and I wondered why he hadn\u2019t at least said goodbye to her. She was right. She never did anything to hurt him. He shouldn\u2019t have left her without a goodbye. And her sadness magnified my own, making my sudden epiphany to be independent null and void. Who was I kidding to think I could just get over David and Mike by choosing to be happy on my own?\u2019</p><p>I chewed my pen for a second, then rubbed my ankle, warming the icy chill that whistled in under the slightly open pane. Down in the street, with the moonlight hidden behind a dense cloud, cars and trees looked shadowed and intimidating. It seemed eerily still out there, but the familiar feeling of being watched trickled past my reflection, making me hold my breath a little. I wished it were true\u2014that I was being watched. By David. Except, a part of me was deathly afraid it may be something else\u2014or no one at all. I wasn\u2019t sure which was worse.</p><p>\u2018I never even leave my window open, anymore\u2019, I continued, \u2018I don\u2019t want the fresh air, and I\u2019m also a little afraid David\u2019s creepy brother might visit me in my sleep again.</p><p>That freaks me out beyond words.\u2019</p><p>A loud crack outside startled me, and a bright flash turned my legs white for a second.</p><p>I froze, unable to inch the window closed so the menacing storm wouldn\u2019t notice me here. It grew in the sky above me, rolling in over the tops of the trees, carrying every fear, every tear I ever cried, surrounding me, cornering me in this tiny little space, only half covered by glass.</p> <p>Then, in a second attempt to demonstrate its power, the thunder ricocheted off the distant horizon with a sharp snap, receding to a dense growl. And I believed it, submitting to the taut being it demanded I become. I thought it had passed\u2014my fear of storms. I\u2019d tried so hard, for so long, to grow up and get over it, and only a few weeks ago I thought I\u2019d succeeded, but it seemed that every time something broke in my heart or my life, so crumbled that pillar of strength I thought I\u2019d built.</p><p>I looked across my room to my door, knowing Mike would be out there\u2014awake, waiting for me. But he wouldn\u2019t always be there to comfort me through these thundery spells, unless I went with him to Perth.</p><p>If I stayed, I\u2019d have to learn to wait out the storms, alone\u2014find a way to live while they raged on.</p><p>I leaned my back against the wall and let thought consume my expression for a moment.</p><p>The call of the storm howled outside, but inside, my heart battled with my mind, stirring the force of a hurricane, waking my vault of indecision again, opening the overly-traversed door of Mike versus David.</p><p>When the next crack of thunder hit, though, I decided then and there that none of it mattered right now. Safety. Warmth. Hiding from that storm was all that mattered. That was all.</p><p>I ditched my diary and ran, a something\u2019s-going-to-grab-my-ankle kind of fear moving my feet. But my heart jumped a beat of relief when I looked across the dark, empty corridor to see Mike\u2019s door open. I leaped toward his bed\u2014without touching his floor, and fell into him.</p><p>\u201cHey. There you are.\u201d He wrapped his arm around me as I snuggled up as close as physically possible to his bare chest. \u201cI was wondering how long it\u2019d take you to come in here.\u201d His voice sounded so light. I could tell he was laughing at me. But I didn\u2019t care; I just needed to feel his arms around me\u2014needed to feel him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mike. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, don\u2019t be sorry, baby. I was actually hoping you\u2019d come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I left my door open?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, listening to each beat of his heart come as reliably as the next, letting my shoulders drop as Mike stroked my head, easing away the knot in my stomach. \u201cThanks, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d</p><p>And I knew that was the truth, more than an automated statement. Just like every moment in the past, Mike had and would always be there to comfort me through the storm. \u201cHey, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the year I told my mum I was too old to be afraid of storms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if she actually believed you or just wanted to believe you.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled my face into his skin. \u201cI think she knew the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you always freaked out when I tapped on your window during a storm,\u201d he mused.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. How scary do you think it is to completely believe The Bogeyman comes out to get you in the thunder, and then see a face outside your window?\u201d</p><p>He laughed loudly. \u201cBut you knew it\u2019d just be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. After a while, anyway.\u201d I closed my eyes and let myself remember laying with him\u2014in his arms, safe and happy all those nights. \u201cMike?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed the top of my head. \u201cI know, baby. I know you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, baby, we\u2019ll talk in the morning. It\u2019s after midnight\u2014go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed my courage and stuffed the words I love you back down where I\u2019d stored them all these years, then closed my eyes and let Mike\u2019s heartbeat take me away to the peace and silence of dreamland.</p><p>A songbird announced the arrival of morning, waking my mind from the best sleep it\u2019d found in ages. I inched one eye open, blinded by the glare of sunlight streaming in\u2014its soft, yellow glow making me smile because, finally, the rain had passed.</p><p>If I could sleep like that every night, I\u2019d make it my occupation to go to bed. But the bed moved under me, rising softly before warm, moist lips touched my brow.</p><p>I pushed up onto my hands and knees. \u201cMike!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, princess. You slept well,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I rubbed my face, checking to see if his door was shut. It was. \u201cI did, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I blinked a few extra times to focus properly on the way the morning seemed to make his skin look like honey and his eyes as warm as hot cocoa. He was very beautiful in the morning. \u201cUm, yeah. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep in your bed.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, shaking his head, then just looked at me for a few seconds. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry it doesn\u2019t storm like that every night.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks lifted first, forcing my lips to follow.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He placed a hand on my shoulder and tugged.</p><p>My muscles were so stiff that I slumped down heavily on his bare chest, and every inch of skin that wasn\u2019t covered by my tank top touched his, making me shiver inside\u2014a good shiver. \u201cWhy did you keep me last night, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d His arms tightened around me for a second. \u201cYou snuggled up so close to me, Ara, with your face and your soft breath over my chest. Why on earth would I put you back in your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep telling me, but yet...\u201d He motioned down at my hand over his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I asked, moving my hand onto his stomach.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d He stretched his arm out around my back and looked at his watch, forcing me closer. I liked this closeness. \u201cMidday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a sec.\u201d He grabbed my arm as I leaped for the side of the bed. \u201cYou stay. I\u2019ll get breakfast. Well, brunch now, I suppose.\u201d He grinned, and his unshaven, sandy-brown stubble did nothing to hide the sexy indent in his cheek\u2014not even a little bit.</p><p>As he gently pushed me back onto the pillows, everything from my heart down went numb. His soft, partially open lips came toward me so slowly that I closed my eyes and held my breath, waiting for them to touch mine. But, he kissed my forehead and walked out the door, leaving me breathless.</p><p>I rubbed at my face, as if maybe I could chafe off some of my awkwardness. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever get this boy thing right. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019d just waited too long to have him kiss me and now I was plotting scenes in my mind that were completely opposite to what was going on the real world. For all I knew, he hadn\u2019t even woken up beside me this morning. I could be in my own bed right now and not even know it.</p><p>Spreading the covers out neatly over my ribs, I drew a deep breath of the morning, smelling the warm scent of toast beneath it. Mike would come back up soon. I needed to compose myself.</p><p>I cupped my hand and blew into it, nodding with approval when my breath came back scentless, then knotted my fingers through my hair in a desperate attempt to tidy my probably very haggard appearance. Okay, so that wasn\u2019t composure. But I\u2019d been crazy over Mike for so long. I wanted him to come back up those stairs and look at me like I was the only girl in the world, then take me in his arms and kiss me\u2014on the lips. Not the forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat ya thinkin\u2019 \u2018bout?\u201d Mike asked, leaning against the door with a tray in hand.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. From the look on your face, you like whatever you were thinking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do; maybe I don\u2019t.\u201d I tried not to grin.</p><p>He rested the tray on the foot of the bed and his homely smile set my heart racing like\u2014like I was the only girl in the world.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you, right now?\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I came back to my own head, smiling sheepishly. \u201cSorry. Did I faze out again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cJust a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Mike wiped his hand across his mouth, then laughed once; a short, breathy laugh. \u201cOkay, well, that\u2019s a good sign, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, half shrugging.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d He patted my leg through the covers. \u201cYou don\u2019t think straight when you\u2019re hungry. So, I'm not gonna read into that too deeply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think I'm delusional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope not,\u201d he said in a breath, sitting down beside me.</p><p>I bit my lip. He knew too well what I\u2019d been thinking\u2014he didn't need to be like David to be in my head, which was as comforting as it was...awkward.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He passed me a plate and I swapped my lip for toast; the peanut butter swirled around on my tongue with the jelly at the prefect consistency; it didn\u2019t even stick to the roof of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cMmm. You\u2019ve always been the best at making toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be the chef in me,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cSo, if the chef in you makes good toast, what can the cop in you do?\u201d Oh, that was suggestive, Ara.</p><p>\u201cI could arrest you? For dangerously good looks.\u201d</p><p>I choked on the toast for a second, nearly losing it out my nose. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst joke I\u2019ve heard in ages.\u201d</p><p>Mike chuckled. \u201cSo, I\u2019m still king, then\u2014of bad jokes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight? I forgot about that,\u201d I mused. \u201cNo one here gets it. They think you\u2019re just trying to be funny and not succeeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I get ya.\u201d His teeth showed with his gentle smile.</p><p>\u201cYou always did. So\u2014if you\u2019re king, I\u2019m queen, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon the bad joke again, but...\u201d He leaned forward and stroked my cheek in a melodramatic fashion. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been my queen.\u201d</p><p>The rumble in the back of my throat couldn\u2019t decide if it was laughter or a giant scoff. \u201cYeah, that was a pretty terrible joke.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe I wasn\u2019t joking,\u201d he said suggestively.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d I sat up a little further and reluctantly put the yummy toast down as a full speed rant shot off from the starting line. \u201cDon\u2019t bother saying it. I already know but, Mike, you keep playing this game with me\u2014saying you\u2019re in love with me, but you touch me and pull away, or you say things to my dad that make me think I\u2019m imagining all this, and when we\u2019re alone, you\u2014it\u2019s like you pretend we\u2019re together and then remind yourself that we\u2019re not. Why? Why do you do that if you want me? Why do you keep confusing me, Mike? I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t be the girl that takes charge and makes the first move. I\u2019ll never be that girl. If you want me, you have to make it clearer than this. You have to be consistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike frowned, surprised. \u201cWhere\u2019s this coming from, baby? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what\u2019s wrong. Us,\u201d I yelled and tried to stand, but he took my hand and pulled me back down, grinning.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that...you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I do\u2014otherwise I would\u2019ve told you already that I don\u2019t.\u201d I lowered my head.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d He sat back, his lips parting as he stared at nothing. \u201cShit. You\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought otherwise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He looked at me then, rubbing his brow. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure anymore, Ara. I thought maybe\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, but...I just can\u2019t believe it. You have no idea how long I\u2019ve waited to hear you say that. I just don\u2019t even know what...I just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuestion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell my dad you don\u2019t want me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaby, I\u2014I never said anything to your dad about not wanting you. What\u2019re you\u2014when was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other day, when you said that thing about going home...alone. I don\u2019t do long distance relationships, Mike\u2014they don\u2019t work.\u201d Even though I\u2019d love David from afar for the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cAra, I didn\u2019t mean that. I was...\u201d He looked frustrated. \u201cAs if I was going to tell your dad I\u2019d asked you to come home with me. He\u2019d have pulled out his shotgun right then.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed with an insistent smile. \u201cTrue. I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, I want you. You know that. I...I want nothing more than for you to come home with me.\u201d He looked at me for a long moment. \u201cAnd...you know I\u2019d look after you, right?\u201d</p><p>He would. He\u2019d take very good care of me; love me, protect me, and I\u2019d never want for anything. \u201cI know,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>\u201cThen...come with me.\u201d He took my hand, his gentle touch littered with hope. \u201cYou could finish school, go to uni\u2014be a teacher\u2014like you always planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t say anything now. Not if you\u2019re going to say no. Just\u2014\u201d He paused, releasing a really deep, tense breath, then looked away\u2014far away to where his thoughts were on the other side of the window. \u201cWhatever you choose? I already decided I can\u2019t go back\u2014not without you.\u201d A warm grin lit his face then. \u201cIf you stay, I stay.\u201d</p><p>The little fold between my brows tightened. \u201cWhat about your career?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, you\u2019re the love of my life.\u201d He took both my hands. \u201cWhat would my career mean to me if I didn't have you? God, I only joined because I thought I\u2019d lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost me?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and looked down; sad Mike. \u201cWhen you moved away\u2014when you refused to even speak to me\u2014I figured you hated me. And...I don't know, I guess I decided that if I didn't have you to look after, I\u2019d be a perfect candidate to risk my own life, because it\u2019d be worth nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike? What a horrid thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I'm sorry. It...it wasn\u2019t like a suicide mission or anything. But, I could\u2019ve joined tactical six months ago. I chose not to because I didn't want to leave you alone if anything ever happened to me.\u201d Mike\u2019s eyes softened as they scanned my cheeks and my lips. \u201cWhen you told me you fell in love with David, I\u2014I died inside, Ara. I thought everything was lost. So, if I have to give up Tactical to stay here and be with you for the rest of my life, it doesn't even need a second thought. All I ever wanted was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d move here? Throw it all away? What would you do for a job?\u201d My voice of reason challenged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I used to be a chef, remember? I can get work anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d need a working visa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr\u2014\u201d He took my hands again and looked into me with those charming, caramel-colour eyes, melting my heart like maple syrup on pancakes. \u201cOr, we could get married. You\u2019re an American citizen now, right?\u201d His tone softened on the end into a shrug of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never getting married. Remember? You hate weddings.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t get married until I found the right girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d only be marrying me for a visa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Ara.\u201d He brushed a quick hand through his hair. \u201cI was using it as a line to open that door. I\u2019ve bloody been trying to cough out a proposal since the first day I got here.\u201d</p><p>Holy crap! \u201cWhy didn't you just ask me?\u201d I played neutral, concealing the little girl inside me who was jumping up and down, throwing confetti.</p><p>\u201cBecause you would\u2019ve said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn't wanna risk it, Ar. I uh...I don\u2019t take rejection as well as I\u2019d like to think I do.\u201d We both laughed softly. Then, he inched closer, and the serious Mike I\u2019d come to know more recently slipped into place. \u201cAll I\u2019ve been waiting on is you\u2014for you to realise you love me, and then, that night, when I didn\u2019t kiss you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I looked away, feeling the pain of the night I lost my mother etching into my heart.</p><p>Mike hooked a finger under my chin and pulled my face toward his. His lips were so close I could smell the peanut butter on his breath. It smelled nice. \u201cYou took me by surprise, Ara. It was all I\u2019d ever wanted, you know? I\u2019d imagined it so many times and, when it finally happened, I acted like a damn fool. And I lost you. I had to accept that you were being dragged away from me, had to accept that you wouldn\u2019t even speak to me, and then, worse, had to break apart hearing you speak about loving another guy. Do you know how hard it was for me to play the supporting friend, when all I wanted to do was coax your naive little mind into believing he didn't want you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn't you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you.\u201d He squeezed my hands. \u201cI wanted you to be happy, and you sounded happy with him. But...I don't know now, Ara. I'm glad he\u2019s gone, because, all I've seen so far is the damage he's done to you.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my hand over my neck. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that, you know. He loved me.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d I asked conceitedly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I uh\u2014\u201d He scratched his brow. \u201cI have a confession to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders dropped. \u201cI stole David\u2019s number from your phone and...I called him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>His arched brow gave half the answer. \u201cCome on, Ara. Why do you think? I\u2019m not stupid. I\u2019ve watched you pretending to be happy, but I knew there was something up with you. I\u2019ve known you all your life. I knew he was hurting you. And I was afraid he might be one of those controlling types; you know, who makes you feel like you need him to feel good about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike? He\u2019s so not like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He smiled and flattened my frown with his thumb. \u201cHe\u2019s a decent guy, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, when you talked to him,\u201d I asked delicately, \u201clike, what...what did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me he\u2019s leaving\u2014that you couldn\u2019t be together. He told me you wanted a family one day and a normal life, but he couldn\u2019t give you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d his words echoed in my mind, \u201c\u2014he...what, he told you to have me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that, Ar.\u201d Mike rolled his head to one side. \u201cHe just said he knows I\u2019ll make you happy and that\u2019s all he ever wanted for you.\u201d</p><p>David gave me away?</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad, Ara.\u201d</p><p>Mad? I wasn't mad that he called David. I felt hurt that he knew everything\u2014embarrassed, but it wasn\u2019t Mike\u2019s fault. It was so like him to do this. He was my protector\u2014he always had been. My best friend. My Zorro. \u201cI'm not mad at you, Mike. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don't be mad at David, either, baby.\u201d His fingers tightened over my hand. \u201cHe just wants you to have a\u2014a normal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think you can give me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, I\u2019ll give you everything. I\u2019ll be whatever you want me to be. I\u2019ll be a husband, a father to our children, a provider, a protector, but most of all, Ara, if you say you\u2019ll marry me, I will love you\u2014more than anyone has ever been loved in the history of mankind, and I will devote every breath I take to being the best husband you could ever have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about what you want, Mike? I don\u2019t want you to be what I want. I want you to be happy, too. I mean, do you even want children?\u201d We\u2019d never discussed that. Mike was good with kids\u2014he always adored Harry, but never spoke of wanting a family.</p><p>He took a breath, lifting his shoulders as he did. \u201cAll I ever wanted was you, baby girl\u2014a thousand times over and every day for the rest of my existence. I\u2019ve never really thought about kids before.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, looking down at my fingers.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d His gaze settled on my belly, lost in a smile.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIf I could place a piece of myself inside of you and\u2014\u201d he lifted my top and traced little circles around my navel, \u201c\u2014and that would grow, and become something so beautiful as life\u2014a life that\u2019s a part of you and me, combined? I can\u2019t imagine something more magical. So, yes.\u201d He broke eye contact for a second and reached into his nightstand, closing the drawer with his pinkie after. \u201cI want to have babies\u2014with you. I want a hundred little dark-haired, blue-eyed babies running around, and you and me, we\u2019ll be together. We\u2019ll have each other. Always. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>The breath I finally released quivered its way out.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Mike slipped off the bed and knelt in front of me, lifting the lid just a fraction on a small purple box. \u201cMake me the happiest man on the planet, Ara. Marry me.\u201d</p><p>Every flower that once was dead bloomed within my heart, and the ashes of my soul circled in on the breeze, finding breath, light among the darkness. I looked into the small box, and a red blossom shimmered back; a ruby rose, with two emeralds on either side. A promise in the shape of life, disguised as the colour of blood\u2014a colour so exquisite in the shadowed parts of my broken past that it cast a spotlight on the door to a future I thought was gone\u2014a door that opened by the key of one word.</p><p>Mike and I belonged together; we were two souls from the same world.</p><p>But my heart...would it always truly belong to David?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered so quietly that Mike\u2019s eyes focused on my lips.</p><p>\u201cDid you just say yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I...yeah, I did.\u201d I could feel the light sparkling off my tears.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, seriously.\u201d I bit my lip.</p><p>Mike laughed, his shaky fingers removing the ring from the box, holding it to the tip of my nail. \u201cI...I have a speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA speech?\u201d</p><p>His cheeks and forehead went pink. \u201cYeah, I uh...I kinda planned this for a while.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, smiling widely. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it then.\u201d</p><p>He cleared the awkwardness from the back of his throat, holding my fingers firmly\u2014almost unintentionally too tight. \u201cI designed this for you, because any other stone, any other ring would never have been perfect enough to tell you how much I love you; how you\u2019re a part of everything I am, and how no matter what I see in the world, I will never see anything that is quite as delicate and perfect and sparkling as you. You\u2019re my girl.\u201d He pointed to the ruby stone. \u201cMy beautiful rose.\u201d</p><p>The ring slid perfectly into place on my finger\u2014fitting like the way Mike fit me, like we were made to go together. I smoothed my fingertip around the gold. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The corners of his eyes softened and he grinned, running his fingers along my forearms, bringing them to rest just on the backs of my elbows. As I parted my legs and let him kneel between them, my confident, womanising best friend became a little rigid, jittery, I suppose\u2014with a kind of schoolboy awkwardness I\u2019d never seen in him before.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, but his eyes held the smile of poorly concealed thoughts.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, seemingly lost for words. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just...I\u2019ve never felt this way before. About anyone. Not like this. I\u2014I just don\u2019t know what to do with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou could...\u201d I swallowed, trying to force down the rising heat in my cheeks. \u201cYou could kiss me. That\u2019s always a start.\u201d</p><p>But he laughed at me instead. \u201cI want to...kiss you. So bad it\u2019s actually causing pain in my chest. But I just don\u2019t wanna get it all wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I pulled his face toward me and closed my eyes tight. He smelled so fresh and sexy\u2014a vibrant, musky cologne. I just wanted to press my face into his neck and breathe him in. \u201cWhat can a kiss hurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything. I\u2019ll go too far. I won\u2019t be able to stop. My knees are shaking, baby\u2014\u201d He laughed and looked down. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted this for too long. It\u2019s taking everything in me right now not to throw you on the bed and tear off your clothes.\u201d He chuckled, but stopped, a frown blending with his smile. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike. Just shut up and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>He looked down into my lap, his shoulders sinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I made him look at me.</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s not home\u2014neither is Vicki.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, I...\u201d He scrunched my shorts up in his fist. \u201cI'm afraid I might want more of you than I should take.\u201d</p><p>My lips split into a perfect grin. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>The breath he was obviously holding burst out of him. \u201cOh, baby. Don't say things like that to a guy who\u2019s trying not to seduce you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just asked me to marry you\u2014that goes beyond seduction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, moving out from between my legs to sit beside me. \u201cThat\u2019s even more of a reason I should be careful with you, Ara. You\u2019re so young and so full of life. I know you want this, baby. I know you\u2019ll ask me to...you know...\u201d He nodded toward me, hinting the obvious.</p> <p>\u201cI would. So what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re seventeen, girl. Wait a few years, at least until we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d I rolled my face into my hand. \u201cNot you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid David put you up to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis no sex before marriage rule?\u201d</p><p>Mike grinned. \u201cHe\u2014he refused you?\u201d</p> <p>My shoulders dropped.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re still a...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgin?\u201d My neck jutted forward with incredulity. \u201cYes, Mike. Oh my God. I can't believe you asked that. And I already told you, at the airport, that I hadn\u2019t...you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, baby, I didn't believe you.\u201d He shrugged, hands out, looking ultimately innocent and sweet.</p><p>By the time my infuriation simmered and I looked over at him, he was shaking his head, smiling down at his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI...I always wanted to be your first.\u201d</p><p>His glittering grin infected my scowl, making me smile. \u201cWell, you could...you know, you could do it now.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, sliding closer, taking my hand. \u201cNo way. You are the only girl left on this planet that still has her innocence. There is no way I'm taking that from you until we have officially tied the knot. We\u2019re gonna do this the right way, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I huffed. \u201cI'm human, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I'm\u2014\u201d I bounced my feet a few times, feeling the heat rise within me. \u201cI'm...I want it, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, I know, but it\u2019d be your first time. Why not just wait, just a bit. Wait \u2018til we\u2019re back home, in a place we both feel comfortable, so I can take my time with you\u2014\u201d His imagination spilled ideas across his face, \u201c\u2014enjoy the first time we get to be naked together; touch you slowly, kiss you in places I only ever dreamed of.\u201d</p><p>I took a quivering breath and moved his hand closer to the apex of my thighs, keeping my fingers twined in his so it seemed like an innocent gesture. He caught on though, and pulled our hands back toward my knees.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to hold firm to this, aren't you?\u201d I said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. But, you\u2019ll thank me one day, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways the upstanding citizen, never the bad boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done the bad boy thing, Ara, with a lot of girls,\u201d he said; we both laughed. \u201cI never respected or loved any one of them, okay? But I love you, and out of respect for you, and for your father, I am not going to have your innocence when you're seventeen, before we get married, in your dad\u2019s house, while he\u2019s at work, earning money to care for you. Okay, so, stop breathing like that and stop moving closer.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>I bit my teeth together and pulled my hand from his so I could fold my arms.</p><p>Mike just laughed at me. \u201cDon't be such a baby. It\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world if we make love, either. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to eat me alive.\u201d Like my last boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cYou mean like the last guy who put his mouth on you?\u201d Mike laughed; I looked up at him quickly, then touched my hand to the aged bruising on my neck again.</p><p>\u201cNot funny, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d But he kept laughing anyway.</p><p>\u201cSo, what now then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d He touched my face and turned it toward him. \u201cNow, I'm going to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d I grinned, so, so ready.</p><p>Inch by inch, his face moved closer to mine, his hot breath sweeping my chin. I swallowed and moistened my lips with my tongue\u2014not daring to breathe, hoping my peanut butter breakfast wasn\u2019t still on my breath. And the smile I gave when Mike tilted his head made him laugh just as our lips touched. Finally touched.</p><p>He was so warm, so solid, so real.</p><p>His stubble scratched against my chin, while the air from his nose brushed over my upper lip, but it was perfect\u2014gentle, loving\u2014not wet or sloppy, like Emily described Spencer\u2019s kiss.</p><p>He closed his lips around my tender pout, held there for just a second, then pulled slowly away, keeping his eyes closed for a second.</p><p>We looked at each other and both broke into a smile.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>My body refused to move\u2014even as he took my rigid hand and ran his thumb over my ring.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I reached for my locket, dropping my hand when I realised it wasn\u2019t there. \u201cI guess...I guess it just sunk in, you know? I\u2019ve kind of been waiting for that kiss since before...\u201d We both knew what came after \u2018before\u2019.</p><p>He cupped my face, his sympathetic gaze easing my soul. \u201cIt\u2019s all okay now, Ara. We\u2019re gonna be fine. We\u2019ll go home, we\u2019ll get married, and everything will be okay again.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but my heart sunk.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I looked at my ring. \u201cMarrying you I'm sure about, but...I don't know if I'm ready to leave Dad, you know. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your dad.\u201d Mike nodded. \u201cI get it. We don't have to think about that part yet, okay? We\u2019ll figure all that out later.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, then kissed my forehead. \u201cHey, I gotta go tell my dad. He\u2019s gonna be so happy I finally asked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I smiled, sweeping the lingering tear from my eye as Mike leaped off the bed and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d He barely got a step away before turning back and kneeling down in front of me again, taking my hand. \u201cYou. Have made me. The happiest man alive.\u201d</p><p>I looked up from our hands and into his smile.</p><p>\u201cI was sure I\u2019d come here to say goodbye,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2014I was ready to leave with a broken heart, but instead, I\u2019ll be bringing yours home with me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, even though one part of that story was wrong. I didn't want to go back to Perth\u2014I wanted to stay here, in New England, where David may one day return.</p><p>As Mike stood up again and walked away, I twisted the ring around on my finger. It was so delicate that if I knocked it the wrong way I was sure it\u2019d break. I was happy though.</p><p>\u201cDad says it\u2019s about time.\u201d Mike popped his head around the corner, phone in hand.</p><p>I grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad. I did.\u201d He turned away again. \u201cNo. Well, I need to be home next week, but we haven\u2019t told Ara\u2019s dad yet.\u201d</p><p>My smile dropped when Mike disappeared down the hall\u2014leaving me alone with my thoughts.</p><p>What would my dad say? He\u2019d probably make me wait until I turned eighteen\u2014or twenty-one. I knew what my mum would\u2019ve said. She\u2019d be happy. Even though I was young. She would\u2019ve been able to see that I loved him; she would\u2019ve taken me shopping for a dress, and....</p><p>I let that thought slip away with the agony it brought.</p><p>What would David say? After all, he wanted this\u2014he gave me away. He must\u2019ve known, when he told Mike to have me, that this would happen.</p><p>I wondered where he was. If he was far away\u2014if he was working in New York, or maybe flying silver planes over pyramids along the Nile. My heart allowed a small smile, thinking of the song he was referring to when he said that. I knew he intended that phrase as a sort of statement. And that made me sad to be wearing an engagement ring to another man.</p><p>But the next thought was a warm one\u2014a happy one, because Mike\u2019s voice, deep and husky, travelled down the hall and into my ears. I could lay all day and listen to him talking\u2014especially knowing he\u2019d come back in here after to see me, because I was his world.</p><p>I looked down at my left hand and traced my fingertip over the ruby. It really was such a pretty ring, and I couldn\u2019t help but to smile at the odd significance of the single red rose.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>A pale blue light filtered between a crack in my curtains, casting shadows of raindrops across my carpet, while memories of David paraded in my mind.</p><p>The celebration dinner Vicki made for Mike and I tonight kept me distracted until I was tired. But all it did to be distracted was make me realise, even deeper, how hard it was going to get to find things every day that made time pass until I grew old and died.</p><p>\u201cI dream about you, you know?\u201d I whispered, imagining David sitting beside me on the bed. \u201cWhen I close my eyes, I see your face. Will it ever stop hurting?\u201d</p><p>The apparition shook his head and reached out to touch me, then, like a cloud of steam brushed away by a hand, he vanished. Only a streak of yellow light remained in his place, filtering in from the hallway. I looked up and smiled at Mike, who leaned against the wall with two steaming mugs in his hands. \u201cYou awake?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The clock beside me said midnight. \u201cI am now,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby. I\u2019ll leave you to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Wait. I\u2019m awake. Please, come in.\u201d My feather quilt ruffled as I sat up.</p><p>He closed the door with his foot and walked through the darkness to my bedside. The cups clinked together on the nightstand, and as my eyes adjusted to the dim light, I noticed his look of concern.</p><p>\u201cMike? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were quiet tonight\u2014at dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cIs something bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think there\u2019s something bothering me? Maybe I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, come on. Don\u2019t play games with me. I\u2019m the one person in the world you can say anything to\u2014without consequence.\u201d He placed the warm mug in my hand, securing my fingers around it before letting go. \u201cDon\u2019t try to lie to me.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and looked down at the creamy layer of warmed milk, forming a white coating of froth in the mug. \u201cI was in love with him, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d He nodded after a deep breath, sitting down. \u201cI know. And I know you probably always will be. I do understand that, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d I asked slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s...I mean, how can you want to be with me\u2014knowing I\u2019ll always have another man in my heart?\u201d</p><p>He paused, and thought changed his expression. \u201cAra, I love you\u2014everything about you\u2014past, present, future. He was obviously a big part of your life the last few months and, you know, he kept you safe while I wasn\u2019t here,\u201d he said simply. \u201cSo, if you always have a place for him in your heart, baby, that\u2019s something I can live with.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with liquid. I smiled down at my hot chocolate, then took a sip through my teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how happy I am to see this on you.\u201d Mike unfolded my ring hand from the cup, pressing his thumb firmly to the stone. \u201cI dug it out so many times, practiced my speech, then put it away again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you had it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh\u2014I designed it when I was seventeen\u2014\u201d He scratched the back of his head. \u201cAra, I\u2019ve been in love with you for forever. I was just too stupid to do anything about it. So, finally, about a year ago, I took the design to a jeweller and had it made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year? God, you are stupid,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>He sighed a few times, opening his mouth to speak then stopping, until finally, he quietly said, \u201cYour mum said the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean Vicki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI mean, yes, Vicki knew about the ring\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh, I told them about a month ago\u2014\u201d And suddenly, her strange behaviour toward Mike made so much sense, \u201c\u2014But, I was talking about your real mum.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the ring. \u201cDid she get to see it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe cried.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, she approved?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOf course. She practically had us betrothed from the day you were born, Ara.\u201d</p><p>The soft smile I gave felt nice across my mouth; I liked smiling, especially for my mum. \u201cWell, it\u2019s easily the most immaculate ring I\u2019ve ever seen, Mike. I can\u2019t believe you designed this\u2014for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re my beautiful rose.\u201d He laughed then\u2014at himself, I think. \u201cLook at me, Mike the poet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like poetry. I\u2019ve always been a sucker for a romantic.\u201d I placed my cup on the nightstand next to Mike\u2019s.</p> <p>Mike smiled. \u201cSquidge over.\u201d</p><p>I moved to the cold side of the bed, letting him slip beneath my covers, coming to rest my cheek against his ultra warm chest. He felt so different from David; he was bulkier, warmer, and the sound of his heart beating in his chest brought a kind of fear to my own\u2014knowing it could break or stop beating by the smallest, stupidest mistakes. But the humanness of Mike made me feel oddly safe in a way I hadn\u2019t always felt with David. I was comfortable with him\u2014we matched. Mike was my human match.</p><p>Mike\u2019s arms relaxed heavily around me, like wearing a bead-filled doorstop as a hug. \u201cAre you excited about the ball?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I nodded, drifting away to the sound of his deep, constant breath.</p><p>This would be my life from now on, and I had to admit, after all the pain, after all the loss and loneliness, it finally felt like I could breathe.</p><p>A semi-conscious dream stole my eyes to the images in the back of my mind; I rolled my face up once more to smile at Mike, see what he thought of my dream, but he couldn\u2019t see it, and while that was reassuring in a way, it also made me feel a little...lonely.</p> <p>I slipped back into my dream, walking down a long aisle toward my destiny\u2014toward Mike. I tried so hard to picture David there in Mike\u2019s place but I couldn\u2019t. It was Mike. It had always been Mike.</p><p>As I stood beside him, I pulled the red rose from my bouquet and gave it to him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need this anymore, Ara.\u201d He kissed my lips and let the rose fall to the floor. \u201cEvery part of your heat belongs to me now.\u201d</p><p>I watched the red petals hit the ground, then looked up into his smile. \u201cFrom this day on\u2014for always,\u201d I said.</p><p>He nodded, reaching for me, and as I rolled my face into his hand, I jumped back with the cold shock of electricity through my cheek, waking to the feel of icy skin and a familiar sweet scent hiding under the shadows of dawn. \u201cDavid?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>No one replied.</p><p>I jumped out from the warmth of Mike\u2019s arms and ran for the window, stopping dead, seeing a yellow rose on the windowsill. My ruby ring suddenly felt heavy\u2014almost as if I was wearing the pain in my soul; I picked up the cold, thornless blossom and pressed it to my nose, spotting my iPod on the sill underneath it. Our lives, every inch of our journey had been mapped out in song on that device\u2014from the first time I saw him and fell in love with him, through the days of wondering if he loved me, to the heartache of knowing he only loved me enough to leave me for my own good, and finally, to losing him. It would do me no good to listen to that playlist again, even though I knew that\u2019s what David wanted. But I just couldn\u2019t live my life in the past anymore. I had to find a way to move forward.</p><p>The street below was desolate and quiet, no sign of David having been or gone. The dawn sky looked cold and grey, like the world was readying itself for rain, and all the streets were empty, the lights still on along the footpath, while a soft red glow outlined the mountains to the east.</p> <p>I looked over at Mike, sleeping peacefully, and drew in the sweet pear scent of the rose once more. Then, as I went to press the Home button on my iPod, noticed a new playlist there, titled \u201cAra\u201d. It only had one song, so I stuffed my earphones in and pressed play; I could move forward tomorrow. Today, I just wanted to be closer to David by thinking about him\u2014pain or none.</p><p>A delicate piano told a sad story, making my heart ache in the first bar. I pushed open my window, leaning on the frame as the words began; I\u2019d never heard this song before. I knew David liked John Mayer, but he\u2019d never even said which song was his favourite. I wondered why he put this one on my iPod and no other song. And then I listened more carefully to the words, relating instantly to the feeling; falling asleep thinking about the one you love\u2014your heart so broken because they\u2019re gone. You dream, for a moment, that they\u2019re right beside you\u2014that everything in the world is finally all right. But the warmth of their hand, the clear memory of their smile dissipates suddenly, destroyed by waking. It almost makes you want to sleep for the rest of your life so you can be together.</p><p>I checked the title of the song again, smiling. Appropriate. \u201cDreaming With A Broken Heart.\u201d</p><p>Tiny bumps of chill dotted my belly with the kiss of a cool breeze, and the sun touched the earth just over the horizon, warming everything around me; the treetops became pink and gold, and orange leaves floated softly down to the ground, like autumn snow.</p><p>I pinched three of the yellow petals from the stem of the rose and held them out over the lip of the window frame; one for my heart; one for my soul; one for eternity. They all belonged to David. Each and every bit of me would always be his\u2014no matter what my dreams may tell me.</p><p>When the wind swept past my window again, I flicked the petals into the day; they floated up into the air, making circles on the breeze, following the autumn leaves to the old oak tree in the garden, finally resting, with one last kiss from the wind, right on the seat of the swing.</p><p>\u201cI love you, David. Forever,\u201d I whispered into the nothing, reluctantly shutting my window on the stormy wind. A tear rolled down my cheek as I looked up to the sky and saw one, single star sparkling out above the waking world, almost like it was David watching over me.</p><p>\u201cMake a wish.\u201d Strong arms wrapped my waist from behind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in wishes anymore, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll make one for you, then.\u201d He squeezed me tighter, then crossed his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you wish?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t tell you. It won\u2019t come true.\u201d He pressed his hands to my waist and turned me around, slowly plucking my earphones from my ears. \u201cWhy are you crying, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>I sniffed back the runny liquid in my nose. \u201cSo much has happened. Everything\u2019s changing for me now, Mike. Sometimes, I feel like I\u2019m losing control of it all\u2014like it just goes too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does go fast, princess,\u201d he said; I looked down. \u201cBut, that\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to make the most of every day. To love whole-heartedly\u2014\u201d he kissed my forehead, \u201c\u2014to laugh at stupid jokes\u2014\u201d he kissed my nose, \u201c\u2014and to find the good in every moment; happy or sad or difficult.\u201d He pulled back for a second as he moved in to kiss my lips and added one more thing, \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to be here to do it all with you. For the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, nodding. \u201cI love you, Mike.\u201d</p><p>My phone forced me to get up off my back, leave my comfy pillow behind and wander across to my desk. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Em. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. I need you to do me a favour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Anything,\u201d I said, peeling the curtain back with my fingertip, looking down over the evening.</p><p>\u201cI...I kind of need you to tell Spencer I can\u2019t go to the ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I screeched. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you go\u2014and why can\u2019t you tell Spence yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe...well...I was kind of going to get you to tell him I have laryngitis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell him I can\u2019t go. I just...I think I might cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm, I don\u2019t get it. Why aren\u2019t you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got a dress, Ara.\u201d She started crying. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even have anything old in my wardrobe. My mom cleaned everything out a few months ago and donated it all to charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only have this ugly red thing that I wore when I was twelve. And I can\u2019t go to the ball in a dress that short, either. I\u2019ll look like a hussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Sam said, popping his head around the wall.</p><p>\u201cHang on, Em.\u201d I looked over at Sam, covering the mouthpiece of the phone. \u201cWhat are you doing in my wardrobe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I borrow your hair gel?\u201d</p><p>I raised a brow at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He stepped into my room, grinning. \u201cI got a date tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date?\u201d I smirked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Can I use it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But shut that bathroom door. I\u2019m talking girl stuff.\u201d</p><p>He walked off, starting up the hairdryer in the bathroom, but didn\u2019t shut the door.</p><p>\u201cArgh. Sorry, Em. Pest control.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>I walked into my wardrobe and glared at Sam through the bathroom mirror. \u201cI told you to shut this door.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSo shut it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d I slammed it behind me and stormed out of my wardrobe, but a flash of blue fabric on the hook caught my eye, and as I thought back to the night David forced me to accept that dress, an epiphany hit me like a rock in the head. \u201cOh my God. Em!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome over. Right now. I have a dress for you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even get to say anything. I hung up the phone and ran downstairs to wait for her, opening the door seven minutes later to a solemn-looking Emily.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said.</p><p>I gave her a hug, and she smiled as she pulled away\u2014but not at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, girls,\u201d Mike said, sitting on the stairs behind me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mike,\u201d Emily said, her cheeks going pink.</p><p>\u201cYou back for another shaking?\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass,\u201d she said sheepishly. \u201cYou know, you look kind of different when you\u2019re not mad with worry.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cYeah, guess it\u2019s easier to see my face when I\u2019m not towering over you, badgering for information on missing girls.\u201d He cast a raised brow my way.</p><p>Emily giggled. \u201cIt was okay. You didn\u2019t actually shake me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, enough small talk.\u201d I grabbed Em\u2019s hand. \u201cCome see your dress.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed as we rushed past him, then slammed my bedroom door behind us.</p><p>\u201cNow, close your eyes\u2014and stay here.\u201d I held out a warning finger.</p><p>\u201cCan't go far with my eyes closed,\u201d she said.</p><p>I left her by my bed while I ran to the wardrobe to get the green dress, and came back, holding it against my body. \u201cOkay. You can look.\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s eyes lit up and her mouth popped open as she ran toward me\u2014well, to the dress. \u201cOh, my God, Ara. This is perfect. Where did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad it for ages.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCan I try it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, dummy, that\u2019s why I asked you over. Here.\u201d I handed her the dress and directed her to my wardrobe. \u201cI hope it fits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like it will,\u201d she said, her voice muffled under a shirt or something.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re the same size, so it should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for this, Ara. I just haven\u2019t found anything I love enough to wear, but I think this\u2014\u201d She stepped out and her beauty struck me. \u201cMight do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but to rush over and hug her. \u201cHow perfect is this on you\u2014oh my God!\u201d</p><p>She readjusted the shoestring strap on her shoulder and spun slowly to show the low back, scooping down just past the purple cotton undies she had on today, while the shimmering emerald green hugged her curves, making her skin look like liquid satin.</p><p>\u201cI hate you, you know.\u201d I sighed enviously, folding my arms. \u201cIt never looked that good on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I\u2019m sorry, Ara. But I do love it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine? Ara, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. I want you to have it. It was\u2014\u201d I shook my head, looking for the right words \u201c\u2014meant for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She reached out; I hugged her again. \u201cI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Come on\u2014\u201d I took her hand, leading her to the door, \u201c\u2014we have to show Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She pulled back a little. \u201cAre...are you sure it looks good? I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm. It\u2019s great. Stop worrying.\u201d I stuck my head around the corner. \u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He flashed a really sexy grin, stopping just as he was headed down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you think?\u201d</p><p>When I pulled Emily around the corner, Mike tilted his head to one side. \u201cWow. Yeah, that\u2019s a great dress. Do a spin,\u201d he said, twirling his finger in the air. Emily spun around. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Ara. Perhaps I\u2019m marrying the wrong girl.\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s head whipped up; she looked at me, her mouth falling open. \u201cMarrying? Did he say marrying?\u201d</p><p>I shot a death glare at Mike. \u201cUm, yeah. We\u2019re...Mike asked me to marry him,\u201d I said, fraying my fingers to show my ring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Emily squealed, grabbing my hand; Mike rubbed his ear with his finger. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She pressed both thumbs to my ruby, becoming seemingly smaller from the shoulders down. \u201cAnd...what about David?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014out of the picture,\u201d Mike said softly, but very politely.</p><p>Emily\u2019s eyes screamed her true thoughts. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just, like, so great, Ara. I\u2019m so happy for you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna...\u201d Mike jerked his thumb toward the stairs and walked a few steps backward before fleeing with the speed of a man in trouble. Oh, wait\u2014he was in trouble!</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d I closed my bedroom door, then spun around to look at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d her voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cI already told you, Em.\u201d I sat on the bed, shifting Emily\u2019s jacket out of the way. \u201cDavid and I broke up. Why are you so surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, you were supposed to meet again one day, on a windy autumn morning, and fall in love all over again. Not go and marry another man!\u201d She pointed to my door.</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d I chuckled. \u201cThis isn't a fairy-tale.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me for a long moment, then threw her hands up in the air. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to you, Ara. You know, he loved you. Why should kids or careers or anything stop you from being together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the kid thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what else is there?\u201d She sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cHe...he has things in his life that he doesn\u2019t want me a part of\u2014that I don't want to be a part of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>I raised a brow at her. \u201cEm, come on, you know David's got secrets.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cSo, you can't love him if he has secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d I stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s that I can't be with him now I know those secrets.\u201d</p><p>She stood too. \u201cAre you kidding me? His inner demons are stopping you from being together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d In a roundabout way.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not love then, Ara. It never was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Emily. You don\u2019t anything about what I felt for him.\u201d</p><p>She doubled back a little.</p><p>\u201cLook, I'm sorry.\u201d I dropped my arms to my sides and slumped on the bed. \u201cI'm just tired of people thinking they know my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn't saying I did. I just...I just don't get it, you know. You wanted him so bad. I remember you telling me you\u2019d give anything if he\u2019d just ask you out. What changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heart.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI gotta know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, confused, as she reached into her bag and pulled out her phone.</p><p>\u201cI gotta ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk who what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk David what he did that\u2019s so terrible it\u2019s destroyed this magic love I thought you guys had.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cHe\u2019ll never answer his phone, Emily. He\u2019s probably got a new number.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, holding her phone to her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s ringing.\u201d</p><p>I tensed. What if he answered? What then?</p><p>I felt my toes edge, turning in preparation to run and snatch the phone.</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d She practically screeched, almost projecting forward. \u201cHi, um, I\u2014uh\u2014where\u2019s David?\u201d</p><p>I tried to force my brow into a dismissive position to hide my obvious confusion at the way she spoke to Jason\u2014like she\u2019d known him for years, or had, at the very least, met him before.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me where he is,\u201d she said, then went quiet. \u201cWell, does he know what Ara\u2019s gone and done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>She bit her lip, ignoring me, then nodded\u2014to herself, I think. \u201cShe\u2019s marrying him, Jason.\u201d</p><p>I gathered, from the look on her face, that Jason didn't really have a lot to say about it. And why would he?</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s your brother.\u201d She hung up the phone and looked at me; I felt like a school kid in big trouble from the principal. \u201cYou are the stupidest girl I've ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! I am not. I'm just trying to be happy.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, conceit littering her smile. \u201cBy living without David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that just makes you even dumber than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. Stay out of it, Em. It\u2019s my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m your friend. That means I get to tell you when you\u2019re being a dumb cow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Emily, I\u2019m being sensible. I\u2019m doing what any normal, sane teenager should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point! Don\u2019t you get it? You\u2019re a teenager. You don\u2019t have to make smart choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, exactly. And I have the freedom to say and do stupid things, because I\u2019m young, Ara. And so are you. And if you let love go now for reasons only an adult would care about, you\u2019ll regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you know about regret? You\u2019re the same age as me.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her feet. \u201cI have my regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, for me, David won\u2019t be one of them. It\u2019d be worse if I stayed with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d She tossed her phone onto my bed. \u201cDo you need a brain scan or something? It\u2019s David!\u201d She waved flat palms at me. \u201cDavid freakin Knight, Ara, not just some random guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stop it, Em. Okay!\u201d I thrust my body forward a little, tightly holding back tears. \u201cHe\u2019s gone! He\u2019s not coming back, and I don\u2019t want to talk about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you know you should have gone with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does it matter to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was my friend, Ara. I cared about him. And I care about you, too. God only knows why I bother, because you obviously don't care about yourself.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, looking away.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, okay,\u201d she said. \u201cI just...I\u2019ve never really had close friends before and, I mean, David was my first one. He was the first person that ever understood me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, or read your mind.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2014\u201d she continued. \u201cYou became my friend because you actually liked me. Not because I was popular or knew all the guys. You actually liked me, Ara, and I don't have any other friends like you and...\u201d Her lip quivered. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna take you back to Australia, isn't he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to,\u201d I said, unable to look at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd what then? Then I\u2019ll have no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have Alana.\u201d</p><p>She swiped her tears and sat on my bed. I sat down beside her.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, too.\u201d She took my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to interfere, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou care?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like how he calls you baby and girl all the time.\u201d Her nose crinkled. \u201cDon\u2019t you find it degrading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s not trying to control me or own me by using a pet name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not his pet. That\u2019s just the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t treat me like a pet, either. It\u2019s a term of endearment. I, unlike you, have an appreciation for verbal affection.\u201d</p><p>She laughed through her nose. \u201cYou sound like David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He says stuff like that all the time.\u201d She softened. \u201cEr, well, said.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cGuess he was starting to rub off on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started out as a way to tease me, you know.\u201d I smiled at a distant memory.</p><p>\u201cWhat was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby. The way Mike always calls me baby. It started because he was always faster, stronger and smarter than me. No matter how hard I tried, I could never beat him at any game or race or anything. So I\u2019d sulk.\u201d I shrugged again. \u201cHe\u2019d always call me a baby, then, after a while, he just started saying it after pretty much everything he said, until one day it changed\u2014there was a warmth behind the word that hadn\u2019t been there before, and I\u2014\u201d I smiled, \u201c\u2014I kinda liked that. It made me feel special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I know what you mean. We kind of let almost anything go when they make us feel special, don\u2019t we?\u201d Em twiddled her fingers in her lap, then exhaled and stood up. \u201cBut, let the record show; I don\u2019t like Mike. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre in my world,\u201d I scoffed. \u201cSo, anyway, how do you know Jason?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, going a little pale.</p><p>\u201cOh, now you have to tell me,\u201d I said, pointing at her.</p><p>She turned away and walked over to my window, heavy, as though gravity gifted her with iron legs.</p><p>\u201cEm, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Ara. Really. It was just a summer fling\u2014it ended.\u201d She braved a teary glance at me as I stood beside her.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d I said.</p><p>The corners of her lips twitched, turning downward. \u201cI was in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d She grabbed a tissue from my desk and wiped her nose, nodding. \u201cWe dated for the summer and then, when it got cold and the fun of the sunshine disappeared, he just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft? As in\u2014he moved, or he just didn\u2019t come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust gone.\u201d She stood back, wiping her face again.</p><p>\u201cReally? Without a goodbye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you hear how fast my heart is beating?\u201d She touched her chest. \u201cThat was the first time I\u2019ve heard his voice in nearly a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, he never even left a note to say where he\u2019d gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014that was the worst part. He just didn\u2019t show for our date and stopped answering his phone. I asked David if he knew what was going on, but he said his brother was a player\u2014that I\u2019d just been one of his victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictims? That\u2019s a pretty cruel way to put it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDavid had a way with words.\u201d</p><p>We both laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he did,\u201d I said. \u201cActually, he told me his brother was a bit...malevolent. Why would you be with a guy like that, Em? You\u2019re gorgeous, you can do better.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled. \u201cThat\u2019s just it; he wasn't like that at all. I don't know what David was talking about, but Jason was really sweet.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Brotherly love. I guess it was the same as me telling everyone Sam was a troll. He wasn\u2019t actually a troll. And I was glad for that\u2014that Jason wasn\u2019t...malevolent. I could never picture David's twin being a creepy, stalking vampire. I tried so many times, but putting the face of David on anything cruel just never fit. \u201cSo, is it true they\u2019re identical?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYep. Like, perfectly identical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been hard for you then\u2014after Jason left, you know, being friends with David\u2014always seeing his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. They were very different people. David was cute, but he had boundaries you couldn't cross. You could never be, like...relaxed with him.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d She gave a soft, distant smile. \u201cI really do. It was the same with Jason and I. People always seemed to avoid him, you know, and I just didn't see what they saw.\u201d</p><p>The predator.</p><p>\u201cHe was gentle and loving and...\u201d She looked at my bed then. \u201cHe jumped through my window on the morning of our six-week anniversary and filled my room with frangipanis, waking me up by running one over my face.\u201d Her fingers traced the memory over her skin. \u201cI loved him, enough that we talked about growing old together and what we\u2019d name our kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then winter came.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYep. Literally.\u201d</p><p>I wished I could tell her about the Set laws and vampire migration. She probably blamed herself, deep down inside, for making him leave. \u201cGuys do that,\u201d I said instead. \u201cSummer flings.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hand from the fold of her arms and wiped another tear, nodding. \u201cIt just hurt to think we had something special\u2014only to find out it was just a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you really believe? That he didn't love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never used to believe it\u2014never wanted to. But it has to be the case. You don't just walk out on those you love.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cMaybe he was like David\u2014maybe he had secrets, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think they\u2019re both just assholes. I mean, how could David just go and leave like that, too? He saw how broken I was when Jason left\u2014he was the one who picked up the pieces. Surely, he must know what he\u2019s done. Why couldn\u2019t he have just said goodbye\u2014at least to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he just thinks it\u2019s better this way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBetter for who?\u201d</p><p>I clicked my tongue. \u201cI wish I could fix this, Em.

They're gone and we just have to move on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I said, waving my ring hand in front of her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI guess I see your point now. But...David still wants you, Ara. I\u2019m sure of it. If I had that choice\u2014with Jason\u2014I would\u2019ve taken it. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I rubbed her back gently. \u201cDo you think he still thinks about you\u2014Jason?\u201d</p><p>Emily stood quietly with her arms folded, her eyes on the dreary day. \u201cI hope so. I think about him from time to time. You never genuinely get over your first love, Ara. This\u2014\u201d She lifted my ring hand. \u201cThis will be a long journey for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nodded. \u201cTrust me, I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust...\u201d she took a breath, \u201c\u2014if Mike steals you away, takes you back to Oz, will we still be friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, dragging the word out. \u201cI think we\u2019ll always be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d She hugged me. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. You\u2019re so real, you know, you just, you\u2019re honest with who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d I half groaned.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, you have this weird bad joke thing, you dress how you wanna dress, and you tell it to me straight\u2014you aren\u2019t even pretending not to be in love with David, even though you\u2019re marrying another man. I think that\u2019s really cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks, Em.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, what does Mike think\u2014about David? Does he know how you feel?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s okay with it.\u201d</p><p>Emily sighed and looked out the window again. \u201cI really don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like him, Em. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but, I think that\u2014\u201d she hesitated, \u201c\u2014if he weren\u2019t here, you would\u2019ve gone with David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNup.\u201d I shook my head with certainty. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>She suppressed a conceited smile and shrugged one shoulder. \u201cI think you would.\u201d</p><p>As I waved goodbye to Emily, Mike stood behind me with one hand in the small of my back and the other waving. \u201cShe hates me,\u201d he said as her car disappeared down the street.</p> <p>\u201cNo. She just doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d I turned and closed the front door. \u201cShe thought David and I were a sure thing. And so, all of this\u2014\u201d I held up my ring hand, \u201c\u2014is a little sudden for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. No offence taken. So?\u201d He stood taller and grinned. \u201cTerminator or The Mummy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou choose. I\u2019ll get popcorn.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>Mike walked up the stairs and when the door to his room closed, I headed into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, honey.\u201d He looked up from his newspaper for a second.</p><p>\u201cAny good news?\u201d I asked, opening the pantry.</p><p>\u201cNo news is the only good news,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou know, Mum still said that all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d he said absently, staring up blankly at the wall.</p><p>Poor Dad. With a soft sigh, I walked over to sit on the chair beside him. \u201cHow long, Dad? Before you stopped missing her when she left?\u201d</p><p>He sniffed once and folded his paper, smoothing it out on the table. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>He looked into my eyes then. \u201cI never stopped missing your mother. Sure, after about ten years or so it got easier to bear, but I still miss her, even now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked out the front window.</p><p>\u201cI did wrong by her, Ara. I made one stupid mistake and I lost her. But when you love someone, like I loved her, you will always miss them. I try not to think of her if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you love Vicki, right? Doesn\u2019t that make it easier?\u201d</p><p>He nodded thoughtfully. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t go back and beg your mom to forgive me. I did love Vicki\u2014do love Vicki, I mean,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut, I loved your mom, too.\u201d</p><p>It hurt to hear him speak of her in the past tense like that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever truly get over losing someone you love. But, it gets easier after time passes, and you can get through the days without missing them so much,\u201d he added, probably in response to my horrified expression. He couldn\u2019t know how much I was relating his story to my own experiences with boys. He was the only person I could think of that suffered a loss as great as mine. I needed to know if there was a life after love\u2014after true love. \u201cIs this about David?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d I smiled at the table.</p><p>\u201cAra, Mike loves you. He\u2019s been trying to ask you to marry him for the last year.\u201d Dad cupped his hand over mine. \u201cHe was so worried you\u2019d turn him down that he almost asked me to ask you for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, honey. Look, I know you love David, but you loved Mike first\u2014and if you thought you could move on from love once, then there\u2019s a good chance you can do it again, right?\u201d He patted my hand.</p><p>He was right. It was just going to take some time. But, of course I\u2019d move on\u2014eventually. Nothing ever lasted forever, right? \u201cSee? That\u2019s why you\u2019re a teacher, Dad. The all-knowing.\u201d I waved my hands around in the air, then stood up and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cLove you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>I turned back to his insistent tone. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI uh...I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d I sat back down.</p><p>\u201cI received a call today\u2014from Ray Bougerstern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I slammed my palms on the table and stood up.</p><p>\u201cAra. Sit back down. We need to discuss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d I felt the blanket of fury wrap my shoulders. \u201cMike\u2019s waiting for me to watch a mo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll wait. You can\u2019t keep avoiding this. The insurance policy has cleared the account. I need to know what you want me to do with the money.\u201d</p><p>My lip quivered as I looked down at my feet. Blood money. The money a company paid out because my mother no longer existed. A consolation. Condolences in the form of green notes. \u201cKeep it. Give it to Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. Your mother took that policy out so that you could take care of yourself if she were no longer around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that without money, Dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d his voice grumbled, peaking above anger. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, Ara-Rose. She\u2019s not coming back, no matter what tortures you inflict on yourself. No amount of your own suffering will change what happened.\u201d He reached for my hand; I kept it tight in the fold of my arms, biting my lip. \u201cHoney, just take the money. Use it to start your life. Use it to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to let this go, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t wanted to bring it up again. I know it\u2019s hard for you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust put it in a trust fund,\u201d I said finally. \u201cPut it in a high interest account until I turn eighteen or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dad said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d I spun on my heel and stormed away.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>Something about the lazy tone of the day made me edgy. Dad and Mike played chess in the formal dining room, Vicki hung laundry on the clothesline, and Sam stood talking to Mr Warner over the fence. My old companion, the swing, rocked gently under me while I strummed my way through months of painful memories, trying to find some sense in it all.</p><p>My life had changed so quickly; from being a normal teenager, going to school, practicing for my big ballet recital, to losing my family, then my first true love, all while discovering the existence of monsters.</p><p>Perhaps that was it. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t the calm quiet that had my gut churning. Perhaps it was the monster called truth\u2014the knowing in my heart that tonight, on the last stroke of midnight, the part of me that wouldn\u2019t believe David was gone would turn, look up at the clock tower on the chamber building and hope he\u2019d tap me on the shoulder and ask me to dance. But it was only a hope. Both me and myself knew he wouldn't show.</p><p>Vicki looked over, shaking her head. \u201cAra, dear, you should be inside doing your makeup.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, tuning my guitar. \u201cI don\u2019t need makeup under a mask, Vicki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. It\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>But I fazed her out, strumming random chords while the representation of my confused brain paced around in my head, calling himself Holmes. Nothing really made sense anymore. When things happen in life, after time passes, I could usually always see some reason, some lesson I needed to learn from it. But losing my mum, moving here to meet my first true love, then losing him, too, made no sense at all. It all just seemed pointless.</p><p>I dropped my fingers from their position on the strings, letting the song die without a name. The whole world seemed pointless. But I couldn\u2019t let my mind wander that path; the trying-to-find-meanings-or-reasons-for-life path. Every time I walked that road, I came to the same conclusions, leaving that train of thought with nothing more than a large suitcase of frustration. Perhaps we were here to love, or to experience many trials\u2014or maybe even to feel. I didn\u2019t know. Pain was the only one that even touched the reality of living. So, maybe the meaning of life was to cram as much pain and heartache as we could into the puny timeline of our miserable existence.</p><p>Satisfied with that dismal conclusion, I started playing again, watching through the window as Dad and Mike played chess. It was like looking across the waters of reflection, reading the story of my life; two elements of my past\u2014from different worlds\u2014coming together in battle. They moved in slow motion; Mike rolling his head back, laughing at Dad\u2019s witty move; Dad coughing into his hand at Mike\u2019s reaction. And it occurred to me then, as I watched their hands meet in the offer of peace, that this was it. That was my Dad and my fianc\u00e9. There would be no more boys for me. Mike would be my first\u2014and my last. A chapter of my life had ended before it even began.</p><p>Perhaps that\u2019s why my dad liked Mike so much; he\u2019d never have to worry about me ending up with a loser\u2014or alone. But that didn\u2019t save me from eternal loneliness.</p><p>Losing my soul to the calm whisper of the breeze and the warm September sun, I hummed softly, singing a few of the words to a song\u2014one that made my soul ache to hear, but to play, only seemed to bring clarity. \u201cI wish I could see you, but you went away; you left me defenceless, in the cold and the rain. I found my way home, and the world was all right, \u2018til the darkness came, and took my knight.</p><p>\u201cWhen I look in the mirror, the face that I see, wears the scars of her past well, but she isn\u2019t me. I lost myself somewhere, when I walked to the light. For the darkness came and took my knight.\u201d</p><p>The melody rang in my ears, forcing a tiny, stinging tear to the corner of my eye. I never cared much for the words before, but today, it seemed they were written just for me.</p><p>By my foot, a grey fluff-ball meowed, forcing his spine against my ankle. \u201cFeel like flying up into a tree, Skitz?\u201d I joked with a weak smile as I placed the guitar on the ground and let my heart sink down with it.</p><p>The cat looked up at me, his big, yellow eyes soft and round.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I chuckled lightly. \u201cMaybe I like you a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope you like me a lot\u2014since you\u2019re marrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mike? Did you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He placed his hand down on the grass, the rest of his body sinking into it. Skittles leaped onto his front paws, ready to run if Mike was a threat, but then just closed his eyes, without re-adjusting his position, and started purring. Mike laughed at him. \u201cYour dad\u2019s too quick. He beat me twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never beat my mum, you know? Not once,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not upstairs putting on your war paint?\u201d</p><p>His soft tone provoked my tears; I forced them back with a shrug. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long once I start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He picked a strand of grass and curled it around his finger.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s hm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this, baby? It\u2019s not too late to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange my mind? About what?\u201d</p><p>Mike pushed up off the ground, shuffling over to kneel in front of me. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to marry me. I\u2019ll be okay if you say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think I don't want to marry you?\u201d</p><p>A watery glaze glimmered under the light of the sun in his eyes. \u201cSince I asked you, you haven\u2019t been happy. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But is trying enough, Ara? Am I enough?\u201d The pain in his words came through with the firm clasp of his fingers around my hips. Mike was scared\u2014I could feel it. He had as much to lose here as I did. I mean, was love enough for this relationship to work, when it wasn\u2019t enough for David and I?</p><p>\u201cI just need to get away from here, I think, Mike.\u201d My voice trembled. \u201cI wanna go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. Baby.\u201d He pulled the swing into him, wrapping me up in his arms. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll go. We\u2019ll leave tomorrow, if you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2014but, I think we better plan it properly first.\u201d I flashed him a grin, which he returned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, baby girl.

It felt good. Normal.</p> <p>I knew I should be with Mike, should go home to Perth\u2014and everything would be right again in the world.</p><p>The quiet whispers of my family lilted up the stairs, carrying my mind back from the hold of a masked stranger\u2019s gaze. Her blue eyes stared out at me from a place and time I no longer belonged. She was the lie after the truth, hiding behind this beauty in a blue dress. And I couldn\u2019t stand the sight of her.</p><p>Somewhere, at some point, I\u2019d split in two. The innocent, dream-believing girl that tragedy left behind disappeared when David ran away with my heart. I was his picture of beauty, created by him, for him, but I\u2019d never feel his cool fingers under the ribbon of my corset, holding me close as we twirled in our graceful, eternal dance. All that was left was the other half of me\u2014the shell. And I\u2019d dusted enough shimmer powder over my skin that I could almost disguise myself as a sparkly vampire. No one could see the depths of my darkness underneath. Except Mike. He knew there was something different\u2014that something had changed. But I bet he never even conceived of the idea that my depression went so deep the fear they all had that I\u2019d top myself was slowly creeping into possibility. I\u2019d overheard him tell my dad he was worried\u2014that I might be depressed. My dad just said it wasn\u2019t a possibility; it was a fact, and all we could do was just be here for me. But the ever-watchful eye of my fianc\u00e9 was getting overbearing. When he came to my room earlier, I called him to enter, completely ignorant to the fact that, while I was standing by my mirror, trying to re-pierce my ear, I was only wearing my underwear and bra.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid.\u201d He grinned, his eyes falling over my bare curves.</p><p>\u201cMike!\u201d I scrambled for something to cover myself with. \u201cShut the door! My dad might walk past.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRelax, baby.\u201d He looked behind him, closing the door, then sauntered across the room. \u201cYou look gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look like a girl in her underwear.\u201d I leaned in front of the mirror again, forcing the silver stud against the unyielding hole in my earlobe. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get this damn thing to go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I glanced away from the mirror long enough to see his smiling eyes trace my shoulders and ribs, fixing on my blue lace undies.</p><p>\u201cNew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bought them to match my dress.\u201d I slapped his hand off my hip.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about this? Have you always had a strapless bra, or is that new too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you look very sexy\u2014\u201d his voice dragged, \u201c\u2014a little too sexy for an unmarried girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d I slapped his hand away again. \u201cI can\u2019t concentrate while you keep doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, let me try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but, good luck.\u201d I placed the earring in his waiting hand. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to get one in that hole for over a week.\u201d</p><p>The warmth of his breath touched my neck as he leaned close, stud in fingertips, and fumbled against my earlobe until I heard a small \u2018pop\u2019. \u201cAll done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I rubbed my ear. It burned a little.</p> <p>\u201cIs the other one okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just this one\u2014it keeps closing. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart wearing your earrings and it won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I hate sleeping in them. So?\u201d I leaned my butt on the dresser, rolling my hand in the air. \u201cDid you want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um\u2014\u201d He unfolded his arms. \u201cI came to see if you were hungry. I uh, I haven\u2019t seen you eat anything today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I haven\u2019t,\u201d I remarked, pushing past him.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d he whined. \u201cWhy, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, maybe if I don\u2019t eat, I\u2019ll die.\u201d I flopped backward on my bed with a huff.</p><p>\u201cAra, grow up, you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d He stood above me, his arms folded.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I also kinda do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d he grabbed my hand and pulled me to sit, \u201c\u2014then you need to get some help, baby. That\u2019s not normal.\u201d</p><p>I forced a smile, tilting my head. \u201cMike. You worry too much. I\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra? Sane girls don\u2019t say they\u2019re trying to starve themselves to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really mean it\u2014not literally.\u201d I stood up. \u201cNow go, let me get dressed or I\u2019ll be going to the ball in my underwear.\u201d I waved my hands down my body.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he scoffed, \u201cyou should. You\u2019d be the belle of the ball, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck up.\u201d I opened my door for him.</p><p>\u201cOh, in case I didn\u2019t mention it,\u201d he said, pecking me on the cheek as he passed, \u201cyou look hot like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have.\u201d I rolled my eyes and shut the door.</p><p>The black and white image fused with colour as my mind came back to the present. All around me, night had fallen into complete silence; the crickets hushed, even the voices downstairs\u2014leaving a kind of stillness that left me breathless, listening carefully for any signs of life. When I looked back at the girl in the mirror, my eyes flashed from her pale face to the wiry shadows behind her, the resonance of a familiar gaze lingering in my immediate memory\u2014a reflection from the world I lived in. My head whipped up. I spun around and ran to grasp my windowsill, hope filling my heart as I held back the call of his name on my lips, leaning out into the dusk air.</p><p>But below, the quiet street was empty; the streetlamp, spilling circles of white light onto the pavement, flickered a few times, and that same silence I\u2019d come to hate greeted hope and I with a wall of emptiness.</p><p>I backed away from the window\u2014away from the absence of anything that resembled life, then turned to my mirror and waited for the girl in the blue dress to look at me again. The face we thought we saw was not David\u2014merely physically manifested wishful thinking; the only thing outside my window was the beginning of another night. And for the rest of my life now, that\u2019s all there\u2019d ever be.</p><p>I closed my bedroom door and headed down the stairs, seeing my dad\u2019s eyes tear up like sudden rain.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d I glided down the stairs. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look so pretty, honey. Just like your first ballet concert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, well, just don\u2019t lift me onto your shoulders this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, not? You\u2019re still my little girl.\u201d He looked up at me where I stopped on the last step.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a little girl, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019ll always be my little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what\u2019s taking Ara so lo\u2014\u201d Mike stopped dead as he walked in; his arms dropped, his lips split into a pearly smile, and his eyes, from behind a small black mask, glistened. \u201cAra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mike.\u201d</p><p>He leaped up onto the step. \u201cAw, baby, look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d I brushed my hands down my hips.</p><p>He shook his head slowly, considering my dress. \u201cMore than the outfit I saw you in when I re-pierced your ear.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s eyes narrowed; I looked away, clearing my throat.</p><p>\u201cCome on then.\u201d Vicki held a camera up and waved us off the stairs. \u201cTime for pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I groaned, taking Mike\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cAra, this might be the last ball you ever go to,\u201d Vicki reasoned. \u201cI want memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine.\u201d I huffed, and Mike grinned at me with a kind of enthusiasm that wasn\u2019t there when he was forced to escort me to the last ball we went to.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t share his excitement.</p><p>Vicki posed us in awkward and weird places to snap her memories, but the world slowed down around me, and I stood in the warm embrace of my fianc\u00e9, smiling for reasons I could only pretend I felt, watching everything move as if it were on screen\u2014a film with no volume. The voices, the wind, the laughter, all gone\u2014everything in my world was silent, empty\u2014wrong. This should have been David; it was always supposed to be David, but once upon a time, I\u2019d have said the same about Mike.</p><p>Everything was back where it was before\u2014before the universe flipped the hourglass, before I lost everything in my world that grounded my soul, and before I ever knew anything about David Knight.</p><p>Now, I was in the arms of the one I was destined to be with all along.</p><p>It was an odd learning curve, and a painful one, but I just had to accept it. When I got home, when I landed in Perth and went home to Mike\u2019s house, she wouldn\u2019t be there\u2014around the corner. Mum was gone. Harry was gone. And I had to move on.</p><p>This was moving on.</p><p>I closed my eyes and let the world pass by for a moment, spinning, like the snow in a musical, glass dome. When I opened them again, fairy lights twinkled from the tall white trunks of leafless trees, and soft music filled my ears as sound suddenly enhanced my world again.</p><p>An almost magical glow seemed to surround everything. The majestic old council chamber sat tall as the backdrop to the dim, candle-lit space, and masked dancers twirled around the floor with hypnotic cadence\u2014sweeping and bowing to the harmony of a string quartet.</p><p>Mike and I stood at the cusp of the wooden dance floor, surrounded by the beauties, but my eyes delighted only in the canopy of stars, observing the Masquerade from the kingdom above.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognise anyone?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I felt kind of lost, like I was alone in the crowded space. The dance floor, the stairs, and even the balcony off the council chamber were filled with people\u2014masked strangers, just like me\u2014but for all I felt in my soul, the court could\u2019ve been completely empty.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some refreshments before we dance?\u201d Mike gestured toward the balcony.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I tucked my arms into my chest, wondering if David was here\u2014watching.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d Mike bowed, offering his hand.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, Ara. First rule of a dance is never to refuse a dance,\u201d he said with a grin, stealing my hand.</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I sunk into a curtsy, obliging Mike, and with one step over the threshold of the dance floor, he swept me into his safe, strong arms, and we joined the flow of dancers like a rose petal on the breeze; never missing a beat. I followed each step of Mike\u2019s wide stride, closing the movement with a short, gliding turn, making patterns like circles around the room. \u201cWhen did you learn to dance like this?\u201d I asked, very impressed.</p><p>\u201cWell, a guy\u2019s gotta know a few tricks if he\u2019s gonna get the girl.\u201d He flashed his cheeky grin, and a small flutter started my heart.</p><p>\u201cI like this new you,\u201d I said, turning my head in the direction our hands led us.</p><p>\u201cGood, because this is the me you\u2019ll be marrying.\u201d</p><p>The music faded out then, and the room came to a standstill; Mike kissed my hand and bowed, while the rest of the crowd softly applauded the musicians.</p><p>\u201cCan we go find Em and the others now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Ara. This is your night. We can do whatever you want.\u201d He looked over his shoulder. \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll go to the balcony\u2014it\u2019ll be easier to see from up there.\u201d</p><p>As we passed through the crowd, they parted for us, turning their heads; I leaned closer to Mike and whispered, \u201cWhat are they staring at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is my bra showing?\u201d I quickly tucked my thumb around the rim of my dress.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d He laughed, pushing my hand down. \u201cIt\u2019s just because, of all the beauty here tonight, you\u2019re the brightest thing in the room.\u201d</p><p>Shrinking into myself, I glanced at the other costumes; pale grey, coffee, burgundy, black\u2014no blue. I was the only girl in a colour this bright. \u201cGreat. I feel like a wasp at a bumblebee convention.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cWell, you look like the flower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErg.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>We stopped by the balcony railing and looked down onto the room of dancers, swirling under a blanket of stars. I felt like a god between worlds.</p><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s so much prettier from up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. These Yanks really know how to throw a shindig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYanks?\u201d I raised a brow at him.</p><p>He just grinned, inching away from the slap he expected. But as he turned back to lean on the railing again, he stopped, watching a young couple giggle their way into the darkness on the other side of the chamber court. \u201cWhat\u2019s down there?\u201d</p><p>I looked too. The gardens were dark, the lights, usually lining the paths that wound through the endless trees and wide planes of grass, were switched off\u2014an obvious attempt to deter hot-blooded teens. Little did the planning committee realise, that dark spaces made it so much easier to be...\u2019romantic\u2019.</p><p>\u201cDo you think your friends might be down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't think so,\u201d I said with a sigh. Above, the clock on the tower chimed nine; its hollow, long tolls haunting and dreary, like warning bells down the streets of death and plague.</p><p>He nodded a few times, his eyes narrowing. \u201cYou\u2019re missing him...aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I drew a breath and looked away; there was no point in lying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, looking down at his clasped hands.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I started, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, there you are.\u201d Before I even spun around, Emily wrapped her arms over my shoulders and squeezed. I gave Spencer, who stood awkwardly in the dust cloud of Emily\u2019s enthusiasm, a short wave. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you guys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d I stood back from her, swiping my hair from my face. \u201cBut we\u2019re here now. And look at you\u2014\u201d Emily twirled around to show her long blonde ponytail, in a spiral down her back, and the perfect fit of the dress; Mike cleared his throat beside me. \u201cI can't believe how grown-up you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mom says\u2014\u201d She stopped and looked beside us when Mike and Spencer shook hands. \u201cOh yeah, sorry guys.\u201d She ducked her head a little. \u201cUm, Mike\u2014Spence; Spence\u2014Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Mike grinned.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Ara\u2019s fianc\u00e9?\u201d Spence looked at me for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cThe one and only,\u201d I said; Mike grinned as I linked my arm in his. He liked that. I could tell. And I liked that he liked it. \u201cSo, Spencer? You scrub up nice,\u201d I added.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, thanks. You\u2019re not so bad yourself, Ara.\u201d He appraised my gown\u2014not in a creepy way, but I think he was just as shocked as I was that it was actually me under all the sparkles.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Alana?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen her.\u201d Emily shrugged.</p><p>We looked over the crowd of dancers for a moment. Each one was hidden beneath a mask of feathers or sequins, their hair drawn up in dazzling ringlets or left down to flow over their shoulders. It seemed futile to find a friend among them. Then I spotted a girl at the centre of the dance floor, with a tall, sandy-blonde-haired boy. Her cream and black dress with pink accents of lace took my breath away, fitting Alana\u2019s description of her hand-me-down perfectly.</p><p>Mike looked over my shoulder, following my gaze. \u201cWow. That\u2019s quite a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow.\u201d Emily sighed, leaning against the railing beside me.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Ryan looks so...vintage,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cThey make a good couple,\u201d Mike noted.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m a good matchmaker.\u201d Emily grinned, hiding her piercing, Mike-directed gaze of abhorrence under her mask.</p><p>I got the sense then that maybe she really did hate him.</p><p>\u201cWell, Miss Ara.\u201d Spencer bowed to me. \u201cI believe you owe me a dance.\u201d</p><p>Emily gave me a smile of approval.</p><p>\u201cVery well, Mr Griffin. It would be my pleasure,\u201d I said in a formal English accent, then wrapped my arm over Spencer\u2019s.</p><p>Mike walked behind us with Emily on his arm. I felt a little sorry for him, knowing Emily would probably step on his toes deliberately.</p> <p>We danced, and the flow and magic of the masquerade concealed my pain and emptiness for just a while. Passed from arm to arm, I danced with nearly every guy attending the ball, and when I finally fell back into Mike\u2019s embrace as the first stroke of midnight chimed through the air, my head swirled like a room full of butterflies.</p><p>The enchanting tone of the evening burst into a spectrum of colour above us when blue and pink electrified the skies\u2014dissipating into yellows and whites as they dissolved among the stars. Everyone stood still, tilting their faces upward while the clock chimed each agonising toll of realisation.</p><p>Midnight.</p><p>The music played on, saddening my heart with its desultory notes. All the beauties around us smiled in awe at the colours of the end, while my heart fought to ignore the sombre melody of loss and separation.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t coming. David really wasn\u2019t coming.</p><p>Mike pulled me close, pressing his fingers firmly between my shoulder blades. \u201cI love you, Ara-Rose. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Wiping the tears from my lips and cheeks, I looked up at his face, feeling the last chime of midnight pass, taking all my hopes and dreams with it. \u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>The fireworks cracked, echoing off the horizon, but the noise, along with the gasps and giggles of girls, faded into the background when his lips touched mine. The room twirled again, the dancers moving around us, taking step to the rhythm of a sound I could no longer hear because, while I was safe in his arms, there was nothing but Mike and I\u2014no one else in the world. It had always been that way, and I knew then that it always would.</p><p>His lips broke away from the kiss with a cool wash of air, the room flooding with noise again as he looked over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d a gentle voice asked, and a boy stepped into view; tall, yet not as tall as Mike, with soft brown hair\u2014his face hidden behind a black mask, but instantly recognisable.</p><p>David?</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>Mike kissed my cheek and took a step backward, giving away the last dance of the evening to this stranger he\u2019d never met. My heart raced, my breath quickening as the boy stepped into me and took my hand, but it all stopped\u2014all the hope, all the excitement, just trickled away when his cold touch met mine with no familiarity.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t him.</p><p>The stranger pulled me close with one sweeping touch, my hips against his, my body arching back slightly, his green eyes locked to mine.</p><p>\u201cMoonlight Sonata,\u201d he said in a smooth, gentle voice, gesturing toward the piano. \u201cYour favourite piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I squinted against the dark, trying to see him better beneath the mask. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head once and said nothing more.</p><p>The song\u2019s harmonies set the pace to his gracefulness, while the elegance in his stance seemed adopted from another era; one hand gently under my shoulder blade, the other extending our arms out widely. He\u2019d danced before. Perhaps on a night such as this. I dreamed of it for a moment; he and I, in another time, another place, dancing this way until sunrise. But the very idea, the very thought of having been in his arms before, came from a place\u2014a dream-like state\u2014somewhere deeper inside. It was as if I didn\u2019t own the thought at all.</p><p>I looked up at the boy, his smile showing only by the dimple beside the curve of his lip, and a strange sensation saturated the air around me, a feeling like energy\u2014closing me in, making this dance a secret from the rest of the world.</p><p>From the sideline, Mike stood watching, arms folded, leaning in, whispering to Alana and Ryan every few seconds. I wondered if he could see us; if he could see the way this boy held me\u2014if he found it odd that he pulled me close, like he\u2019d held me there a thousand times before. All the laws of nature said he could, but I felt invisible.</p><p>\u201cCan you feel that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He turned his head an inch and looked down at me; his mysterious eyes held a depth of darkness to them that made me feel suddenly very uneasy. \u201cI\u2019m the one doing it.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Mike again\u2014having a thumb war with Spencer\u2014and my heart hurried a little. I wanted him to come, to tap this boy on the shoulder and ask for me back, hold me safe in his arms, but the boy squeezed my hand gently, tightening his hold on my back.</p><p>\u201cOur dance is not yet complete, my lady,\u201d his wet lips whispered onto my brow. \u201cIt would be incredibly bad manners to leave a man in the middle of the dance floor. You wouldn\u2019t want to be rude, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to be rude,\u201d I said softly, and something inside me screamed, wriggling about, warning me to move away. But I stayed in his arms, smiling his smile as we passed each dancer, softly nodding my head in greeting. It felt unnatural.</p><p>When the music ended, the boy stopped and clapped gently. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I said, but made no haste to move away from him. I stood, staring up at him, like a stuffed animal. \u201cPlease tell me who you are.\u201d</p><p>Another song began; he bowed low, holding his arm across his body. \u201cCare to dance the encore first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I swallowed, shaking my head as a name came to mind. \u201cJason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTr\u00e8s bien, madame.\u201d He stood taller, his lip creasing in one corner, leaving the smile to come only from behind his eyes\u2014the way David smiled when he read my mind.</p><p>\u201cYou look so much like him.\u201d</p><p>Jason exhaled and offered his arm; \u201cWalk with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to the balcony,\u201d he said, cupping my hand into the crook of his elbow.</p><p>We passed right by Mike and my friends, who didn\u2019t even look up as this stranger led me away from the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA perfect night.\u201d I leaned on the marble railing, watching the other dancers in the final act.</p><p>\u201cPerfect for one\u2019s last,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall not repeat myself, girl. It\u2019s rude not to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you. I just wondered what you meant.\u201d</p><p>Jason smiled, seemingly to himself. \u201cI meant that if this were your last night, it would be a grand way to spend it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I looked down at the dance floor again. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why I\u2019ve come?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cAre you here because of David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn ways.\u201d His eyes focused on something distant, while the same malignant smile as before settled onto his dark-pink lips, sending shivers down my spine. Bad shivers.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIn pain, I suspect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d I stood up straight.</p><p>Jason turned and leaned his back on the ledge. \u201cI mean\u2014you hurt him. Badly. I suspect he\u2019s grieving at this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you gave him your heart, then denied him your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d I said, turning to walk away.</p><p>But his hand lashed out and caught my arm, spinning me into his chest with a breathtaking jolt. \u201cOn the contrary, my dear, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I wedged the ball of my palm into his chest. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>When a few curious glances flicked our way, Jason placed his hand firmly on my lower back and forced my arms into position. \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you.\u201d He held me firmly, spinning around to the soft piano, like we were just two masked teens in love.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you already know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been one for guessing games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say\u2014\u201d his eyes, under the cover of the black mask, became small with a smile, \u201c\u2014I\u2019m not here for pleasure.\u201d</p><p>The pulse between my collarbones seemed to shoot out backward, filling me with a sudden urge to run. I cast my eyes to the dance floor, but Mike was gone. The space he stood before\u2014vacant. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, sounding amazingly calm, \u201cif it\u2019s not pleasure, it must be business. What business do you have here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe concluding of an age-old quarrel among brothers\u2014one you, so unfortunately, have found yourself recompense of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s head moved at a fraction of an inch, the green in his eyes occupying the corners. \u201cSomeone is looking for you.\u201d</p><p>I followed his sideways gaze to see Mike running through the crowd\u2014panicked, touching the shoulders of various individuals\u2014obviously desperate to find me.</p><p>Look up, Mike, look up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him, Ara. If he comes for you\u2014he will die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I gasped. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal, really.\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cThen again, perhaps it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to hurt you to hurt my brother.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open with a huff. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to do worse than touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I sunk my knees down, slipping free from his hold, but he grabbed my arm, hoisting me to my feet and started walking toward the dark chamber gardens. \u201cLet me go, Jason,\u201d I ordered, \u201cI\u2019ll scream.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled wickedly, keeping his eyes on our destination. \u201cYou won\u2019t scream. Because I\u2019ll kill them\u2014all of them, Ara. I will take every last life that resides in this miserable gathering, and I will save you until the end, so you may watch as I tear apart each one of your friends and eviscerate your replacement lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You have no right to do that.\u201d I tugged hard against him. \u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come quietly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I scratched at his hand, trying to unwind his fingers from my arm, but they tightened\u2014his nails digging in to my flesh. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cUm, no.\u201d</p><p>As we neared the step, my darting gaze of desperation flicked around the room, passing over the smiles of distracted couples. But each face was unfamiliar. No one knew me. No one knew I was being kidnapped. And not one of the faces was David. He was supposed to be here. He was supposed to come. The last dance on the hour of midnight. That was the deal.</p><p>The haunting piano stopped below us, and the gentle clicking of applause filled the air as Jason pulled me along\u2014attempting discretion\u2014and to my amazement, succeeding.</p><p>We stopped by the stairs, waiting as a few couples emerged from the darkness, straightening their clothes, looking a little flushed. Jason smiled at them knowingly, pulling me in to conceal his tight grip within the closeness of our bodies. I tried to push my hips away from his, but he hooked his foot around my ankle, leaning closer to whisper against my brow. \u201cIf you bring attention to yourself, young lady, I will dig my fingertip into your skin and cut your bone in half.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stopped struggling, taking shallow breaths to suppress the deep urge to fight, and when I saw my hand against the lapels of Jason\u2019s jacket, my ruby ring standing out like midnight blood, Mike\u2019s face, the way he smiled when I accepted his proposal, came to mind. All those things that were lost filled my heart with regret. I wanted Mike to come\u2014wanted him to save me. And a part of me didn't care about anyone else in the room; a part of me just wanted to scream out while I still had the chance. But if I even indulged in the idea, I\u2019d be risking Mike\u2019s life too.</p><p>\u201cMike can\u2019t help you now, anyway, Ara. He\u2019s only human.\u201d</p><p>David could help me\u2014if he were here. I know he\u2019d...</p> <p>\u201cDavid will not help you, either. He\u2019s not coming back for you.\u201d Jason\u2019s eyes flooded with amusement as he looked down at the cold liquid running from my nose and eyes, trickling past my quivering lip. \u201cBut you already knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, closing my eyes tight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite the poetic ending, really, that you despised him, lost him because you could not become the beast he is, and yet, in dying, your beautiful face and body will be marred beyond recognition, crafting you, essentially, into an eternal beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The fright left my lips in an uncontrolled wail, and several other cries came from nearby, couples parting, nearly toppling over the railing as a bulk figure burst through them on the stairs. Jason slowly looked over his shoulder, his gaze meeting Mike\u2019s for a split second, a lifetime of comprehension passing the invisible barrier between them. And Mike started running.</p><p>Panic overruled my fear. I wriggled in Jason\u2019s arms, torn between reality and paranormal. I couldn't let my world touch Mike\u2019s\u2014couldn\u2019t let him die for me. \u201cJason!\u201d I gasped in a low voice. \u201cRun!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d he said, and in that moment, as he reached down and swept me off the ground, Mike knew. I closed my eyes and prayed as the darkness closed me in, seeing Mike\u2019s face, seeing all hope slip for that one heartbeat when he knew, when he realised for the first time, that he would never see me again.</p><p>A rush of wind and the feel of speed beneath my feet ended suddenly. I opened my eyes again to kaleidoscope shadows of leaves on my hands and dress. Jason spun me at the shoulders, facing me in the other direction, and pointed past the border of the forest to the top of the stairs.</p><p>Mike grasped the railing and leaned into the night\u2014searching the darkness frantically, as my name echoed off the emptiness, his voice breaking to tears beneath the panic.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t give up, you know,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at Jason and, seeing the seriousness in his eyes, slowly looked upon my Zorro one last time. Mike\u2019s hands flew into his hair, gripping tightly as he sunk down onto the step, his head between his knees.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a warrior you have there,\u201d Jason said. \u201cPerhaps I should oblige him to a duel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came here for me. You leave him out of this,\u201d I warned, clenching my fists.</p><p>Jason watched again for a second as Emily landed beside Mike, her hand on his shoulder, her head whipping up to search the gardens before she took off up the stairs, running. Mike rolled back, looking up at the sky, then reached into his pocket, his phone lighting his face blue a second later.</p><p>\u201cMy dad. He\u2019s calling my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jason said. \u201cHe\u2019s calling the police.\u201d</p><p>The severity of the situation hit me then. I drew a shaky breath, feeling the frosty, pine-scented wind tighten my chest. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was never the plan.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders slowly inched closer to my jaw. \u201cI...I don\u2019t want you to hurt me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d he said, amused. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be any fun if you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun? So that\u2019s what this is really about? Fun?\u201d</p><p>He turned to me, slowly laying widespread fingers to his mask and drew it away, revealing a face that stole my breath. \u201cTo a degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick, Jason.\u201d I looked away from the kind eyes of my David, offensive on this vile man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the sick one. Your beloved vampire ex is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cAt least he would never take an innocent life for revenge.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s sudden burst of laughter was revoltingly boyish and sincere; a different kind of laugh to his brother\u2019s. \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. You think he\u2019s kind\u2014and compassionate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think. I know.\u201d</p><p>He spun around about a foot away and bowed with humour, crossing his hands over his stomach. \u201cMy dear, young lady, you have been kept in the dark, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d I wedged my hands onto my hips.</p><p>\u201cAs far as you\u2019re concerned? As far as you are concerned, my sweet girl, he is a vile, disgusting vampire who kills people with his teeth; not good enough for you to love eternally. Is it any surprise he might have done something terrible in his past that, perhaps, hurt others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike killing a girl I was in love with!\u201d Jason\u2019s cold breath infected the side of my face as he sprung up suddenly in front of me, whispering his words into my skin. \u201cAnd I intend to repay him the favour.\u201d</p><p>I jerked away, shoving him. \u201cGo ahead, Jason. If you\u2019re going to kill me, just get it over with.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d I wiped my lip, standing taller. \u201cI\u2019m tired of this. In fact, since you obviously want to taint his honour with your little story about how evil David is, why not break into a little bad-guy monologue?\u201d I challenged. \u201cMaybe you can even get stuck in it just long enough for me to escape.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s hand moved, and every muscle in my throat seized up, the blood filling my head above the cage of fingers. \u201cDo not speak to me with such contempt, you haughty little bitch.\u201d He thrust his arm downward, slamming me to the floor.</p><p>I coughed out, falling to my side, clenching the grass in a small fist as I tried to catch my breath\u2014half suffocating under the rattling of my heart.</p><p>\u201cHave we learned our lesson now?\u201d The predator towered over me.</p><p>\u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d I sniffled, rolling onto my knees, tearing the mask from my face.</p><p>\u201cLeave you alone?\u201d He knelt beside me, taking the mask. \u201cWhy would I go and do a thing like that? Especially now you\u2019re crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with it?\u201d I asked, dabbing a finger under my lashes.</p><p>\u201cShe cried. She begged him to stop.\u201d He turned my jaw until it faced him; I wouldn\u2019t look into his eyes, though. \u201cYou, my dear, have only reached phase one of your torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s phase two?\u201d I asked through my teeth, scrunching the grass tightly. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to kill me, I\u2019d rather not drag this out playing guessing games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but my lovely girl, games are half the fun\u2014they\u2019re what will climax the ending when I show him the way I hurt you,\u201d he said in a kind voice, like he was talking to a child. \u201cFinally, he will get to see how it feels to watch someone he loves die at the hands of someone he\u2019s trusted his whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw him kill her\u2014this girl you loved?\u201d My whisper came out ragged.</p><p>\u201cI did\u2014in his memories.\u201d He seemed to choke. \u201cYou cannot fathom the debasing things he did to her, Ara\u2014you cannot comprehend what she suffered in those last moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to be the one to make me understand?\u201d I said sarcastically.</p><p>Jason thumbed a tear away from my chin. \u201cYes, but first, by making you see.\u201d</p><p>When his hand came up fast, I cowered, shielding my cheek, but he shoved my wrist away, gripping both sides of my face to pull me closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d I asked, nose to nose with this man who meant to hurt me.</p><p>\u201cBlessing you with the gift of insight.\u201d He squeezed my face tighter as I fought him. \u201cSit still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to see this,\u201d he said, breathless. \u201cYou need to know what you\u2019re dying for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His voice broke, tears coating his eyes. \u201cBecause it matters.\u201d</p><p>And a small part of me actually felt a pang of pity for him then. I held my breath, listening for the voices in the distance calling my name. All I wanted was to run to them, to get away, but I exhaled slowly and looked deep into the eyes of my captor. \u201cLet it go, Jason.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his thumbs under my eyes, holding me in place; the indentation of his grip suggesting that movement might result in a cracked skull. \u201cTake a deep breath, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2014don\u2019t.\u201d As his icy touch sent a stinging jolt through my cheek, I jerked back, wriggling like a fish on a hook; I pushed my wrists down on his forearms, merely making his grip tighter. \u201cGet off me, it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2014\u201d I tugged at his thumbs. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he ordered. \u201cIt will hurt less.\u201d</p><p>A whimpering cry shook the back of my throat; I swallowed hard, scrunching my eyes tightly over the hot, stinging tears, and drew a quick breath instantly when I saw a girl\u2014as bright as the sun in the day. She looked like a memory, one that didn\u2019t belong to me, but clear as a reflection.</p><p>\u201cRochelle, Rochelle, Rochelle,\u201d a man said, standing over her where she cowered in the corner, her head in her arms. His feet parted enough that I could see her bare toes, her golden legs, and honey blond hair falling over her shoulder. She looked just like Emily.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jason\u2019s grip eased and the stinging in my face turned numb and cold. \u201cShe did. Will you sit still now?\u201d</p><p>As I nodded, the film became clearer; the girl looked up\u2014her eyes round with fright, her whole body convulsing uncontrollably.</p><p>David knelt beside her and softly ran his fingers down her arm, taking her hand, then kissed it. \u201cSuch a pretty little thing. It\u2019s a pity you had to cry, Rochelle\u2014you really are repulsive when you snivel.\u201d</p><p>She buried her face again, her delicate, feminine voice so high, so frightened. \u201cPlease. Please let me go.\u201d</p><p>He smiled softly. \u201cI will. I just have to do something first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d even in a quiet voice, her French accent was so thick.</p><p>His hand slid along her ankle, up her leg, coming to rest on her knee. \u201cIf you promise to lie still, I will be gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beg, Rochelle.\u201d He unfastened the top button on her dress, parting the collar. \u201cIt won't hurt for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVa te faire foutre, trouduci.\u201d She spat on him.</p><p>\u201cYou dirty little whore!\u201d He thrashed the back of his hand across her chin with lip-splitting force.</p><p>I squealed, covering my mouth as she did.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Jason squeezed my face. \u201cYou\u2019ll expose our position to your little hunting party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cJust watch.\u201d He pushed my mind closer to the memory: David lowered his face to the girl\u2019s and whispered something in her ear, turning her cheek to lick the blood from it after.</p><p>My chest tightened.</p><p>\u201cYour taste does not really appeal to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would, if you were merely my next meal, but I'm here for another reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother does not have the courage to do what must be done.\u201d He ran his finger down the opening in her dress, smoothing it off her shoulder. \u201cThis is not personal, Rochelle. It\u2019s just business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat must be done?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d she shrieked. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, David, I\u2019m p\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He covered her mouth, slipping behind her, cradling her spine to his chest. \u201cIt will be over soon.\u201d</p><p>She hummed her aversion in the back of her throat, tugging at his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts more if you fight, Rochelle,\u201d he whispered into her hair, meticulously rolling her head to expose the vein on her neck. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, no!\u201d my squeal broke off as he sank his teeth in, yanking the girl\u2019s head back until a bone broke through her collar. I covered my face, trying to hide from the reality.</p><p>\u201cNo. You must see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, no, Jason. Please don\u2019t make me watch.\u201d</p><p>He ripped my hands from my face. \u201cYou will watch.\u201d</p><p>As I looked back into the memory, David looked up, his eyes meeting mine\u2014disturbing the core of my soul with the ferocity behind them\u2014tearing out my every ill-conceived notion that he was once human inside. I hated him then, as I saw the monster he\u2019d warned me about so many times\u2014I hated him.</p><p>I sobbed loudly, watching his victim fall limp in his arms, her last breath releasing in a whisper, \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>He moved closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>I drew back, frozen, unable to think; my heart pounded in my chest as the realisation of the loss that could never be retrieved flooded my angry heart, bringing a cascade of tears down my cheeks.</p><p>Rochelle faded.</p><p>David dropped her lifeless corpse to the floor, letting her head hit the ground, her neck twisting awkwardly as she fell\u2014then stood up and walked away. His heavy black boots were the last thing I saw in the memory before reality washed in like cold water on my face, making me jump inside. \u201cJason,\u201d I cried through deep, breathless sobs. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All I could see was her face as she tried to beg David\u2014heartless, merciless, and unrelenting David\u2014for her life.</p><p>Jason wrapped his arms around his knees and crossed his ankles where he sat on the grass beside me. \u201cThis is the pain I\u2019ve lived with for too long. Do you see now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see it.\u201d I rolled forward, rooting my trembling hands to the grass, my soft curls sticking to the tears around my lips. \u201cPlease get it out of my head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.

Why did he kill her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe carried another soul inside her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby? He killed her because she was pregnant?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cAt the preliminary hearing, he claimed he was keeping the peace\u2014ridding the world of an unauthorized half-blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he...was he ordered to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He took it upon himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you know that\u2019s why he killed her? How do you know it wasn\u2019t an attempt to change her\u2014so you could keep her?\u201d</p><p>Jason stiffened. \u201cHe tried that one. Outside the council chamber, alone, he told me he meant it as a surprise\u2014that he lied to the Blood King about his reasons to avoid punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, why didn't she change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he was speaking the truth\u2014even if he meant to change her, only one soul can be immortalised, or they will both die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, then, maybe he didn\u2019t know she was pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother is not ignorant, Ara, you know this.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled. He was right. David always had the upper hand. Always. Nothing got past him. \u201cYou loved her\u2014like he loves me?\u201d</p><p>The grip around his knees tightened. \u201cShe was everything to me; fifty years has passed, and that has not changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...now you\u2019re planning to do the same thing to David. Don\u2019t you know what I am to him?\u201d</p><p>He studied my face with repugnance. \u201cYes, and I will take that from him.\u201d</p><p>My head rocked from side to side in astonished, intensely maddening disbelief. How could my David be capable of such horror? \u201cI know it means nothing to you, Jason, but...I am so, so sorry,\u201d I whispered with a focused, watery stare.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It changes nothing,\u201d he said irresolutely. \u201cNow you know why you must die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra!\u201d</p><p>I looked up to the sound of that voice; Mike\u2014he was close\u2014so close that if I dared to scream, he\u2019d find me.</p><p>Without warning, Jason swept me from the wet grass and threw me over his shoulder. All the blood rushed into a tight pulse in my lips and cheeks, making it hard to see, leaving only the whipping breeze as evidence to the ground moving beneath us. I didn\u2019t care if he took me away, though. I hung limply over my captor, unable to feel anything anymore. All I could see were Rochelle\u2019s eyes in her last moments\u2014the fear, the desperation for her life and that of her unborn child\u2014while a soft whisper repeated from my lips, \u201cDavid. How could you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>We broke through into a clearing and a dense, shadowy darkness overtook. The only lights around were a thousand twinkling stars in the sky and the distant glow of the Masquerade; pink, like the last drop of sunlight on the horizon.</p><p>Jason set me down in the long grass, my bare toes sinking into the dewy soil. I hadn\u2019t even noticed my shoes fell off until now.</p><p>The voices of the hunters\u2014the ones searching for me\u2014were as faint behind the height of the towering trees around us as the soft, magical music of the ball, still playing, perhaps to keep the patrons calm. But I knew they could search all night, put posters up on every tree, phone every television station in the world, and they would never find me.</p><p>\u201cThey will find you,\u201d Jason said, his voice revealing his position in the darkness. \u201cOnce I'm finished with you, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to leave me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jason. Don\u2019t do this,\u201d I begged, stepping away, reaching for the place my silver locket used to rest. \u201cJust think about it for a second.\u201d</p><p>He laughed lightly. \u201cAra-Rose, I have thought about it\u2014for a very long time.\u201d He appeared in front of me. \u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m going to do to you.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, grateful that the dark cloaked his face. If I\u2019d been able to see the intent behind the smile I heard in his voice, I was afraid my skin might have fallen from my limbs. But, ignorant, I could pretend to be strong. \u201cThen, why haven\u2019t you done it yet? Are you waiting for some perfect moment?\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward, the shadows lifting, revealing his eyes as hollow, yawning caves. \u201cNo, Ara. I\u2019m a vampire\u2014we like to play with our food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not your food. You came here to kill me. That makes me a victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose it does.\u201d His firm grip sent a rush of blood shooting from my arm to my heart; he pulled me closer, his orange-chocolate scent waking my mind to a different version of the dream it always put me in\u2014casting me suddenly into the theatrics of a nightmare. \u201cBut still, I have a few games\u2014things I want you to suffer before I kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't do that,\u201d I said, pushing his chest, unable to get my arm free. \u201cDon\u2019t keep saying things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cOr, perhaps, brave\u2014making demands of your reaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d</p><p>Something exchanged between us then, a kind of knowing that came from experience; it was as if I could see every thought beyond the darkness of his eyes. He wanted to do something to me then\u2014what, I didn\u2019t know, but it made me suddenly not so sure of myself.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what his favourite genre of film was? Did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorror.\u201d I nodded, eyes on the ground.</p><p>\u201cYes. So, I thought I might make this little charade as gruesome an end as I could dream up, so that when I show him the memory, he will be haunted by it for the rest of eternity.\u201d He walked slowly around me, the feel of his eyes gliding over every bare inch of my skin, stopping in front of me with his cold breath moist on my brow, his body close like he was my David. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten for five days and the hunger in me is so vicious right now, I'm not sure I can make this last as long as I would like.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, crossing my forearms over my chest.</p><p>\u201cI've touched your hair before.\u201d He lifted a clipping and pressed it to his nose. \u201cI watched you\u2014while you slept, and never intended to touch you, but your hair\u2014\u201d He breathed in deeply, closing his eyes. \u201cYou smell so pretty. Did he ever tell you that?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just your blood\u2014it\u2019s you, your human cosmetics, your hair, your clothes. All of you.\u201d He considered the chocolate-brown curls against his palm for a moment, running his thumb over them. \u201cThis is easier than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, feeling my shaky breath brush warmly across my salty, tear-stained lips.</p><p>\u201cI was sure your beautiful face would force compassion within me, but\u2014\u201d he shook his head, dropping my hair, \u201c\u2014I feel nothing for you, as if you were merely a dog who had bitten a child. I just want to see you dead\u2014in the worst way possible.\u201d</p><p>My crossed arms tightened over my chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd, don\u2019t get me wrong; I do see this as a waste of life\u2014beautiful life. I will not deny the fact that you are something special, Ara, but I cannot let you live. You understand this?\u201d He lifted my chin; I nodded, sniffling. \u201cHowever, I would like to dance with you one last time before I begin.\u201d</p><p>My body moved with his, close, circling like two birds falling mid-flight. The feel of his cool fingers at the ribbon of my corset and the softness of his palm against mine, made me wish only that I were his\u2014his girl, for him to touch, to love, to hold. I wanted to be a part of him, as I once was with David.</p><p>He spun me out from his body gracefully, and I twirled back into his chest, completely intoxicated by his spell\u2014and completely aware of it too. We swayed together in the cool breeze, surrounded by the trees, where no one could see us, and no one would ever find us\u2014not until he was finished with me.</p><p>\u201cBeg me not to kill you,\u201d he whispered, his lips against my brow like a kiss. \u201cBeg me and I will show you mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d My throat tightened, eyes spilling with tears as I looked into his; he was just like David. But he was going to kill me no matter how much I begged. And the worst part was, it didn't matter to me, because, as if a thread of finely-woven silk had bound us, I was unable to resist. I wanted him to kill me; I wanted him to hurt me first\u2014because it would be an honour to die by his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a very convincing plea for your life, Ara,\u201d he said.</p><p>The faint blue sparkle surrounding my thoughts persisted like delirium consuming an otherwise rational mind. I smiled up at him, wishing we would dance this way together, forever. \u201cWhat are you doing to me, Jason? Why does nothing make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush now, sweet girl. I am making this easier by allowing you to feel safe with me. It is one of my many talents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. This is an extension of kindness, child. Do not look a gift horse in the mouth.\u201d</p><p>My throat fought hard for its own vocabulary\u2014for common sense. But he smelled just like David, and I missed him so much I just wanted to believe he was David; to imagine for one last moment that I was in his arms\u2014that I still mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes and you shall believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can never be him. And you\u2019ll just be closer to becoming the monster he is by killing me\u2014\u201d My gaze delved deep into his hollow, shadowed eyes, \u201c\u2014but you will never have a heart like his, and I will never give you mine.\u201d</p><p>We stopped moving, his hands slipping from my body, an icy rush tearing away the cloud of my confusion, leaving behind a sudden explosion of terror. \u201cI don\u2019t want your heart, you stupid girl.\u201d He peeled me from the closeness of his body, tossing me off to the side by my arm. But my dress caught under my toes, my hands flailing as I fell backward, stopping against the ground with a high-pitched surge of wind blasting from my lungs.</p><p>Before I could even find the source of the sudden pain I felt, blood gushed out over my fingertip.</p><p>\u201cOoh.\u201d Jason stood over me, wincing. \u201cThat looks nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d I pinched the edge of the partially detached nail, my hand shaking like glass in an earthquake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to fold that back, or it\u2019ll come right off,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I yelled at him, trying to use my thumb to roll the nail back in place, but every time I touched it, it shifted and the pain intensified, closing in around me as if I were in a red box.</p><p>\u201cSettle down.\u201d Jason took my hand, straightened my arm out to the side\u2014away from my line of sight\u2014and...</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d I screamed, but it reduced to a tiny whimper as the agony receded. When Jason released me, I doubled over, weeping breathlessly into my skirt. I just wanted to go home. I didn\u2019t want to die like this. Not like this.</p><p>\u201cAra, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I struggled to push myself up to my knees, falling on my elbows each time.</p><p>The killer just watched. I couldn\u2019t even look at his face to see if he was enjoying it. I felt pathetic and helpless, humiliated at my own whimpering. But I couldn\u2019t stop it. It just kept coming out.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you crying like that?\u201d He grabbed my arm to help me to my knees.</p><p>I tried to speak, but the words had no shape\u2014just distraught sobs, like a hysterical child. All anger had trickled away with realisation; he wasn\u2019t playing games. He really was going to kill me. This was real. This was no book or movie where the girl gets rescued. I was going to die here. Tonight. Even the distant sound of voices, having grown in number, coming toward us, couldn\u2019t be sounds of salvation for me\u2014merely a cruel, cold reminder that there was life beyond this. And I would never know freedom again. \u201cPlease just let me go, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I wiped the tears and dribble from my chin. \u201cPlease. I had nothing to do with her death. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your lover did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I covered my ears, shaking my head. \u201cDavid\u2019s not to blame, either. It\u2019s you. You loved her\u2014you brought her into your world\u2014you didn't protect her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing!\u201d I felt only a sharp jolt, nerves stinging in the base of my skull as he grasped a handful of my hair, pulling my face closer, his shaky breath coming through his teeth in three short words. \u201cYou. Know. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you are,\u201d I said, arching my neck to stop my hair from coming out. \u201cI know the things you\u2019re capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can imagine what I\u2019m about to do to you.\u201d</p><p>I tried to shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you. You won\u2019t hurt me. Emily told me that you\u2019re swee\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shut your mouth, you horrible little human.\u201d His fingers knotted tightly in my hair, moving the flesh over my scalp, making my forehead higher.</p><p>\u201cJason, please.\u201d My fingertips slowly reached for his arm. \u201cPlease, look at me. I\u2019m not the enemy. I\u2019m not the\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne does not have to deserve the misfortune they suffer.\u201d His anger landed in my face in dots of saliva. \u201cYou were to die by torture for his crimes, but now you will endure it more slowly for your own mouthy impudence, you stupid, stupid girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra-Rose!\u201d Voices echoed off the shallow valley. Jason\u2019s grip on my hair eased until he untangled his fingers gently from the loose remains and removed his hand.</p><p>I looked up at him, my scalp burning like the rage rising within me. \u201cGo ahead. Do what you want. It will never change the fact that Rochelle\u2019s dead\u2014and all it will achieve is your own pain when David takes revenge on you.\u201d</p><p>Jason just sat beside me on the ground. \u201cActually, my dear, the laws of our kind prevent he should seek retribution for the death of a human.\u201d He grinned, seemingly pleased with himself. \u201cThe unlawful changing of one to a vampire, yes\u2014but not death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the right to mutilate my kill in any way I see fit\u2014as long as I eat you. The law will not side with David this time. There is nothing he can do, and he will have an eternity to reflect on the horrific way in which I hurt you. Oh, Ara\u2014\u201d He rolled his head back. \u201cIt will kill him inside; the images I will savour for him shall be etched into the iris of his minds-eye for all time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014that isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife is not fair. But you refuse to believe that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, the anger becoming a physical form of hatred inside me. \u201cI won\u2019t let you destroy my faith in\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to destroy it,\u201d he yelled. \u201cI will destroy you instead, then David\u2019s hope, his faith in life, in love, will be lost forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You will let me go. I will not be the victim in your family feuds,\u201d I said with an unsteady cry, trying to sound strong.</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2014\u201d he stopped and listened as the hunters came closer, \u201c\u2014you only make this more of a game for me\u2014to see how long I have to hurt you until your faith breaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all that will do is prolong my life, because I will never lose faith. Love will prevail. David will come for me, and I will go home and live my life, and you\u2014\u201d I spat the words out, \u201c\u2014will suffer for eternity without Rochelle.\u201d</p><p>He reached sideways and knocked his forearm across my chest; I yelped out an odd sounding whimper as I fell to the ground with my hands across my ribs, unable to find my breath for a second. \u201cKeep up this haughty attitude, and I will see to it that death is not the worst you suffer.\u201d</p><p>I snickered miserably to myself, pressing my hands to the ground, stretching my arms to lift myself up. \u201cWhat could be worse than death?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMany things,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cHow \u2018bout if I ensure your replacement lover finds his precious baby girl in such disgrace that he will suffer the nightmares of your naked, mutilated body, for the next fifty years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease! No!\u201d I jumped to my knees and grabbed his sleeve. \u201cKill me, do what you want, but don\u2019t let Mike see\u2014I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBegging?\u201d he asked, cold amusement oozing through his voice. \u201cI gave you the chance to beg, but you were too proud. Now I will give you no such fortune. Curious though\u2014\u201d He rubbed his chin. \u201cYou care not for what I show your true love, but for Mike\u2014you wish him to be free of this detest. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good, Jason.\u201d Hysteria turned my words to hiccups. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve this. It has nothing to do with him. Please just don\u2019t hurt him like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, hush now, sweet little girl. It will all be okay\u2014for you. You will be dead in a few hours, and all of this\u2014the cold, the dark, the fear of what his last vision of you will be\u2014will all be over.\u201d Jason softened then and stroked my face, so gently. \u201cHow\u2019s this sound? Now that I know how much Mike means to you, perhaps I will make sure that he finds you revoltingly displayed.\u201d</p><p>As his laughter filled the silence, images flashed in my mind of so many horrible possibilities. I shook my head, trying to find words in the back of my closing throat. I didn\u2019t want Mike to see. I didn\u2019t want his last memory of me to be something horrible.</p><p>\u201cLet me paint the picture for you.\u201d He knelt beside me, tracing his finger slowly from my chin to my collarbones as he spoke. \u201cI could tear a line down the centre of your body and peel you apart, leave your legs spread, intact, so that when he finds your adulterated corpse, his heart will give out, and he will fall to the ground beside you\u2014and die.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my hands over my chest and focused on the brown and green stains discolouring my ball gown, blocking out the roar of his hilarity. Mike would break. He would die if Jason did that to me. Already, my mere death would destroy him more than anything in this world ever could.</p> <p>I had to escape\u2014I couldn\u2019t let him do this to Mike.</p><p>\u201cNow, who says I'm merciless?\u201d He continued to laugh, relishing in self-amusement, while I gauged the distance between his hands, sitting loosely over his parted knees, leaving open the one place no man was immune to pain. Then, with every ounce of force I could muster from my weakened body, I lifted my foot and slammed it down into Jason\u2019s groin.</p><p>A balk of anguish rang out into the night. The vampire folded in, clutching his weak spot, and as I spun onto my hands and knees and jumped to my feet, his fingers wrapped my ankle. I screamed, kicking them off, but jerked away too fast, losing the grip on gravity. A wicked jolt sent me down to kiss the grass a few feet away from him, and as the blow wore off, I pushed up on my hands, spitting lawn clippings from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cGet. Back. Here,\u201d Jason grumbled, so strained with agony I knew there was still time.</p><p>I got back up, stumbling onto my fingertips for a second before finding my feet\u2014and ran. Just ran, ignoring the sear of pain in my nail as I hoisted my skirt above my knees, fighting for each step I took. I wanted to look back. Wanted to see if he got up\u2014see if he was behind me. But I\u2019d watched enough movies to know that would be my final mistake. So I ran\u2014my legs hot, shaky with adrenaline, making them move faster than I knew possible but not fast enough; I pictured the face of anger on the vampire behind me, feeling the crawl of my skin as I imagined him rising to his knees, watching me run\u2014giving me a moment to believe I\u2019d escaped.</p><p>Hope filled my chest as I reached the border of the trees, my feet slipping for a second on the skinny dregs of pine needles, and searched the darkness for a shadow\u2014a figure, a person that might have wandered away from the hunting party. And the beat of my heart thumped so ferociously I could hardly breathe, but I took a gulp of the icy night air, shaping it to scream, \u201cHel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d</p><p>My body shot backward, like a lasso had snagged my neck. The iron grip of the vampire cut any hope of rescue, muffling my scream; only a whimper escaped, lost to the empty silence of the dark night. No one would hear it. I was too late.</p><p>I dropped to my knees, trying to loosen his hold around my throat.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot outrun a vampire. It is pointless to even try.\u201d</p><p>A series of consonants rolled from the back of my tongue, trapped by his stranglehold, my nose and cheeks pulsating with blood\u2014like they were about to pop open.</p><p>\u201cI want to kill you, right here, right now,\u201d he said through his teeth, his voice quivering. \u201cBut I will not show you such mercy.\u201d</p><p>Nearby, the hunters finally came so close that I could hear their private chatters and the instructions being called out to each one from the voice of my fianc\u00e9. If they\u2019d only been there two seconds ago they might have heard me.</p><p>Jason squeezed my throat tighter as I wormed my fingers under his.</p><p>Please, Jason, I thought, You\u2019re hurting me.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I care? If I had any compassion for your adversity before, you just destroyed it,\u201d he said, his grip easing. \u201cYour blood will no longer be enough to satiate my thirst for revenge.\u201d</p><p>He moved quickly, folding my chest across his arm while the other hand tore the back of my dress open, leaving my skin bare to the prickly grass beneath it as he threw me down onto my back.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I coughed the air from my lungs, nudging my elbows into his chest, but he separated my hands in his tenuous grip and forced them onto either side of my head.</p><p>\u201cI wasn't going to do this to you, Ara, but I need him to see you suffer, and this is the only way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2014please don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep begging, human\u2014\u201d He slipped my dress quickly down my waist, jolting my hips upward as he tore it past my legs and tossed it away. \u201cIt turns me on.\u201d</p><p>I wedged my knees tightly together. \u201cThis is rape, Jason. This is worse than murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said death was the worst one could suffer,\u201d he said cynically, winning the battle to compress me into stillness.</p><p>I shook my head, panting heavily beneath his weight, my teeth so tightly knitted I felt a chip come loose and fall under my tongue. I never even contemplated this. I never even imagined he would be capable.</p><p>I searched the grounds for a distraction, digging deep for the training Mike gave me\u2014for the times he laid on me just like this and wouldn\u2019t back down until I broke free. But it was gone\u2014all of it. I couldn\u2019t sidestep the paralysis of fear enough to think straight.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t about to let him have me, either.</p><p>I kicked my heels into the ground, rocking my whole body from side to side.</p><p>\u201cStop struggling.\u201d Jason jammed the full force of his elbow onto my shoulder. I cried out, my upper body locked into submission. \u201cShut up or they will hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d I cried. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His palm forced me into silence; only a weak sign of terror survived in the back of my throat. \u201cBut I promise, if you lie still, I will only hurt you enough to make you cry. After all\u2014\u201d He pushed his knees into my thighs, forcing my legs up and open, \u201cYou are a virgin. There are bound to be a few...rips.\u201d</p><p>My soul drew away inside me; Oh, please, no. Please don't. I closed my eyes\u2014tried to escape to someplace else in my mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u201d He repositioned himself, then froze, looking up as a yellow beam of torchlight flashed across my face for a single second. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook over here,\u201d called a stranger. \u201cI thought I saw something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike called.</p><p>My heart skipped. I looked up just as Jason looked down at me. Please don\u2019t kill him, Jason. Please don\u2019t. Oh God. I wished he\u2019d just taken me far away. I couldn\u2019t die knowing Mike would too.</p><p>\u201cIf he finds us, he has to die. All of them do.\u201d Jason released me.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Please, don\u2019t kill them! Do what you want with me, but, please just let them live?\u201d I begged, staring into his softening eyes.</p><p>His brow pulled tightly together. He gently took my wrist, tugging it to roll my shoulders off the ground and cradled my face close to his chest. \u201cShh. Okay, just hold tight.\u201d</p><p>Before I had a chance to react, he flung like a rocket into the trees outlining the field. My stomach dropped into my hips; I wrapped my fingers firmly around his jacket, letting go once we landed on the long, scratchy limb of the tallest tree\u2014what seemed like miles off the ground.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cYou just remember this when I come to lie between your legs again.\u201d</p><p>I shivered all over, everything south of my hips going tight. The air up here was cooler, thinner, making the cloud in my head fizzle away a little. My heart was so confused by the combination of terrors that, if I was afraid of being this high up\u2014of looking out across the city and the steep valley of trees beyond the gardens, feeling as though I could land on the ground miles from this spot if I fell\u2014I didn\u2019t notice it, even though my only beams of safety right now were the splintery shelf of branch, only as wide as my hips, and the secure grip of the predator\u2019s fingers around my arm.</p><p>Jason watched the men scour the scene below, then looked back at me. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m in the mood for a little game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Flesh-bombing hunters?\u201d</p><p>He turned and smiled at me. \u201cYou\u2019re funny when you\u2019re frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a common emotional reaction,\u201d I said, kind of embarrassed by it.</p><p>Jason just laughed through his nose, his eyes filling with fondness before he looked back down at Mike, standing a few hundred feet away\u2014talking on his phone. \u201cIf I were a human attacker, he\u2019d have found you by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have some fun with him, shall we?\u201d he said in an unsettlingly smooth tone, then reached behind my back. \u201cAnd since you won\u2019t be needing this.\u201d</p><p>My hands shot up to cover my chest as my bra came loose, leaving a cool feeling around my ribs.</p><p>\u201cJust think of the things he\u2019ll imagine when he finds it.\u201d Jason laughed, and we both watched as, like a ribbon on the breeze, blue lace floated to the earth below\u2014a part of me finally to touch the hands of the man I loved once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mike,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jason smiled down at my crossed arms\u2014the kind of smile David would use. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t felt it before, but while the hope of rescue faded, a chill had seeped in. I nodded softly.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He lifted me into his lap and wrapped my body around him; my legs on either side of his hips; my chest against the silky fabric of his suit. Perfect position to scratch his eyes out. \u201cBe nice, Ara, and you shall live longer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop trying to kill me and I\u2019ll be nice,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cRight now,\u201d he whispered into my cheek, making my skin crawl with the gentle caress of his fingers down my spine, \u201cI am not trying to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you shouldn\u2019t hold me this way. I don\u2019t belong to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you want to belong to me.\u201d His words came out with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just confusing my mind. It\u2019s not real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as real as you want it to be.\u201d</p><p>I went to speak, but the truth swallowed my retort. I did want him. I wanted him to touch me. I wanted him to move his lips from their gentle caress over my shoulder, to the purlieu of my mouth, and kiss me. I had no control over my hand; I felt myself slowly move it, as if by instinct, and cup the side of his neck, my breath falling heavily against his jaw with soft little kisses. And even when I felt him grow between my legs, not one part of me wanted to move away. I saw what my brain craved, saw myself reaching down to unzip him\u2014slip him inside me, and dared not move in case I obeyed that desire.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he hummed, running his hands down my thighs. \u201cYou\u2019re getting hotter. This will make a nice memory to show my brother\u2014the way you hold me as if I were him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn my mind, it is him,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet\u2014\u201d he grabbed my wrists and yanked me away from his chest, \u201c\u2014when you scream for mercy, it will be my name on your lips.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my elbows in to cover myself. \u201cAnd in that, you will become everything you despise about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am nothing like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn eye for an eye says otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Like a flash going off in my face, my mind blanked for a second, waking to a branch against my spine, my fingers clutching it tightly to stop from falling to depths of the empty space behind me. And as the shock of his slap wore down to the pain, I wanted so badly to cry out to the hunters below\u2014to David. To yell out and beg him to save me. I couldn\u2019t understand why he never came. Surely, my dad called him\u2014told him what happened.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Jason gently laid my arm across my bare chest. \u201cIt is horrible that he made you believe you meant something to him.\u201d</p><p>I looked up, livid with spite. \u201cI meant everything to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, yet, you refer to yourself in the past tense. So, you understand then, that vampires move on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I wiped my cheek on my shoulder, trying to blot away the last of his slap. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jason smiled sympathetically. \u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>Below, the voices of the hunters became louder over the savage barking of dogs, headed quickly in our direction.</p><p>\u201cOh, look.\u201d Jason pointed down. \u201cYour replacement has unearthed a clue.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Four</p> <p>I turned my head to see a shadowed figure drop to its knees at the base of the tree, his anguished, incomprehensible sobs rising up audibly, like I was standing beside him. In his open palms, the lacy fabric laid, spilling the taunting tale\u2014a truth I knew he\u2019d feared this whole time. \u201cOh, baby. What has he done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike!\u201d Emily ran up behind him, barely able to catch her breath. \u201cWhat did you fi\u2014\u201d but her words stopped short as her steps slowed, and a crowd gathered around them, dogs tugging at their master\u2019s leads, eager to catch the scent in Mike\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that, Mike,\u201d a man said, scooping up the lacy delicate, passing it to a man in uniform.</p><p>I looked away, my limbs running hot with shame. All I could control in my world were my own tears, so I held them back\u2014holding my breath as if that might keep them at bay. \u201cYou\u2019re a monster, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if you can\u2019t come up with a new name for me once I finish with you. Now...\u201d He pressed a flat palm to my chest and slowly pushed me backward. \u201cShall we continue?\u201d</p><p>The scratch of bark on each bone in my spine meant nothing to me. I held onto the branch with both hands, letting tears trickle down my temples and over my ears as I watched my Zorro walk away\u2014stumbling through his own, deep agony. Emily wrapped her arm around him, and as each person finally melted into the shadows, the emptiness their silence left behind took the last promise of survival. I closed my eyes, whispering goodbye.</p><p>\u201cAre you done feeling sorry for yourself now?\u201d Jason asked, looking down at me with a smug grin.</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d He pried my hand away from the branch and held it up, leaning closer. \u201cDo me a favour. Don\u2019t scream.\u201d</p><p>Would there be any point?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He moved in with his mouth open then stopped. \u201cDo you always answer a question with a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m being murdered and have no other means of defence.\u201d</p><p>The vampire smiled warmly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t the murder part yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. I can relax then.\u201d I pulled tightly against him as he drew my wrist toward his mouth, the point of his fangs showing in his smile, reminding me of the story David told about the effects of venom on the human condition.</p><p>The scar David left on my other hand tingled, and as the cold touch of Jason\u2019s lips mopped my flesh, I shut my eyes tight, digging my nails into the branch, waiting for the sear of his razor teeth. They popped through the surface, like the first cut in the flesh of a peach, and the scream I promised not to release etched its way up my throat. I jammed my tongue against the roof of my mouth, twisting my lips, fighting against all human urges. I felt his bite ease, felt him draw the blood up past his teeth like string up a straw, felt the spicy venom rush along my veins, pulsing and twisting them like worms under sand.</p><p>All sound blotted out around me, leaving only him and I in a world standing excruciatingly still. But the subdued cry in the back of my throat turned to a high shriek when Jason\u2019s fangs tore from my flesh without loosening their hold. The skin came away with a long, peeling sensation, each nerve disconnecting with one last shudder.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t scream, couldn\u2019t make my voice find my lips; they quivered, sitting parted, fighting to feel the air come past them. But there was none\u2014no air, no hope. The muscles in my wrist had detached from the bone, I was sure, leaving the edges of my skin floating on a wild, hot wind\u2014freezing, then burning as the venom raced back through in the opposite direction. Please stop! Please.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop when you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>I tried to roll my body\u2014to send myself to the ground\u2014but he held me fiercely, slowly smearing his tongue across the wound. I kicked both legs, hooking my heels into the bark to push my hips out from under his, but couldn\u2019t get free. And all the lies David told me\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe venom numbs the flesh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019d never let you fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will always protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u2014thrashed about on the trails of my agony, rising in waves of hatred for all; all man, all vampires, for everything that ever was or ever would be. I wanted it to stop. Life to stop. The world to stop. I wanted to scream, to cry with all my heart and beg him to tell me why. Why? Why aren\u2019t you here? Why did you leave me to die like this?</p><p>This pain didn\u2019t belong to me. I shouldn\u2019t be here.</p><p>I cried, letting the sound be whatever the agony in my soul needed it to be, and as I imagined my Mike finding me, cradling me in arms of safety, saying, Baby, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here, you\u2019re safe now, the cry came from a place so much deeper than I\u2019d ever cried before. He\u2019d make it all okay. He\u2019d make it stop.</p><p>David? I turned my head to look at the empty expanse of space beside me. David. Please come for me. Please don\u2019t leave me here to die.</p><p>Jason drew his lips away, moved them up my arm, over my shoulder, stopping just below the softer skin on my chest. His silky hair smelled like apple, and the softness, where it brushed against me, made me relax a little.</p><p>My legs gently fell on either side of the branch, my feet dangling into oblivion. \u201cIs that it?\u201d I asked softly, keeping my eyes closed. \u201cWill I die now?\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed against my ribcage. \u201cNo. I\u2019m going to bite you again.\u201d</p><p>Before I could think to react, the sear of venom barred my tears and the weight of his body against mine forced the branch into my spine, as if it would rip me in half. I opened my mouth to scream, but Jason pinched the base of my throat, gagging me with my own tongue.</p><p>I let go of the branch and dug my thumb into his wrist, merely making him hold tighter\u2014trapping my anguish inside of me.</p><p>Then, like holding your breath for a second too long before finally inhaling, he released my throat, leaning back to look down at me.</p><p>Tiny, rasping breaths of agony lifted my chest in quick jolts. I ran my swollen tongue over the roof of my mouth, trying to open the passage again. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d I stammered. I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cOkay, just calm down. I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d He rubbed his thumb across the lump in my throat, and the tension eased, oozing past my dry lips, as if the venom in my limbs had finally seeped into my muscles. I could actually feel it assimilate, like a drop of food dye in a glass of water, making the burn in my arm feel like hot sauce on raw skin.</p><p>The predator wiped his sleeve along his mouth, breathing heavily as if he\u2019d just enjoyed a swig of cola on a really hot day. \u201cI knew you\u2019d taste lovely, Ara-Rose. After all, my brother always did like them... sweet.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t see how that was relevant. I really didn\u2019t care to know how he enjoyed my blood; all I could focus on was the violent quiver of my jaw, making my teeth clatter in my mouth, and the deepest, most binding cold I\u2019d ever suffered. \u201cK...K...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He pressed his ear to my lips.</p><p>\u201cKill me.\u201d</p><p>He sat back, a cruel smile shining out under the blood. \u201cOnly if you beg me nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cP\u2014\u201d I shut my eyes, moistening my throat. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Nothing but a breath of perfect silence passed me, a cool breeze parting my lips, lifting my hair from my face as the ground rushed up to meet me.</p><p>Sharp vibrations rattled through my core, resonating with the sound of dry pasta snapping between teeth. The impact of the fall struck me only as a memory when my body came to rest in a dishevelled lump at the base of the tree.</p><p>Jason appeared beside me, crouching into a soft landing. Though I was weary and suffocating under pain, I could see his face perfectly in the darkness now. His tight lips broke into a malicious spread as our eyes met, and he reached down to shift my body, curving my rag doll limbs to the correct position. I could feel them move, but they felt lank and hollow, like the empty sleeve of a coat.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said, brushing my cheek. \u201cDon't cry.\u201d</p><p>I tried not to\u2014tried to breathe, but every time my lungs expanded, a sharp jab made me stop. I just wanted to be dead.</p><p>\u201cYou will be soon, sweet girl. And it\u2019s better this way\u2014if you can't move.\u201d He sat taller, indulgently eyeing my half-naked form. \u201cIt won't take me as long if I don't have to pin you down.\u201d</p><p>My lip folded down tightly, trembling. I held perfectly still, wiping an imaginary cloth over my body to rid the creeping, icky feeling tingling up my spine\u2014branching out from where his hand rested against my leg. I didn\u2019t want this end. I didn\u2019t want to lose my virginity like this. I just wanted to be loved\u2014to feel the touch of a person that wanted me like I wanted them. Please not this, Jason, please\u2014kill me, but don\u2019t do this to me.</p><p>He studied my face for a long moment, the crease in his brow slowly growing deeper, his lips going tighter, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>Warm tears ran in streams over the sides of my face, and the burning in my limbs ceased, giving way to a dull, knife-like sear. But my mind focused only on Jason towering over me\u2014my legs apart beneath him, his body free to enter mine, as I had no way to stop him. I just wanted to bend my knee and kick him in the groin again, send his balls into his throat.</p><p>\u201cNow, now, sweet Ara. Be nice.\u201d He rose up over my body to wipe the tears from my cheeks, but stopped, his head cocked. \u201cLook at you\u2014so broken, so sad, but still just so pretty.\u201d</p><p>And he was just so much like David. If I watched his face, ignoring the deeper, almost timid tones of his voice, I could almost imagine he was David\u2014almost needed to imagine he was so my heart could survive the fear. They say that fear paralyses, but that was the wrong word. It felt more like running full speed, then stopping at a dead end with no air.</p><p>Each breath I took responded to my panic, rising inch for inch with Jason\u2019s lips moving down my body. He kissed me sweetly on my rib, running his thumb over the bite, then moved down along my flesh, coming to a halt at the very top of my inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to bite you here\u2014that day he drank your blood.\u201d He kissed me there. \u201cHe was afraid you\u2019d die if he bit you. But, luckily\u2014\u201d He looked over his shoulder for a second, \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>No, please stop\u2014please don\u2019t, Jason.</p><p>The familiarity of leaves rustling above me with the garden-scented breeze made my heart ache for normality. Even the stars, once so mysterious, seemed only so recognisable to my weary eyes as I watched them, wishing on each one for something, anything to come along and save me from this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already bitten you, Ara. Only death can save you now,\u201d he said, and like a serrated clamp broke the flesh, he sank his teeth into my leg. A surge of agony stole a squeal from my lips; it split the air like a thousand knives through an eternity of silence and echoed off the emptiness all around me. My thigh bone seemed to lengthen with the ferocious burning, making the scream move deeper into my soul\u2014resounding from the back of my throat in the highest save-me-God-save-me pitch I\u2019d ever heard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJason. Stop,\u201d I pleaded, and finally, all life, all sound faded, my cry becoming only a distant shriek, like a whistle blowing. But even when I closed my mouth, panting as the pain blast through my hip, the whistle continued.</p><p>Then, I heard a holler: \u201cShe\u2019s over here\u2014over here.\u201d</p><p>The whistle blew once more, echoing in my mind as if I were spinning in a giant plastic bin.</p> <p>Jason sighed. \u201cWhy did you have to go and scream? Now you\u2019ve ruined all my fun.\u201d</p><p>The cold night air burned my throat as it scraped into my lungs, dragging vestiges of Jason\u2019s sweet scent with it\u2014a scent that once reminded me of love, but now, only reeked of cold fear.</p><p>He landed on the grass, his body stretched out alongside mine, a cheeky grin putting the vampire to rest. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for you.\u201d</p><p>I tried to nod. I knew this much, but I knew he wasn\u2019t finished with me yet, either. Vampires were fast\u2014he had plenty of time. Just promise me you won\u2019t hurt any of them, Jason.</p><p>His immaculately green eyes softened, turning bright as his body absorbed the life-force of my blood. \u201cI want you to know, Ara\u2014\u201d he leaned down, his deep voice vibrating warmly against my brow, \u201c\u2014I\u2019ve enjoyed our time together, although it\u2019s been cut short. And I will watch when they come for you. I want to see what your replacement thinks when he finds you like this\u2014so broken, so demoralised, just a worthless, unwanted little girl that nobody cared to fight for.\u201d</p> <p>I swallowed back the lump in my throat. The venom had burned in my limbs for so long now that they were numb to all he could think of to hurt me\u2014except the truth.</p><p>Jason was right. David never came for me. Even until I hit the ground, I still, stupidly, believed he would come. And now I would die alone\u2014disgraced, and all hope for an eternity of blood would only ever be a promise I wished I\u2019d made. I ruined my own life by loving a vampire. I should never have loved David once I knew what he was\u2014but I would love him anyway, for all time.</p><p>A sharp, tight grip capped my throat, and Jason\u2019s cheek touched my jaw as he sank his teeth into the curve of my shoulder. I laid perfectly still. My body twitched, convulsing without the knowledge of my brain. But I felt calm inside\u2014unable to process what I was suffering.</p><p>\u201cYour blood is running thin,\u201d he said, his red, wet mouth right in front of mine.</p><p>I studied it carefully, seeing my David in the way he smiled, the way he closed his lips for a second like he was considering kissing me.</p><p>\u201cI was considering it,\u201d he said, and he looked up from my lips, his eyes cold again. \u201cI know how much it\u2019ll hurt my brother to see our lips touch.\u201d He came down slowly and opened my mouth with his tongue, sinking it inside with a mix of blood and venom or spit or something that burned the back of my throat. I tried not to swallow, holding my breath, but as I coughed from the burn, spitting back in his mouth, I had no choice.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t drown in it,\u201d he said, drawing back, then turned my head to the side so the blood dribbled out the corner of my mouth.</p><p>It was nearly over now. The nightmare was fading away with the stars in the sky. Only second\u2019s left, I could feel it. I\u2019d miss life\u2014miss David, but at least the suffering would be over.</p><p>I felt the fear in my eyes flood away with the serenity of near-death, and I was sure I smiled as I looked up at Jason. \u201cTell David...I love...him,\u201d I muttered weakly\u2014not a message for Jason to deliver, but a part of the story before the end. David would hear it when Jason showed him the memory, and he\u2019d know that, even in death, it was his name on my lips.</p><p>I exhaled and settled back, looking up at the sky; the stars blurred into one thin silver line, and the night sky surrounded me.</p><p>For a second, I saw them; Mum and Harry\u2014nothing more than a flash\u2014just a flicker of a memory, standing there behind Jason. They were waiting for me. I wanted to run to them, call to them, ask them to help me\u2014for anyone to help me. But I knew they weren\u2019t really there, and that even if they were, they couldn\u2019t help. There was no help. People died every day. People suffered every day. No one came to save them, and no one was coming for me.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Mum, I whispered inside, I know you wanted better for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay now.\u201d The memory of her nodded, reaching out. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>But, I need to see David again\u2014tell him I\u2019m sorry; tell him I want to be a vampire now\u2014be with him forever.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said with a sympathetic smile, like everything was okay. But it wasn\u2019t. Not at all. She wasn\u2019t going to help me. She wanted me to come with her\u2014to end it all right now. Right here.</p><p>\u201cDeath is only the beginning, Ara.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThere is so much more for you now.\u201d</p><p>No! I want to go home! \u201cPlease?\u201d Cold air brushed out past my lips\u2014colder than it should be. I thought I felt my hands shaking, but wasn\u2019t sure. The only thing I knew I felt was the warm, mucky feeling of something sticky under my head and all over the side of my neck. I struggled to open my eyes\u2014to remember where it was I had fallen asleep, or how I got there. \u201cMum!\u201d I screamed. \u201cMum?\u201d</p><p>But she was gone. Everything was gone.</p><p>The strange blackness of the world smothered me, tightening around my ribs, making the air thin and humid. I felt myself being pulled down, like I was swimming against a strong current and losing the fight. I tried to kick my legs, to clutch at my throat and tear away the belt of restraint, but my hands were gone; there was nothing to move, nothing to free me from the sweltering wrap of my own death.</p><p>And then, from deep in the darkness, a warm grip pulled me back to the night. A hand. Something waking me from the depths of my own fear. I held onto it with my mind, focused on it with all of my strength until I heard a voice: \u201cAra? Baby, oh baby.\u201d It echoed like an old memory. \u201cGod, what has he done to you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I think I whispered.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d His golden voice hit the walls of my subconscious and bounced off the empty space around me. \u201cYou stay with me...with me...with me,\u201d it echoed again. \u201cAra, please\u2014don\u2019t let go...let go...let go\u2014\u201d I felt a hand around the back of my head, and a heavy cold settled on my limbs, making me wish I could sleep. Just fall asleep and everything would be okay.</p><p>\u201cMi-ke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d his distraught voice cut out under grief. \u201cGet help\u2014please, she\u2019s losing too much blood. Get help!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Five</p><p>Nothing. No stars. No sound. I tried to open my eyes to see against the black, but as I truly noticed the emptiness for the first time, I felt my heart stop; my eyes were already open.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I called, but my own voice fell flat in front of me, as if I\u2019d spoken into cupped hands. I waited; waited past that moment you expect everything to be okay, past the breath you held when you thought you heard something, and finally realised what happened.</p><p>I\u2019d let go.</p><p>Perfect silence. Complete weightlessness; it almost made me breathless, like I needed sound or a horizon to remind me how to breathe. I couldn\u2019t breathe\u2014couldn\u2019t suffocate because there was only emptiness where my lungs should be. All I could actually feel were tingles, shivering across every part of my body that had turned into air. I wanted to break free, but there was nothing to break free from.</p><p>I was gone.</p><p>Mike was gone.</p><p>The world was gone.</p><p>Everything was gone...</p><p>Floating through space and time, I waited for morning to come and light the corners of this dark room, but the sun never rose. I wasn\u2019t sure how many days or years had passed, but this couldn\u2019t be sleep\u2014it couldn\u2019t just be a dream. In fact, I was pretty sure this was Hell. No fire, no pain, just...eternal blackness slowly, second by quiet second, driving you mad.</p><p>It reminded me of the time I went swimming as a little girl; I\u2019d closed my eyes and floated in the water for a while. With my ears under the lashing of waves, aware only of my own thoughts, I had thought it was peaceful then, but here, in this unimaginable expanse of nothing, floating, unable to find the shore, it was just agonisingly confining.</p><p>The only thing I ever found down here was the memories\u2014hidden behind shadows in the darkness. And when the darkness got too much, those memories became nightmares\u2014unhappy endings I\u2019d keep examining in my mind\u2014over and over again, never able to find the conclusion, because there\u2019d never be a conclusion. Not for me, anyway. In death, we have no resolution.</p><p>My last breath would have been taken in the arms of my best friend; my naked, twisted and broken body would have stirred thoughts in him I couldn\u2019t control; he\u2019d think Jason raped me, did other unspeakable things to me, and I couldn\u2019t tell him the truth.</p><p>Tears of frustration and anger wanted release, but with no face and no eyes to cry from, they were trapped, lodged like a rolled-up sock in my chest\u2014quivering and growing into a feeling I had never known before. I wanted to rattle the bars of my cage, to scream at those responsible.</p><p>But the rage always wore down to misery, and when misery was unreleased, trapped in by nothingness, it turned to fear, then to rage again. It was an endless cycle. And even that made me mad, because there was just nothing...nothing I could do to make it stop.</p><p>\u201cLet me out of here!\u201d my mind called into the darkness. I imagined myself circling around, gripping my hair with both hands, falling to the floor with my head in my knees.</p><p>It did no good to picture it, though. I still felt just the same.</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d I imagined myself looking up\u2014to wherever up was. \u201cMike. He didn\u2019t rape me.\u201d</p><p>I needed him to know that. I needed him to know how sorry I was for leaving the dance, and for not remembering what he taught me all those years\u2014how to survive, how to fight.</p><p>\u201cMike? Please, please be there. Please.\u201d</p><p>But nothing ever answered back.</p><p>The rage subsided again and I watched my imagination fall to her knees. She looked so fragile and human, so broken and alone. I felt no pity for her, though, because she did this to herself. She let herself walk into the arms of a vampire, and now, she was dead.</p><p>Dreams had happened in the blackness. Once or twice, I\u2019d seen myself somewhere else, only to wake in the nothing again. As I wandered forward, of full body, I knew this was just another dream.</p><p>The emptiness around me was coloured with blue plumes of smoke, rising up, gripping my ankles and hips like creeping fingers. The message I\u2019d been trying to get to my fianc\u00e9 was still trembling on my lips, stuck, like a ghost that couldn\u2019t cross over. \u201cMike?\u201d I said weakly into the darkness. \u201cMike, please listen.\u201d</p><p>With each step I took, I could feel the fine, tickly tips of the grass between my toes. I walked through the smoke, reaching out to touch anything at my fingertips. I\u2019d take a tree in the head right now\u2014just to feel.</p><p>When the sound of soft, ragged breaths came from somewhere ahead, I looked deeper into the darkness\u2014past the blur, past the shadows.</p><p>Then, I saw him.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up. As he became completely visible for the first time, so too did the world around him\u2014but not me. The storm clouds overhead raged and swirled, lapping the horizon with the promise of a wild night. But my hair, my dress, and my existence stayed frozen in time.</p><p>Mike stood hunched and shaking, one hand splayed out on something stone, while his lungs fought to find the breath that would make it all okay. \u201cAra, baby. I\u2019m so, so sorry. I should\u2019ve protected you. I should\u2019ve been there to stop him from hurting you.\u201d</p><p>I watched on, my lip trembling, tears edging tightly on the brink of hysterics.</p><p>Mike lost his words to grief, sobbing heavily into his fingertips, as he reached into his pocket, removing a closed fist. My thumb landed on my ring finger when the gentle tink of glass drew my eyes to what he placed atop the stone.</p><p>\u201cThis is where it belongs now,\u201d he said and backed away, wiping a weary hand across his lips. As his shadow receded, allowing light against the words on the headstone, the core of my being imploded:</p><p>\u2018Ara-Rose: Loved Eternally.\u2019</p><p>All life drew from my soul, like my existence happened in reverse for that spilt second, and the remains of the ring I once wore for love bled out over the stone, weeping crimson tears across my name.</p><p>I stumbled on my heels, reaching out for something to ground me. And the dream slipped away, becoming smaller until the blackness swallowed it whole. He was gone, but I knew he still existed out there, somewhere I could never go\u2014just like everything I loved\u2014lost in a world I would not see again; their smiles, their voices, their warm arms. All gone. They would grow old and pass, time would pass, and I would remain here.</p><p>Ghosts were supposed to watch\u2014to see who was at their funeral, to see who mourned them. I was supposed to see David again\u2014to know if he came to my grave. I was supposed to sit beside him, comfort him, though he\u2019d never know I was there. Everything just turned out so wrong. How had it all gone so wrong?</p><p>The imaginary me appeared in full light, just a soft, golden glow in the darkness, her pale dress billowing, like the fingers of a ghost. She was the storybook version I thought death would be. But I was the reality, sitting across from her\u2014an empty vessel, dark, invisible, tortured. There were no happy reunions in the afterlife, no peace and, from what I could tell, no God, either. I had called to Him; called to everyone I could think of\u2014even called to Rochelle. But she wasn\u2019t here. God wasn\u2019t. Buddha. Anyone. Just me. Just me and my regrets.</p><p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d said my imagination.</p><p>I wanted to shake my head. She wasn\u2019t there either. I wasn\u2019t sure there was even a mind. I knew only an eternity of nothing\u2014my punishment, I guess, for condemning David\u2019s heart to the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was the little things I missed the most, like a smile or colour or twisting my ring around on my finger\u2014my ruby rose. Mike would be so sad I couldn\u2019t wear it. And I once thought David would be so sad that I did. But I guess time changes our assumptions. Or our hearts.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what he\u2019ll do\u2014David\u2014when Jason shows him the memory of what he did to us,\u201d the imagination said.</p><p>We didn\u2019t need to wonder, though. \u201cDavid will hate me for letting Jason hold me the way he did in the tree.\u201d That was supposed to be David\u2019s right. He told me once, so long ago, that the touch of human skin to a vampire was like a thousand kisses of ecstasy; like satiating an eternal hunger with the warmth of one breath. He\u2019d never forgive me for giving that to his brother.</p> <p>I wished I could go back\u2014tell him I was sorry. I should have stayed on the dance floor with Mike; I should never have gone with Jason.</p><p>\u201cBut you knew that then, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou went with Jason, knowing deep inside that he was dangerous. You tempted Fate, tempted danger, so David would realise how precious we are to him, and stay with us forever.\u201d</p><p>I thought about it for a second. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, then I am one big, epic fail, and I will never see David again\u2014never find out why he didn\u2019t show for the last dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d the imagination said, smiling. \u201cHe told you that vampires leave and move on without saying goodbye\u2014without telling people why.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, because it raises more suspicions when questions are asked. They simply send a letter resigning from jobs or schools and they\u2019re never seen again.\u201d As I finished the sentence, realisation struck me worse than shock. \u201cIs that what he did to me? Did he leave me, and I never saw it coming? Did he convince me that he\u2019d come back so that I wouldn\u2019t try to find him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you already know the answer to that question, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is right. David didn\u2019t come...because David never was coming.\u201d</p><p>The remains of my existence suddenly gave up in that one moment. If I could have been speechless or stared blankly, I would have. \u201cThen he really is just as nasty as the memory Jason showed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d my imagination snickered, \u201cand you were just another victim of his cruelty.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Six</p> <p>An alarm clock set my mind on wake; its incessant bleeping stirring me before I was ready. But the sun, usually always up at this hour, was missing. I blinked a few times, thinking maybe my eyes were still closed, and as my breath came back hot against my own lips from a flat surface right above me, I jumped suddenly. Dread filled my lungs out, making my world sink backward. I placed my hands in desperate layers over the sides, the top, the base of this space I was laying, folding my toes down, pushing against the hard there, making my head hit the firm surface above it.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I called, but my voice came back dead absorbed by the wood it fell against. And the tiny box got hotter and smaller around me, my shoulders folding in, narrowing my lungs.</p><p>They thought I was dead.</p><p>I felt my heart\u2014placed my hand right over it to see if it was beating, but I couldn\u2019t feel it\u2014couldn\u2019t feel the wound on my neck or my wrist or anywhere. They\u2019d healed. They were healed and I was in a box.</p><p>Panic rose.</p><p>A chain of fierce screams burst suddenly from my lips, blocked only by the forcing drive of each blow of my elbow, my knee, my foot being cast down on the solid surrounds. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me here.\u201d I scratched the wooden roof, my fingers splintering. But I didn\u2019t care. \u201cPlease. Please, God. Please.\u201d</p><p>I coughed out suddenly, the air leaving my lungs in a vulgar bark, fine particles of earthy powder spiking the back of my throat. The box compressed my shoulders on both sides, stopping my lungs from expanding, denying me the breath of relief I fought for.</p><p>I stopped moving then. Stopped kicking, breathing, everything, and laid perfectly still, listening to the flow of dirt rain down in a heavy pile over my ponytail, cooling my head through the strands of hair.</p> <p>The first rule in this situation would be to not panic. But my chest moved in quick hitches. My fingers balled up so tight my thumb cut my hand, I was sure, and I couldn\u2019t stop the thoughts entering my mind, things David told me\u2014vampires, buried alive for seven days. They survived. They lived through that, tortured, alone, unable to breathe.</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d I bent my knee to the highest angle it could achieve and jammed my foot against the floor, pushing on the lid of this coffin, thrashing about like a beetle caught on its back. \u201cAhh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d a muffled voice came gloriously through the wood then, thick with grief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in here!\u201d I screamed. \u201cMike. Get me out. I\u2019m in here.\u201d I banged on the roof, making the dirt pile grow. But I didn\u2019t care. Mike was there. He\u2019d get me out. He\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cJust squeeze my hand,\u201d he said, cutting off my thought. \u201cPlease. Just once. That\u2019s all I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike. I can\u2019t,\u201d I screamed. \u201cI can\u2019t get out. I\u2019m in a box.\u201d</p><p>I waited, listening, but this container seemed to be soundproofed\u2014from the inside. I tried to sit up, to move, to struggle against the pine confines, but the dirt formed a mound under my head as I lifted it, pushing my nose closer to the lid, arching my neck at an awkward, unnatural angle. And panic returned with a layer of sweat, turning the dirt to mud around my temples and nose. \u201cOh God.\u201d I looked up, shutting my eyes tight. \u201cPlease. Please get me out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo change?\u201d</p><p>My thoughts halted at the sound of another voice.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cNo. Doc says her heart\u2019s not coping,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cTime will tell.\u201d The other voice sounded void of all emotion.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Mike\u2019s tone peaked with incredulity.</p><p>\u201cShe needs rest, and my being here is....\u201d There was a long pause. \u201cPointless.\u201d</p><p>Only a sigh followed that, leaving me by myself again, confined in a space made for those not living. I shut my eyes tight and took slow, deep breaths through my mouth, tasting the raw, almost freshly-cut pine against my lips. I tried to imagine pretty things\u2014butterflies, the sun\u2014not the crawly and possibly undead creatures that might be buried beneath me. I would run out of air soon if I didn\u2019t calm down.</p><p>And strangely, as my belly lifted and fell with each breath, the air trembling out of my tight lungs, so too did the panic.</p><p>I looked around the dark box for what felt like the first time, and instead of pitch black staring back at me, I could make out the ridges in the panels and the oddly-angled nail sticking out beside my eyebrow.</p><p>They\u2019d put me in a box\u2014not a coffin\u2014just a pine box; laid me down, closed me in and nailed it shut. But I would find a way out of here. Come Hell or high water. This would not be my death, and if it was already my death, I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d let it be my eternity.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d The voice echoed through my endless night, resonating from somewhere behind me.</p><p>My eyes shot open and space, cool and airy, greeted me. I brushed my arms, feeling as though there\u2019d be dirt there. But I was clean. I couldn\u2019t remember where I\u2019d been or why I\u2019d be so dirty, but I felt dirty and starved for air.</p><p>\u201cNo change,\u201d said a woman suddenly.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d I said, looking up, searching the empty room for a crack of light to mark my position.</p><p>\u201cCan she hear us?\u201d a man said.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHer monitor changes when I speak. See?\u201d he said, and I got the sense then that they weren\u2019t talking to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just static.\u201d As soon as that man spoke, I knew it was Mike. The other one sounded almost too smooth to be Mike; liquid, if that was the right word.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not static. Look, she can hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d the woman whispered. \u201cBe nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Mike said in a tone that indicated a set of folded arms to go with it. \u201cFrom what I know, the doc says she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra? My love.\u201d Mr Smooth sounded closer than before. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease? Please come back to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. Are...I\u2019m sorry, are you talking to me?\u201d I called.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I blinked a few times, noticing only as I looked down at my feet, that my feet weren\u2019t actually there. I held my arm out and ran my fingers over it, feeling the soft skin, but couldn\u2019t see it. There was nothing there to identify me; no nails, no skin colour, no age spots or bracelets. Not even a bed or a surface to show what kind of room this was; maybe it was a prison, a hospital, a bedroom\u2014a padded cell, perhaps even a ballroom with no people. Could even be the White House, for all I knew. But that word, Ara, rang a bell somehow.</p><p>I dropped my arms to my sides, quickly yanking my hand back when it touched something cold. It stung, like dry ice, sticking to me even as I shook my fingers.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that?\u201d the stranger said. \u201cI think...I think she just squeezed my hand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was probably just a flinch. She does that from time to time.\u201d I heard the silky pages of a magazine turn.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d the smooth voice said, dejected. \u201cIt just seemed almost like she was shaking me off. Do you think she...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe what? Knows you\u2019re here? Hates you?\u201d The pages flicked again, and it sounded as though a metal-legged chair scraped along vinyl. \u201cChances are, she was shaking you off. Maybe you should stop touching her.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, looking down at where my fingers were supposed to be. And, like a puppet master, I focused on them, closed them tightly and squeezed the nothing, letting go when that voice laughed, cheering with praise again.</p><p>\u201cShe did. She squeezed my hand. Look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she squeezed your hand?\u201d Mike\u2019s voice came from closer than before and, though it was still dark, I felt space around me\u2014felt him near me. The echoing mist of eternity flowed out through the cracks in my subconscious, leaving me solid, heavy. Really heavy. I didn\u2019t remember being this heavy. I didn\u2019t remember having laid down, on my back, but when I tried to get up, my chest stayed stuck, glued to my spine against this flat surface.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d The smooth stranger interrupted my moment of confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I called, irritated.</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d he said again, as if I hadn\u2019t answered him.</p><p>And now I was getting cranky. It had been God knows how long since I\u2019d eaten, felt the sun, slept, or even seen my own toes, and now this person was talking at me and not answering. I just wanted to get out of here\u2014wherever here was. I just wanted to go home to Mike and lay in his arms. I was tired of the dark\u2014of the black. I couldn't even remember where I'd been all this time or even why Mike was important to me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in there, man,\u201d Mike said. \u201cAnd if she was, she\u2019s not gonna come to the surface for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see, so you think she\u2019ll wake suddenly to your soft, whispering confessions of love, do you?\u201d Mr Smooth said sarcastically. \u201cDo you have any idea what she and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. Both of you,\u201d a woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s three o\u2019clock. Take yourselves home and get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d the other man said, and I heard his breath, felt it suddenly close to my face, though there was no one in this room. I held my own breath, scrunching my eyes. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>But before I had a chance to answer him again, the surface quaked suddenly under me, my legs tilting through the earth, angling my entire body away from existence. I reached out, panicked, grabbing at imaginary branches as my head followed my feet, sliding downward. There was no wind and no trees for which to show my descent, but I felt it\u2014felt the earth rising up under me.</p><p>I tensed all over, ready to hit the surface, but nothing ever came\u2014only the emptiness of my eternal, hollow Hell.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother to cry this time as the darkness swallowed me, and hope had been lost so long that I\u2019d never truly allowed it back in. I simply existed. In the dark. Alone. My body alive out there somewhere, an empty vessel in their living world, while my soul was slowly dying beneath it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s struggling to breathe.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, clearly having woken to the middle of a conversation.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna put her on a breathing thing.\u201d</p><p>The smooth voice sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want that for her\u2014she\u2019s been through enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, mate, but it\u2019s for the best.\u201d Mike\u2019s warm energy emanated from his voice somewhere near. I wished I could feel him, like, actually touch him. \u201cI can\u2019t lose her. I\u2019d rather see her with a tube down her throat than in a coffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little selfish\u2014prolonging her life merely to save your own grief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly as selfish as to wish she\u2019d die so you don\u2019t have to wonder where she is, what she\u2019s doing, for the rest of your life,\u201d Mike spat.</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing about what I wish for this girl,\u201d his smooth voice cracked like a volcano erupting. I could hear the rumble of anger raging too close to the threshold of release. \u201cIf I could heal her, I would, but you don\u2019t know what she may be suffering in this sleep, Mike. For all we know she\u2019s\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s unconscious. She suffers nothing.\u201d</p><p>All was silent until the smooth voice said flatly, \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014\u201d Mike said; I could imagine him rubbing his face roughly in the pause that followed. \u201cWe\u2019re getting off track. Right now, what\u2019s best for her is\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor us to let her go. Stop sticking needles and tubes in her, trying to make her body live a little longer. She\u2019s gone.\u201d I felt something touch my head. \u201cHer body is the only thing left of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might still recover,\u201d Mike offered.</p><p>\u201cRecover?\u201d his voice pitched high. \u201cLook at her\u2014does she look like she\u2019s going to recover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop yelling.\u201d Mike\u2019s tone of reason made my heart soar with desire to be on the receiving end of one of his lectures. \u201cIf they hear you, they\u2019ll make you leave. One at a time in here, remember?\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause. \u201cIt\u2019s five in the morning. Technically, it\u2019s my shift.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t start this again, Da\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not saying you have to go, just\u2014\u201d Suddenly, my hand returned\u2014just my hand, with a sharp, cold sensation travelling right through each bone in my fingers. I tensed. It hurt, like holding onto ice or snow a little too long. \u201cJust don\u2019t talk hope, okay? I can\u2019t bear to even hope.\u201d</p><p>The silence lingered a while, and all I could focus on was the deep burn of cold in my bones. I wanted to push it away\u2014to make it stop. It branched out from my wrist, slowly trembling up my arm and along my collarbones. I tried to hold my breath, but my lungs weren\u2019t there, a hollow void occupying my chest instead.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should take a walk. You look...stressed,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been here too long. I\u2019m losing my mind, I\u2014\u201d The cold in my hand suddenly came away, replaced by a warm touch that melted the chill left behind. I knew it was Mike. I remembered touching him once, but not the reason why. I wondered if we were friends or if he loved me maybe. Whatever the reason we\u2019d touched, I liked it. I wanted him to know I could feel him; wanted him to know that, despite the fact that I couldn\u2019t talk to him, I was still here. Somehow, I was still here.</p><p>\u201cIs she...smiling?\u201d Mike\u2019s voice peaked on the edge of excited curiosity.</p> <p>\u201cIt means nothing,\u201d said the smooth voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just a muscle reflex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mike said. \u201cNo, she is smiling.\u201d</p><p>The smooth voice sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby girl. I\u2019m here,\u201d Mike whispered in my ear, the warmth of his breath brushing against my hair. It was pleasant\u2014not at all like the cold that had brought me back into reality.</p><p>But though the cold was gone, I stayed, in my mind\u2014aware, in this consciousness\u2014surrounded by the black pit of nothing. I could even smell him now\u2014Mike; he smelled like...a feeling. Like...home.</p><p>I wanted to go home. Wanted to be like Dorothy and find my magic slippers\u2014wish my way back. I shut my eyes tight and imagined them. Red ones, like the movie, not silver, like the book, and clicked my heels together, repeating the words Dorothy used as a spell to get home.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she saying?\u201d asked the smooth stranger.</p><p>\u201cSomething about...?\u201d Mike paused, then repeated my words. My words. They could hear me.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s dreaming?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. Or trying to find her way home,\u201d Mr Smooth suggested.</p><p>I tried harder, cupping imaginary hands tightly together, praying he\u2019d hear me again.</p><p>\u201cLook at her skin.\u201d A hand fell on my brow, a warm one. \u201cShe\u2019s pale. Do you think she\u2019s turni\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>An empty chill stole the hum of the world and a flat, dense darkness consumed my hope, like a vacuum sucking a hole in my belly.</p><p>I was alive, but I was never getting out of here.</p><p>An alarm clock somewhere out there woke me. I wanted to reach over and hit snooze, shut it up, but I was so tired my body wouldn\u2019t wake enough to move. I imagined doing it so many times that when the beep lifted me to the surface of my dreams again, I actually thought I\u2019d already turned it off. It was annoying, but, somewhere in the back of my mind, as I tried to drift back to sleep, my brain interpreted it as rhythm\u2014reminding me of something I\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>Music.</p><p>I remembered music. I remembered a song\u2014one I heard so long ago in a place that felt like home, with a boy I know I loved, but could no longer see when I closed my eyes. His song had the same hollow, kind of sorrowful rhythm as that beep.</p><p>I opened my eyes and foggy light flooded the room, creeping along the walls and floor like the morning sun sweeping the grass in the early hours. It touched my toes, my ankles, and flowed up over my denim jeans and tank top until, as I looked around me for the first time, saw the orange trees and foliage-covered floor of a forest.</p><p>I knew this place...</p><p>The lake! It was the lake.</p><p>And that perfect song was the whisper on the breeze.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I remembered him now.</p><p>Eternity.</p><p>My love.</p><p>The red rose.</p><p>The silky voice.</p><p>It was like I could see him so clearly, sitting just across the way, hunched over a blue guitar, singing that song; his voice so heartbreakingly beautiful. With each note he played, my heart beat double-time, the alarm clock beeping out there in the same rapid pattern.</p><p>\u201cOh, David.\u201d I covered my mouth with a shaky hand, feeling tears track my cheeks like unfamiliar friends in a home they once knew well. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s song echoed in the space around me, the volume dropping slowly as it faded away under the alarm clock getting louder, more powerful\u2014the single-tone drowning out the beauty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d a stiff-sounding man said.</p><p>My body became stiff too, and tight; I could feel gravity again, but couldn\u2019t use it.</p><p>\u201cOnce the tube is out, she may just slip away,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Someone burst into tears; Vicki, I think. \u201cShe looks perfectly fine. How can she be brain-dead?\u201d</p><p>What? Brain-dead? I\u2019m not brain-dead. I struggled against my confines\u2014trying to get up. What did they mean by brain dead?</p><p>\u201cThe tests were conclusive, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m sorry. In some cases, the patient can stay in a coma, on life-support, for years to come. In your daughter\u2019s case, it would be best for her if she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Wait! No, I yelled. I\u2019m not brain-dead. Vicki. Dad. Please?</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Vicki said. \u201cJust...don\u2019t take it out yet. Please? Give her more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father signed the forms, Mrs Thompson. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg?\u201d her voice broke. \u201cGreg, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicki. Just stop,\u201d Mike said. \u201cShe\u2019s gone. Don\u2019t make her suffer any more than she already has.\u201d</p><p>Mike? No. Don\u2019t give up on me, Mike. I\u2019m still in here. They got it wrong.</p><p>\u201cHand me that tray, please?\u201d the stiff-sounding man said to someone, and in my world, I clutched my own chin as the feel of muggy, sweaty hands touched it.</p><p>Get off. Stop touching me! I couldn\u2019t move. I felt my body, felt my arms, my face, but couldn\u2019t get his sticky hands off me. Please? Don\u2019t let me go yet. Don\u2019t give up on me.</p><p>David! Where was David? He could read my mind, tell them I was still here, help me, rescue me.</p><p>But he left me, gave me away. He never even came to...</p><p>A tugging sensation snaked up my throat, grating my insides like the ribbed curve of a straw. My lungs felt tight, strained\u2014as if air was being drawn in through a thick cloth over my mouth.</p><p>The room went silent for a breath, then, the beeps sounded in one flat pitch.</p><p>\u201cGreg, please?\u201d Vicki whispered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let her go.\u201d</p><p>The anguished sobs of those around me flooded my heart. I focused on the beeps\u2014willed them to move\u2014but they rang out in monotone.</p><p>\u201cFight, Ara,\u201d a smooth voice hummed, the melody dark with sorrow, as cool lips brushed softly over my eyes...</p><p>Wait, cool? David?</p><p>The air was so thick I couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t catch a gasp to scream out to him\u2014to David. He was there. Right there beside me. But nothing had changed. They couldn\u2019t hear me. David couldn\u2019t hear me.</p><p>And like a door slamming shut at the end of a long, empty corridor, a dead echo rang all around me. I felt myself whole\u2014felt my fingers, toes, arms, legs, everything was here in this room with me, but I couldn\u2019t see them. I held my arm out and ran my fingers down my completely invisible skin.</p><p>\u201cTell me how to get out of here,\u201d I yelled up at the uninhabited void. \u201cI know you\u2019re out there. I know you can hear me.\u201d</p><p>A trickling sound, like water over pebbles, filled the space around me and an eerie feeling lingered along my neck. I turned slightly, noticing a thickness to the dark, like a shadow stood there. But when I tried to focus on it, it was gone.</p><p>I closed my eyes tight and crossed my fingers, willing the beeps to move again. \u201cGod, please. If you\u2019re up there, please...?\u201d</p><p>Then, under my prayer, I heard a sound; I opened one eye and looked around, sure it wasn\u2019t possible\u2014until I heard it again; small and faint, and such a long, quiet pause between each one.</p><p>My heart skipped a beat and the beep copied.</p><p>\u201cGet the doctor,\u201d someone ordered, and Vicki\u2019s high voice broke into sobs, my Dad\u2019s deep, soothing whisper rising above it with comforting words. I missed my dad so much. Would give anything to see his smile again.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d my Dad said. \u201cJust breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Mike\u2019s voice sounded so thick with sadness. \u201cI can\u2019t. Where\u2019s the goddamn doctor?\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a glitch,\u201d the stiff man said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a goddamn glitch,\u201d Mike screamed. \u201cShe\u2019s alive. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d His voice trailed away to soft sobs under my dad\u2019s mutters. And everything went quiet again.</p><p>I held my breath, listened carefully, but there were no voices, no beeps\u2014nothing.</p><p>I understood then; I was a prisoner in their world. David was right beside me, and I couldn\u2019t even look at him; couldn\u2019t even hold him.</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d David\u2019s hand swept my brow, bringing the world back, desperation rising up in his controlled tone. \u201cS\u2019il te plait, mon amour, lute, bats toi pour vivre.\u201d</p><p>It was no good. I couldn\u2019t wake my mind. I couldn\u2019t reach over and press snooze. I couldn\u2019t even understand what he was saying to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost her,\u201d the words trembled from his lips. \u201cI\u2019ve lost her.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, David, I whispered with weakened resolve.</p><p>And as if David had felt me give up, his cold hand slipped behind my neck and lifted my head. \u201cAra? My love, please be in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMate,\u201d Mike said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to let her go.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s arms wrapped me tightly, his hands searching, touching every inch of flesh as if to caress me back to life.</p><p>Then, as the panic reduced to realisation, his hands slowed and a cold drop of liquid fell onto the bridge of my nose. \u201cPlease? Fight. I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d He took a deep, strained breath and pressed his lips to my brow. \u201cJe vous en prie, Dieu, sauvez-la.\u201d He took another jagged gasp. \u201cS'il vous pla\u00eet, ne l'enlevez pas loin de moi. Ne me l'enlevez pas.\u201d</p><p>His words hung in the back of my mind, resonating with a tone of understanding; as if I were right in front of him; they looped around me, pulling me into him, and as I touched my face to his chest, they became suddenly very clear: \u201cI\u2019m begging you, God, save her. Don\u2019t take her from me. Don\u2019t take her away.\u201d</p><p>His devastation broke my heart. Oh David. I\u2019m so sorry. I love you. If you can hear me, please know that. Please take care of Mike\u2014tell him I love him too.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. I wanted him to answer just once\u2014just so I knew he heard me, knew how much I loved him, heard the words I wished I\u2019d said when he asked me to change for him.</p><p>David? Please?</p><p>Nothing...</p><p>David? My throat hurt.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Something moved under me as he spoke\u2014my body, I could feel my body, feel the bulky, uneven surface I was laying on. A cold grip tightened ever so slightly around my waist. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I tried again. I could hear the terror in my cry, but it was real\u2014my voice\u2014it came from somewhere different than it had before.</p><p>David laughed from behind me, his lips on the side of my face. \u201cYes. Yes, my love. Yes. You\u2019re talking. Open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re closed? Gravity pulled my skin, dragging it down. I fought against the push and lifted my eyelids, blinking rapidly.</p><p>Bright.</p><p>Light.</p><p>Tears rushed to my irises to protect them from this new experience, burning my vision into a white blur. I couldn\u2019t focus on anything, but I loved it more than the breath I could suddenly feel through my lips.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I smiled. \u201cAm I...am I out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui, mon amour, oui, you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you saved me. You pulled me out.\u201d I held his hand tight over my belly as the gift of sight restored and I felt his arms become the cold that was restraining before. His chest shook under me; tears dripped from his chin beside my ear and fell onto my shoulder as I took in the room; a white room, a bed, a chair\u2014a glass window looking onto the corridor of a hospital. \u201cWhat...happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d he started, but couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cWe lost you, baby,\u201d said Mike.</p><p>Oh, Mike! That\u2019s when I felt my heart\u2014it was still beating, and it was strong. \u201cMike?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Ara. I\u2019m right here.\u201d He appeared then, by my side. The warmth, the hand I felt in my darkness, it was Mike. I didn\u2019t imagine it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What am I doing in a hospital?\u201d I asked, rubbing my face.</p><p>David looked at Mike, then they both looked at me. \u201cYou lost a lot of blood\u2014they had to put you on a life support system.\u201d Mike\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but, what happened to me?\u201d My memory hit the foggy wall of perplexity. I didn't even remember getting up this morning.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t this morning.\u201d David answered my thought.</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, you\u2019ve been in a coma for three months.\u201d Mike\u2019s voice trembled; he turned away so I couldn\u2019t see his face, but I only had to see his shoulders shaking to know he was crying.</p><p>What? Three months?</p><p>I tried to look around the room to get my bearings.</p><p>Three months?</p><p>I felt nothing then, except a throbbing in my head as I tried to piece together the last few months of my life. \u201cOkay.\u201d I took a few deep breaths, bringing myself to terms with this new information. \u201cSo, a coma\u2014but why? How did I get in a coma?\u201d</p> <p>Mike\u2019s shoulders rolled forward even more.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head, refusing to look at me.</p><p>I looked down at my hands, felt my face, my throat, checking for something, anything that would give me a clue. Then, I felt the silky, lumpy rise of gathered skin on my neck, and as I looked down, to nothing in particular, saw the horrid parallel lines of raised pink skin down the length of my forearm. I drew a breath, tracing the scar with wide eyes, afraid to touch it\u2014not sure if it was really there or if this was some nightmare. \u201cDid I do this to myself?\u201d</p><p>Mike released the sob he\u2019d obviously been trying to restrain, and David held his breath, cradling me in his arms\u2014pressing his cheek firmly to mine with the same intensity as his grip around my waist. Then, with a wash of cold trepidation, the memory hit me.</p><p>Jason did it?</p><p>David squeezed me tighter.</p><p>I rubbed my head, letting the tears spill out over my lashes. Jason. He\u2014he hurt me. The cold. The dark. I remember.</p> <p>\u201cShh, hush, my love, it\u2019s...it\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Mike leaned over me and, placing his hand on my forehead, studied my face as I fell apart inside. \u201cWhy is she breathing like that?\u201d</p><p>David stood up and laid me flat on my back.</p><p>\u201cGet the nurse,\u201d Mike ordered, moving a pillow from under my head.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I held my hand out, taking deeper, more controlled breaths. \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, you\u2019re as white as a ghost.\u201d Mike folded himself around me, and the warm smell of home reminded me that I was safe, that I was okay now and the darkness was gone\u2014Jason was gone. I rested my chin in the curve of his neck.</p><p>David?</p><p>He looked at me, his emerald-green eyes shining out under his low-pulled brow.</p><p>Did he find me, David? Did Mike find me? I clutched Mike\u2019s shoulder tightly, studying David\u2019s face for proof of a lie, trying to feel my heart beating\u2014to steady it\u2014but after months of sensory deprivation, everything was so loud and so bright. I couldn\u2019t feel it beating anymore.</p><p>David closed his eyes, nodding, and looked away.</p><p>I knew what Mike would\u2019ve seen. I knew what David would\u2019ve seen in Mike\u2019s head\u2014even he couldn\u2019t look at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mike,\u201d I cried. \u201cOh, God. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Mike let out a gust of air and his sad gaze drew me in as he pulled back. Tears streamed over his cheeks, his eyes falling stunned into the silence that stopped on his lips. \u201cAr, I...\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flushed with heat; I turned my face away.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mike took my chin in his fingers and made me look at him. \u201cNo, Ara, you have nothing to be sorry for. You did nothing wrong. This is something that was done to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe bit me.\u201d I touched my neck.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mike\u2019s eyes, with desperation hiding in the corners, met mine. \u201cDo you remember anything else?\u201d</p><p>I looked at David, who lifted his head when he read my thought; He bit me, does that mean I\u2019m a...?</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>I\u2019m not a vampire?</p><p>He closed his eyes and shook his head again.</p><p>My breathing slowed entirely. I lowered my head and rested my hand across my lips. Why? Why aren\u2019t I dead then? He bit me. I should be dead, right?</p><p>Our gazes locked again; David nodded.</p><p>Mike moistened his dry lips, then wiped a palm across his mouth. \u201cI wish I\u2019d never let you out of my sight. Just a split second was all it took. I just\u2014I was watching you. I was right there and...\u201d He bit his knuckle for a second. \u201cI tried to get to you\u2014but he was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Mike,\u201d I whispered; it was all I could do to console him. My throat hurt and the muscles under my jaw felt strained.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve protected you. It was my job, Ara.\u201d Mike looked at David for a second. \u201cThey...they say you have the same mark on your neck as that kid who died\u2014Nathan?\u201d</p><p>What? He died from a vampire bite?</p><p>David nodded.</p><p>A vampire? Not you, David? You didn\u2019t do it, did you?</p><p>He closed his eyes. Mike studied the both of us, no clue we were exchanging our own private words. I looked away from Mike, and my wide eyes studied every inch of David\u2019s face. There was no way David killed Nathan. I couldn\u2019t believe that. I wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>David looked up, his warm eyes softening as he opened them and muttered, \u201cThank you,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>\u201cThey just can\u2019t understand why\u2014if it was the same guy\u2014why Nathan didn\u2019t report an attack,\u201d Mike said. \u201cAra, you shouldn\u2019t be alive right now. Your attacker was carrying some rare tropical disease. You died!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They pronounced you brain-dead. You flat-lined, they took out the breathing tube and your heart stopped. But then, the monitor\u2014\u201d he looked at the small screen behind me, \u201c\u2014it started beeping again. You kept going. Somehow, you found a way.\u201d</p><p>The memory of the darkness filled my mind; the air became thick and hard to inhale, closing me in, the dry smell of dirt choking me. I looked down at my hand. \u201cMy ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d Mike pulled it from his pocket and held it up; it looked so small and fragile in his broad, strong fingers.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost it. All this time, in the darkness, I thought I\u2019d lost it.\u201d My voice quivered as the reality of being alive set in.</p><p>David closed his eyes and looked away when Mike slipped the ring back onto my finger. I had no time to stop him\u2014it just happened, and the hurt on David\u2019s face tore my heart as it dropped into my stomach.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let you keep it on,\u201d Mike said softly. \u201cBut I kept it close to me every day.\u201d</p><p>Like a habit that had been formed over years, I twisted the ring around on my finger and studied the shimmering red of the ruby, regretting having asked Mike about it. \u201cWhere\u2019s Vicki? My Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey went for coffee,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThey stayed for a while, but your dad needed a break\u2014he\u2019s not doing so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you call them?\u201d I asked Mike, but looked at David quickly. I need him to go, David\u2014I need to talk to you.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Mike nodded. \u201cSure, kid. I\u2019ll be right back. David, man?\u201d</p><p>David snapped out of his stiff-lipped stare. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her go, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and took my hand, crushing the ring against my finger as he squeezed it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of her for you.\u201d</p><p>Mike paused a second, ignoring the resentment we all heard in David\u2019s tone, then, with his phone in hand, closed the door, and I turned to David, trying to stop my lip from quivering.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI know where you\u2019ve been. I tried to bring you back, but I just couldn\u2019t reach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did he do that to me?\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s face crumpled, but he stiffened immediately and held straight. \u201cHe wanted to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not remember what he showed you?\u201d</p><p>Rochelle?</p><p>He looked away. \u201cHe\u2019s never forgiven me. I thought we\u2019d moved past it. But he was just biding his time until I fell in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, that was fifty years ago, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>David nodded, stroking my cheek with the back of his finger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara. There are no words...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo words I can offer you to make this all right.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his hand and held it to my cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re here. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What matters is that you\u2019re alive, and that this will never, ever happen to you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...he won't...I mean, he won\u2019t come back for me?\u201d</p><p>David shook his head, seeming to detain the words that might\u2019ve accompanied the action.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he left you alive, Ara. For what reason, I do not know, but the fact that you\u2019re still here\u2014that he gave you the chance to survive, and that he didn't kill Mike when he found you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Jason was there when Mike found me?\u201d I pushed myself up to sit.</p><p>David nodded, pressing my chest until I laid back down.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it all.\u201d He rolled his chin toward his chest.</p><p>I looked away, going numb all over. \u201cHe told me he was going to make you watch.\u201d I hoped he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that, Ara. He wouldn\u2019t show me.\u201d His fists clenched. \u201cI all but ripped it from his mind. When I saw you here, saw the tearing on your throat\u2014I knew. There is only one person in this world who would do that to a girl everyone knew belonged to me.\u201d He took off across the room, stopping by the window, with the daylight reminding us both that the real world still existed out there. \u201cI went straight to him\u2014forced him to show me. Only...I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, David. I should never have went with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ara.\u201d He appeared beside me, taking my hand. \u201cNone of this is your fault. None of it. I left you. I did this. Not you. You should hate me.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not possible, David. It\u2019s not your fault\u2014Jason did this, no one else.</p><p>He sniffed once, staying silent for a while, looking down at my ruby ring. \u201cI will never understand why he didn\u2019t finish what he started\u2014but I am eternally grateful that he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe darkness? He wanted me to be lost down there,\u201d I concluded.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d David shook his head. \u201cNo. He said something\u2014as he left you. Something that just didn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d My brow creased; it felt so weird to use those muscles again.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed you on the cheek and touched your hair, but he did it so gently.\u201d David absentmindedly copied the action of his brother. \u201cHe touched you the way I would. Then he said, You don\u2019t know how special you are. I can break your body, but I\u2019ll never break this.\u201d David placed his hand over my heart. I looked up from my chest and into the confusion on his face. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make any sense. I know him; I know what he\u2019s capable of. Whatever changed his mind, you don\u2019t know how lucky you are\u2014how lucky Mike is. Ara, he was going to\u2014\u201d He closed his eyes.</p><p>An involuntary shudder edged up my spine. We both breathed heavily in the silence for a second.</p><p>\u201cBut he bit me. Why didn\u2019t I change?\u201d</p><p>David drew a long breath, masking the shaking in his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the gene?\u201d Hot tears filled my eyes again. I felt myself being pulled backward\u2014like I\u2019d stayed put in the crowded lounge of an airport and watched myself leave. David looked away. \u201cBut, I...I changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d David nodded. \u201cYou just\u2014it\u2019s just not in your blood, Ara.\u201d</p><p>My whole body stilled, my eyes closing tightly around hot liquid. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die anymore, David. I can\u2019t be without you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know, my love.\u201d He stroked my hair, holding my face to his chest, but there was nothing he could say. \u201cYou can never be a vampire, Ara. The promise of eternity was never mine to give.\u201d</p><p>The emptiness of stolen dreams consumed me, and something died within my soul; all hope fell away to the darkness of my nightmares\u2014like a rose, falling through eternity to a marbled ground of nowhere\u2014laying lifeless and spoiled with a single drop of crimson on her pretty, white petal. The only colour she would ever see again.</p><p>David rested his forehead to mine and tucked a lock of hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cHow can that be?\u201d My words touched his lips in a breath. \u201cHow can it be over now that I\u2019ve made up my mind?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cSometimes, Ara, life is cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this, David. I feel like I\u2019ve lost a part of myself that I\u2019ll never get back\u2014this can\u2019t be the end.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re marrying him,\u201d David\u2019s voice quavered as he nodded toward the hall\u2014to where Mike went to call my dad. \u201cThat\u2019s as concluded as things get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you told me to. You wanted me to.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s fingers tightened around my face. \u201cI\u2019m no saint, Ara. I want what\u2019s best for you, but at the same time...\u201d He let out a heavy breath. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less if being with me meant the end of your future.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen don\u2019t let me go.\u201d Hope filled my voice. \u201cStay with me. Run away with me, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra? I can\u2019t. You know I can\u2019t. I have things I need to deal with\u2014things I must return and take care of, and running away\u2014\u201d he looked down at my face, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s not the answer, my love. Life is the answer, even if loneliness is the outcome.\u201d I went to protest, but David shook his head and pressed his thumbs firmly into my cheekbones, gently pressuring me to silence. \u201cYou will have a good life with him. I know now that I\u2019m leaving you in good hands.\u201d</p><p>We both looked to the hall\u2014to Mike, to my best friend and fianc\u00e9, practically bouncing around the corridor, smiling with more joy radiating from his heart than I had ever seen. When I looked back at David, he was already looking at me; his lips twitching as if words rested there\u2014maybe words I wanted to hear him say.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a life anymore. I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said sympathetically, like an adult telling a child her mother was dead.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t speak to me with such finality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I had a lot of time to think in the darkness, David, and none of it matters to me now.\u201d I sniffled, wiping the liquid from my nose. \u201cLove. True love\u2014that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cYou can never be immortal, Ara. I sat here, by your side, all this time, and I watched you die. I was helpless, unable to save you\u2014forced to let you fade away a little more every day,\u201d his voice broke to a whisper. \u201cYou disappeared into nothing, until every trace of what made you mine, what made you real\u2014was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m still here. David, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change things.\u201d A tight crease pulled his brow at the centre. \u201cLook, I know I said once that I will always hope you would one day change your mind, but that hope no longer exists. It\u2019s been ripped away by reality, Ara. I will not stay with you as a mortal\u2014I have to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Am I so repulsive that you can\u2019t love me with a heartbeat?\u201d</p><p>David stood back and looked down at his clenched fist. \u201cYou know it has nothing to do with lo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d I almost screamed. I could feel my face burning with heat. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you just love me enough to think I\u2019m the only thing that matters? I know I messed up. I know I\u2019m moody and spoiled and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t let you take me away, I\u2019m sorry I went with Jason, and what you\u2019re doing to me now, David, is making me goddamn well sorry I ever fell in lo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d He held a finger up, tilting his head awkwardly away as if he were fighting a deep, instinctual urge within him\u2014what it was, I couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cDon\u2019t say what you\u2019re about to say. If you say it, it\u2019s been said, and you won\u2019t be able to take it back.\u201d</p><p>I held onto the urge to yell at him, to scream at him, but I could only hold it so long; it burst out in a singular cry. I folded my face into my hand. \u201cI hate you. I hate you. I hate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, Ara, stop.\u201d He gathered me in his arms. \u201cAra, please, please don\u2019t do this, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You stop it. Don\u2019t you call me that. You can\u2019t call me that and then leave me.\u201d I grabbed his shirt and looked deep into his eyes, my tears stopping. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You can\u2019t leave. I\u2019ll die if you leave, David. I\u2019ll never be able to co\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to cope, Ara.\u201d He unfolded my fingers from his shirt. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no goddamn choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I do. This is love. This is life. I\u2019m alive.\u201d I tapped my chest. \u201cI\u2019m alive. We get a second chance, David. Don\u2019t waste that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d He looked into me, and I could almost feel him reaching out to stroke my face, but though his eyes said he wanted to, his hands stayed by his sides. \u201cI\u2019m leaving you so you can live. A life with me\u2014running, hiding, like dogs, Ara, would be a waste. I will walk out that door\u2014\u201d he pointed across the room, \u201c\u2014and you have the choice to either say goodbye to me now, or never have the chance again.\u201d</p><p>It hurt so much\u2014in my heart. I rolled my head back, letting my face crumple with the pain of his impassively conclusive words. \u201cDavid. Please. You can't. I won\u2019t live without you. I won\u2019t, and you can\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>But he took another step away from me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped with the disbelief my heart suffered for each inch of space between us. The fight in me turned to fear, and I tried to move my legs\u2014to get up and run after him, but they felt like jelly; I could barely even move my toes.</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d I reached out. \u201cDavid. Don\u2019t. Please. Don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>He looked away from me, his eyes scrunching tightly in the corners as he closed them.</p><p>\u201cDavid, I love you. If I could take it all back, I would. Just, please. Please stay with me\u2014please don\u2019t leave me again. I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t be with me, Ara.\u201d He appeared beside me, stroking his thumb over the release of tears down my cheek. \u201cI left you with scars from my involvement in your life, and it\u2019s time to put it right again. I love you too much to let you get hurt like that.\u201d His voice trembled; he steadied it with a breath. \u201cAnd I can never watch you die again. I swear\u2014\u201d he clutched a fist over his heart, \u201c\u2014as long as I walk this Earth, as long as I continue to move, I will have to believe that you are alive\u2014that you still exist, or I will not survive this human life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I reached for him, just managing to grasp his shirt before he could pull away. \u201cDavid, please\u2014you\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Behind David, the door flung open and Mike\u2019s smile dropped when he saw my face. \u201cWhat have you done to her?\u201d he growled, bounding toward me.</p><p>The tense energy tore away from the space between us as Mike pushed David aside. My outstretched hand gripped tighter, but my fingers slipped, and David backed away, one painful step at a time.</p><p>\u201cAra? What happened?\u201d Mike asked, tucking my abandoned reach into my lap.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d I pushed up from Mike\u2019s embrace and searched the room for David; he hesitated by the door, holding it ajar as his gaze quickly averted once it met mine.</p><p>\u201cI know this will be hard for you, Ara. Believe me, I will regret this decision for the rest of eternity,\u201d his silky voice trembled. \u201cBut I cannot love you the way you are. I will only bring you pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d I whimpered. I\u2019ll die without you. Can\u2019t you feel that?</p><p>\u201cNon, ma cherie. The sun will rise again in your world, but for me, it never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay,\u201d I whispered one last time.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe were just a dream of mine, Ara...but even dreams eventually die.\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed as the words he spoke touched my soul and broke my heart; when I looked up from Mike\u2019s embrace, my David, my knight\u2014was gone.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Seven</p><p>Death, those of us who outrun it, can never escape it. It held me in its clutches long enough to steal my life, and though I could breathe and talk and was capable of human emotion on the outside, inside I was a cold, putrid corpse.</p><p>He left me\u2014backed away, turned around and held his head high as he fled my life for eternity. No second chance, no discussion\u2014just gone.</p><p>My body would heal, so they told me\u2014it would take months of rigorous and painful physiotherapy, but it would, eventually, return to what it once was. But they were talking about my ability to walk to the bathroom by myself or breathe properly when sitting up. None of them knew what torments I suffered inside. Even the psychiatrist in Vicki couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d She broke my reverie, knocking on my already open door.</p><p>I looked up from pretending to read my book. \u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014\u201d She shuffled her feet. \u201cEmily\u2019s on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicki!\u201d I slammed the book down. \u201cI told you. No phone calls. I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Ara, honey, it\u2019s been weeks\u2014she just wants to see you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look all right? God, I can hardly even walk myself to the bathroom, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can, you did it this morning, remember?\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cYes, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, honey? It\u2019ll only be a few mi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done arguing. I said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll uh\u2014I\u2019ll tell her to call back another day.\u201d Vicki nodded and closed the door.</p><p>I stared at the empty space for a moment, lip quivering, arms weighted with grief. I just couldn't do it. I just couldn\u2019t let Em see me. I missed her so much. I missed school, missed normal life, but I was so goddamn ashamed. I didn\u2019t even want to look at my own father, let alone my friends.</p><p>\u201cHey, ba\u2014\u201d I jumped, wiping hot tears from my cheeks, hurriedly grabbing my book as Mike swung my door open. \u201cAra? Baby, are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I held the book to my chest as he sat beside me. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, these are tears of hilarity?\u201d He looked at the title.</p><p>\u201cYup. Funny scene.\u201d I forced a smile.</p><p>Mike\u2019s eyes narrowed, his head seeming to shake, though it held still. I knew he wasn\u2019t born yesterday, but I also knew that with the prudence they all exercised with me lately, he wouldn\u2019t push for the truth. The question was etching on his lips, though; he wanted to know why I cried if I didn\u2019t remember much about the attack, and a part of him, I was sure, wondered if David had something to do with it.</p><p>He asked me once, if there was some reason David had become so upset when he saw the wound on my neck\u2014more upset than anyone else. I simply told him it was because David loved me more than anyone else, and Mike accepted that answer, temporarily. But he\u2019d eventually start piecing things together, I was sure of it.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike said, snapping his fingers in front of my face. \u201cQuit fazing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, eyes on my ring, then shook his head. \u201cNothing. It was nothing. I uh\u2014\u201d he stood up, \u201c\u2014I\u2019ll be in my room if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mike,\u201d I said, and let him walk away. I couldn\u2019t ask him what he\u2019d just said\u2014not when there was a strong chance it was about our engagement. We hadn\u2019t mentioned it since I woke from the coma, and I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to yet.</p><p>I stared at the door again for a while after he closed it, trying not to embrace the past\u2014not to look on it and remember the bad or the good. It was, and would remain, exactly as the dictionary described it\u2014the past.</p><p>As another night rolled to a close, Sam sat at the base of my bed and sketched pictures in his journal. He was good company. It was enough for him to just sit and be silent; he didn\u2019t need to probe or prod for details, attempting to assess my psychological state. It pretty clearly sat high at \u2018completely messed-up\u2019 since the attack\u2014it didn\u2019t take a genius to figure that out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d He held up his book.</p><p>\u201cWow, Sam, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d Not just because the grey sketch of the girl looked exactly like me, but because she was smiling\u2014something I\u2019d not done since coming home.</p><p>He rested the book in his lap and kept his eyes on it. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember much\u2014about the attack?\u201d He pretended to retrace the lines on his picture. \u201cDoes it keep you up at night?\u201d</p><p>I stared at my thumbs, clicking them over each other. \u201cYes. It does. But I try not to think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I rolled over and covered my head with my blankets.</p><p>No one told Sam the finer details of the attack, but gossip had a way of spreading. He came home late from school the other day, kept back on detention after punching a kid who told him my dad lied\u2014that the truth was, my attacker really had...violated me. But no one knew what actually happened; I\u2019d take the truth to my grave\u2014however far away that may be. And I didn\u2019t plan to stay in New England, either. My story made the news and all the major papers; there\u2019d be no escaping the stares if I went back to school. Conclusions based on odd facts were the worst kinds of infectious humiliation. I\u2019d already planned to jump on a plane and go back home as soon as I was well. Whether that was as Mike\u2019s fianc\u00e9 or not, I didn\u2019t care. I just needed to get away from here\u2014away from it all.</p><p>David once said that it was kinder for a vampire to kill a human than to leave them alive, suffering in agony until they finally passed. He was right. Death would have been kinder. Perhaps that\u2019s why Jason left me alive\u2014so I\u2019d walk the Earth for the rest of my days, not only ashamed and broken, reliving the consequences of his cruelty in every nightmare, but also that I\u2019d suffer it alone\u2014without David. He must have known David would leave me if I wasn\u2019t capable of change. He set out to punish David, but I was the one made to suffer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A wild winter gale rattled my windowpane, and the darkness of the night touched every corner of my room. I couldn\u2019t remember Sam leaving, and though I heard Dad and Vicki go to bed, I couldn\u2019t remember if they came in to say goodnight\u2014like they always did.</p><p>The music vibrating through my earphones helped filter out some of the clatter from the wind, but I should\u2019ve been more careful about the playlist I chose because, tonight, in the darkness, these songs flooded my heart with the agony of missing David.</p><p>I made myself small against the wall and hugged my pillow to my chest. The skin along my cheeks hurt from the constant wiping of tears, but as the cold turned them icy against my lips, I forced myself to blot them away. Then, as I sniffled, the memory of David\u2019s scent replayed in the darkness, an apparition of him appearing before me, making me lose the fight to subdue my sobs. I could hardly breathe, hardly stop my shoulders ferociously shaking as I bawled, muffling my cries against my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re not really here, are you?\u201d</p> <p>He stared down at me, his liquid-green eyes intense with sorrow, as if our separation hurt him just as much as me. \u201cIf I were, my love, I shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Then, as swiftly as he appeared, he was gone again, the tone of his smooth voice ringing in my ears as if he\u2019d really spoken.</p><p>I remained breathless, watching the breeze blow in through my window, a second passing before my heart beat again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d I tore my earphones out and ditched my iPod across the room, tossing my pillows and blanket on top so I wouldn\u2019t have to think about it, then rolled over, shivering in the nakedness of my bed, wishing I\u2019d at least kept my blanket. But regret only lasted another few sobs as the exhaustion of healing swept me under the grasp of sleep.</p><p>Morning has a funny way of turning up when it\u2019s not wanted. The unruly wind from last night receded with the moon, and the sun cast a scarlet ribbon across the horizon. Through the reflection of my antique mirror on the other side of my room, I watched a murder of crows flock in the open sky. It was early, but there was still so much beauty in the morning, despite the world\u2019s ignorance to its existence.</p><p>I snuggled up under my blanket, tucking my hand under my pillow, but held my breath, feeling something small and solid slip between my fingertips. I sat up and unfolded my hand, my skin going tight with bumps as a silver chain dangled down, swinging from my heart-shaped locket, the French inscription face up, bringing tears to my eyes.</p> <p>He left this. He was here. I grabbed my blanket in a fist and tucked it to my chin. Why would he do this to me? Why would he leave this when I gave it back to him so I could move on?</p><p>I sobered myself with a shaky gulp of air and wiped my cheeks with my sleeve.</p><p>Because that was just it, wasn\u2019t it? Forever. I promised him my forever, and he promised me eternity. But I had to move on. He made me move on, though he would never let me go. And it occurred to me then, that I\u2019d never let him go either, and needed to stop trying\u2014needed to wear this, keep David close to my heart, alive in my thoughts, because he was a part of me, and I felt nothing if I didn\u2019t love him.</p><p>Mike would know; he\u2019d know I missed David, but he\u2019d accept it, because he loved me, too. I could never move on, not really. I could live for the rest of my life with Mike, and I could be his wife, but, as the fine inscription on the back of the locket read, I belonged to him\u2014to David. I always would.</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d I told myself as I linked the chain around my neck and let it fall against my collarbones\u2014back where it belonged.</p><p>Day turned into night again, and I listened to the familiar sound of dinner conversation going on in the dining room, without me. Mike\u2019s booming laughter flowed up the stairs and poked me in the heart. I wished I could laugh. I wished I could laugh with Mike. But he seemed to be avoiding me. I think. Or maybe he was just trying to give me some space, I wasn\u2019t sure, but he hovered by my door a lot\u2014hardly ever knocked or came in...just hovered. Unless I needed something. Care and help, but no companionship. It just wasn\u2019t like him to be so distant. Before the attack, there were never closed doors between us, but now it seemed like even the windows were shut\u2014and I was all alone on the other side.</p> <p>A screech of disapproval rose above the loud chatter of my family and Vicki said, \u201cGreg, you can\u2019t say that. It\u2019s politically incorrect.\u201d</p><p>Dad didn\u2019t respond, but I pictured him laughing into his fist, his face red, his shoulders shaking.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true, Vicki,\u201d Mike said, \u201cIt\u2019s rude, yes, but...\u201d I stopped listening. I didn\u2019t want to hear what they were saying. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of their conversation\u2014nor did I want to sit here wishing I was.</p><p>I clutched my secret locket and waited for the arrival of another tear-provoked sleep.</p><p>When the faucet stopped running and the lights and doors were positioned in their nightly rest stop, I snuggled down in my bed, closed my eyes, and imagined David beside me.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d the apparition asked, smiling at me; I could almost feel the solidity of his fingers as he trailed them along my hairline.</p><p>\u201cBetter now you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He went to smile, then looked up to my opening door; I quickly tucked the locket away and closed my eyes.</p> <p>Mike stood in the doorway, waiting to see if I\u2019d wake, as usual, then wandered over to lock the window I\u2019d already double-checked\u2014twice, drawing my curtains closed again after. I wanted to look up and see what he was doing then, since his gaze seemed to have a physical effect on me, as if my body knew he was staring, but if I let him know I was awake, he\u2019d stay with me for the night and I\u2019d never get back to my dreams of David.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mike\u2014I didn\u2019t realise you were in here,\u201d my dad whispered into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I like to check on her before I go to bed,\u201d Mike said in a deep, husky whisper.</p><p>\u201cIs she sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His solemn, almost broken tone obviously set my dad\u2019s mind wandering as it did mine.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, son?\u201d Dad said, and the light filtering in from the hall disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about her, Greg.\u201d</p><p>I opened one eye to see my dad lean against my dresser. \u201cMe too,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s okay, you know. She plays it tough\u2014\u201d Dad looked right at me; I closed my eye again. \u201cBut I never even see her cry. Not once. Surely something like this has got to leave a girl feeling something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cries,\u201d Mike stated, his tone empty. \u201cI know you don\u2019t see it, but that\u2019s because she wants everyone to think she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen her cry?\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes a little; Mike shook his head. \u201cBut I hear her. At night, when she thinks everyone\u2019s asleep.\u201d Mike looked at Dad. \u201cA few times I\u2019ve come to her door, trying to decide if I should come in, but she smiles and plays it cool when I catch her.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cShe won\u2019t talk to me, Greg, but she needs to talk to someone before she buries this grief too deep and we lose her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019ll talk to Emily?\u201d Dad suggested.</p><p>No, I won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Mike said, then sighed heavily, rubbing his face with both hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess we just need to give her more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think we\u2019re past that point, Mike. Vicki\u2019s worried.\u201d Dad combed the front of his hair with arched fingers. \u201cShe thinks we might need to get her some professional help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Mike warned. \u201cShe\u2019ll shut down if you do that. I\u2019ll try talking to her tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I rolled onto my back and groaned, deliberately, to get them and their gossip out of my room.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dad clapped Mike on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBut, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Mike said, looking at me again. \u201cShe is still capable of feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Dad said. \u201cOtherwise...\u201d</p><p>I tensed, Dad\u2019s pause lasting a little too long. Otherwise what?</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mike said. \u201cBut she\u2019s alive, Greg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to wonder if that\u2019s all that counts.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not, Dad, I thought. I wished I had died. There was a point in the darkness when I wanted to come back, but not to this. Not to the nightmares I had for the way Jason touched me, the emptiness I felt for the way David left me, and the grief that hit me when I\u2019d stand naked in the shower\u2014feeling the exposure of my skin to the air\u2014knowing I was safe, but feeling so scared and so bare. No one warned me that being awake again would be worse. No one told me I\u2019d have bad dreams\u2014falling, over and over again, from that tree, waking up just before I hit the ground.</p><p>Life wasn\u2019t all that mattered, and I learned that, unfortunately, a little too late.</p><p>The light from their world intruded on my David fantasy time for a while longer. Dad had left the door open when he walked away, but I could feel Mike lingering at my bedside; he leaned down and stroked my hair, his worries expelling with his breath, and ran his thumb down my neck\u2014the one place he wasn\u2019t supposed to touch me anymore.</p><p>I curled my fingers into a tight fist, on the cusp of losing my battle for alone time by shoving his hand away, when everything around us seemed to stop.</p><p>\u201cWhere did this come from?\u201d he whispered to himself, lifting the silver chain from under my shirt. \u201cOh, Ara\u2014\u201d he sighed my name out, his warm, heavy breath brushing across my nose and lips. But, he placed the locket gently back down on my chest, instead of ripping it away, like he probably should have, and kissed my head, closing the bedroom door behind him.</p><p>The sunlight outside reflected off the icy roads and shone through the window with its early morning glow. It felt like years since I\u2019d seen the sun, since I\u2019d looked up at the blue sky and found the summer.</p><p>I wondered now if I\u2019d ever love the summer again.</p><p>\u201cHi, gorgeous.\u201d Mike glided into my room with breakfast. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He lowered the plate of toast, his smile dropping with it. \u201cI\u2019ll take it back down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mike. But...\u201d I sat up a little. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Vicki. She\u2019s worried I\u2019m not getting enough nutrients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He paused, chewing the inside of his lip as he studied my half-dried tears. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more, baby.\u201d He squatted beside me, placing the plate on the ground. \u201cYou gotta talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do talk to you.\u201d I folded my arms.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don't. You haven\u2019t even been able to look at me. You flinch when\u2014\u201d he dropped his hand away from my face as I recoiled, \u201c\u2014when I touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you expect, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. I do. But I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re pushing me away. I\u2019d never hurt you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d I said with a hint of detest.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d He dropped back on his heels a little. \u201cWhat is it then?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him through a film of tears, and as the words of truth rose to the surface, at the same time the tears spilled onto my cheeks, I spat them out, \u201cI\u2019m just so ashamed. I never wanted you to find me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat way? Ara, how do you think I found you?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014he,\u201d I stammered. \u201cHe said he was going to make sure that when you found me, you wouldn\u2019t sleep for fifty years.\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s eyes widened; his hands shot out so fast that I squealed and ducked my head, but he sat on my bed and held me to his chest anyway, stroking my hair. \u201cYou never told me that. Why didn\u2019t you tell me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, did you tell the cops that?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone\u2014anything. I only told them the basics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, you remember more than you say?\u201d His tone was soft, not angry like I expected.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. Why? Why would you do that? How can they catch this guy if they don\u2019t know the full story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never catch him.\u201d That much I was sure of.</p><p>Mike ignored that comment and took a deep breath. \u201cDo you want to know what I saw when I found you\u2014can you cope with this yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know, Mike. It\u2019s been eating me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ara. You should\u2019ve talked to me about this before now. I could\u2019ve helped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just silly, baby.\u201d Mike laid me back down on the pillow and his hand fell gently into the curve of my neck as he studied me, swiping his thumb over my cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I grabbed his wrist and pushed it down. \u201cPlease don't touch my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, sorry, I forgot.\u201d But his eyes stayed there for a moment, not on the jagged, silvery bite shape, but on the place the attacker\u2019s grip left a mental scar. \u201cYou were covered when I found you.\u201d</p><p>I looked up quickly into his soulful, caramel gaze. \u201cI was?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, half smiling. \u201cYour hair was laying over your...over your chest, like it\u2019d been positioned that way. No one saw anything, and I had you covered with my jacket before anyone else came.\u201d</p><p>Tears of relief overflowed and swerved down my cheeks. Mike started to wipe them away, but gave up in vain when they kept flowing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so silly, Ara. All this time, you thought I found you\u2014exposed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did.\u201d I wiped my nose. \u201cI thought\u2014I mean, I didn't know what he did to me after I\u2014when it all went black. I didn't know if maybe he\u2019d done...worse, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. I really wish you\u2019d said something.\u201d</p><p>I felt pretty silly then. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p> <p>Mike laughed softly, but the smile in his eyes faded away to something darker.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Mike? What is it?\u201d</p><p>He pinched his lips, rocking his jaw. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I went through\u2014looking for you. And when I found you\u2014\u201d He let a breath out through his nose, battling with words inside his mouth. \u201cI expected, given what I was sure he\u2019d done to you, I was surprised when I found you still wearing your underwear.\u201d</p><p>I cringed.</p><p>\u201cBut your legs\u2014\u201d He looked haunted, lost in disgust. \u201cYou were just so...so covered in blood. I thought the deranged prick had actually dressed you again after he...\u201d Mike couldn't say it.</p> <p>I touched his arm, wishing I could have been there to comfort him through that.</p><p>\u201cI cried when they told me,\u201d he said, cupping his hand over mine. \u201cWhen the doctors said you were untouched, I just cried. Baby, it was so dark in that field. Without a torch, I might not\u2019ve seen you at all. And when I found you, I noticed only one small flicker of pale skin, and I ran, faster than I\u2019ve ever run before.\u201d</p><p>In my mind, I could see it all as it happened.</p><p>\u201cAll we\u2019d come across so far was\u2014\u201d he paused and lowered his voice, \u201c\u2014was your bra. And I can\u2019t tell you what went through my mind when I found it.\u201d</p><p>I felt my cheeks flush.</p><p>\u201cOh God, baby, the things I imagined he was doing to you while I wasn\u2019t there to protect you. I felt so helpless. I couldn\u2019t walk properly; every step I took was like my legs were carrying the weight of a train. But I kept going, just to find you\u2014to hold you and make you safe again.</p> <p>\u201cIf you could only feel what I felt when I saw you there. I wasn\u2019t ashamed or disgusted, like you seem to think, princess. I was overjoyed. And I promise you, no one saw your body\u2014except for Emily; she was right beside me the whole time.\u201d When he looked back unexpectedly, I nearly jumped out of my skin; Mike\u2019s eyes became soft and round. \u201cI covered you with my jacket,\u201d he continued, \u201cand checked every square inch of your body to make sure I wouldn't break you more if I moved you, and I know you didn\u2019t want me to see you like that, but I never looked at anything in that way. I was just so happy to find you still breathing. All I saw was the girl I\u2019m in love with\u2014and the only memory I\u2019ve taken with me from that night is the way you looked up suddenly, so scared, and then smiled when you saw me.\u201d He squeezed my hand. \u201cYou closed your eyes then, and I thought that was last time I\u2019d ever see the blue again.\u201d</p><p>An audible sob left my lips.</p><p>Mike gathered me into his chest, tighter than ever before, and I felt nauseated for feeling gratitude toward Jason for not doing as he\u2019d threatened. But the sick feeling welled up into a circle of anger within me. My fists clenched behind Mike\u2019s back. I closed my eyes tight. One day, I didn\u2019t know when, or how, but one day, I would make Jason pay for what he did to me.</p><p>Mike leaned out from our embrace and looked at my lips, then my eyes, stroking my hair off my brow. \u201cIs this why you won\u2019t see Emily\u2014because she was there with me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, looking down.</p><p>Mike took a really long breath, letting it out slowly. \u201cYou know, she\u2019s been hysterical over this. She needs to see you\u2014she blames herself, Ara, for not chasing after you when she saw you walk away with that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She cries every time I see her, and there\u2019s nothing I can do to console her. Will you please just see her? She loves you, just the same as we all do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014she saw, Mike. I can\u2019t help how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. Please don\u2019t be like that. Emily\u2019s your friend, and she\u2019s a girl. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s seen it all before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019m just trying to get you to understand how little any of that means when, in the greater scheme of things, we thought we\u2019d find you dead\u2014or much, much worse.\u201d</p><p>I wedged the tongue of stubbornness into my cheek and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cAra. Emily\u2019s not to blame. You can\u2019t hide from this, and you won\u2019t make yourself feel better by punishing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake! Fine. I\u2019ll see her.\u201d</p><p>Mike let out a quick huff of relief. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If you shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShutting up.\u201d He kissed my lips, scrunching my cheeks between his hands. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go call her. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and fell back against my pillows as he backed away and closed the door. It only felt like ten minutes passed before Sam popped his head around the corner and said, \u201cEmily\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>I put my book down and pressed my hands into the mattress until I was sitting up properly. \u201cSend her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure, sis?\u201d Sam asked, slightly closing himself in the room with me. \u201cBecause, I know Mike kinda pushed you into this.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Sam. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then signalled into the corridor.</p><p>Emily, with her hands clasped in front of her, walked very slowly into my room and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d As soon as the words left her lips, she spun around to close my door, then just stood there with her head against it.</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d She nodded, exhaling.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. I have rules. Things I\u2019m not allowed to say, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>I waited, allowing her to pull herself together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I just don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m so...so sorry.\u201d She turned to face me then, and tears rained over her crossed arms, falling past her elbows to the carpet. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm. Don\u2019t. Okay?\u201d I held a hand up. \u201cJust don\u2019t. Say. Anything about it.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, she sighed. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Em.\u201d I opened my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just talk about the weather then.\u201d She smiled a weak smile, then sat beside me on the bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I need.\u201d</p><p>And we did talk about the weather\u2014the past, the present, the future. The coming spring, the wild winter, and I know a few times Emily wondered if I was talking in code, referring to David as the rain, the sadness, or talking about the attack when I spoke of the storms. And who knows, maybe I was, maybe I wasn\u2019t. But it was nice to just talk for no other reason than to exchange words in the company of someone you\u2019d come to love.</p><p>By the time Dad told Emily to \u2018let me rest\u2019, I had formed a real smile at least twice and had managed to forget about the attack for a while.</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d I said as she went to close my door behind her.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you come back tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips into a tight line, nodding rapidly, then closed the door before I heard her burst into tears on the other side.</p><p>Rising from my first dreamless slumber since I woke from my nightmare, I drew a deep breath and watched the sun rise higher in the sky until it shone through my crystals, making a pale rainbow dance on the wall above my dresser.</p><p>I looked away; colour didn\u2019t belong in my life anymore. I wondered if it ever would again.</p><p>I did find one moment of joy in all the gloom, though, as I extended my limbs into a stretch and, for the first time, they didn\u2019t hurt quite so much. I felt the cold as if it were only cold, not sharp pins, and could actually find appreciation in the beautiful winter that set in deep while I was in a coma. It had been a shock to my nerves when I felt the sting of the frost on that first day they brought me home. But I actually liked it now\u2014more than I once liked the autumn.</p><p>\u201cHey? Good morning. I didn\u2019t know you were awake,\u201d Mike chimed, leaning on my doorframe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been awake for the last three weeks, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d He gave a simple smile. He looked rested today; his hair was still wet from a shower and the smell of his fresh, powder-scented cologne filled my room.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I was joking around with you.\u201d I sat up in my bed.</p><p>\u201cJoking?\u201d He nodded, pursing his lips in consideration. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is general conversation.\u201d I waited, expecting him to chuckle. \u201cYou know, \u2018cause dead people don't talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Ha!\u201d He laughed once. \u201cSorry, I'm not used to the lame joke game anymore.\u201d</p><p>I shrunk a little. I wasn\u2019t playing the lame joke game. I was actually attempting to be funny.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, kid?\u201d Mike dropped his folded arms and moved to sit beside me.</p><p>\u201cNah, I've just been doing some thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>I didn't mean to, but I stiffened all over. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra\u2014\u201d He paused, seemingly assessing his words. \u201cI love you. And...I\u2019m your best friend. I always will be. But I\u2019m not stupid and I\u2019m not blind. I know...things...and I know that he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not what you think he is, Mike.\u201d I cleared my throat, sorting out a response in my head. \u201cYou might think you\u2019ve pieced it all together, but you're wrong.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI know you\u2019re upset that he left you, but I don't think I'm wrong about him; I really do think he loves you and he's just trying to do the right thing by you.\u201d</p><p>Cold shock washed through me. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat did you think I thought?\u201d</p><p>That he was a vampire. \u201cOh, um\u2014I thought you might\u2019ve thought he was a jerk, you know, for leaving again.\u201d</p><p>Mike shook his head. \u201cNo, baby. Not at all. I mean, I...in the hospital, I saw the way he loved you. It was...undeniable. And I don't know what happened between you two, maybe you\u2019ll never tell me, but you need to know that, although that part of your life is over now, I\u2019m still here. And you still have a chance to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m capable of that anymore, Mike.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhat if I could promise you you are? What if I could guarantee that you will one day find a reason to smile? Would you believe me\u2014at least start wanting to be happy again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I frowned to myself. \u201cI do want to be happy.\u201d</p><p>He went to shake his head, but stopped and exhaled. \u201cOnly you know the truth of that, Ar.\u201d</p><p>He was right. I didn't want to be happy, because being happy meant moving on from David, and moving on meant that I didn't love him.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not giving up on you,\u201d Mike said. \u201cNot ever. I don\u2019t care what you say to me or do to make me mad or hurt, I love you, and I\u2019m not giving up on you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes watered. \u201cWhat if I asked you to go?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even answer. We both already knew the answer. But I wondered if he\u2019d stay if he knew the real reason I was attacked\u2014that I had let a vampire into my life, then followed one to my own detriment. And I wondered how he would feel to know that the core of my sadness was not because I was attacked, but because of David, because he was gone and because time, death, and tears hadn\u2019t changed what I meant to him and wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t make him stay.</p><p>But Mike had stayed, even though everything he worked for back in Australia had fallen apart, and he would always stay, no matter what; if I was human, if I was weak and frail, even if I asked him to go. And that was more than I could say for David.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Mike.\u201d My head rocked from side to side. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m marrying you.\u201d</p><p>His frown softened and a broad smile spread across his face, like the light touching the earth at sunrise. \u201cThen...you still wanna get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, dummy.\u201d I slapped his arm. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought, with the whole near-death experience and all, you know, people change from those things, Ara. I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d want the same things anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you stayed? Even though you weren\u2019t sure?\u201d Admiration crinkled across my nose.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cAra. I\u2019m in this for life. Whether you marry me or not, I will always be here to love you, protect you, and be your friend. That will never change. Never.\u201d</p><p>And it really only sunk in right then, that I had missed this; all along, I\u2019d been looking across the road to the boy I thought I loved, when I should\u2019ve been looking right beside me. This was my saviour\u2014this was my knight in shining armour. He always had and always would come to my rescue. \u201cGood,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you to go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and his warm, velvet smile melted onto my lips as his breath brushed hot against my skin. It was the first kiss. My first kiss in my new life. I\u2019d been given the chance to start over\u2014cleansed of all the mistakes of the past.</p><p>The hourglass had rocked and the balance tipped in reverse, but everything was back in place and, today, I began a new journey with the man I was supposed to be with. True love would be ours now and happiness would be in every breath I took beside this man. We would go on\u2014live, as living was intended, and I would love him for forever\u2014for our forever\u2014because they\u2019d always been the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-Eight</p><p>True love, by definition, means \u201csomeone that is truly loved.\u201d</p><p>But true love must be reciprocated, or it is only excruciatingly unbearable and devastating\u2014a never-ending lonely night in an empty room.</p> <p>By the dictionary of Ara, true love means you could not live without that person. That the love you feel for them is as honest and deep as the love they feel for you\u2014a soul mate\u2014a perfect match. David was my soul mate, but Mike was my perfect match, and in only a few hours, we\u2019d be sharing this truth with the rest of the world.</p><p>The presence of my hand over my belly was supposed to settle the feeling of nerves, like black bats had assembled in my gut and bludgeoned the ogre to death, but it didn\u2019t. And it didn\u2019t hide the fact that, in truth, I wasn\u2019t ready for this. But Dad wouldn\u2019t let me go back to Perth with Mike unless we were married first. So, I stood in front of the full-length, oval mirror, with golden light spreading its warm beams of morning over my bedroom floor, and let time pass around me\u2014unable to control it or make good use of it; just existing as a part of its greater plan.</p><p>I reached across and tilted the mirror\u2019s frame, changing the image to the plain white of the roof. I couldn\u2019t look at the reflection staring back at me today; she was error, beautified by justification, painted in the form of a bright-eyed young girl. A young girl who was doing what was expected of her, not what her heart wanted.</p><p>I loved Mike, I really did, but the quiet prelude to the tempest had me wondering if I was doing the right thing; if marrying one man, when I was still in love with another, would perhaps destroy not just my life, but Mike\u2019s as well.</p><p>The passed winter was long and the blue memory of Christmas Day settled over my thoughts, blotting out the yellow of spring in my room. Mike\u2019s parents had demanded he return home for Christmas, and I spent the whole day on the armchair downstairs, talking to him on the phone. The bill was huge, but Mike just laughed and said it was small change\u2014a minor drawback in the greater scheme of things\u2014and covered the costs himself. When he finally came back, I had never been so glad to see him in all my life. I\u2019d had so many nightmares while he was gone\u2014one\u2019s that ended in him calling to say he\u2019d changed his mind about me, or some where his plane crashed while I waited for him at the airport, and some where I slipped into the darkness again, and he wasn\u2019t there to save me. I needed him, almost as much as he needed me. So, maybe I wasn't really ready for this, but I couldn\u2019t live without him, either.</p> <p>I shook my head a few times, releasing the shiver of memories, and looked behind me to the near-empty room. My bed was gone, the spongy white carpet dominating the space, while the new daybed in the corner had become a shelf for all things bridal, except the bouquets, which were lined up on the hallstand beside the window. It might not have been my room anymore, but it still felt like my room, except, like me, it was changed beyond recognition. My face, my hands, everything was polished and shined, shaped and fashioned to look like the bride standing by the mirror in her wedding dress.</p><p>The swirling vortex of time had swept everything up, and I was next\u2014destined to leave everyone behind. But that was always my destiny, wasn\u2019t it? And one day soon, I was sure it would carry me away from Mike.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>Under my thumb, the white flowers stitched into the veil sitting over the chair back felt silky. This veil was one of the reasons Mike gave no protest over going home at Christmas time. He\u2019d salvaged a few things when he and his mum cleared out my old house after I left\u2014my mum\u2019s veil being one of them. I don't think I ever cried so hard as when he handed me a box, wearing that cheeky grin, and I opened it to see white tulle. He and Dad found it utterly amusing, but I was sure half Dad\u2019s tears of hilarity were owed to emotions he wouldn\u2019t admit.</p><p>Outside my window, the familiar chatter of my little bluebird friend formed the soundtrack to my faraway thoughts. I snapped from my reverie, tilted the mirror back down and watched the bird dancing in the reflection, bouncing happily as if life just went on. So simple. That\u2019s it; eat, sing, dance and play.</p><p>I wished I were a bluebird. I\u2019d fly away\u2014over the rainbow.</p> <p>But life was not a novel and people didn\u2019t really get happy endings. I finally understood all the negative philosophical one-liners this town loved so much. They were phrases invented by smart people who knew life wasn\u2019t made of dreams, even though it sometimes felt like one.</p><p>David said it best, though: \u201cEven dreams eventually die.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re not the leading ladies of our own illusory films. This is life and we are real. The time had come for me to grow up and, if I couldn't live the life I wanted, I had to at least live the lie. Either way, they were making me move on.</p><p>I ran my fingers over the yellow and silver embroidered cherry blossoms, flowing like a swarm of butterflies over the fitted bodice of my white dress. I wasn\u2019t totally sold on the full hoop skirt and long train, but it had been a stipulation of Vicki\u2019s that she get to help choose the dress\u2014without any arguments. The only thing we really argued on, the only thing I really enforced was that my bouquet be white, with only accents of yellow. No red. It caused massive debates, until Mike stepped in and told Vicki it was my choice.</p><p>Vicki meant well, but she could never understand what the red rose once meant to me, how it represented the part of me that would always belong to David. That was a different time; I wish it were a different life.</p><p>I took a wispy breath and felt my heart flutter as I pushed his face away from my mind. I couldn\u2019t have any thoughts of him today or I\u2019d fall to pieces. There is, and never was, a David Knight. He died in nineteen-thirteen when his uncle bit him and turned him into a vampire. He never loved me, never promised me eternity\u2014never existed. I was moving on, as he did\u2014leaving all hope of love and destiny to the children who read fairytales.</p><p>They say that spring represents new beginnings; the end of the darkness; the cloaking of faux pas\u2014the chance to wake up and start all over again. David would never be far from my thoughts, but I would live for the rest of my life without him in my embrace.</p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror again, at the bride, the woman that now stood before me: this was moving on.</p> <p>\u201cAra? Are you okay?\u201d Emily smiled at me from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cEmily! You look beautiful,\u201d I all but squealed and hugged her as she walked over to me. She held me tight. Then, standing her at arms length, I smiled, admiring her dress. \u201cYellow is definitely your colour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for choosing such a tasteful bridesmaid dress.\u201d She smiled, running her fingers over the chiffon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we went for the shorter dress\u2014it\u2019s says spring to me.\u201d I tapped my chin.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like spring. It\u2019s so cold today.\u201d She smiled and tilted her head to one side, pausing there for a second. \u201cIs it David? Is that what you were thinking about just now?\u201d</p><p>A rush of hot blood shot through my stomach; I clutched my silver locket. On my own, with the four walls of my room surrounding me\u2014closing me in\u2014convincing myself I could move on was easy. But in the presence of those who proved life was still real and still hurt, pretending I no longer belonged to him made me want to fold over and cry. \u201cYou know me too well.\u201d I sighed, forcing myself to release the locket. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll come see you real soon. You\u2019ll see. And as for David? Well\u2014\u201d she touched my shoulder, \u201c\u2014Mike\u2019s better for you than him, Ara.\u201d</p><p>My eyes nearly leaped out of my head. \u201cWhat! Did you just say what I think you just said?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s a bit if a turnaround, but\u2014\u201d she shrugged. \u201cI'm sorry, Mike\u2019s proven himself in my books, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s pretty likeable.\u201d My fingers found the locket again and held it tight. \u201cAnd I am happy, you know. I do love Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI just miss David, is all, and\u2014\u201d I faced the mirror again, dropping the chain from my fingers and letting it fall, cool against my skin. \u201cI just needed a moment to reflect on that, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d We both looked up to the whimpering gasp as Vicki walked in and burst into tears\u2014again. \u201cMy beautiful Ara-Rose. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen that way for a few months now, Mom,\u201d I said and hugged her, being careful of my cascading curls.</p><p>\u201cI know. It just feels like we only got you a few weeks ago, and now look at you\u2014all grown up and leaving us.\u201d She wiped away her tears. \u201cOh. Look at me, I\u2019ve gone and smudged my makeup again.\u201d</p><p>Emily and I exchanged a humoured smile as Vicki headed into my bathroom. The wardrobe she passed through was empty now. The rows and rows of clothes she bought me, the yellow dress, my box of pictures and everything else that made this room my own was on its way home now. On a freight plane back to Perth, which, after tonight, when I officially became Mrs Michael Christopher White, I would be too\u2014except...not on a freight plane.</p><p>Emily let out a soft breath, half smiling. \u201cCome on. It\u2019s nearly time. Let\u2019s put this veil on.\u201d</p><p>I lifted the blanket-heavy skirt and sat down on the stool near the mirror. It felt good to sit. I\u2019d been standing for too long.</p><p>\u201cNo looking until I get this in, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm\u2014my back\u2019s to the mirror. How can I see, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a way, if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me too well.\u201d I smirked. \u201cSo, where\u2019s Alana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinishing her hair. And still trying to practice walking in those heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t trip over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will notice,\u201d she muttered with a few bobby pins between her lips, \u201cthey won\u2019t be able to see past you.\u201d</p><p>With the veil in my hair, Emily took a step back and adoration flooded her eyes like a little girl getting her first kitten.</p><p>\u201cDoes it look nice?\u201d I asked, touching my fingertips to the meshy fabric.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Alana squealed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d Emily warned. \u201cI\u2019m not re-doing your makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m not. Oh, Ara,\u201d Alana said, waving her hands near her moistening eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You look nice too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She curtsied. \u201cRyan said his heart stopped beating when he saw me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw.\u201d Emily and I said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Alana walked over. \u201cHe\u2019s really sweet. So, you\u2019re all ready then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have something old?\u201d She touched my veil.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, and something new.\u201d I nodded down at my dress.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s something borrowed.\u201d Emily clasped her silver bracelet over my wrist\u2014over the scar David left.</p><p>\u201cWell, that just leaves something blue.\u201d I searched the room, half expecting to see the bookshelf behind my bedroom door where I used to keep a bluebird pin my mother gave me when I was little.</p><p>\u201cUm, Ara?\u201d Vicki stood nervously behind Emily. \u201cI\u2014I have something blue.\u201d</p><p>When Em stepped aside, Vicki reached across the pale beam of sunlight and placed something cold and kind of heavy in my hand, cupping hers there for a second. \u201cMy mother gave this to me on my wedding day\u2014when I married your father.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated to look down at it, keeping my gaze on her teary eyes for longer than needed. But when I finally unfolded my fingers, I gasped, seeing the blue perfection there. \u201cVicki! This is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brooch,\u201d she said, turning the delicate glass blossom in my open palm.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I stole my gaze away from it to look at her, \u201c\u2014this should be passed down to Sam, shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Vicki shook her head and closed my fingers around the flower. \u201cIt\u2018s been passed down in my family from daughter to daughter; it belongs to you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicki, I\u2014how can I ever thank you for all you\u2019ve done for me?\u201d I jumped off the stool and hugged her tight, gripping the sapphire blossom in my hand. \u201cI love you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, Ara.\u201d She smiled and bit her quivering lips together. \u201cNow, enough clich\u00e9 fussing. Where shall we pin this?\u201d</p><p>We placed the brooch, after much deliberation, to the largest cherry blossom on the bodice, right where the skirt met my hips, and as everyone stepped back to take a look at me, I drew a deep breath and squared my shoulders. \u201cSo, that\u2019s everything?\u201d</p><p>The chatter of four girls suddenly burst into the roar of twenty screaming fans at a boy-band concert. I calmed myself to a picture of composure while they gathered their bouquets, then hurried into the corridor.</p><p>\u201cYou coming, Ara?\u201d Alana turned back to look at me.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d A sigh forced my shoulders to relax. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a sec.\u201d</p><p>She smiled knowingly, then walked away.</p><p>The silence seemed to be filled with all the thoughts I\u2019d been afraid of, all the truths I couldn\u2019t own today. So, before it could destroy resolution, I wandered out quickly, looking back for only a moment before shutting the door on the warm yellow light of the past.</p><p>Dad came out of his room at the same time; I waited in anticipation for him to turn around. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>His face moved from the thoughts of the day ahead to a round-mouthed, wide-eyed smile. \u201cOh, honey,\u201d he said, raising my hand above my head to spin me around. \u201cLook at you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too overdone, do you think?\u201d I looked down at the marshmallow skirt.</p><p>\u201cNo, you look perfect.\u201d He kissed my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re so grown up, so before your time.\u201d He stopped then with a slight sigh. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Ara-Rose\u2014and your mother\u2014\u201d Dad touched my inherited veil, \u201c\u2014I know she\u2019d be proud of you too.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, looking down at Dad\u2019s hand holding mine.</p> <p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re supposed to take your engagement ring off when you get married. It goes on in front of your wedding ring after the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, here, hold on to it for me.\u201d</p><p>He placed my ruby ring in his top pocket with a little pat. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Ready? I wasn\u2019t sure if that was the right word. I inhaled a deep, shaky-yet-excited breath, and let it out in a gust. \u201cNo! Wait. I forgot my bouquet.\u201d I spun on my heel, hitched my dress up at the front, feeling it swish around the tops of my feet as I bolted back to my room. The warmth of my yellow walls greeted me with the sun\u2019s smile as I burst through the door and grabbed the lone bouquet sitting on the table.</p><p>But, as I turned to walk away, a wave of nostalgia hit me. I took two slow steps back to where my bed used to be, and let my arms fall to my sides.</p> <p>It was so empty in here now. The crystals that once cast rainbows from the sun were all gone, so too were the photos on the walls, and the innocence of childhood. They were all just a memory now, and it felt strange to be saying goodbye to a place that\u2019d been such a big part of my life, for such a short time. Despite the pain I suffered here, what I was leaving behind today were mostly fond memories.</p><p>Then, as I turned to walk away again, a splash of a forbidden colour caught my eye\u2014resting in the hinge of the old mirror.</p><p>One single red rose.</p><p>Breathless, bonded to the spot, I could no longer feel my arms or lips\u2014my thumping heart was all that existed. No one would have put that there. I was very clear. There were to be no red roses around today.</p><p>I walked over and plucked the rose from the mirror, dropping it as soon as my fingers touched the thornless stem.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p> <p>A silent moment passed, but only the stammering of my wanting heart echoed back. Please be here. Please.</p><p>The red rose sat by my feet. I stared at it for a moment. One red rose. The single element of colour inside a completely white bouquet; the scarlet representation of my love for David\u2014of the part of me that would always be his. I left it out. I wanted to move on\u2014to forget about him. But we both knew I was fooling myself to think I could ever move on. There was no moving on, and he wouldn\u2019t let me.</p><p>No. I shook my head and took a step away from the rose. I would not let his memory reside here, in this life, with me. The past was his dwelling now\u2014long forgotten and hidden in a dark corner of my heart, like a favourite old book at the back of a shelf.</p><p>The reflection of the bride holding a colourless bouquet was one of picturesque beauty, but not what I saw in my dream, in what seemed a lifetime ago. This was a different image. I was no longer the empty shell of a girl I used to be. I had moved on, without David, away from David, and slowly, I was growing out of the mask I used to hide behind. Happiness was becoming a real part of my life, and it was because of Mike that I could finally be just a girl. Just Ara.</p><p>Leaving the rose on the floor where it fell, I smiled. Mike was all I needed now. I loved David with all of my heart once, and when Mike came back into my life, my heart simply grew bigger.</p><p>With one hand, I unclasped the silver chain David returned to me. \u201cI will always be yours, David,\u201d I said into the mirror. \u201cAnd you will always have a special place in my heart, but\u2014\u201d I placed the locket on the floor over the rose and stood back. \u201cBut this is me saying goodbye. Saying...this is the way things should be. Don\u2019t let your life be about me now. It\u2019s time to move on and let things fall where they may.\u201d My heart and my voice steadied then with the last of my goodbye. \u201cI love you, David Knight. I\u2019ll love you for forever\u2014but it just has to be forever apart.\u201d</p><p>Slowly and reluctantly, I walked to the door and placed my fingers over the handle. When I turned back to look around my room for the last time\u2014the rose and the locket were gone.</p><p>With faltering resolution and a tender heart, I blinked back the pain, and closed the door behind me.</p> <p>Dad winked at me when I took his arm, and we walked down the stairs to the warm spring morning\u2014the last morning I would ever look across the road at the oval of the school where I once met a boy. He wasn't there anymore\u2014no longer waiting by the grass for me to take his hand. He was gone, and I was moving on.</p><p>The photographer placed us in position to document the momentous occasion before we could climb into the bridal car and drive away, leaving behind all the innocence of youth and the sadness of eternal nights. Bright, sunny days were my path now.</p><p>I looked up at the blue sky, just as I did that first day I came to live here, only, back then, in my heart, I wanted nothing more than to go back home, while today, the idea had me stealing glances at my dad, Sam, and even Vicki, wondering how I was going to cope with missing them.</p><p>I guess life has a funny way of granting the things we want, when we no longer really want them. I came here alone, and I was leaving with a heart full of family and friends who loved me. I knew that when the night descended and I said my final farewells, I\u2019d cry, because at some point in all my growing up, I learned that home was built with the hearts of people you love; it was a place you knew you could always return, where waiting arms would greet you and make you safe.</p><p>And I guess, in that sense, I never really needed to find my way home, because I\u2019d truly been there all along. </p> </body></html>"]
