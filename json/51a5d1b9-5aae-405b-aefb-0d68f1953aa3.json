It was a first for me, too. There were four of us at lunch, but only one of us was new to half the table. Dr. Ellen Radborne was about my height, 5' 3\" with thick shoulder length brunette hair that I might have thought was black, but my hair was black, so I knew hers was really just dark brown. Her eyes were brown, like mine, though again mine were a little darker. She had a pale summer tan, to my nearly white skin, but then my skin never tanned, it just burned, and then went back to being pale. She was curvy, maybe not as curvy through the chest as me, but no man who liked breasts would complain that she lacked. She was in shape, though not as fit as I, but then I doubt she needed to hit the weights and cardio as hard for her job as I did for mine.</p><p>We\u2019d chatted through ordering food, eating food, and finally ordered coffee and tea, and still they hadn\u2019t brought up anything serious, or anything to do with the reason for this meeting. I hadn't had to endure this much small talk in years. We\u2019d learned a lot about each other, but unless we were looking to date, I didn\u2019t see the point.</p><p>She taught college level biology, and continued to do research field work in the summers. She reminded me of the last two serious girlfriends he\u2019s had. He certainly had a type, as if only the names changed for his short, dark haired women. He\u2019d sleep with a variety, but for serious dating it was always women like us. She liked camping, bird watching, hiking, caving, climbing, and all sorts of outdoor stuff. I had, at one time, enjoyed all of that, but my job as a U. S. Marshal for the preternatural branch didn\u2019t leave me much room for hobbies.</p><p>My gym time was more serious, because my life could depend on how fast I could run, how hard I could hit, and just how tough I could be. Dr. Radborne probably didn\u2019t have to worry about any of that. It meant I could have out arm wrestled her, but she probably had a more reasonable work schedule.</p> <p>We sat across from each other smiling, but her eyes were a little uncertain, and I was trying very hard not to make my eyes look empty. Most women took eyes that were too neutral as unfriendly. Men understood that sometimes you didn\u2019t want to smile, but you weren\u2019t mad either, while women expect other women to be pleasant, and if you\u2019re not they think you don\u2019t like them. There are so many reasons that most of my friends are men.</p><p>The only saving grace to this Saturday lunch fiasco was that we weren\u2019t alone, though in some ways that also made it more awkward. I was still happy to have a hand to hold on my side of the table while she hung on the arm of her fianc\u00e9 across the table from us.</p><p>The us was Micah Callahan, who was the same height as the good doctor and me. He was the only man I\u2019d ever dated who matched my height. Micah was wearing a forest green t-shirt that was actually made of silk, which always seemed wrong for a t-shirt, but since it also made it petably soft and looked fabulous on him I didn\u2019t complain. It made the rim of green around his irises more vibrant, and the circle of yellow on the outside of them more gold, so that his eyes were even more beautiful set in the delicate triangle of his dark skinned face. He still had his summer tan that he got every year from jogging in nothing but shorts, so he was dark and his eyes were jewel-like in the almost feminine beauty of his face. The shirt also fit every curve of his upper body, showing just how much muscle was under there. He had broad shoulders for his size, and a nice chest that went down to a waist so slender we could share some of our jeans, but in too many clothes he just looked delicate, because he fought for every ounce of muscle he got in the gym, or on the track, which was not true for the man sitting beside Dr. Ellen Radborne.</p><p>Richard Zeeman was 6' 1\" and had always muscled easily, and it showed in his broad shoulders, impressive chest, and the swell of his arms against his own cotton t-shirt, which was also forest green. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me to coordinate what the boys were wearing. Dr. Ellen had asked Richard to ask what I was wearing, so that I\u2019d had to think about it ahead of time more than I normally would for a Saturday. I\u2019d told her jeans and a t-shirt with boots, because it was fall. I was wearing skinny black jeans tucked into some really nice boots, and a silk t-shirt that matched Micah\u2019s except for color -- mine was red, which matched my lipstick, and brought out the flame pattern in my boots. The boots were fun, and I figured I\u2019d need some fun for the lunch. I\u2019d been right, but Ellen had worn more ordinary blue jeans tucked into dressy brown cowboy boots, and a button up dress shirt in a blue that complimented the jeans more than her skin tone, or at least, that was my opinion, which I kept to myself. But it was unfortunate that the men were wearing nearly identical t-shirts, and that they both had their summer tans and looked fabulous in them. Micah looked better in his, but it was the eyes. Richard\u2019s eyes were a deep, even, milk chocolate brown, lovely eyes, but they couldn\u2019t compete with Micah\u2019s leopard eyes. They were both wearing jeans, Micah in black, Richard in blue, so again we each coordinated with our other half. Micah was wearing black cordovan leather designer shoes so that with my three inch heels I was actually taller than he was, but he never cared, he was secure in all sorts of ways. Richard was wearing brown hiking boots, which was one of his favorite types of shoes on the weekends.</p><p>Richard\u2019s hair fell in foaming waves of brown with golden highlights, and in strong enough sunlight I knew that there were threads of coppery red in it, so that saying he had brown hair never did it justice. Micah\u2019s hair was curly, not wavy, and he normally wore it back in a pony tail, or a braid of some kind, but since this lunch was supposed to help Dr. Ellen understand that I had other yummy men in my life so I didn\u2019t need to steal Richard from her, Micah had left the hair unbound around his shoulders so that it trailed deep brown chestnut curls to mid-back. My hair was the same length, and I realized, weirdly, that both Richard\u2019s and Dr. Ellen\u2019s hair was just past their shoulders. They say that after awhile couples begin to look alike.</p> <p>She gave Richard\u2019s arm a little extra squeeze where her arm was snaked through his, and then sat up more evenly in her own chair. \u201cWell, this is more awkward than I thought it would be,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about as awkward as I thought it would be,\u201d I said.</p><p>Micah squeezed my hand under the table, a silent bid for me to play nice. I smiled harder, and did my best to push it up into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I did force this on all of us,\u201d she said, and she looked genuinely uncomfortable.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ellen, I just meant that Miss Manners doesn\u2019t cover this, and I don\u2019t know what to say either.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little uncertainly at me, but nodded, and took Richard\u2019s hand across the white table cloth. \u201cDo you understand why I wanted to meet?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged, because I couldn\u2019t think of anything good to say. Richard\u2019s agenda for the lunch meeting had been to reassure his recent fianc\u00e9 that I had other men in my life, so I wouldn\u2019t be trying to steal him back and keep him all to myself. Why did I feel we owed Richard this lunch? He wasn\u2019t an ex-lover, but a current lover, and Ellen knew that, so socially awkward didn\u2019t even begin to cover today\u2019s little event.</p><p>I tried to take a sip of the coffee in front of me, but the smell alone made me put it back down. Weird, but it just smelled bitter. Micah hadn\u2019t touched his either; maybe it wasn\u2019t just me. Richard and Ellen had both ordered different kinds of hot tea, though they weren\u2019t drinking either. I think we\u2019d all ordered simply to have an excuse to stay at the table longer without the waiter bitching.</p><p>Micah said, \u201cYou wanted some reassurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, smiling at him and looking relieved, then her glance went back to me, \u201cthough I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to end up reassured.\u201d</p><p>I knew with that small eye flick that I looked too good, had dressed too well, and she had done that girl thing where you compare yourself to the ex, and she didn\u2019t feel like she was winning. This was so not my problem; I hadn\u2019t asked for the lunch, I\u2019d told her what I was wearing. It wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d shown up in a designer outfit after telling her I was wearing jeans. It wasn\u2019t my fault that I dressed my jeans up more than she did.</p><p>I looked at Richard across the table, and hoped he could read my expression, because I was fighting not to get angry. Micah started rubbing his thumb over the back of my hand where he held it on my thigh. He leaned in and laid a gentle kiss on my cheek. It made me let out the breath I\u2019d been holding and try to ease the tension in my shoulders.</p><p>Richard hugged Ellen to him. \u201cEllen, honey, you can see that Anita and Micah are a couple. What more do you want to be reassured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d I said.</p><p>Micah whispered, \u201cEasy.\u201d</p><p>Ellen gave me a not entirely friendly look and said, \u201cFor you not to sit there looking fabulously beautiful and making me feel like an ugly duckling to your swan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to that,\u201d I said, and looked first at Micah and then at Richard for a clue, a hint, something.</p><p>Richard turned that handsome face to her, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Ellen, you know that.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m pretty, but I\u2019m not . . .\u201d she waved vaguely in my direction, \u201c. . . this.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and looked at Micah for some help. He spoke out loud what I was thinking, \u201cShe won\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat won\u2019t I believe?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said, and moved his hand to my thigh, which was sometimes more calming for both of us than hand holding. He kept his other arm across my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not prettier than you are,\u201d I said.</p><p>She gave me a look of utter scorn. \u201cFrom one woman to another, don\u2019t bullshit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen, she\u2019s not lying,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d she demanded, and moved away from his hand.</p><p>\u201cHow honest do you want me to be?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Micah said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot brutal,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cHonest,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWith the right makeup and a blue that had more jewel tones you\u2019d look every bit as good as I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, thanks, are you going to offer to take me shopping next to give me makeup lessons?\u201d Her voice was thick with scorn.</p><p>\u201cGod no, but the friends who gave me lessons taught me not to be afraid of color and bright red lipstick, because it looked good on me and on them. You dress like I did a couple of years ago, more subdued, but your coloring is close enough to mine that you need more color, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA different shirt and lipstick isn\u2019t going to make me exotic like you.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at her. \u201cI\u2019m not exotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalse modesty is just irritating to the rest of us, Anita. You say you\u2019re not exotic and not beautiful, and if you believe that than I have to be ugly in comparison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnita has trouble seeing herself as beautiful,\u201d Micah said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t owe her that story,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ellen looked at Micah, and then at me. I glared at her. I was about to be done being friendly.</p><p>\u201cHow do we make the point without it?\u201d Micah asked, and that was him all over, he had his eye on the goal, which was to make her feel reassured. He was more goal-oriented even than I was, but for him and for the fact that our little social group was actually working better than it ever had, I\u2019d try. God help me, but I\u2019d try.</p><p>\u201cWhen I first started dating Richard I thought he was too handsome to like me. He was the kind of guy that made me feel awkward in high school, and that I just assumed would never look at me twice.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Richard and smiled, it was a good smile. \u201cHe is amazing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he is, and it made me uncomfortable at first that he paid so much attention to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too handsome,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou can never be too handsome,\u201d she said smiling up at him. He smiled back. We were making progress.</p><p>\u201cRichard was the beginning of me understanding that I was attractive, because if beautiful men kept wanting to date me logic dictated that I had to be attractive enough to make them want to date me.\u201d I sighed, even to me that sounded convoluted like I was torturing the logic rather than making a point.</p><p>\u201cEvery woman knows how attractive she is, it\u2019s ingrained into us as little girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if one of the people raising you tells you that you\u2019re not pretty as a little girl, and not if your father remarries someone that spends your childhood telling people, \u2018No, she\u2019s not mine, from his first marriage. Her mother was Mexican.\u2019\u201d I did my best imitation of my stepmother, Judith.</p><p>\u201cYour stepmother said that?\u201d Ellen asked.</p> <p>\u201cConstantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your father stop her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never said it in front of him. It was actually my stepsister, Andria, who told my father when we were twelve. She and I didn\u2019t get along that much, but apparently she was embarrassed that her mother was so . . . whatever, but it left me feeling too short, too dark, too not tall, blond and Nordic like everyone else in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see your mother part of the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died when I was eight, and when I was younger I looked like she\u2019d cloned herself except for father\u2019s skin tone. Can\u2019t tan worth a damn. Maybe that\u2019s why my stepmother was so hateful, because I was a constant reminder of my father\u2019s first love. Hell, I don\u2019t know. One of the things you learn in therapy is that you can work on your own issues, and on healing the damage that was done to you, but you can\u2019t fathom why the people that hurt you did what they did. That\u2019s on their head, in their heart.\u201d</p><p>Ellen looked at me. \u201cWhat an awful thing to do to a child. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you for sympathy, I told you to try and explain that I have trouble seeing myself. Micah is beautiful and he loves me, Richard did love me and he\u2019s gorgeous, and I have other men in my life who are just as amazing, so, like I said, logic dictates that if beautiful people keep wanting to date me, then I can\u2019t be ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still don\u2019t feel beautiful,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d I said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSo you mean it, that you think we\u2019re both pretty, because you don\u2019t believe you\u2019re beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>She took in some air, let it out slow, and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I got upset and made you feel like you had to share that story.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, because, me too.</p><p>Richard said, \u201cThank you.\u201d He looked way too sympathetic. I didn\u2019t want sympathy from him right now.</p><p>Micah kissed me, gently so he wouldn\u2019t be wearing too much of my red lipstick. It made me smile to see the line of red on his lips.</p><p>\u201cThe go-faster-stripe,\u201d he said, softly.</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>\u201cThe go-faster-stripe,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s what Nathaniel named the line of lipstick when I kiss them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel is your other . . .\u201d she seemed lost for words.</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend works,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t add that it was the phrase I used for vanilla friends who didn\u2019t understand our alternative lifestyle and didn\u2019t really want to.</p><p>\u201cSo, Micah is your . . .?\u201d again she paused for help with the right word.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ellen,\u201d Micah said, \u201cvocabulary for polyamory is hard, even for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that polyamory means loving more people, but beyond that I don\u2019t really understand it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m at a social event where we don\u2019t know most of the people, then I introduce Micah and Nathaniel as my boyfriends, anything else just seems to confuse people. If we\u2019re someplace where they understand what poly is, or at least it\u2019s not straight vanilla, then Micah is my significant other, and Nathaniel is our Third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does third mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt usually means your live-in third partner,\u201d Micah said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you introduce Nathaniel and Anita?\u201d She asked Micah.</p><p>\u201cMy girlfriend and our boyfriend, or Significant other and our Third, depending on the event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how would you introduce Richard?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Micah and I looked at each other. He gave me a long look, letting me know this was my ball to hit. Great. \u201cMicah has no relationship with Richard, really. Richard is never going to take me to a vanilla social event as his girlfriend, so that\u2019s not an issue. At a more poly- or kink-friendly event, if we felt compelled to say anything, I guess, I\u2019d say he\u2019s my Top.\u201d</p><p>Ellen turned to Richard. \u201cHow would you introduce Anita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my bottom, or submissive.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m not your submissive, I\u2019ll agree to the term bottom, but I\u2019m not submissive to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Richard fought not to frown and almost succeeded. \u201cI could argue that you are to other people, but fine.\u201d</p><p>Ellen was watching us closely. \u201cOkay, why did you say one thing and Anita the other? What\u2019s the difference between bottom and submissive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me,\u201d I said, trying not to frown at Richard, \u201cbottom is someone who just submits, or wants to be dominated, in the bedroom, or dungeon, but outside of that they are dominant and in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a complete answer, Anita. Some people who are very dominant in every other part of their life are submissive in the dungeon and bedroom, and are still okay with the term, and say they have a dominant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, because I may like to be physically dominated, but no one dominates me by will, or force of personality. To me a submissive is more than just physically dominated, it\u2019s about giving up your will to someone else and letting them control you more completely,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI think what you let Asher do with you is submissive,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cI disagree and since I\u2019m the one getting tied up, it\u2019s my call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how either of you can let a vampire touch you, but Asher is submissive to Richard, so how can he also be dominant, or top, to Anita? If the two of you can\u2019t even agree then how am I ever going to understand this?\u201d Ellen asked.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to her remark about vampires, so I let it go.</p><p>\u201cIt is confusing,\u201d Micah said, with a smile and an attempt to ease her discomfort. He was ignoring the vampire remark, too. We\u2019d take the maze one twist at a time, I guess.</p><p>I was uncomfortable, too, but if it was \u201cmake this work or give up Richard\u201d as a part of our social group I\u2019d muscle through it. Richard had worked his therapy hard to come to a place where he could admit what made him happy, all of what made him happy, and try to find a way to incorporate all of it into his life. He\u2019d found the woman he wanted to have the white picket fence marriage with, but he wanted to keep the black metal spike gate, too. I wasn\u2019t sure you could have a white picket fence with a Gothic gate, but hey, it wasn\u2019t my life. I was only a small part of Richard\u2019s life, as he was a small part of mine now.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am totally lost that Richard says that Asher is his submissive, but he\u2019s also Anita\u2019s top, and Richard is her top, too. Richard says that Asher is his submissive, but Anita is only a bottom. How can you have more than one of each?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Micah asked.</p><p>Richard and I both said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Micah smiled at Ellen. \u201cFirst, Asher and Anita are both switches, which means they switch between top and bottom, but it\u2019s more complicated than that, I\u2019m afraid. Asher gives up almost all control to Richard in the dungeon/bedroom. He wants to be dominated in every way. Anita just wants Richard to dominate her physically with his superior strength, so she thinks of it as just bottoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Richard says that she lets Asher do a great deal more than just use his strength. Asher . . . well, he . . .\u201d she seemed acutely embarrassed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe ties me up and does nefarious things to me,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ellen nodded. \u201cYes, that.\u201d She actually blushed.</p><p>Since I used to blush at the drop of a hat, I sympathized. \u201cI maintain that it isn\u2019t what a person enjoys in the bedroom, or dungeon, that makes them submissive, but the mindset that goes with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou go as far into sub mindset as Asher does sometimes,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s sub mindset?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I suddenly despaired of ever explaining this enough to her. It was like explaining color to the blind: they accept that there is such a thing as color, but they have no basis for understanding it as a reality. Either you enjoyed being tied up, or you didn\u2019t, and if you didn\u2019t you were just never going to understand it.</p><p>Micah stroked my thigh with his free hand as if he\u2019d felt some of my frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t honestly understand that personally, myself,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve seen Anita do it. Her eyes, face, body language changes. It\u2019s as if some tension leaves her that she holds onto in every other part of her life, except in the bedroom, or the dungeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard told me it\u2019s not a real dungeon.\u201d</p> <p>We actually did have access to a real dungeon at the Circus of the Damned, but I couldn\u2019t make myself use it for fun. I\u2019d seen friends chained in the place for real torture when evil vampires had been in charge of things. I knew that Richard had taken Asher to it for fun and games, but at my request Nathaniel would not go with Asher to play without me. I still had nightmares about a friend dying chained to one of the walls, and Nathaniel in there for anything was just too close to that memory.</p><p>Micah smiled, softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just a term for the bondage side of things that go beyond just rough sex.\u201d We\u2019d all agreed not to cloud the issue with mentioning we did have a real dungeon.</p><p>She winced, I think at the term \u201crough sex.\u201d Again, it wasn\u2019t a good sign. How vanilla was Dr. Ellen Radborne? The thought of Richard married to someone who thought just saying the phrase \u201crough sex\u201d was embarrassing, or bad in some way, made me sad for him. I knew that Richard was capable of enjoying gentler lovemaking, but he was so well-endowed that there was an element of roughness in most of his sex. How could you enjoy sex with him if you didn\u2019t like it a little rough? Or maybe, how would Richard be able to enjoy it if she didn\u2019t like a little rough? It just seemed sad. Why was he doing this to himself?</p><p>Some of what I was thinking must have shown because Richard looked at me. I stared into that handsome face with those high, perfect cheekbones, and male model face, and thought, he should have been able to have almost anyone he wanted, why Ellen?</p><p>\u201cEllen is willing to try and let me keep you, Asher, and Jean-Claude in my life, Anita. That\u2019s a lot.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, yes it is.\u201d I sounded tired even to me as I said it.</p> <p>Micah hugged me, placing his face next to mine. I cuddled into the warmth of the skin on skin contact; sometimes even touching through clothes wasn\u2019t enough. My hands found his and one hand slid up his arm until we were half-hugging.</p><p>\u201cRichard explained that excessive touching in public is a sign of stress, or need for reassurance between lycanthropes. What happened just now to stress you, Anita?\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes where I was cuddled in against the warmth and pulse of Micah\u2019s neck. I looked at her, and it might not have been an entirely friendly look, because her eyes widened just a bit. I switched the look higher to Richard, and said, \u201cWhat do you want me to say, Richard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen, honey,\u201d he said, her hand in his, \u201cthat\u2019s not excessive public display of affection for Anita and Micah.\u201d</p><p>Ellen turned and looked up at him, eyes wide. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me.\u201d</p><p>Richard shook his head and looked down at her at the same time, so that his hair fell forward and hid most of his face from me.</p><p>Ellen stared up at him for a few seconds and then turned back to us with an almost horrified look on her face. I had no idea what we\u2019d done to earn that look.</p><p>Micah sat up a little straighter, doing more of a standard arm across the shoulders half-hug with the other hand just holding mine on the table top. I sat up straighter, too, though part of me wanted to do something even more up close and personal just so Ellen would have a real reason for looking shocked, but I wasn\u2019t a child, and this was Richard\u2019s problem, not mine. As one of our newer vampires, who was originally Polish, would say, \u201cNie Moj Cyrk, Nie Moje Malpy - Not my circus, not my monkeys.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the fact that he was still my lover, and still with Jean-Claude, and Asher, meant that in a way he was still a part of our circus and he, at least was still our monkey, but Ellen wasn\u2019t. Unfortunately, one thing I\u2019d learned about being poly is that just because you\u2019re not having sex with someone doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t screw it all up; everyone\u2019s lover can affect the emotional side of things and Ellen had all the ear marks of being a pain in everyone\u2019s emotional poly ass.</p><p>I decided to go for truth. I didn\u2019t know what else to do; besides our lives were working and that was too important to fuck with by not being honest.</p><p>\u201cWhat did we do just now that bothered you, Ellen?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Micah hugged me a little harder, as if in warning.</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cWe can\u2019t avoid upsetting her if we don\u2019t know what upset her in the first place.\u201d I looked at Ellen, and tried to look helpful, questioning, waiting.</p><p>She glanced at Richard.</p><p>\u201cAnita has a point, if we don\u2019t know what makes you anxious we can\u2019t avoid it.\u201d</p><p>She looked from one to the other of us. \u201cI . . . I . . . it was just so . . . intimate. Holding hands, kissing, hugging, sitting close, and rubbing your faces against each other\u2019s necks and faces. The way your hand keeps disappearing underneath the table and I can see your hand moving, Anita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m petting his thigh, Ellen, that\u2019s all. My hand may be close to his groin, but I would never do that sitting in public and especially not in a situation where I\u2019m trying to help convince you that this is all somehow normal and okay. That would be rude and stupid. I\u2019m trying not to be the first, and I\u2019m not the second if I can avoid it.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry . . . I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She stood up.</p><p>Richard caught her hand. \u201cEllen, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Richard, she\u2019s deliberately trying to make me feel stupid and rude, and just . . . I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God, Ellen, if you don\u2019t tell us what upset you we can\u2019t fix it,\u201d I said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI thought I could do this, Richard, I really did. I thought meeting Anita and seeing her with someone else she loved would make me feel more secure about it all, but it doesn\u2019t. It just doesn\u2019t help at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen, please sit back down and talk to us,\u201d Richard said. He still had her hand in his.</p><p>She pulled on his hand for a moment and then, as she stared down at him, her face softened. Looking at how yummy he was always made it hard for me to be mad at him, too, or had once. Being in love with someone gives them a lot of extra clout. She finally let him ease her back into her chair.</p><p>She looked at us; her eyes were shiny with unshed tears, but her voice was calm when it came. \u201cI thought I could do this, but I don\u2019t think I can. I love you, and you are everything I want, all I want, Richard. I was willing to believe that you needed rougher things in the bedroom than I was comfortable with, so I thought I could accept you needed someone for that and for bondage, but now I see her and you have to stop lying to me, Richard. It\u2019s not needing to be rough, or needing bondage, it\u2019s just her. You want to keep her in your bed, and that\u2019s that.\u201d The first hard tear started down her cheek.</p><p>Micah hugged me tighter, and said, \u201cTrust me, Ellen, it is rough sex that they do together. Rougher than anything I enjoy. I accept that Anita needs some things in the bedroom that I just do not want to do.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him and again there was that soft horror on her face. \u201cYou\u2019ve watched . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, very firmly, \u201cbut I\u2019ve seen the marks on her body afterwards. Anita and Richard are not a couple in the way that you and Richard are, Ellen. He loves you, is in love with you, just like I\u2019m in love with Anita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarks,\u201d Ellen said softly, \u201cwhat kind of marks?\u201d</p><p>Micah looked at Richard. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s my question to answer.\u201d</p><p>Richard hugged her close and said, \u201cBruises sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She looked stricken. \u201cYou beat her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he and I said together.</p><p>\u201cI would never let anyone beat me, Ellen,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said looking from one to the other of us.</p><p>I looked at Richard, because I got bruised from struggling pitting my strength against his. I didn\u2019t fight as hard as I could, and neither did he. We didn\u2019t want to really hurt each other, but we liked seeing how far we could push it sometimes in our little rape fantasies. But there was no way I was saying the phrase, \u201crape fantasy,\u201d to Ellen. That either came from Richard, or no one; besides, honestly, it still embarrassed me a little. It seemed so anti-feminist to enjoy being overpowered in the bedroom, but under the right circumstances, with the right people I loved it. I was tired of pretending about the things that made me happy in my life; I\u2019d decided I\u2019d rather just be happy.</p><p>\u201cI would never allow Richard to abuse me, or any man for that matter,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am not an abuse victim, Ellen. I\u2019m not a victim at all. I own my sexuality in every sense, and I top some of the men in my life. It\u2019s not just me on the receiving end of the rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou abuse some of the men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not abuse.\u201d I was getting pissed and trying not to be.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt each other. How is that not abuse?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is my sexuality; it\u2019s what makes me happy. You saying that it\u2019s abuse is insulting; it would be like me saying that your idea of sex is boring.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you know what kind of sex I enjoy?\u201d She looked at Richard.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about our sex life to anyone,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming some things from your reaction, Ellen, that\u2019s all. I hope I\u2019m wrong for your sake and Richard\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWrong about what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYour idea of sex.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed in her seat, and wouldn\u2019t meet anyone\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>That was it for me. \u201cYou sit there and demand that we tell you intimate things about our sex life, our relationships, but you share nothing. You get all embarrassed, why can\u2019t we be embarrassed, too?\u201d</p><p>She looked startled. \u201cI just thought . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThought what, that because we like kinky sex we can\u2019t be embarrassed?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Richard, then back at me. \u201cI guess I assumed that if you were this open it didn\u2019t bother you to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me to talk to my sweeties, but to someone who I\u2019ve just met and who is judging every word I say, yeah, it bothers me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not judging you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Micah hugged me a little harder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s not.\u201d I looked at Richard. We had a moment of looking deep into each other\u2019s brown eyes, but it wasn\u2019t a love look, it was a soul-searching one. The look you give someone that you know well, or did at one time, as you\u2019re wondering what the hell they\u2019re doing to their lives. Richard had finally worked through his issues so it was nice to have him in our lives again, and part of me wondered if Ellen was his new way of denying himself. It was a nice way of setting himself up to withdraw from the bondage and the rough sex without admitting that he was conflicted. He wouldn\u2019t be conflicted, he\u2019d be giving it all up so he could be married and have that white picket fence dream. Was it possible to lie to yourself so well that you didn\u2019t realize you were doing it? Hell, yes. I\u2019d done it myself for years.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she said, \u201cthat look, how can I not feel threatened when the two of you have such a strong connection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t looking lovingly into each other\u2019s eyes, trust me on that,\u201d I said and cuddled in against Micah. I just wanted to leave. I was so done with this conversation.</p><p>\u201cThen what did that look mean?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>Richard answered, \u201cAnita is wondering why I want someone who is so uncomfortable with so much of my life, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said and looked at them both.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just sex, not his whole life,\u201d she said.</p> <p>I gave Richard very direct eye contact, and raised an eyebrow at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, \u201cWhat is that look you\u2019re giving each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe that sex isn\u2019t that important to you, that\u2019s your choice, but . . .\u201d I stopped without finishing the sentence.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I looked at Richard.</p><p>\u201cJust say it, Anita,\u201d he said.</p><p>I sighed, Micah squeezed my hand. \u201cBut if you believe that sex isn\u2019t important to Richard . . . that would be a mistake and not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.</p><p>Richard took her hand in his, and gazed into her eyes. \u201cI love you, I want to spend my life with you and have children with you. I want to go to PTA meetings and Boy Scout meetings, and do all of it with you.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her smaller hands around his. \u201cOh, Richard, I want that too, so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut to have all that with you, and be happy, I need certain things that you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it wrong that I don\u2019t want you to tie me up and hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not wrong,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also not wrong that I want and need to do that with someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t, honey, but can you accept that it\u2019s true for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to let you have sex with Anita and then come home to me as if it\u2019s all normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou selfish bastard,\u201d she said, and she was crying again. She took her hands out of his and this time he let her do it. She stood up and gave him a look of rage and disgust that must have been like a knife through his heart. \u201cAre you honestly saying, that if I don\u2019t say yes to all this perverted sex that you won\u2019t marry me?\u201d</p><p>The tables near us were beginning to notice the show, and trying to act as if they hadn\u2019t heard that oh, so, provocative sentence.</p><p>We had Richard\u2019s face in profile. He swallowed hard enough that we heard it, and then he said, \u201cI\u2019ve worked too hard to accept who I really am. Ellen, I can\u2019t go back to hiding. I can\u2019t go back to lying to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are choosing her over me,\u201d Ellen said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m choosing myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>She aimed that rage at me. \u201cYou must be incredible in bed for him to throw everything away. I guess I can\u2019t compete with a fur banging, blood whore.\u201d</p><p>Micah pressed his arm against my shoulders, holding me in my chair, because I had started to stand. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>He was right, because if I stood up I wasn\u2019t sure what I was going to do -- nothing good.</p><p>Richard stood up. \u201cThat was an ugly thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s Jean-Claude\u2019s blood whore, then so am I,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ellen stared at him; her face didn\u2019t seem to know what expression it wanted to have, as if so many thoughts were chasing around her mind that she didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have sex with him. You told me you don\u2019t have sex with either of the vampires.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and spoke low, so the other people around wouldn\u2019t hear. Some of the people at the nearest tables were trying not to stare; others were openly watching. He bent closer to her, and said, \u201cJust because no one sticks their dicks in each other doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not sex.\u201d</p><p>She slapped him, hard enough for it to echo in the suddenly silent restaurant. Everyone was looking now; it was too good a show to look away. Richard hadn\u2019t done anything to protect himself, he\u2019d just let her hit him. If a man had done the same thing to a woman someone would have been calling the police.</p><p>Richard stood up straighter, taking his face out of her reach. \u201cI love you, Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you, Richard Zeeman, I hate you for making me love you, and for this . . .\u201d she gestured at me and Micah, though I think we were just representative of the problem.</p><p>She started to sob, put her hands over her face and then ran towards the archway and the door beyond. I honestly expected Richard to follow her, but he just stood there with his cheek reddened from her slap. She was outside in the sunlight now, hesitating on the sidewalk, looking behind her. She kept looking back, and I realized she was expecting him to run after her. When he didn\u2019t appear there, she turned toward the window. Richard didn\u2019t turn around. He didn\u2019t see her on the sidewalk. He didn\u2019t see her look in through the windows at him. Ellen had expected him to follow her. I think she\u2019d seen running out as an escalation, but not an end, and if he\u2019d gone after her, she\u2019d have been right. The look on her face as she realized he wasn\u2019t going to follow was one of raw pain.</p><p>Micah touched my arm, which made me look at him. He looked at me and I knew the look. I was supposed to do something.</p><p>I said, \u201cRichard, if you don\u2019t follow her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>I looked at his very straight, very still back, and then turned to the window. Ellen was looking at him, as if willing him to turn around, but he didn\u2019t. She walked out of sight, fresh tears streaming down her face. Richard didn\u2019t follow her.</p><p>THE END </p> </body></html>"]
