Only you!\u201d</p> <p>He smoothed a hand down the side of her face even as pain thrummed in his temples. \u201cMy love, you must do as the king wills. And you know that I cannot wed with you, for I am promised to another.\u201d</p><p>Tears glistened in her eyes and he thumbed one away, then reached to hold her hands with both of his own. He blinked furiously, squeezing his eyes closed, trying to force the pain away from his head, but it would not abate.</p><p>He must not think on the image that came always with the pain, the image of his parents lying, broken, on the ground beneath the tower. It had happened long ago, and there was naught he could do to save them\u2014then or now.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall happen when I couple with him? There will be no maidenhead to breach, and Lord Merle is like to kill me for leading him falsely!\u201d Allegra\u2019s tears fell freely now, and her voice held a clear strain of panic.</p><p>He strove to clear his mind, and to find a way to stem her weeping. For if he did not have relief, he would go mad. Mayhap he already was.</p> <p>\u201cI shall send to your maid a pig\u2019s bladder filled with blood. You will hide it under your pillow, and when you couple with your new husband, you must cry out in hurt, as you did with me.\u201d He tightened his fingers around her wrists, ignoring her gasp of pain. \u201cAnd when he sleeps anon, you will break that bladder of blood and smear it over your thighs, and on the bed sheets. And Lord Merle will be none the wiser.\u201d</p><p>Allegra\u2019s blue eyes pooled with tears and grief. \u201cAye. And then I shall be wed with a man I do not love, whilst I carry the babe of the man I do.\u201d</p><p>~ Part I ~</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Eighteen Years Later</p><p>Langumont Keep</p> <p>\u201cLady Allegra, a man has arrived below-stairs and wishes to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>Maris looked up from the embroidery on which she had been trying to concentrate and eagerly dropped it to the table in front of her. \u201cI\u2019ll attend to the visitor, Mama. I\u2019ve enough of needles and thread for the day.\u201d</p><p>She rose, glancing automatically out the narrow window for a sign of approaching riders. There was naught on the horizon but snow-covered hills and sparse trees.</p><p>Her mother, Allegra, Lady of Langumont, gave her a vague smile and made no move to stir. \u201cAnd if you continue to seize every opportunity to put your sewing aside, how will you finish your father\u2019s surcoat by Christ\u2019s Mass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish it in time, Mama,\u201d Maris told her. And she would, too, for it was almost as if her father couldn\u2019t return home in time for the celebrations unless she did. Yet, Maris glanced at the half-finished surcoat and wished she hadn\u2019t chosen to embark on such a complicated project.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Allegra told her. \u201cGreet our visitor in my stead and do what you can for him.\u201d</p><p>It was the difference between she and her mother, Maris reflected as she hurried down the curving stone staircase. She moved with such alacrity that the tapestries billowed against the walls and wisps of her hair fluttered against her cheeks. Her mother had always preferred to wait for what would come, whilst Maris rode eagerly to meet trouble\u2014or anything else of interest.</p><p>In the absence of Lord Merle, her father, Maris managed the fief, with the help of Langumont\u2019s steward. Allegra was content to stitch on the many tapestries that decorated the walls, or to manage the sewing ladies. Mayhap, if roused, she would make selections of fabrics, or choose meats for the evening meals, but she did not bestir herself with managing the estate.</p> <p>Such was gladly left to her enthusiastic daughter, the only child of Allegra and Merle, and the sole heiress to Langumont\u2019s vast holdings. It was only right that a woman who was heir to such large holdings must clearly understand the management of them\u2014from every home of each villein and tradesman, to which fields belonged to the overlord, and which were left to the villagers. She knew every inch of every acre of forest as well, and rode out with her father as often as he allowed.</p><p>When she was near the bottom of the stairs, Maris took a moment to adjust her headdress and wimple. The Lady of Langumont might be busy, but she never appeared rushed.</p><p>At this time of the day, mid-afternoon, when the winter sun sunk low to the trees, the hall was empty of men-at-arms and bustling with serfs preparing for the evening meal. A lone, stationary man dressed in fine clothing stood near the stone fireplace that stretched nearly the length of one wall. He appeared to be surveying the room, and when Maris came into his view, he turned to look at her.</p><p>She approached him with regal bearing. \u201cI am Lady Maris Lareux. You are well come to Langumont Keep.\u201d</p><p>He was not overly tall, but taller than she, and his small, sharp black eyes scored over her as if snatching in every detail in a large gulp. More of an age with Allegra than Maris, the man was mayhap one and a half score.</p><p>He was not unpleasing to look upon, with his gleaming black hair, fashionable moustache and neatly trimmed beard, and at first, he appeared neat and well dressed. Yet as Maris returned his bold gaze with one of her own, she noted the splotch of a stain on the midriff of his tunic and the frayed hem of the cross-garters on his left leg.</p><p>\u201cI am Bon de Savrille, my lady. I had not expected...I was led to believe that the Lady of Langumont was called Allegra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Allegra is my mother,\u201d Maris told him. \u201cShe has asked that I greet our guests and tend to their needs as she is otherwise occupied. May I offer you aught to eat or drink? If you have a message for my mother, I would be pleased to relay it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he returned, his gaze sweeping her again so that she felt the urge to look down and make certain the laces were tied at her bliaut\u2019s bosom. \u201cNay, \u2019tis not she to whom I wish to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did request to see the Lady of Langumont,\u201d Maris pressed. \u201cDo you bear a message of some sort? From my father?\u201d A sudden fear seized her middle.</p><p>\u201cNay. I am merely in need of a pallet for the night, as I am traveling to my home. I asked only for Lady Allegra, as her name was familiar to me. I knew her once long ago, and had heard that she was lady here.\u201d He smiled, and though he likely meant it to be a warm one, Maris thought it carried the greasiness of an undercooked hare.</p><p>The man was odd, but she did not fear him. Nay, she had no need to fear him, or any other man while in Langumont. At the slightest crook of her little finger, any number of men-at-arms would rush to her assistance or protection.</p><p>This single man who, even if he were armed could be wearing only a dagger or eating knife, posed no threat to her. Still. His expression caused Maris to step away, grateful for something to do other than to allow the man to rake her up and down with his eyes.</p><p>The look there was a mixture of complacence, interest, and cunning, and not for the first time did Maris wish she had Good Venny\u2019s seventh sense for understanding people.</p><p>\u201cYou may have a seat at any of the tables, and there are pallets in the room below-stairs. If there is anything else you wish, please send for Ralf.\u201d</p><p>Maris made a move to go, but the man stopped her. \u201cMy lady, there is one last thing. If you would give this to your lady mother, mayhap she will remember me.\u201d She saw that he was working a tight ring from a middle finger that resembled a sausage more than an appendage.</p><p>At last it slipped free, and he dropped the heavy, warm gold into her hand. Maris closed her fingers around it. \u201cI\u2019ll give it to her and return with her message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. And many thanks to you for your hospitality.\u201d His gaze transferred from her to sweep the room, as if taking in its expansiveness and accoutrements.</p><p>Glad to be released from what had to be the oddest conversation she\u2019d had since the daft miller Brander had passed on, Maris nodded and gave a brief bow before sweeping from the hall. Ralf would tend to Bon de Savrille if he had any further needs. She would take the ring to Allegra and see what her mother remembered of this bizarre man.</p><p>As Maris entered the room, she offered the heavy gold ring to her mother, saying, \u201cOur visitor is named Bon de Savrille, and he sends this to you.\u201d</p><p>To Maris\u2019s shock, Allegra\u2019s face drained of color. Her eyes grew round and her body stiffened. With fingers that shook, she took the ring from Maris\u2019s hand, closing her fingers around it as if to imprison it.</p><p>\u201cMama, what is it? Shall I order him thrown out?\u201d A wave of strength and protectiveness surged from Maris\u2019s middle. If the man sought to hurt Allegra, or to threaten her in some way, he would be swiftly dealt with.</p><p>\u201cNay. Nay, my sweetling. \u2019Tis naught. I merely felt a bit light of head for the moment.\u201d Allegra\u2019s smile was a bit wobbly.</p><p>\u201cBut Mama\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d Allegra\u2019s voice, rarely this harsh and strong, stopped the words from her daughter\u2019s mouth. \u201c\u2019Tis naught, Maris. I am merely weary and wish to rest. You may leave me. Do you not give that man any further message or attention. I bid you leave him be. He is no one.\u201d</p><p>As Maris left the chamber, Allegra\u2019s heart was ramming so hard in her throat that she thought it might choke her. Her hands had become cold, and they were stiff with the chilling fear that filled her. She wanted naught more than to stay in this sunlit solar, to ignore the man from her past.</p><p>His arrival could mean nothing good.</p><p>But she knew she must speak with Bon. His summons had been implicit when he gave Maris the signet ring to show Allegra. She must find out why he\u2019d reappeared after so many years, and what he wanted from her. And so she descended the stairs to the great hall, knowing he\u2019d be waiting for her to appear.</p><p>Knowing that she\u2019d come to him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t mistaken, for he was sitting on a stool near one of the smaller fireplaces, watching her from across the vast chamber. Ignoring him, Allegra sent Maris on an errand to the kitchen. She knew that her headstrong and directive daughter would be occupied for some time therein, for one of the cook\u2019s children had taken ill. Before moving in the direction of her visitor, Allegra gave several more orders that would take most of the serfs, as well as the steward and the few men-at-arms from the hall as well. She wanted as few witnesses as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then, with great trepidation, she made her way to where he sat, taking care to appear that she merely wandered there by happenstance.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely daughter you have,\u201d were Bon\u2019s first words as Allegra approached. He stood and gave a brief, mocking bow.</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014\u2019twas thought you were dead.\u201d Allegra hated that her voice came out weak and thready. She sank onto the stool he\u2019d just vacated, her knees trembling violently.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come back to life, so it seems.\u201d His dark eyes taunted her.</p><p>Allegra forced a smile over her stiff features. \u201cYou are well come to the home of Lord Lareux and myself.\u201d</p><p>A soft, cruel laugh rumbled from deep in his throat. \u201cAye, Allegra, I am so well come that you did not greet your brother with open arms in view of your serfs and your daughter. In fact, you sent them on their way before you deigned to acknowledge me. Are you so certain I am well come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf-brother,\u201d she reminded him, summoning a bit of spirit.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d His laughter stopped abruptly. \u201cI am indeed the son of a lord and his lady\u2014unlike my sister, who was spawned by a whore.\u201d</p> <p>Allegra flinched and fought to keep her voice steady and out of earshot of the single serf across the room as she demanded, \u201cWhy are you here? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter is lovely. Amazingly lovely,\u201d he said, his attention boring into the orange flames next to them as he spoke with studied casualness. \u201c\u2019Tis hard to believe she is the daughter of a gruff and homely man as Merle Lareux.\u201d</p><p>Darkness closed in on Allegra\u2019s vision and she drew in a deep breath. His last words floated between them, threatening and knowing. Her cold hands fluttered in her lap, digging into the material of her gown, twisting and turning, hiding.... \u201cAye,\u201d she whispered. Could he know?</p><p>\u201cOr is she?\u201d</p><p>Allegra\u2019s insides collapsed into a mass of writhing, churning nausea. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d she managed, despite the fact that the world was closing in on her.</p><p>Bon stepped back from her, turning to look across the empty hall. The cold confidence in his movements and the proprietary sweep of his gaze made Allegra feel even more ill. \u201cBeyond is the beautiful maiden Maris of Langumont, heiress to the vast lands of Merle Lareux. She must be near a ripe age to wed...it has been nearly eighteen years, has it not?\u201d He turned slowly to look at Allegra. \u201c\u2019Twould be a shame if the truth were found out, aye? Were the great Lord of Langumont to learn that the daughter he adores is not of his\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Allegra cried softly, still taking care that none of the bustling serfs should see that aught was amiss. \u201cDo you not speak such lies in my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLies?\u201d Bon rumbled from deep in his throat. \u201cAye. Lies that have such truth to them that the walls of Langumont Keep could come crumbling down about you.\u201d His laughter was bitter. He looked at her calmly, seeming to enjoy the fear that ate into her. \u201cLady sister, I have returned\u2014from the dead, if you wish\u2014for my rightful inheritance.\u201d</p><p>The numbness of fear was so great that Allegra did not comprehend him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleonis, Firmain...and now, thanks to your marriage to Merle Lareux\u2014from which there is, quite remarkably, only a single issue in the form of your lovely daughter\u2014I shall also be the heir apparent to Langumont, Edena and Damona.\u201d His eyes took on a bright gleam. \u201cI am the rightful heir to Father\u2019s lands, Allegra, and I\u2019ll have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d She found her voice at last. \u201cFather disowned you, and you disappeared when he wed with Mother. My mother.\u201d Though she knew little of the ways lands were enfeoffed and distributed, she knew enough that a woman could inherit should her father or the king allow it. Merle had arranged it for Maris, his only daughter. And Allegra knew that her father had done the same for her. That Bon had no claim to the lands she\u2019d brought to her marriage to Merle.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Bon said, a smile stretching his beard and moustache. \u201cI cannot claim Cleonis as a son. But as a husband....\u201d</p><p>\u201cA husband?\u201d she breathed, the fear stifling her as the meaning of his words penetrated. He would claim Maris as his wife? His own niece?</p><p>He stood back, that smile turning colder and more calculating. \u201c\u2019Twould be a shame for Merle Lareux to learn the truth of his daughter...and the perfidy of his wife. However, that unpleasantness could be avoided were the beautiful heiress of Langumont entrusted to the right husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNay. Never.\u201d Allegra stood, turning away in a rush of fear and anger. Her hands trembled violently. \u201cI will never give Maris to a dog such as you.\u201d</p><p>His voice remained low and cold, drawing her to look back at him. \u201cIn time, you will come to see the advantage of my offer. I wed Maris, inherit Langumont and Cleonis, and you remain the healthy wife of Merle Lareux. If not...ach...I fear there will be a convent in your future. Or worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Bon\u2019s eyes were sharp as they settled on her, raking over her with obvious disgust. \u201cThis is not the last you will hear from me.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Bon turned and strode from the hall.</p><p>Allegra eased herself slowly back onto the stool, her head light. The world was in a darkening spiral.</p><p>What could she do?</p><p>Bone-weary, dirty, and smelling of ripe horse, Dirick of Derkland hailed the guardsmen above the heavy portcullis of the Tower of London. At last.</p><p>Nick\u2019s sure hooves clattered on the polished wood as they continued through the entrance into the bailey of King Henry the Plantagenet\u2019s current residence. It had been a brutal two days\u2019 ride in snow and sleet from the funeral of Dirick\u2019s father at Derkland Keep, and he wished only to strip off his half-frozen, sweat-soaked sherte and chausses and slip into a steaming bath that smelled of some pleasing spice or other.</p><p>With one of the king\u2019s maids attending him, of course.</p><p>Mayhap that, at least, would turn his mind from the grief and anger that had gnawed his middle this se\u2019ennight past.</p><p>Fortunately, Dirick had visited Henry uncountable times and Nick knew the whereabouts of the stable without prompting. Dirick\u2019s eyelids sagged, as did his shoulders, and when he slid to the ground, planting his boots in the snow, his knees buckled from weariness. One of the marshals took Nick\u2019s reins, and Dirick stumbled gratefully toward the main keep where he would find food and warmth. The bath and the woman, he amended internally, could wait for the morrow.</p><p>He would search out a pallet on the floor in the below-stairs chamber for the men, and he would sleep. Sleep. He prayed he was too tired to dream, for the nightmare of what had befallen his father would surely haunt him.</p><p>Dirick managed the steps into the hall, but had barely begun his search for a spot at the long trestle tables when he was hailed from behind.</p><p>\u201cDirick! You are here.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward the familiar voice. \u201cGavin. Aye, only just moments ago. I am in search of food and a pallet,\u201d he responded, grasping the forearm of his friend in greeting.</p><p>Lord Gavin of Mal Verne was shaking his head, his stark features more sharp than usual. \u201cI fear your rest must needs wait. Henry demands you attend him immediately.\u201d</p><p>Dirick cursed, flexing his frozen fingers. \u201cHow can he know I am arrived? I have only just left the stable. I didn\u2019t even take the time to unsaddle Nick myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were in his private chamber when the news came you\u2019d crossed the drawbridge. He bade me send you to him immediately, before you found yourself in the company of one lady or another.\u201d A faint quirk of his mouth gave the words a humorous edge, but it slipped away at his next words. \u201cI was aggrieved to hear of your father\u2019s death. I am sorry that Madelyne and I could not attend the funeral, but the news did not reach us here until \u2019twas too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I learned the news in bare time to travel to Derkland myself,\u201d Dirick replied, falling into reluctant step with Gavin as they left the hall. \u201cI traveled two days with no rest from Kent, and then at the nonce of the funeral\u2019s end, I remounted Nick and rode here with no rest.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d felt more than a bit of guilt, leaving his brother Bernard\u2014who was now Lord of Derkland\u2014to deal with the grief of their mother, but it could not be helped. Joanna, Bernard\u2019s wife, was a kind and gentle soul, and she would take good care of their mother.</p><p>\u201cThere is, at least, food with the king,\u201d Gavin pointed out as they came to a fork in the passageway. Then he stopped and gave Dirick a wry smile. \u201cNow that I have done my duty, I\u2019ll bid you good eve and wish you luck on finding your pallet sometime before the dawn. I have been with Henry all the day myself\u2014he is filled with the energetic humors all these last days and has kept me since dawn. And Madelyne awaits me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBid her well for me. I\u2019ll speak with the king, then, God willing, find that pallet and sleep for two days. \u2019Tis that, or my knees will give out in his royal presence.\u201d Dirick gave his friend a weak grin, then turned toward Henry\u2019s chamber and strode rapidly down the chill, dark passage. The sooner he should learn of the king\u2019s needs, the sooner Dirick could see to his own.</p><p>\u2019Twas not as if his own requirements were great.</p><p>As the youngest son of Harold of Derkland, Dirick had neither lands nor an affinity for the Church\u2014as his two elder brothers did, eldest and middle, respectively. Instead, he had made himself indispensable to the young King of England when he was merely the Count of Angevin and wooing his bride, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Henry had grown to trust and rely upon Dirick, and as he had naught to offer any woman but his company and his body, Dirick had enjoyed his time in Eleanor\u2019s Court of Love whilst managing the variety of tasks Henry set before him.</p><p>\u2019Twas just as well that he had not been seated in the hall, he reflected numbly, striding along the curving passageway. He was in no good mood to charm the ladies of Eleanor\u2019s court, nor did he wish to offend any of them in his present state. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But to his dismay, when Dirick was shown into Henry\u2019s private solar, his wife, Queen Eleanor attended him also.</p><p>\u201cYour majesty.\u201d He bowed first to Henry, pressing his forehead to the king\u2019s outstretched hand, and then swiveled on his bent, aching knee to greet the queen. \u201cMy queen, I fear I offend you in my present state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirick, you may get off the floor and rid yourself of that sword and cloak,\u201d Henry boomed, standing to look down at him. \u201c\u2019Tis not as though Eleanor doesn\u2019t understand the rudiments of traveling in haste. The woman leaves me in her tracks when we tour Aquitaine. \u2019Tis only when she is enceinte that she travels at a reasonable pace,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, Sir Dirick,\u201d the queen\u2019s languid tones forgave him, \u201c\u2019twould be unthinkable that you could offend me. Or any of my ladies, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>Dirick murmured his thanks and pulled to his feet, smothering a groan from the ache in his knees, and unbuckled the sword from his tunic. Resting it on the floor near the door, he tore the cloak from his shoulders and dropped it atop the scabbard, then turned back to his liege.</p><p>\u201cSit yourself down,\u201d Henry grumped, turning to pace across the room. \u201cYour excessive height offends me\u2014and in truth, you look as though you are ready to fall over.\u201d</p><p>Dirick sank onto a stool near the crackling fire and tried to warm his hands. Henry\u2019s sharp eyes surely did not miss the weariness and pain that lined his man\u2019s face, but he said nothing save, \u201cYour father is laid to rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. He is laid to rest\u2014yet I will not rest until I lay hand and sword upon the man who helped him to an early grave.\u201d Dirick stopped his weary tongue from adding aloud the words that echoed in his mind: with or without your blessing.</p> <p>\u201cAnd well you should not, Dirick. I would expect no less from you. A younger son you might be, but bound with honor and determination you ever have been\u2014at the least in my name.\u201d Henry gestured to a wooden platter of cheese and bread. \u201cEat, man, before you tilt onto the floor, and I will tell you why I have summoned you.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor thrust a goblet of ruby wine into his hand, and Dirick took it, mildly surprised that she would serve him. But he was left to reach for his own hunk of bread, and he did, tearing it from the brown loaf, and breaking off a piece of cheese as well. The wine, surely from Eleanor\u2019s own lands of Aquitaine, went smoothly down his throat and warmed his limbs as Henry began to speak in his abrupt fashion.</p><p>\u201cAs I have heard it, your father Harold was found dead with his horse and one of his men near Derrington. \u2019Twas no ordinary scene of war or thievery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. On his belly and unshriven,\u201d Dirick spat, heedless of the breadcrumbs that sprayed into his wine. \u201cHis throat was slit deep, through to the spine. Someone had arranged it so that his head pulled back, leaving his face to look up at the heavens.\u201d Anger and nausea rolled deep within him, simmering and bubbling from where he\u2019d kept it tucked away for days.</p><p>\u201cAnd his body was arranged thusly with another victim, hand to hand, belly to ground, face to the sky, as well,\u201d Henry continued. His voice had lost its friendly boom and become hard. \u201c\u2019Tis a madman, and your father\u2019s death was the third such instance in two summers.\u201d</p><p>Dirick swallowed hard, and the lump of bread stuck in his throat. He gulped wine to soften it and warm his suddenly shivering body again. \u201cMore? There are more of these slaughterings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye.\u201d Of a sudden, the king looked as weary as Dirick felt. \u201cI have summoned you with such haste because I do not wish there to be a fourth instance. You may fulfill your need for vengeance and mine own desires at the nonce, and with my blessing.\u201d</p><p>The realization that he did not have to beg to be released from Henry\u2019s service to find his father\u2019s killer lightened Dirick\u2019s weary shoulders. His prayers had been answered. \u201cMany thanks, my liege. You have granted me the only boon I should ask of you.\u201d</p><p>Henry nodded once, as if to agree, and Dirick shoved a hunk of crusty yellow cheese into his mouth. \u201cYou will leave on the morrow\u2014or the one following, if you desire a day of rest before setting out on your quest. You have my permission to travel where you wish to run this killer to the ground, but one small task you must first complete.</p><p>\u201cI have long suspected my vassal Bon de Savrille, Lord of Breakston by some fool\u2019s decision, of having something to hide from his king. He has not traveled to me in more than a score moons, and he always gives the excuse of aught such as a bad crop, or reavers on the loose, for why he doesn\u2019t come. At the last, \u2019twas that he\u2019d injured a leg and couldn\u2019t ride the distance. I bid you seek him out and learn what you can of him, and whether he should be trusted. I do not wish him to know you are my man, however, so take care how you present yourself.</p><p>\u201cAnd as you travel to Breakston, you will cross the lands of Langumont. Lord Merle Lareaux of Langumont, as you mayhap are aware, is the one who came upon the scene of your father\u2019s death. You must speak with him.\u201d</p><p>Dirick could barely contain his satisfaction and relief at being commanded by his king to do the very thing he\u2019d planned to plead for. \u201cAye, my lord. And what of the other instances of this slaughtering mad man? Are there others I should speak with as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall have news sent to you at Langumont, as my man Dwain travels to Lederwyth to visit with a merchant who came upon the last scene. Of the first instance...\u2019twas nearly two summers past, and the man who found the victims is dead of the pox. He will be no help to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, my lord. Now, if you will, as you have provided me with satisfaction for belly and mind, I will beg leave and seek a pallet. It will be a long ride to Langumont and Breakston, and I am weary in both body and spirit.\u201d</p> <p>Eleanor\u2019s dulcet tones interrupted any response her husband may have intended. \u201cBut Christ\u2019s Mass is on the morrow, Dirick. By now the ladies have heard of your return, and they will be sore disappointed to be cheated of your dance and song at the feast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist\u2019s Mass?\u201d Dirick shook his head, the weariness rushing over him again with full force. But he was not so fogged that he didn\u2019t recognize her implicit command that he should stay and entertain her ladies. \u201cI did not realize...aye, mayhap I will stay for the feast.\u201d He was rewarded with a warm smile from the beautiful queen, and he considered for not the first time the challenge Henry must have, managing such a powerful woman as his wife.</p><p>It was a blessing Dirick would never have that cross to bear.</p><p>He staged a brief bow. \u201cMay I beg your leave, your majesties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Dirick, only one more thing.\u201d Something akin to grief brushed the king\u2019s ruddy face, and Dirick recognized pain in his liege\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou must know I am greatly grieved at your father\u2019s passing. He was a good man, and a loyal friend and advisor. I will do whatever I can to help you bring his killer to justice.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>It was late in the day of Christ\u2019s Mass. Maris trudged through the new-fallen snow from the hall out into the bailey and over to the door that opened into the small structure that was her herbary. The little building was both her sanctuary and her liberation.</p><p>This day, the new miller\u2019s wife was about to deliver her new baby, and Maris would be there as her healer. It was true that one of the village midwives or leeches could be there to help her, but Maris had tired of watching in vain for her father\u2019s return and she didn\u2019t wish to have idle hands.</p><p>Keeping her hands busy would keep her mind from stewing on the fact that Allegra refused to tell her anything more of Bon de Savrille.</p><p>The worry gnawed away in her mind.</p><p>As did the memory of de Savrille\u2019s hungry expression as he looked at her in the hall.</p><p>A strange shiver\u2014one of discomfort, mayhap of fear\u2014whipped over her shoulders and had nothing to do with the cold.</p><p>And where was Papa? He had been gone over long, and it had been more than a moon since his last letter in which he was certain he\u2019d be returned by Christ\u2019s Mass. She missed him, and she could speak with him about her worries. Surely he would know whether this Bon de Savrille was a threat or nay.</p><p>Then, as if her deepest wish conjured him, Maris heard it: the bellows, the excited calls from the bailey.</p><p>\u201cRiders approach! The lord\u2019s standard!\u201d</p><p>Hardly daring to hope, she dashed from the herbary on swift feet, allowing the door to smack into the wall as she flung it open.</p><p>\u201cThe lord! The lord returns!\u201d</p><p>The bellowing shouts came from the guards as they raised the portcullis and lowered the drawbridge and spurred Maris\u2019s excitement and relief.</p><p>But when she saw him, saw that he barely sat on the saddle and that his face bore a pasty expression the color of bad meat, her greetings dried in her throat. As she watched, as his eyes scored the bailey, over the masses of people welcoming his return, and finally settled on her person. She felt his relief from across the yard.</p><p>Terror surging in her chest, Maris started toward him, heedless of the danger of his war-trained horse, as he gave the barest of smiles with what seemed to be a last effort.</p><p>And then her papa slumped over, sliding off the saddle and into the snow.</p><p>It was well past the evening meal before Maris assured herself that her father would live. After the first numbness of terror, she\u2019d galvanized into action, snapping orders and demands to serfs and men-at-arms alike.</p><p>Papa\u2019s squire and Raymond Vermille, the master-at-arms, had carried him into the hall, up the stone-cut stairs that led to the private chamber he shared with Allegra. Maris preceded them, calling for warm water, strips of linen, broth, as well as array of herbs from her storeroom: woad leaves and comfrey roots, lavender and birch bark.</p><p>She\u2019d soaked the linen of his sherte, which had dried into the blood of his wound, so that it could be pulled away with as little pain as possible. She mashed a paste of dried woad and comfrey root over the deep slice in his side\u2014the mark of a sword, and not an unfamiliar sight to Maris. After wrapping it with cloth soaked in a birch bark tea, she watched for a long while until his breathing became regular and deep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Only then was she able to settle back in her chair and look upon him with new eyes\u2014realizing that this day, her world had shifted.</p><p>Her beloved father. The most important person in her world. He\u2019d almost not come home.</p><p>And if he had not, she would be left alone, heiress to Langumont and vassal to King Henry\u2014a ripe prize for any man to take.</p> <p>Maris slid to her knees at that moment, sending prayers of gratitude to the Heavenly Father for sparing her earthly one. The rough stone of the floor cut through her heavy wool skirts, and the chill and dampness seeped into her knees, reminding her how different her life would be were her father not there to protect her.</p><p>Despite her array of responsibilities as lady of the manor, Maris suddenly felt young and small when she thought of being without her papa. Allegra had never had the inclination or the skill to manage the estates. Indeed, Maris tended to care for her mother more than Allegra cared for her. Her papa was her strength.</p><p>Maris rose from her knees and dashed away the single tear that had seeped from one eye.</p><p>It was foolish and a waste of time to cry over that which would not come to pass. Papa had returned and he would heal well. She would see to it. And she wouldn\u2019t let him leave again until he was strong and able. She would also take Raymond of Vermille aside and impress upon the master at arms that if he allowed one hair on Merle\u2019s head to be harmed, she would flay him herself, and\u2014</p><p>Merle shifted, groaning softly, and Maris reached for his heavy hand. She sat on the edge of the bed and held his fingers in her lap, thanking God again that he was not so sore injured that he had fallen into a fever.</p> <p>\u201cMaris.\u201d His voice was stronger than she\u2019d expected and a surge of relief rushed over her.</p><p>\u201cPapa, I have broth for you...and willow tea.\u201d She helped him sit upright and saw that his eyes were open, gleaming and lucid. Aye, there would be no fever and for that she sent up another prayer of thanks.</p><p>\u201cAye, dearling I find I am quite hungry. Where is your mama?\u201d</p><p>Maris brought him the bowl and dredged up a spoonful of the rich broth as she replied. \u201cMama came immediately, but at the sight of your gash, her head became light, and so she went to get some air. She bade me call her when you awakened\u2014or if you worsened. So there you see, naught has changed in your absence.\u201d She smiled with a bit of humor as well as satisfaction when she saw the way he gulped the broth.</p><p>Papa smiled back, easing her worry that much more. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the truth, dearling, that naught has changed\u2014for I have seen changes just in this chamber. You\u2019ve grown more beautiful and more skilled in my absence. I told Raymond I wished to come to the place where I would be cared for the best. And I made the right choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, indeed, Papa, none will care for you as I do,\u201d Maris told him with a teary smile. \u201cBut you must rest now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye. That I will. And on the morrow, I have much to say to you, my beloved daughter, and I will brook no disagreement from you.\u201d</p><p>The morning after Christ\u2019s Mass was a cold, clear one, and the sun was high in the sky. Maris shielded her eyes from the brilliance of the snow as she picked her way to the stables.</p><p>Her mare, Hickory, nickered softly from the last stall on the left. Maris crooned gently to her, petting the soft black nose that rooted about the folds of her brilliant blue cape for the dried apple hidden therein. She offered the treat to Hickory, then knelt in the stall to look at the injured leg.</p><p>Yesterday\u2019s poultice was long dried, and Maris peeled the strips of cloth away. Gingerly feeling the length of the mare\u2019s foreleg, she noted Hickory\u2019s start when she pressed on the muscle that had been strained a week earlier. The swelling from an abrasion against rough stone had eased, but the mare was still in too much pain to walk easily.</p><p>Before the warm bruisewort poultice she\u2019d prepared cooled, Maris pressed the cloth that held the herb onto the tender spot on Hickory\u2019s leg. The horse nickered softly and butted her nose against the top of her mistress\u2019s head. Holding the herbal mass firmly in place, she wrapped clean strips of cloth around, binding it firmly to the injured leg.</p><p>She was just pulling to her feet when the sound of running footsteps alerted her.</p><p>\u201cLady!\u201d</p><p>Maris froze her heart surging into her throat. Papa?</p> <p>She whirled to see who was dashing into the stables with such haste.</p><p>\u201cMilady, you must come at once. Thomas the Cooper\u2019s wife\u2014she\u2019us strainin\u2019 to deliver her babe an\u2019 \u2019tain\u2019t comin\u2019. I done all I ken,\u201d Widow Maggie pleaded in earnest. She wasn\u2019t nearly as old as the lines on her face made her appear, and today they seemed even deeper and more stark than usual.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll come.\u201d Relief coursed through her, and Maris, always glad to have something with which to occupy her hands and mind, started out of the stables, brushing past the older woman.</p><p>Outside of the keep, a chill wind had kicked up and flurries of snow blew raucously about her cape and Widow Maggie\u2019s three layers of wrap. Maris knew the way to Thomas the Cooper\u2019s home, and trudged along as quickly as she could in the knee-deep snow.</p><p>It never occurred to her to bring a man-at-arms with her on a visit to one of her villagers. Maris knew there wasn\u2019t a person within Langumont who would dare or even wish to harm a hair on her head. And if anyone should attempt such a foolish thing, the punishment would be swift and fatal.</p><p>Aside of that, it would take much too long to send for one to accompany her in desperate situations such as this.</p><p>As she hurried along, Maris wondered not for the first time what Papa intended to speak with her about\u2014but whatever it was would wait until she returned. Papa was just as concerned for the welfare of the residents of Langumont as she was. For without them, the lands wouldn\u2019t be worked, the tradesmen wouldn\u2019t conduct their businesses, and the entire manor would fall to ruin.</p><p>All thoughts of her father disappeared when Maris approached the dark, dank hut. She could hear the screams of the woman inside.</p><p>Drawing a deep breath\u2014as much to calm her nerves as to dispel the stench of blood, urine and other waste\u2014she ducked her head and, pushing aside the heavy door, entered the hut.</p><p>In one corner of the dwelling was a bed, with a prone woman twisting on it in agony. Her huge belly swelled up from under the old blankets. Thomas the Cooper sat next to her on a three legged stool and held her hand. A block of wood was clamped tightly between her teeth, but did nothing to stifle the moans and shrieks of pain.</p><p>The windows were shrouded, and smoke from the fire pit choked Maris\u2019s vision. Within moments, she had Thomas and Widow Maggie opening the windows and chimney to let the stagnant air out of the room.</p><p>\u201cDarkness only encourages the bad humors,\u201d she explained, stating aloud one of the cardinal rules Good Venny, her mentor, had taught her.</p><p>She wasted no time and pushed the blankets up over the woman\u2019s abdomen to see what was happening. Dried blood smeared her legs, but Maris could see the bloody skin of a babe erupting from her womb. It was not the head crowning betwixt the woman\u2019s thighs.</p><p>Dear God. \u201c\u2019Tis the bottom that comes. Bring water,\u201d Maris ordered, her lips tight. \u201cAnd, Maggie, some of that lye soap. I will wash before touching her.\u201d</p><p>The leeches and physicians of England did not always agree with the tenets of Good Venny\u2019s homeland, Jerusalem, but Maris had been taught by him and rarely veered from his wisdom. Most of the local leeches would never dare consider what Maris knew she must do to save the woman. She washed her hands quickly\u2014another of Good Venny\u2019s rules\u2014then wiped the legs of the woman so she could better see.</p><p>The babe was twisted and bent double as it tried to push from the womb. With no further thought\u2014for if she allowed herself to hesitate, she might not act\u2014Maris reached into the crying woman\u2019s womb and felt the slick bottom of the babe. Fighting against nature, she pushed the infant back in and up. Hardly aware of the gaping stare of Maggie behind her, Maris struggled with the slippery babe, sliding her fingers in and around to turn it into the proper direction.</p><p>At last...at last, the baby moved and Maris felt the curve of a small foot. \u201cPush!\u201d she cried to the cooper\u2019s wife. \u201cPush!\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s muscles bunched and her stomach shifted. Then, with a long, keening moan, the mother forced the babe from her body. Maris guided the infant, feet first, as it erupted from the womb, and at last held the tiny infant in her hands.</p><p>The squall of a newborn filled the hut.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a son,\u201d Maris announced, handing the babe to Maggie. \u201cNow, mistress, one more push to rid you of the afterbirth and you may rest.\u201d But when she pressed the woman\u2019s stomach and felt another bump and movement within, she realized she was wrong.</p><p>\u201cThere is another, mistress. You are blessed with two! Push,\u201d Maris ordered, replacing the block of wood between the woman\u2019s teeth. \u201cComes another babe.\u201d</p><p>It took the rest of the woman\u2019s strength to rid herself of her second son, and the afterbirth, mercifully, came shortly after.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll sleep,\u201d Maris told Thomas. \u201c\u2019Tis likely the babes were tangled in the womb and thus became mixed up.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a packet of herbs with instructions to boil them with water and have her drink it as often as she would. \u201cSend for Widow Maggie if you need her. She will bleed some, but not overmuch.\u201d Turning to Maggie, she asked, \u201cIs there not a wet nurse in the village? What of the smith\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady. I\u2019ll fetch her.\u201d Widow Maggie\u2019s wrinkled face had smoothed a bit, and relief glowed in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady, thank\u2019ee for coming.\u201d Thomas was at her feet, tugging profusely at his forelock. \u201cMy lady, thank\u2019ee for my sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo strapping boys they\u2019ll be,\u201d Maris said with a smile, and made a mental note to send three chickens and a calf to them from her own stables. \u201cWhat a good help to you in the shop. But your wife will be poorly for some time. Take care not to work her until Maggie gives the word. Keep the smith\u2019s daughter for a wet nurse as long as you need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then, because the dark room with its stench of blood had finally begun to close in on her, Maris had to get out. She said her last farewells and slipped from the close, smoky hut.</p><p>It was dark\u2014Maris looked up in surprise at the moon and stars. She\u2019d spent nearly the whole day in that tiny room. Weariness washed over her, followed by a burst of exhilaration at the realization that she had helped two new babes into the world.</p><p>Surely God would rather that she spend her time doing such things, rather than embroidering or even praying on her knees in the chapel\u2014which was what many ladies such as her own mother preferred to do.</p> <p>Maris\u2019s feet crunched in the snow as she trudged along, considering this n. Clutching her pouch in one cold hand, she tucked the other inside her cloak. The moon was bright in the clear sky, lighting her way almost as if it were day.</p><p>The gate to the bailey was just ahead, lit invitingly with torches. Surely Papa would be in bed\u2014and if he weren\u2019t, as his healer, she\u2019d have something to say about that. Thus, tomorrow would be soon enough for them to speak on whatever he meant to tell her.</p><p>All at once, Maris was jolted from her thoughts as a huge horse appeared from nowhere. He was coming too quickly down the narrow, deserted throughway, and Maris shrieked, holding up a hand to shield her face.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Sblood, woman!\u201d cried the rider, jerking back frantically on the reins of his mount as soon as he saw her shadowed figure. \u201cDo you not open your eyes when wandering at night?\u201d</p><p>Maris\u2019s initial fright turned to anger. No one spoke to the Lady of Langumont in that manner. She turned her face up to meet the eyes of the rider, drawing her shoulders back and lifting her chin haughtily.</p> <p>The man was a stranger to her, but he was obviously one of high rank. He wore chain mail and rode a horse as valuable as her father\u2019s. Even in the instant of her anger and fright, she took in the details of his appearance: he was tall and broad-shouldered with thick, shadowed hair curling wildly at the nape of his neck. One big hand waved his helm angrily at her while the other fought to keep his mount under control.</p><p>\u201cIt was your good fortune that I could stop Nick before we trampled you,\u201d Dirick snapped, altogether too grateful that he had, in fact, seen her slender shadow before it was too late. His heart was thudding in his chest as he realized how close he\u2019d come to trampling the wench.</p><p>Christ\u2019s teeth, she\u2019d been walking in the shadows of the narrow throughway, and it was only by luck that a silver of moonbeam had caught at something metallic in her hair, glinting and alerting him to the movement.</p><p>Looking down, he noted her dirt streaked face and sagging hair. In the bright moonlight, he could see her eyes flashing at him\u2014rather like his mother\u2019s cats when they were angry: spitting and hissing. Yet, despite her bedraggled appearance, the woman had an air of affront that did not befit a simple peasant wench.</p><p>A comely one, she would be, however, if she were cleaned up a bit, he realized suddenly, allowing his gaze to do a leisurely sweep over her from head to toe. Mayhap that was just what he needed after these days\u2019 journey ahorse...and mayhap that was why she walked on the road alone so late at night.</p><p>Before he could voice his thoughts, she snapped back at him. \u201cIt was no fault of mine!\u201d she told him coldly. \u201cI didn\u2019t leap into your pathway; you came barreling upon mine with nary a care for anyone else who might be along the way. If you do not open your eyes while riding, sir knight, when in battle, you may find yourself in a more telling situation than nearly trampling a woman!\u201d</p> <p>Annoyance flashed through him at her scornful response, and he jerked Nick back around, glaring right down into her face. To his surprise, she didn\u2019t back away, but instead glared back. Her furious eyes were an incongruity in a dirty face.</p><p>\u201cI can think of much better things to do with a woman than trample her,\u201d he replied, wheeling Nick in front of her to cut off her escape. Only whores walked the streets of a village at night, and despite her dirt-streaked cheeks, she was rather appealing\u2014if one could overlook the haughtiness in her words. \u201cMayhap you would like to display your own horsemanship if you do not appreciate mine.\u201d His voice gentled and deepened just enough to let it be clear he had something in particular she might care to ride...and it wasn\u2019t Nick.</p><p>The wench drew her breath in sharply, obviously understanding his meaning all too well, and confirming his suspicion that she was no innocent. \u201cSir, you overspeak yourself,\u201d she told him, backing away.</p><p>Dirick lunged from his saddle, half-heartedly snatching at her arm. But she was too quick and dodged into the shadows. He sat back and, after a moment, laughed at himself. \u2019Twas just as well. He had no time to waste with whores, and the very accommodating Lady Artemis had been most hospitable in a private alcove before he left London. His need could wait.</p><p>He gathered up Nick\u2019s reins and urged his horse on down the street toward the center of the village. He expected to find an inn where he could sleep this night, and then present himself to Lord Merle Lareux on the morrow.</p><p>Dirick nodded to himself as he looked about. The streets of Langumont were lit only by the bright moon and stars, but clearly showed well built houses and a relatively clean center square. When he\u2019d passed some men at arms at the edge of the village, they\u2019d taken notice of him\u2014a single rider on a good mount\u2014but did not attempt to stop him from entering the town. Although they were sharp eyed enough to notice a stranger, they did not deem a single knight to be a threat.</p><p>It was true...Dirick beheld was only a threat to those who slayed his father.</p><p>Maris ran the last bit to the portcullis of the bailey, her long braid bouncing along her shoulder as she hurried into the safety of the keep.</p> <p>That man was a mule\u2019s behind! And a very large one at that.</p><p>Had he dared lay a hand on her, she would have called the guards down on him so quickly, he wouldn\u2019t know what happened.</p><p>Suddenly, now that she was safely inside the bailey and able to think more clearly, a wave of unease settled over her. She\u2019d only been challenged because she looked like a wench\u2014in a simple cloak, without a wimple, her face dirty and her hair straggling about, trudging the village streets at night...indeed, what else was a man to think?</p><p>He\u2019d thought exactly what anyone would have thought: only whores walk the streets at night.</p><p>She wondered who he was. Dressed so richly, riding a horse of that sort...surely he wasn\u2019t a guest of her father\u2019s. Nay, of course not. He would have approached the keep, rather than ride through the village. And\u2014Maris turned to look back at the lowered portcullis\u2014no one approached at this time of night, so he must be seeking a place at the inn.</p><p>Whoever he was, she doubted she\u2019d see him again. And even if she did, the man would never recognize her as the weary, bedraggled woman on the road.</p><p>Maris let herself into the great hall and was surprised to find her father seated in his chair by a blazing fire. The serf who tended the fire during the night slept curled on his pallet in the corner, near enough to tell if the flames lowered.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d she exclaimed softly, aware of the pallets for the men-at-arms that lay just on the other side of a screen of blankets. \u201cWhat are you doing, still awake? You should be resting,\u201d she lectured. Nevertheless, she was relieved and delighted to see him.</p><p>\u201cDaughter,\u201d he looked up from a chessboard. \u201cI\u2019d begun to worry about you, but Father Abraham\u2019s servant sent to me that the birthing was difficult.\u201d</p><p>Maris lowered herself into her mother\u2019s chair and gratefully took the chunk of bread her father offered her. \u201cAye\u2014\u2019twas two babes. Two boys. They are well and squalling, and overjoyed to be in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis good work you do, Maris. You are good to the people here, and I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>She felt herself swell with pride at her father\u2019s words, and tears glinted at the corners of her eyes when she saw the smile on his face. \u201cThank you Papa. You know that I love Langumont, and its people, above all\u2014save you, of course.\u201d</p><p>Merle shifted in his heavy chair. \u201cMaris, I nearly didn\u2019t live to see you again,\u201d he said, returning his gaze to her. \u201cI was sorely injured, and were it not for the grace of God and the assistance of another man, I should have been left on the field to die. \u2019Tis why my return was so delayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Papa, why did you not send word? I would have come\u2014\u201d</p><p>He smiled, patting her hand. \u201cI know you would have, daughter, and I couldn\u2019t have had a better one to nurse me back to health than you. I didn\u2019t send word because I didn\u2019t wish to worry your mother.\u201d He sighed and released her hand to stroke his beard. \u201cAs I lay there, determined to live, I realized that had I perished, I should have left you and your mother alone and unprotected. And Langumont unprotected.\u201d</p><p>Unease crept over her. What was he trying to say \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be unprotected, Papa. Sir Raymond is here, and....\u201d She trailed off and folded her hands in her lap, looking at herb stained skin and scratched fingers. The hands of a maidservant, not a great lady.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis time you were wed, Maris,\u201d he told her quietly, but with a firmness in his voice that brooked no disobedience.</p><p>Her gaze snapped up to him as horror shot through her. \u201cBut I do not wish to wed, Papa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he responded, his words steady, \u201cbut wed you will, Maris. And by Christ\u2019s Mass next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d The denial sprang from her lips in a whisper.</p><p>He appeared not to hear her. \u201cI\u2019ve sifted through the many suitors that have inquired for your hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misspeak yourself, Papa, they inquire not for my hand but for my lands. Nothing more than that,\u201d Maris said wryly, swallowing back the heavy lump in her throat. \u201cWould that you had heirs other than me, that I could choose my husband.\u201d</p><p>He gave a short laugh. \u201cIf you were to choose your husband, that occasion would never happen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Papa\u2014\u201d</p><p>Merle\u2019s bushy eyebrows furrowed and he raised a silencing hand. \u201cYou\u2019re the heiress to Langumont, Maris. Lady of Firmain and Cleonis. You cannot disown your heritage, and your husband must be worthy of you.\u201d He leaned toward her, his blue eyes serious. \u201cI have made certain that you are lady of the lands in your own right. \u2019Tis writ, and I would not wish to see you lose that power. You will rule in your own right, just as our queen yet does\u2014but a husband is needed to ensure that you remain able to do so.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPapa, have you not allowed me to learn to ride and hunt as well as a man? Have you not insisted that I learn to read and write so I can keep my own accounts? Yet you feel that I am not able to retain hold of my own lands without a husband.\u201d She looked imploringly at her father, her small hand resting over his big one. \u201cDo not force me to marry yet, please, Papa.\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head slowly. \u201cAye, Maris, I insisted that you be as able to rule your lands as a man, yet never did I disallow the fact that you must marry. It is the best for Langumont, too, daughter. Langumont, which you purport to love as much as you do me. The people cannot be left without a strong liege to protect them, and, intelligent and brave as you are, my dearling, you cannot ride into battle and defend the lands. And there is the matter of your own heir, my dearling.\u201d</p><p>Maris opened her mouth to argue, then closed it as she realized he spoke the truth. She had known, had she not, that this day would come. As much as she had ignored it, tried to believe it would never happen...nay, it had always been on the horizon. She bit her lip and swallowed, then looked at him. \u201cPapa, at the least, do not force me to wed with a man I do not know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaris, I am not fond of the word \u2018force\u2019. You will do your duty, and you will trust me and accept my decision for your husband. Have I not always taken the best care of you? I cannot allow this matter to remain unsettled any longer.\u201d He paused for a sip of his own wine. \u201cThe son of the man who saved my life in battle rides to Langumont,\u201d he told her. \u201cTake care that you do not offend him, nor drive him away as you flaunt your horsemanship and archery skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d she asked, a note of desperation creeping into her voice. Her fate had already been sealed.</p><p>\u201cYou shall meet him,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cAye, Papa,\u201d she said, staring studiously at the hands in her lap.</p><p>\u201cGood girl, Maris.\u201d He put his arm around her, pulling her shoulder to his. \u201cKnow that I want only what is best for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, Papa,\u201d she said again, struggling to keep the sadness from her voice.</p><p>After a few moments of silence, she rose slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll to bed now, my lord.\u201d She kissed his cheek gently.</p><p>\u201cSleep well, child,\u201d he said quietly, brushing her face.</p><p>Merle hoisted himself carefully into bed. His muscles ached, not to mention the wound in his side that was barely healed enough to sit ahorse.</p><p>Allegra sat in the bed next to him. She had dismissed her maid Maella after the woman brushed out her mistress\u2019s long hair and braided it in its customary plait. Curls framed her face as her wide gaze fastened on her husband. He sensed her tension, and not understanding the reason for it, reached to take her cold fingers.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis glad I am to be home,\u201d he told her, bringing them to his mouth for a soft kiss. \u201cAnd back in my own chamber this night, at least.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I too,\u201d she murmured, pulling her hand away as she reached over to pull the draperies about the bed.</p><p>\u201cMaris is grown to a beautiful lady,\u201d he said, staring at the velvet draperies as she drew them together. \u201c\u2019Tis well past time for her to be wed.\u201d</p><p>Allegra froze. \u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. She will be wed within the year. \u2019Tis not safe for her otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, you\u2014but my lord, you may not find a worthy man in the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, yet I have found one. One that is worthy of my Maris\u2019s hand, worthy to have Langumont.\u201d He scratched his belly and looked at her slim form with interest. It had been a long while since he\u2019d bedded his wife, and though she wasn\u2019t the most receptive woman he\u2019d coupled with, she was his wife, and she was there.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked, her voice thin and tight.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis the son of a dear friend.\u201d He struggled under the blankets to twist and show her the ugly wound in his side.</p> <p>Allegra gasped and covered her face at the sight of the red, swollen gash, reminding Merle yet again how fortunate he was to have a daughter so well versed in healing. Otherwise, he\u2019d have to allow the leeches to attend to his hurts, for his wife could not. \u201cHe is a dear friend who caused this not to be my last wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, my lord, I beg you\u2014do not make the decision to betrothe Maris in haste,\u201d she said, reaching to touch the grey speckled hair on his scarred chest. \u201cMayhaps there is another\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay. Lady, know you this\u2014Maris will wed with Victor d\u2019Arcy on Midsummer\u2019s Eve. He is well suited for her. He will arrive in short order to sign the betrothal agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. She will marry Victor. For her own well being.\u201d</p><p>Allegra twisted her fingers into the heavy fur that covered their bed. \u201cBut my lord, surely there are others\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman, do you not hear me?\u201d Merle was irritated. \u201cShe will marry Victor d\u2019Arcy and that is the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord.\u201d Her voice was choked and her attention was turned away, fixed on the inside of the curtains by her.</p><p>Merle thought of one other thing, \u201cAllegra. Do you not let Maris bathe Raymond Vermille any longer. He looks at her too admiringly, and it would not be good to inflate his infatuation. Send Maella or Verna to take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Weary of waiting, and in no mood to coax, he closed his hand softly over her breast and drew her close. \u201cCome, woman, it has been nigh too long.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Bon de Savrille opened his swollen eyes slowly. Too much wine and wenching to celebrate Christ\u2019s Mass\u2014and the eve of. And the day following.</p><p>His head pounded and the daylight streaming into the inn\u2019s room was too bright. Verna the Bountiful, as he\u2019d come to think of her, stirred next to him. He swatted her hard enough to force a squeal as she started awake. She rolled over leisurely and gave him a long, deep kiss.</p><p>His hand grasped her large breast and squeezed until she sighed a moan of pleasured pain, then he nipped at the tight peak of flesh. Verna purred as Bon\u2019s large hand swept over her belly and down between her legs. She closed work roughened fingers over his erection and proceeded to torment him until he threw her flat so he could drive fiercely into her body.</p><p>Rough nails scored his back and the pain and smell of blood only served to heighten his pleasure. The pounding in his head receded and passion ruled him now. Verna was quite the best lay he\u2019d had for years. It was good fortune that had led him to her on the threshold of Merle Lareux\u2019s keep.</p><p>In the afterglow of their angry, violent mating, he lay staring at the low, dark ceiling. He\u2019d watched from a distance as Merle Lareux returned to his home, seen how the people greeted him\u2014and, especially, how his daughter, Maris, attached herself to his side. \u2019Twas obvious that the man adored her\u2014and that made Bon\u2019s scheme all the more brilliant. Allegra, his stupid sister, would not dare chance driving a wedge between her husband and daughter. Not if she wanted to continue as Lady of Langumont Keep.</p><p>Satisfaction settled over him as his thoughts wandered on to the pleasure of having the young and beautiful Maris in his bed. He\u2019d watched her follow the old lady into the village two days earlier. She\u2019d spent the better part of the afternoon in a tiny, filthy hut ministering to some peasants. They would be good partners\u2014she the figurehead, the beloved chatelaine, the healer, and he, the great lord, the meter of justice.</p><p>And in bed....His cock shifted with enthusiasm as he imagined her face slack with passion, her hazel eyes smoky with pleasure.</p><p>Verna felt him stir against her, and she lazily turned to look over her shoulder at him. \u201cMy lord, you are randy this morn,\u201d she murmured, pressing her buttocks into his erection.</p><p>He said nothing, but when his hand felt between her legs, he found her ready for him as well. Bon thrust into her from behind, catching her off guard. She writhed with pleasure, and he pounded himself inside Maris of Langumont over and over until he filled her with his seed.</p><p>\u201cSoon, my lady,\u201d he promised softly, knowing he must ride from the gates of Langumont Keep this day. But he would return. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>Merle Lareux sat opposite a stranger knight, listening to his story. The man, called Dirick de Arlande, had arrived at the keep early that morning. He\u2019d requested a private audience with him in the name of the king, and Merle had no choice but to take the time to meet with him.</p><p>He was glad he\u2019d done so.</p><p>Merle examined the figure standing confidently before him. The knight\u2019s black and blue standard, which he did not recognize, was a sword and shield on the backdrop of a roaring yellow flame, and the young man\u2019s figure was imposing yet unthreatening.</p><p>Merle felt himself being studied in return by a pair of cool grey eyes, and he sensed impatience and restlessness from the man. And, he thought, something else. Sorrow or grief.</p><p>\u201cTo account for my words,\u201d Dirick concluded his explanation, gesturing to the thick parchment packet he\u2019d just handed to his host, \u201cI bring a missive from his majesty.\u201d</p><p>Merle turned the parchment over in his hands, noting the red wax seal of his sovereign. The man before him was no mere royal messenger. Breaking the seal and unfolding the creased missive, he perused the king\u2019s words carefully.</p><p>\u201cThe king speaks highly of you, Sir Dirick,\u201d he said, refolding the parchment. Something niggled at the back of his mind, and it took a moment before he realized what it was. And then...ah. \u201cYou are Dirick of Derkland\u2014Harold\u2019s son? You are using a different name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be aware that I came upon your father\u2019s death scene.\u201d Merle tightened his fingers on the parchment, remembering the depravity pervading the glen where he\u2019d found Harold\u2019s mutilated body. It was like nothing he\u2019d ever seen, even on the worst battlefield. A maniac had been there...and even as Merle attempted to see if there were any survivors, he felt the weight of evil suffocating the small, still glen. His eyes burned with tears a hardened man such as he would be loathe to shed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that your father is dead, and in such a manner. It was unconscionable. Whoever did such a deed is surely already in hell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dirick replied, his gray eyes still somber with grief.</p><p>\u201cThe king writes that you are in search your father\u2019s murderer,\u201d Merle continued, gesturing with the parchment. \u201cI would be happy to be of assistance in any way I can.\u201d His offer was sincere, although he did not have any urge to relive the experience of coming upon that bloody scene.</p><p>Dirick nodded briefly, and now there was an element of rage flickering behind the grief. \u201cAlthough it must be difficult for you, my lord, I should like to know every detail of what you found.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Merle replied. \u201cAnd it can be no more difficult for me to recount it than for you to hear of it. Again, I am sorry...and even more so for having to tell you what I will.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly to pull the scene back into his memory, and then began to describe how he\u2019d come upon Derkland. \u201cWe traveled along the border of Maitland and the king\u2019s forest\u2014 my man-at-arms, Raymond, my squires, and several other arms bearing men rode with me. \u2019Twas late in the day, near twilight, and we were weary, seeking Maitland Keep for the night. As we rode, a shrill, horrible cry met my ears. It was the cry of a horse in pain. My mount reacted as if he himself was in danger; but once given his head, he thrashed through the brush to the glen.\u201d Merle swallowed as he remembered the heavy stench of blood that filled his nostrils before he even saw the horror there.</p><p>As if sensing his host needed a moment to collect himself, Dirick took a drink from his wine. \u201cThere were no survivors?\u201d he asked after he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cNay. We put the horse out of her misery\u2014she had three broken legs and was tied to a tree. I\u2019ve never seen such carnage. And such torture.\u201d Merle\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201c\u2019Twas a waste and a travesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father?\u201d</p> <p>Merle took a deep breath, recalling the last time he\u2019d seen Lord Harold hale and hearty. \u201cI would it had not been anyone, but particularly your father. I had met him on two occasions, and he was a very fine man. We talked of betrothing your elder brother to my Maris, but alas, it was not to be. Maris and Bernard did not suit. However, your father did favor the match.\u201d</p><p>He sipped to moisten his parched throat and continued his description of the scene. \u201cYour father was dead from stab wounds, yet the bastard had slit his throat as well. Very little blood drenched the ground, so it appeared clear he was dead when his throat was cut. And then...\u201d He rubbed his temples with a forefinger and thumb. \u201cI saw the imprint of a horse\u2019s hoof in the back of your father\u2019s neck. The force appeared to have snapped his spine, and was so strong that it drove his severed neck into the ground. And,\u201d Merle swallowed hard, for this was the worst part. \u201cHis face was pulled back to face the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the hand of God,\u201d Dirick murmured.</p><p>Merle looked over and saw that his guest\u2019s handsome face had turned dark and stony, and he wished yet again that he had never come upon such a sight. But there was more. \u201cYour father was not alone. He was arranged opposite another man, their hands joined at the wrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy God, I will find the monster.\u201d His vow was soft and hard. \u201cFor my father to die unshriven...in such an unspeakable manner....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, he was not unshriven, lad,\u201d Merle told him. \u201cA priest was in my party and gave last rites to your father and his companions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPraise God for that, at the least,\u201d Dirick said quietly. \u201cIs there aught else, anything that will help in my quest?\u201d</p><p>Merle was silent for a moment. \u201cI can think of nothing. The men were divested of any coin and weapons they might have carried and some horses were missing...yet, I believe it was no mere robbery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay. Slaughter is more like. God help the man who did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI questioned the nearby villages for news of a roaming party of bandits, but either they were too frightened to tell me, or they saw no one. That is all I can tell you, I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>Dirick nodded, and at that moment, there was a knock on the door of Merle\u2019s private chamber.</p><p>\u201cAye, enter,\u201d he called.</p><p>The door opened and a page entered, bearing a folded parchment. \u201cMy lord, this arrived by messenger. He was told not to await your reply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Merle took the missive, and, glancing at the seal, smiled in satisfaction. \u201cAh, good.\u201d The paper crackled as he opened it to read.</p> <p>Dirick was torn between banishing the images of his father\u2019s murder from his mind and mulling over them in hopes of finding some answer in the details, somehow. As Lord Merle closed the document, Dirick returned his attention from taking in the details of the small, wood furnished room. \u201cGood news is always well come,\u201d he said with a nod toward the letter.</p><p>\u201cAye, indeed. \u2019Tis a message from the man with whom I hope to betrothe Maris,\u201d the man explained. \u201cHe and his father Lord d\u2019Arcy should arrive within a se\u2019ennight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope to betrothe?\u201d he repeated, wondering what it was about the woman that kept his brother, and, obviously, numerous other suitors, from laying claim to her many lands through her hand. Dirick was curious in spite of himself. Mayhap she was impossibly ugly\u2014still, few men would turn away the chance to hold as many lands as the Lord of Langumont regardless of what the woman looked like. Or perhaps she was yet still too young. Although it wasn\u2019t uncommon for a girl of eight or nine to be betrothed and then wed when she was fifteen or sixteen.</p><p>\u201cMaris is rather unusual,\u201d Merle said with an indulgent smile. \u201cShe is seventeen summers, and to date I haven\u2019t found a suitable man for her. But \u2019tis nearly done\u2014just the papers need to be signed upon Victor d\u2019Arcy\u2019s arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnusual?\u201d Was she ugly, or deformed in some way...or, perhaps, mad? No wonder Bernard had not \u201csuited\u201d with the woman. His wife Joanna was lovely in both form and character, and they had been wed only a bit longer than a year.</p><p>Merle dismissed Dirick\u2019s question about Lady Maris, saying instead, \u201cYou will join us at the high table for dinner this night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Yet, my lord, I must ask that outside of this chamber, I\u2019m merely Dirick de Arlande\u2014lately come from France. I\u2019m not a man of the king, but I am an itinerant knight in search of work. I have another mission for his majesty that involves the fief of Breakston. Neither of us wish for Baron de Savrille to know of my identity before I arrive there.\u201d</p><p>Merle nodded. \u201cThe king is watching Bon de Savrille? I\u2019ve long suspected he might have other allegiances. He was to provide men and to be at my side in Wales. He showed himself for a mere three days, kept to himself, and eventually left his men to return to Breakston. He left word that he had problems at home that called him back. Methinks the man is merely a coward, yet, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised were he to turn up as a supporter of the Welsh uprisings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your permission, I won\u2019t leave immediately for Breakston. I intend to be sure he\u2019s in residence before I make the journey, and \u2019twould do me some good to be nearby if you remember anything else about my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, of course\u2014stay as long as you like. Shall I put some work your way to help your tale and keep your mind and body occupied?\u201d</p><p>Dirick smiled. \u201cAye, thank you, my lord. I\u2019ll sit at table with you this evening and be most pleased to make the acquaintance of your daughter.\u201d Dirick imagined telling Bernard of his meal with the lady who had rejected his suit.</p><p>That could be most interesting, and entertaining as well.</p><p>Early that morning when she heard that a man had arrived to see her father, Maris made her escape from the keep. Wishing to put off meeting her betrothed, she grabbed two apples and a hunk of cheese and went out to the village. There were several people she should visit, including Thomas the cooper and his wife, and she wanted to gather the last of the bruisewort leaves from her garden. It was her intention to be scarce for the entire day.</p><p>And so it was nearing dusk when she finally returned to the keep. Managing to avoid her father, mother, and probable suitor, she sneaked up the huge stone steps that led to the women\u2019s quarters above the great hall. Verna was awaiting Maris in the chamber, ready to help her dress for dinner.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis late, my lady. My lord will soon be voicing his displeasure if you miss a third evening meal,\u201d Verna commented as she helped Maris out of her work tunic.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Maris\u2019s teeth chattered as she stood in the chill room clothed only in her shift. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a reason to miss this meal as I have the last two. Nay, I think the gold bliaut, Verna.\u201d</p><p>Her maid dutifully pulled the gold colored undertunic from her lady\u2019s wardrobe. It was shot through with gilt thread, making the tight fitting garment look like the ocean under a sunny sky. Verna laced it tightly up the sides, then turned back to the trunks.</p><p>\u201cThe green tunic, my lady?\u201d she asked, pulling out an overgarment trimmed with gold thread.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Maris would dress her finest for a man she should detest who sat below, waiting to slather all over her hand and her lands. Despite her curiosity, knowing that Verna would certainly have heard the gossip about the man whom her father had chosen for her, Maris deigned to ask anything about him.</p><p>She would learn aught soon enough.</p><p>Verna pulled the long, loose fitting tunic over Maris\u2019s head. There were no sides to the tunic, merely a hole for her head with a deep neckline to show off the golden bliaut underneath. A gold girdle wrought in the shape of loose flowers and leaves cinched the tunic at her waist.</p><p>Maris was strangely nervous at the thought of descending the stairs to dinner. She knew that her father\u2019s mind had been made up, and the man she was to marry awaited her below. As much as she might abhor the idea of marriage, Maris had come to realize that it was for the good of Langumont that she must wed ...and that it would do her little benefit to anger her father by rebuffing her intended betrothed.</p><p>There was no time to redo her hair, so Verna left it in the heavy plait that hung down her back. Flyaway wisps of rich, chestnut brown had sprung from the braid, framing her face. Verna tucked them under the sheer, gold shot wimple that was draped over her mistress\u2019s head and neck. A thin-filigreed headdress held the wimple in place, and Maris was dressed for dinner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She inched her way along the hall and toward the steps that would bring her to her father\u2019s table for dinner. Reluctantly, she started down the stairs, enjoying her vantage point of the hall.</p><p>The familiar sounds of preparation for the evening meal drifted up to her. Serfs bustled about, men-at-arms pulled the long trestle tables together and settled benches along each one. Female serfs stood aside, ready with trenchers and crudely carved wooden cups to place on the tables. The three dogs that were allowed in the hall slept next to the fire, knowing that their scraps would come much later. Maris allowed those three hounds in the hall only because they were her father\u2019s favorite hunting dogs\u2014or had been before one was blinded, one lost a leg, and the third got so old he couldn\u2019t run any longer.</p><p>A group of men-at-arms sat in front of the blazing fire. Some were engrossed in games of chess or chance and others were drinking ale and sharing jests. Still others were flirting with the female serfs hoping to find one to share their bed, no doubt.</p> <p>Maris\u2019s feet brought her closer to the bottom of the stairs\u2014directly across the room from her father\u2019s table. She wove her way carefully between the tables, serfs, and men-at-arms toward the dais. As soon as the dais came into full view, she saw that her father was engrossed in conversation with a man who was undoubtedly her unwanted suitor.</p><p>Her stomach gave a little lurch of disappointment. It had to be the man Papa was expecting. Her betrothed. Praise God, at least he seemed close to her in age, and he had all of his hair. If she were truly fortunate, he\u2019d be in possession of a full set of teeth as well. And even sitting next to her broad-shouldered father, the guest was solid and imposing.</p><p>Maris straightened her shoulders, lifted her chin, and drew a deep, steadying breath. She had no choice in the matter, so \u2019twas best that she begin this on her own terms: strong and with confidence.</p><p>Just then, the dark-haired man looked up, directly at her, and in that horrible instant, she recognized him.</p><p>The man who\u2019d nearly run her down last night.</p> <p>From his seat at the high table, Dirick was struggling with the same shock and chagrin that was reflected in the woman\u2019s face\u2014albeit briefly. For, no sooner had their eyes met than the surprise disappeared from her expression.</p><p>Thus, he attempted to talk himself out of it\u2014perhaps he\u2019d imagined the flash of recognition there. There was the faulty light in the hall, and the distance...surely she wasn\u2019t the woman from last night. The one whom he\u2019d nearly trampled, insulted and then propositioned?</p><p>He\u2019d lost track of what he\u2019d been saying to Lord Merle and as she made her way closer to the dais, he found it impossible to look away. Whether it was because of the young woman\u2019s beauty\u2014which was undeniable, even from half across the hall\u2014or because it was as if an impending doom was coming his way like a rolling black storm, Dirick wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>She seemed to sparkle gold: from the gossamer veil on her head to the long, wrist length sleeves of her gown. As she drew closer, he scrutinized her closely\u2014absentmindedly rejoining the conversation with Merle as he held onto the rapidly disintegrating hope that he was mistaken. But, no, the nearer she came the clearer his error was. A warm flush began to settle over Dirick\u2019s features as he recalled the rude and angry words he\u2019d shouted at her the night before. The fact that he\u2019d nearly flattened her.</p><p>His next question\u2014who was she?\u2014was soon answered, but not before he privately agonized over whether he\u2019d insulted his lord\u2019s wife, his mistress, or\u2014God help him\u2014the daughter, Maris.</p><p>When she reached the dais, her gaze flitted over him with impersonal coolness before settling on her father.</p> <p>\u201cAh, my love,\u201d Merle stood to take her hand. His affection for her was evident in the tone of his voice as well as the gleam in his eyes.</p><p>That Dirick even more uncomfortable. He rose stiffly beside his host, trying desperately to think of something to say in defense of his actions. After all, what the hell had a noble lady been doing dressed in peasant clothes, wandering through the town alone\u2014in the middle of the night?</p><p>Then the thought struck him. Mayhap she no more wished for Dirick to acknowledge their meeting than he did. What had she been doing out in the night alone?</p><p>\u201cSir Dirick de Arlande, may I present you with my daughter, Maris Lareux, Lady of Langumont,\u201d Merle said.</p><p>His daughter. God\u2019s teeth, of all the women he could have accosted....</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a pleasure, my lady,\u201d he managed to say, pressing a light kiss to her fingertips, wondering what on earth had possessed Bernard to reject the beautiful creature standing before him. He noticed the stains and scratches on what should have been a lily white hand with interest and wondered what she did other than embroidery.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Sir Dirick,\u201d she said steadily.</p><p>Her refusal to meet his gaze fueled Dirick\u2019s suspicion that she wished to ignore their previous meeting and he relaxed slightly.</p> <p>As she took a seat on the far side of her father, Merle said, \u201cSir Dirick is lately arrived from France\u2014Paris, I believe. I knew his father quite well, and he\u2019ll be staying with us for some time.\u201d</p><p>Lady Allegra, Merle\u2019s wife, arrived at that moment. Dirick was immediately struck by the difference between the two women who now sat at the high table. Other than the same sensual shape to their mouths and a similar creamy complexion, \u2019twas hard to recognize that they were mother and daughter.</p><p>While the lady of the manor was certainly beautiful, it was in a soft, almost faded way that was only partly due to her age. Her daughter, however, sparkled not only through her choice of clothing and jewels, but also in her eyes and countenance. She was vibrant whilst her mother was soft-spoken and demure.</p><p>Dirick shared a bread trencher with Lady Allegra, and as his mind raced, he occupied his hands by serving her as elegantly as the fine courtier he was. No sooner had she sipped from her wine than he refilled it. Her meat was cut swiftly into bite sized chunks with the knife that he kept at his waist. She had the choicest pieces of bread, the sweetest smelling pieces of fish. And she had charming, lightly flirtatious conversation\u2014something at which Dirick was highly skilled.</p><p>He didn\u2019t realize until near halfway through the meal that he\u2019d been holding his breath, waiting to hear the roar of fury from Merle as Maris told him of their encounter. When it didn\u2019t come, he began to relax and enjoy Allegra\u2019s company. Though she didn\u2019t talk much, she asked several questions and giggled like a girl at his jests. Her eyes lit up a bit then, and she ceased looking quite as faded as he\u2019d previously thought.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis said the king will cross the channel to deal with Geoffrey now that Christ\u2019s Mass has passed,\u201d Merle said to Dirick as one of the pages brought a new platter, this one with stuffed turbot.</p><p>Dirick nodded, chewing his bread slowly. While he had to take care what he said\u2014after all, he was newly come from Paris, not from the king\u2019s side at Westminster\u2014much of what they spoke of would only be heard between the four of them. Neither of the ladies would take much from his words, so he needn\u2019t be overly cautious.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he replied. \u201cI hear that Geoffrey is stocking his estates for war\u2014claiming that Old King Henry meant for his son to relinquish Anjou to Geoffrey when he succeeded the throne of England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatilda is still at Westminster with Henry?\u201d asked Merle.</p><p>\u201cAye. \u2019Twas she that kept him from heading off to Ireland to conquer the lands for his brother William. With Geoffrey stirring the pot in Anjou, the king has trouble enough across the channel that he doesn\u2019t need to make more war here. The rumors are that the queen\u2019s vassals do not much like him either.\u201d</p><p>Merle tsked into his cup of wine as he took a long draught. \u201cThe king has his hands full,\u201d he said, wiping his mouth with the back of a hand. \u201cBut he is a man who loves his war and action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. And whilst Aquitaine seethes for her mistress, Eleanor, Anjou is about to be gobbled up by Geoffrey.\u201d Dirick wiped his hands on a damp cloth proffered by a page. \u201cAnd the queen is enceinte once again,\u201d he offered in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cThen she will not accompany her husband across the channel?\u201d asked Maris, leaning around her father to look at him.</p><p>Dirick started, assuming that his conversation had been between himself and Merle, but he recovered quickly. \u201cNay, lady. She stays at Westminster\u2014so the rumors say\u2014because of her condition.\u201d</p><p>Maris quirked her eyebrow in a most becoming manner. \u201cIt might be worthwhile for the king if her majesty visited Aquitaine if \u2019tis in such an uproar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad as that...and Henry has enough problems with Geoffrey in Anjou. The king will cross the channel and leave Richard of Luci as official administrator of England. But the queen will still be here.\u201d</p><p>Maris made a soft sound of comprehension. \u201cThe king might appoint Luci officially, yet the queen is certain to hold her own. She will be the one truly in control.\u201d</p><p>Dirick almost choked on a chunk of bread, taken by surprise at her grasp of the situation, and her accurate assessment. Women didn\u2019t talk politics\u2014at least, women other than Matilda and Eleanor\u2014and they were queens, for God\u2019s sake. \u201cAye, my lady, I do believe you are correct. The queen stands back to none but her husband.\u201d</p><p>Turning back to Merle, Dirick asked, \u201cHow fares the king\u2019s chancellor? \u2019Tis said he takes the court by storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Thomas \u00e0 Becket is the king\u2019s friend as well as his chancellor. To think that it was the Archbishop who forced Henry to take him on as chancellor...now the two are nearly inseparable,\u201d Merle replied.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis said the chancellor holds court rather than the king,\u201d Maris interjected. \u201cThe king goes to Becket\u2019s court, rather than the chancellor coming to his. Even the diplomats attend Becket, rather than the queen\u2014which I cannot imagine she appreciates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I would not expect it thus,\u201d Dirick said. He cast a brief glance at his host, wondering whether the man was merely indulgent of his daughter\u2019s vocal tendencies, or whether he encouraged it. And he wondered where Maris got her information\u2014by listening in on such conversations, or from her father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or mayhap from whomever she was meeting in the village a night.</p><p>All at once, Lady Maris didn\u2019t seem quite as na\u00efve and innocent as one might think.</p><p>\u201cBecket dresses in all frippery and serves the most gluttonous meals,\u201d Maris continued. \u201c\u2019Tis said the king even rode his horse into Becket\u2019s hall one evening for dinner!\u201d</p> <p>She paused to wipe daintily at her mouth, and Dirick\u2019s attention followed her hand as it brushed over a pair of full, pink lips. He found his eyes caught there for a moment and his mouth went dry.</p><p>A surprise heat swept over him at the thought of tasting that sensual mouth\u2014despite the fact that it hardly seemed to cease speaking. Tearing his eyes away while focusing on that wry thought, Dirick turned to his trencher and took a long swallow of wine. He had obviously been too long without a woman\u2014a state he would rectify tonight. Until then, he would he would firmly steer his thoughts away from the daughter of his host.</p><p>\u201cMaris, do you not carry tales,\u201d Merle was admonishing her good naturedly.</p><p>\u201cAye, Papa,\u201d she conceded with a smile. \u201cThough \u2019twas only yourself who told me the same story last night.\u201d</p><p>Merle chuckled and changed the subject, continuing to speak to his daughter\u2014which gave Dirick a moment to redirect his base thoughts from the lovely woman sitting next to her father. \u201cHow fare the cooper\u2019s wife and babes?\u201d Merle asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe woman is a bit weak, for she has lost much blood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe babes thrive, and I\u2019ve sent Bernice, the smith\u2019s daughter, to wet nurse for them whilst Thomas\u2019s wife recovers. Her own babe died this se\u2019ennight past, and she was glad to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaris has the gift of healing and she spends much of her time in the village, caring for the people,\u201d Merle explained to their guest.</p><p>\u201cThe cooper\u2019s wife bore two babes?\u201d Dirick asked, keeping his attention upon her hazel eyes instead of allowing it to drop lower.</p><p>\u201cAye. Both hale and hearty boys, though it was a horrific birthing,\u201d she replied. \u201cShe was nearly lost herself and will have a long recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done all you can for the cooper, and with the smith\u2019s daughter to keep the babes, verily the mill will continue to function. I will visit him on the morrow to express my own felicitations,\u201d Merle said as the last platters were cleared from the high table.</p><p>Dirick remembered how much it meant for him when his lord showed sympathy for his recent loss, and his admiration for Merle Lareux grew, knowing that he would do the same for a lowly peasant. Then all at once, a great yawn surprised him, nearly cracking his jaw with its violence. Dirick muffled it with a large hand and said, \u201cPardon, ladies, \u2019tis not your company which wearies me. I\u2019d a long journey, and the day was even longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Merle agreed. \u201cMaris, will you not show Sir Dirick where the men-at-arms lay their pallets? And any other comforts he may need? Come, Allegra, let us go abovestairs.\u201d</p><p>Maris stood reluctantly, dismay by her father\u2019s innocent command. The last thing she wanted was to be alone with this man. She\u2019d felt his attention returning to her again and again during the evening, and had been unable to ignore the interest in his stare. Try as she might, she\u2019d been unable to keep her mouth closed and her mind on her food\u2014as her mother had admonished her many a time. Nay, if the man was to wed her, he\u2019d know from the beginning that she had her own thoughts and opinions, and an interest in the world beyond Langumont\u2019s walls.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Papa,\u201d she said in a voice that disguised her discomfort.</p><p>Obviously, Sir Dirick did not miss her mislike of the situation, for as soon as Merle and Allegra were out of earshot, he said, \u201cLady Maris, I am perfectly able to find my own pallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, \u2019tis my father\u2019s wish. I should not put a guest out,\u201d she smiled at him, swallowing the resentment she felt for being pressed into a marriage she did not want. In all honesty, it was not this man\u2019s fault\u2014and he seemed pleasant enough now that he was not ahorse. \u201cHave you bathed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he shook his head, surprise flashing in his gray-blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cMay I offer you a warm bath before I direct you to your pallet?\u201d she asked. \u201cGustave will bring the water. I won\u2019t take long, and you will soon be for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Those eyes turned on her with a sudden intensity, and he looked at her for a moment, a very faint smile hovering at the corners of his mouth.</p> <p>Maris\u2019s throat went dry and she nearly stepped away from him and the unexpected stirrings in her middle. The sudden image of this man, devoid of his chausses and tunic, settled into a tub that would hardly fit his large body, filled her mind. His dark hair, which now curled wildly about his face and jaw, would be sleek and dripping, his broad shoulders bare and steam rising from dark skin\u2014</p><p>Maris bit her lip as her cheeks flushed with warmth. What was wrong with her? She\u2019d never had such lewd thoughts over such a mundane chore. \u201cAye, of course,\u201d she managed to say in response to the question she\u2019d nearly forgotten.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Sir Dirick rumbled after what seemed like forever. His smooth, low voice carried easily to her ears, even over the noise of the servants as they cleared off the tables and stacked the benches. \u201cI do not believe I should put myself through such torture.\u201d</p><p>Her heart in her throat and her mind whirling\u2014unsure as to what he meant by such a comment\u2014Maris spun away to hide her discomfiture. \u201cThen if you would follow me,\u201d she murmured and blindly began to make her way between the nearly empty tables, anxious to be rid of her charge.</p><p>As they approached a group of rowdy knights, Maris paused, resting her hand on the shoulder of a burly, red headed one. They quieted almost as if she\u2019d commanded it. \u201cSir Raymond, how fares your shoulder? Is the pain lessening?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s face nearly matched the color of his hair when he turned it up to look at her. \u201cAye, my lady. The pain is nearly gone.\u201d He moved his arm as if to demonstrate.</p><p>\u201cYou will come to the herbary on the morrow and I will check it again,\u201d she ordered. It wouldn\u2019t do for her father\u2019s best man to have an injured arm. \u201cThe last I dressed a wound for you, \u2019twas only once that you came to me\u2014and look what has happened to it because of your carelessness!\u201d</p><p>He grinned up at her, \u201cAye, my lady. On the morrow, I will allow you to torture me yet again. \u2019Tis only because your touch is so sweet that I can sit through the pain,\u201d he teased in the manner of a big brother.</p><p>Maris, who\u2019d grown up with Raymond pulling at her pigtails and chasing her through the keep with spiders, planted hands on her hips as the other men laughed. \u201cAye, and you should keep such sweetness on your tongue, or I will put you through more tortures if you spread tales. Did I not warn you that some day you would pay for the frog in my bed?\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a hint of guile in her actions, Dirick thought as he watched. She had no concept of what she did to a man, with those teasing golden green eyes and vibrant smile\u2014particularly the redheaded knight, whose besotted expression was not quite brotherly. Whatever reason she\u2019d been in the village at night, it hadn\u2019t been for a tryst\u2014he was now certain of it.</p><p>Dirick\u2019s skin still prickled at the memory of her innocent offer to bathe him, and he wondered if her father knew she\u2019d made such a gesture. A sudden streak of heat shot through him at the thought of her scratched and stained hands soaping his body...but he thrust the thought away immediately. He\u2019d do well to find a woman this night. Mayhaps one of the maidservants would oblige him.</p><p>Not for the first time that evening, he wondered why he\u2019d heard nothing of the beautiful heiress of Langumont\u2014from either his brother or the court. Certainly a well landed maid as comely as Maris Lareux wouldn\u2019t escape the notice of the unmarried, land-greedy barons at court.</p><p>Lady Maris\u2019s voice broke into Dirick\u2019s thoughts as she led him around into the area reserved for the men-at-arms and other important visitors. It was a large room, cordoned off from the rest of the hall by a heavy oaken door\u2014much nicer than many of the men\u2019s quarters he\u2019d slept in throughout England and France. A fire roared in the corner, and a serf slumped against the wall, snoring, with a stack of wood within reach.</p><p>\u201cYou may place your pallet anywhere you like, Sir Dirick,\u201d Maris offered. She handed him a pile of blankets, more than generous enough to keep one warm\u2014especially with a blazing fire in the same room.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lady,\u201d he took the bundle.</p><p>She paused for a moment as if contemplating her next words, and when she spoke, a small grin tickled the corner of her enticing mouth.</p><p>Her words, however, when they came, eliminated any hint of innocence. \u201cPapa bade me see to your comforts. If your need is as great as \u2019twas yestereve, I will send a woman to you.\u201d</p><p>Dirick felt his face flush hot as he ground his teeth together in an attempt to maintain his dignity. Words escaped him, and before he could gather his wits, the little minx took his silence for dissent and whirled away down the dark corridor.</p><p>He could only stare after her, trying to decide whether he wanted to murder her or kiss her.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Maris dressed without Verna\u2019s assistance the next morning. She\u2019d wakened earlier than usual and found too many thoughts trundling through her mind to make more sleep likely, so she rose. It was a frigid morn, and the sun had not even begun to peek over the edge of the earth to warm it.</p><p>Down the stone steps she went, breezing through the hall where several men-at-arms were sprawled in a corner. Obviously, they\u2019d not made it to the knights\u2019 quarters where she\u2019d left a dumfounded Sir Dirick the night before.</p><p>A bemused smile quirked her face at the memory of his shocked expression, and, engrossed as she was, Maris misstepped and trod upon the cat\u2019s tail. The tabby emitted a yowl of protest (the sotted men still did not stir) and the feline stalked off through the matted rushes, refusing to accept Maris\u2019s apologies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tsked at herself, fearing that the cat\u2019s reaction was merely a foreshadowing of what her father would say if he heard of her unladylike gibe at Sir Dirick. She couldn\u2019t keep from glancing again toward the common sleeping area, where he was likely sprawled out on his pallet.</p><p>For a moment, she imagined his thick dark hair tufted and curling where he rested his head, his pleasing face lax and smooth in his rest. Mayhap an arm would be thrown out, away from his blanketed body...or a leg might be lying atop the woolen blanket whilst the rest of him slumbered in comfort. His disturbing grey-blue eyes would be closed in sleep\u2014those eyes that looked at her with such intensity that her heart dodged about in her chest. Yet, when they were not focused on her, she\u2019d noticed that they were a soft, cloud like grey, flecked with blue. The color of Langumont Bay on a winter day, and fringed with the longest, darkest lashes she\u2019d ever seen, or noticed, on a man.</p><p>Maris started, realizing in confusion that she had paused in the hall and stood, staring toward the sleeping area as these thoughts danced through her mind. Though no one was about to see her actions, her cheeks warmed and she turned resolutely away. Although there was no harm in mooning over one\u2019s betrothed, she had balked against marriage for so long that it felt odd for her to relish the thought of knowing all aspects of a man\u2019s body. Maris gathered up her heavy wool tunic and draped it over her arm as she stepped over an up ended bench.</p> <p>The kitchen was deserted except for Bit, the daughter of the cook, who slept in the corner on empty flour sacks. One large blue eye opened as Maris approached, and a yawn cracked across the pudgy, dirty face.</p><p>\u201cMilady!\u201d she started awake and jerked to her feet.</p><p>\u201cGo back to your bed, Bit,\u201d Maris told her. \u201c\u2019Tis well before matins, and all are sleeping soundly but myself and the cat.\u201d</p><p>She turned to root about in an apple barrel, and, finding a barely bruised one, she polished it against the soft blue wool still draped over her wrist. She broke her fast with a piece of day old bread, found wrapped in cloth under a board, and a large swallow of watered down ale.</p><p>She made her way out into the bitter morning, crunching the apple. It was nearly as dark as the night she\u2019d trudged home from Thomas the cooper\u2019s wretched home. Stars lit the dark blue heavens, and a large moon still hung in their midst. Despite the cold, Maris stopped for a moment to look up. She drew her squirrel lined cloak tighter about her shoulders as she stood in the center of the silent bailey. The only other creatures stirring were her father\u2019s midnight watch, posted on the north and south walls of the bailey. Sir Richard, on the north wall, saw Maris and waved in greeting and recognition.</p> <p>She waved back, and, finishing the last of her apple, pocketed the core for Hickory. A shiver took her by surprise, and she hurried on her way to the stable where the presence of the horses would make it warm.</p><p>It was indeed warmer in the old building, but much darker. It took a moment for her eyes to adjust, but then she could just make out the moving grey shapes of the horses. Maris clicked her tongue hello and moved down the length of the stable to where her mare nickered in greeting.</p><p>She buried her hands in Hickory\u2019s warm brown mane, to warm them as much as to say hello. Stroking the mare\u2019s neck, she spoke soothingly to her as the horse poked her velvety nose into the folds of Maris\u2019s cloak. Her mistress never visited without a treat, and the rest of her apple was discovered and quickly munched down.</p><p>\u201cHow is your leg?\u201d Maris asked her friend softly, kneeling in the stall. She pushed the hood of her cloak back from her face and ran sure hands along Hickory\u2019s foreleg. The mare didn\u2019t wince, and she unwrapped the bindings to find the swelling nearly gone.</p><p>\u201cAh, you are feeling much better,\u201d she crooned. \u201cWe\u2019ll be off to hunt the wild boar on the morrow, sweet Hickory,\u201d Maris whispered as she stood to caress the velvety nose that bumped her head. \u201cWe\u2019ll tear the beastie into little pieces, aye, will we not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what says your father of this plan to snare the wild boar?\u201d The voice behind startled her and she whirled about, heart lodging in her throat.</p> <p>\u201cSir Dirick, that was not very nice,\u201d she told him indignantly as she tried to slow her thumping heart. \u201cI could have been talking about you!\u201d</p><p>He gave a short laugh. \u201cAnd mayhap it would have served me right if you had,\u201d he said with better humor than she\u2019d expected.</p><p>Awakened much too early by the terrible, haunting dreams of his father\u2019s death, Dirick had been in the corner of the hall and seen Maris slip from the keep in her brilliant blue cloak. Looking for an excuse to escape from the darkness of those dreams, Dirick had taken the opportunity to follow her.</p><p>He must spend another day or two at Langumont while he waited for word as to whether Bon de Savrille was in Breakston, and Dirick intended to keep his mind and body occupied so that he didn\u2019t fall into the despair of grief and anger over his need to find Father\u2019s murderer. Lord Merle had promised him some training to keep his body active, and the puzzle of his daughter would serve to intrigue his mind. Soon, he would be on his way on the king\u2019s business...and then to his own matters.</p><p>\u201cIt seems much too early for a lady to be about her business, whatever that may be,\u201d Dirick commented, squinting in the dim light.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut \u2019tis the quietest part of the day, and I wished to see about Hickory\u2019s foreleg.\u201d</p><p>It was starting to get lighter, and the dark grey shadows began to take on muted colors and details as they stood in the stable. Dirick could see that Maris\u2019s hair was uncovered, hanging in a fat braid over one shoulder. He felt a strange intimacy with her, seeing her hair. Although many maids at court had begun to disdain the covering wimples, it was obvious that in Merle\u2019s household they were standard ware, for both ladies had worn them last night. He couldn\u2019t tell what color Maris\u2019s braid was, though, and for some reason, he needed to know.</p><p>\u201cAnd the night?\u201d Dirick asked pointedly. \u201cIs that also a quiet time for a noble lady to go about her business?\u201d</p> <p>She had cocked her head like a falcon, as if trying to read the second meaning in his words. \u201cAye, there are times my tasks take me out in the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is it that brings the Lady of Langumont to walk the streets\u2014alone\u2014in the darkness?\u201d He held her gaze steadily in the dimness, determined to receive an answer as to what she\u2019d been doing on her own in the village in the middle of the night.</p><p>To his surprise, she laughed. \u201cAh, Sir Dirick, are you so protective of my reputation that you refuse to go to Papa with your evil suspicions? But of course you do not wish your betrothed to be seen wandering the streets at night\u2014at the least, if you do not know the reason why.\u201d Her hand came to rest lightly on his arm as she became serious. \u201cDo you not fear for my reputation, Sir Dirick. I but came from the bedside of the cooper\u2019s wife, after that long, difficult day of birthing her sons. I fear I was not in the best of tempers when you bore down on me.\u201d</p><p>The dawn broke over Dirick so that he almost missed the detail one of her comments. \u201cPlease accept my apologies for my rude behavior,\u201d he said with chagrin, then, as his mouth caught up with his brain, he repeated incredulously, \u201cBetrothed?\u201d</p><p>Maris had returned to stroking Hickory\u2019s nose, turning her back to him as if to hide her expression. \u201cAye, sir, \u2019tis not a secret that you are here to speak on my hand. \u2019Tis\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow came you by such a notion?\u201d Dirick exclaimed. To speak of a marriage contract only the day after meeting Lord Merle and his daughter was, to the least, embarrassingly rude. Beside that, marriage was the last thing on his mind\u2014he had no lands to bring a wife, nor any wish to be saddled with one woman when God had put so many beautiful ones on His earth. \u201cMy lady, \u2019tis not at all the purpose of my visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d Maris broke in, relief and mortification in her voice. \u201cI meant not to be\u2014I bethought you were the man to which Papa means to betrothe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour papa did say you are not yet betrothed,\u201d he told her, regaining his faculties. Now he recalled Lord Merle\u2019s missive from the day before, and the imminent arrival of the betrothal candidate. \u2019Twas an honest mistake on the lady\u2019s part.</p><p>\u201cNay, I am not yet betrothed, nor am I desirous of having my person bartered over,\u201d Maris replied tartly. She looked up at him, and he was surprised to be able to make out the shape and the flecks of green in her eyes now, in the dawning light. \u201cPapa has stopped urging me to find a man to my liking.\u201d Her face fell, and she returned to stroking Hickory\u2019s velvet nose, \u201cBecause I have not made a decision, he has chosen my husband.\u201d</p><p>Dirick was taken aback by her forthright opinions. Most maids were at the least betrothed by age fifteen, and a good majority of them wed, and before him stood a woman of more than seventeen summers calmly declaring she had not found a man to her liking and was unlikely to do so. It was unnatural.</p><p>Maris interrupted his thoughts. \u201cWhat, then, do you here at Langumont if not to look me over, check my teeth, and set a dower price?\u201d</p><p>Dirick managed to neither smile nor grimace at her words, which made the whole process sound callous. \u201cAs your father said last evening, I am lately come from Paris and travel through the area, looking to work for a lord such as your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d she asked, an odd tone in her voice. \u201cIt seems you have much knowledge of Henry\u2019s court for one come so newly from France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing Louis keeps many eyes on the court of the man who stole his wife,\u201d Dirick replied smoothly.</p><p>\u201cSuch beautiful horseflesh you have for an itinerant knight,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dirick looked at her, certain that the innocence in her voice was feigned, but unwilling to believe that she could be suspicious of him. What did a woman know of horseflesh? He decided to divert her attention. \u201cAye, I have an eye for good horseflesh...among other pleasures.\u201d</p><p>Maris flushed and turned away. \u201cDid you partake of such pleasures last night?\u201d she threw back without looking at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dirick was rendered momentarily speechless by her blunt question. \u201cLady Maris\u2014\u201d A noise behind drew his attention. \u201cWho goes there?\u201d he called, stepping in front of her with a sudden, graceful movement, hand going to the sword buckled at his waist.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis Peter the Marshal,\u201d replied a voice, matching Dirick\u2019s in warning. \u201cAn\u2019 who be ye?\u201d</p><p>Maris brushed past Dirick, and the scent of her, fresh and lemony, filled his nostrils as she stepped into the walkway. \u201cPeter, good morrow to you. Hickory\u2019s leg is near healed,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2019Tis Sir Dirick de Arlande with me,\u201d she explained as the stooped old man peered at Dirick over her shoulder. \u201cPeter has been Langumont\u2019s marshal for near three score years\u2014and his sons and grandsons after him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, I see\u2014you have the same look as the young man who took Nick\u2019s reins upon my arrival. He had a gentle touch with my stallion, a definite way with horses,\u201d Dirick replied.</p><p>Peter nodded with pleasure. \u201cAye, my lord, \u2019twas my oldest grandson, Percival. I vow, \u2019e \u2019as \u2019orseblood in \u2019is own veins!\u201d</p><p>Dirick chuckled, and his attention turned back to Maris when she knelt to show Peter the mare\u2019s foreleg. By now the stable was fairly light, and the shades of grey had turned to muted color. The fat braid that roused his curiosity had been flipped back over her shoulder when she stooped and he nearly reached out to touch its glossy darkness. Chestnut hair. Chestnut hair and green and gold flecked eyes and full pink lips.</p><p>Dirick jerked his thoughts back from where they skittered into impropriety just as Maris stood. They were nearly on top of each other. Her nose almost bumped his chest when she turned quickly and he took a step back, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>She ignored him. Peter had her full attention and her eyes snapped golden while her cheeks flushed pink as she explained the healing process of Hickory\u2019s leg as proudly as if the mare\u2019s steps were her own child\u2019s first ones.</p> <p>When at last the marshal turned to go about his business, Maris turned to Dirick. \u201cWell, sir, do you intend to stand there supporting the stable wall all the day? I assure you, my Papa would not allow any building on his lands to come to that state in which a well paid man should spend his time holding it up.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but grin at her saucy tongue. \u201cNay, lady. I but wait for you to finish trilling with the marshal and leave to go about your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrilling, indeed.\u201d She stamped her foot indignantly, and even in the soft dirt floor he could hear the thud.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s bones, lady, do you sound like my destrier when he seeks a mare in season.\u201d He cocked an eyebrow and widened his grin.</p><p>Maris turned in a swirl of cloak to stalk out of the stable. Dirick followed, hands clasped innocently behind his back. His long legs gave him the speed to catch up with her, and he stepped into her stride just as they came out of the stable. \u201cWhy do you nip at my heels like a starving pup?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI am interested, \u2019tis all,\u201d he said with all sincerity. \u201cI was intrigued by your story this morrow about the cooper and his wife...and your gift of healing.\u201d</p> <p>Maris stopped and turned to face him full in the bailey. A huge ball of the sun peered over the wall of the courtyard, and her resulting squint was most unladylike\u2014yet endearing\u2014as she looked up at him. \u201cInterested, you say?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAye. I know many noble ladies, and many well landed ones such as yourself, and I have yet to meet one who stays out till all hours of the night to midwife a cooper\u2019s woman. \u2019Tis true, my lady mother will see to the ills of her people, aye, and I\u2019ve met others that do the same\u2014but, all too often, \u2019tis only at their convenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople do not become ill to convenience their healers,\u201d Maris said with disdain, those full lips flattening. \u201c\u2019Twas near the first thing I was taught\u2014after which plant is deadly hemlock, of course,\u201d she smiled at him. Her nose was red with cold and her cheeks soon to follow and she looked quite lovely as she jested with him.</p><p>He grinned down at her, suddenly light hearted for the first time since he heard the news of his father. \u201cIt was, I\u2019m certain, an informative bit of knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, yet not as important as creating a draught to rid one of arrogant knights who tear down upon one like a demon in the dark of night,\u201d she said dryly, turning away and pulling up her hood to cover her shiny reddish-brown hair.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I would pay well the woman who could create a draught to whittle away the tartness of a particular Lady of Langumont. I vow, my mouth puckers less at the taste of a lemon than at her wit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dare to speak of my mother in such a manner?\u201d A little giggle escaped from her lips, and she looked up at him, her eyes dancing. \u201cI should toss you out on your ear for taking such liberties!\u201d</p><p>A thick strand of hair blew in her face and caught at the corner of her mouth. She brushed it away and sobered. \u201cIn truth, Sir Dirick, your sincere interest is unfamiliar to me. More oft than not, men of your ilk turn tail or the subject, rather than hear the extent of my duties at Langumont.\u201d She brushed her heavy cloak over her torso, \u201cAnd, now, \u2019tis well past time for me to tend to those duties. I have kept you from your own work long enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNay, my lady, you have kept me from naught,\u201d Dirick was quick to respond, tightening his hands deep in the warmth of his tunic. It was quite frigid on this side of the bailey, where the slightest breeze seemed to catch and swirl brazenly about.</p><p>Maris smiled. \u201cVery well, sir. But I am off to Mass and then about my duties.\u201d She turned to make her way toward Langumont\u2019s tiny chapel.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d He was in her footsteps as if pulled by a rope. She turned and he felt foolish. \u201cLady Maris, I do not know where the chapel is and I am in need of absolution,\u201d he said.</p><p>She gestured him forward, \u201cCome, then, to Mass and Father Abraham will see you after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady, and thank you.\u201d</p><p>Verna crept up the dim, cold steps that led to the upper chambers of the keep. The sounds of busyness from below drifted up to her keen ears. And though she listened for the sound of her mistress\u2019s voice, she knew that Lady Maris was gone about her work in the village and would not return for several hours.</p><p>On the floor above the great hall, several chambers were set into the tall stone walls. There was Lady Allegra\u2019s solar, where the seamstresses worked, the private chamber of the lord and lady, several smaller chambers for important guests, and, finally, Verna\u2019s destination.</p><p>Lady Maris\u2019s chamber was the last along the narrow, dimly lit hallway. Attached was an antechamber where Verna slept when she was not with a man, for Maris did not require that she attend her every night as Lady Allegra would.</p><p>Verna passed silently through the small antechamber, skirting the small pallet piled generously with three pillows and an array of blankets, and opened the heavy door into the main chamber.</p><p>A large bed sat in one corner, its curtains drawn back to show a thick fur coverlet and many more pillows than Verna\u2019s meager pallet. To the left of the bed, along the wall, was the narrow slit of a window\u2014just wide enough to pass a hand through. A second window was staggered at the other end of the room. Both slits were covered with heavy tapestries to keep the harsh winter from entering the chamber.</p><p>A fireplace carved itself into the corner opposite the windows, and a small blaze crackled within. One of Verna\u2019s many tasks each night was to build the sparks to a roar just as her mistress mounted the steps to her chamber. A large trunk rested at the foot of the bed, and a second one acted as a table near the fireplace. A stool and a straight backed chair completed the room\u2019s furnishings.</p><p>Verna padded across the chamber, her feet rustling through the soft rushes that covered the stone floor. She poked briefly at the fire, adding two small logs to the protesting flames, then turned to the trunk at the foot of the bed.</p><p>Kneeling, she raised the lid of the heavy wooden trunk. Inside mounded piles of silks and velvets, wools and linens of the brightest colors and the most intricate embroideries. She passed a hand slowly over them, crushing an emerald silk bliaut in her fingers. A strange curl twisted her mouth and she stood, pulling the bliaut with her. It fell in a cascade of silk to her feet. She knew the green would complement her pale blonde hair and catlike green eyes.</p><p>For a moment, she stood thus, smoothing the silk down the front of her body, imagining how she would look garbed in the riches of Lady Maris of Langumont. Then, the twist of her mouth deepening, she carefully refolded the garment and replaced it in the trunk.</p><p>Now Verna dug carefully through the piles of clothing to the very bottom of the trunk and rummaged gingerly there. Holding a candle close to the shadowy depths, she peered into the depths of the fabric, mindful of dripping wax, and at last extracted the object of her search.</p><p>It was a headdress, woven of cloth of gold that often confined Lady Maris\u2019s thick locks during the summer months. Verna examined the snood closely in the candlelight and was pleased to find several strands of rich brown hair trapped in the intricacies of the headdress. With a small sound of satisfaction, she folded the cloth carefully and pushed it up into her sleeve.</p><p>Maris had an audience as she peeled the dressing off Raymond of Vermille\u2019s shoulder. Her father\u2019s squires watched closely, hoping for a sign of the gore they\u2019d been told they\u2019d see. Unfortunately for them\u2014and quite happily for Sir Raymond\u2014the green pus that had oozed from his wound a mere two days earlier was gone, and the swelling had decreased greatly.</p><p>\u201cSee you, Sir Raymond,\u201d she began for what seemed the hundredth time, but in this case, with the intent of teaching the young boys as well, \u201cit is no great feat to keep soil from an open cut and \u2019tis much easier on the skin, so it heals nicely. If you keep mashing dirt and wool and lice from your tunic into the wound, it swells greatly as the humors grow.\u201d She was finishing with a clean wrap around his shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy thanks, my lady,\u201d Raymond told her, winking at the squires.</p><p>\u201cI saw that,\u201d she remonstrated, pulling the binding tighter. At his exaggerated grunt of pain, she released it slightly. \u201cIf you do not listen to me, Sir Raymond, and cease your jesting, you\u2019ll soon be without your sword arm.\u201d Then she smiled and patted his good shoulder, \u201cBut if you listen to my commands, you\u2019ll be wielding a lance in a week\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you my lady,\u201d he said again, this time seriously.</p> <p>She urged him off the stool on which he\u2019d perched. \u201cOn the next you ride with Papa, I will send some of my green salve with you to put on a cut such as this until you are home for me to treat.\u201d</p><p>She gathered up the rest of her medicines, packing some dried leaves and berries into a pouch to carry in her basket. \u201cOff with you before cook puts you to work,\u201d she said, shooing the young boys out of the herbary.</p><p>Outside, the air was just as brittle as it had been early that morning. The sun was so bright that Maris found herself blinded at the change from the darker chamber, and walked full faced into a warm body.</p><p>\u201cDo you not watch where you are going?\u201d came a deep, amused voice. \u201cLady Maris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Dirick,\u201d she was beginning to make out shapes now. She looked up where his face would be and her eyes immediately watered from the brightness of the sun. Blinking the tears back, she looked back down and saw his scuffed brown boots in the compressed snow of the bailey. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it was so dark in the herbary and the sun is so magnificently bright, I could not see for a moment. I trust your confession was well received?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cAye, my lady, and well deserved, also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you manage to obtain absolution for all your great sins?\u201d she teased.</p><p>This time he laughed. \u201cAye, but for that I had to work a bit harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. I hadn\u2019t expected to see you emerge from the chapel so quickly,\u201d she returned, now able to look up at the face that blocked the sun. \u201cFather Abraham is not known for his simple penances\u2014and with a confession such as yours, I should think you\u2019d be saying paternosters until Judgment Day and selling your fine Nick to pay for all your pardons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, lady, my penance is much heavier than you could think.\u201d His eyes twinkled like the brilliant snow, \u201cFather Abraham bade me accompany a headstrong lady healer on her visits to keep her from getting trampled under the hooves of any more horses.\u201d Before she could react, he relieved her arm of the herb filled basket and asked, \u201cAnd since I myself have nearly been flattened by a lady healer, \u2019tis fitting that I take up my penance now. Where are you off to, Lady Maris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not have aught to do but dog along my footsteps?\u201d she asked, yet unable to keep back a smile. \u201cDoes not Papa have work for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, lady, \u2019twas he who sent me to find you\u2014and ensure that you are back to the keep for this evening\u2019s meal. He says you have missed too many suppers as of late. Now, again, where are we off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo visit the cooper,\u201d she told him automatically. Her father had sent a strange knight to be her chaperone? A chaperone in Langumont?</p><p>\u201cAh, the cooper.\u201d Dirick sobered, \u201cHave you heard any news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay. Widow Maggie\u2014the village healer\u2014would have sent to me if there were cause for concern. Yet, I still wish to see how the babes fare, and see that the smith\u2019s daughter is still wet nursing them.\u201d</p><p>They trudged along the well packed snow through the gate of the bailey, over the drawbridge and into Langumont Village. Dirick watched in amazement as Maris greeted every person they encountered, by name and in their simple English language. She even ventured into the smoky, dark houses to see to a child with the ague, or show a woman how to make a draught for pain. Well accustomed to accepting the hospitality of the peasants that dwelled on his father\u2019s lands, Dirick was still quite surprised at the ease with which Lady Maris did the same.</p><p>He plodded along in her wake as a mere fixture to the lord\u2019s daughter. This was the first he\u2019d seen of Langumont Village in the light of day, and he took note of its condition with a watchful eye.</p><p>There was one main throughway that led up to the iron portcullis of the bailey of Langumont Keep, and ran through the length of the generous village. Small structures of roughly hewn logs lined the road. The homes of the villagers were topped with thick thatching, and curls of smoke drifted up from crude chimneys. Most structures had at least one small window that was covered with well greased linen to keep the wind out while letting the light in. All of the doors seemed sturdy enough that they wouldn\u2019t blow open in even the fiercest wind.</p><p>Dirick noted a smithy, a weaver, a baker, a prosperous looking silversmith, the inn he\u2019d lodged in two nights earlier, and various other merchants and workshops. He picked out a butcher and a shoemaker, and his nose eventually pointed out the mart where the fishermen brought their wares from the nearby Langumont Bay. Outside of the village, he knew, were acres and acres of farmland\u2014some belonging to the villagers, but a good portion belonging to Merle Lareux. Those fields were worked in turn by the villeins to produce the barrels and barrels of food that fed the lord\u2019s household and its guests.</p> <p>As he noted the prosperity of the village, Dirick could not help a twinge of envy. Such would never be his, he knew.</p><p>He was destined to a life of travel and war, with no lands or title of his own. Though he was well regarded by the king\u2014even so well thought of as to be Henry\u2019s confidante and advisor\u2014the most he could expect or even aspire to was the fortune of marrying an unimportant heiress with a single fief. He would pay fealty to a liege lord with a great many lands, such as Merle of Langumont...or, mayhap, even Dirick himself might be awarded the position of castellan at a small fief such as Cleonis or Firmain.</p><p>As a youngest son, such was his fate\u2014and \u2019twould only be altered should Bernard die without issue. And even in his deepest heart, in his most private thoughts, Dirick did not wish for that to come to pass.</p><p>He had ever known that this would be his destiny...and never before had he questioned it. Dirick turned a covert glance onto the woman who walked next to him, suddenly forced to subdue a pang of regret. The man who was to wed her was fortunate indeed, and not merely because of the lands he would obtain.</p><p>Dirick returned his thoughts to the scenery and peasants as they continued through the village. At last they reached a structure near the south side of the village. A man whom Dirick assumed was the cooper greeted them at the door, his face full of hope.</p><p>But as soon as he saw the scene within, Dirick knew the man\u2019s hope was truly misplaced.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Propelled by dismay and anger, Maris brushed past Dirick, pushing her way into the hut. Contrary to her previous commands, the windows had been resheathed, and old smoke clung to the air. Two babies squalled in the corner, and the woman was eerily silent.</p><p>\u201cUncover the windows,\u201d Maris snapped, moving quickly to the bedside of the patient. Widow Maggie, who had been tending to the mother with a damp cloth on her forehead, stepped away, looking abashed at her lady\u2019s entrance.</p><p>\u201cBut, my lady, the leech said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeech?\u201d she exclaimed, turning on Maggie. \u201cWhat said the leech?\u201d</p><p>Quailing at his lady\u2019s anger, Thomas nevertheless spoke haltingly. \u201cThe leech said the humors need darkness and heat from the fire. He said Mary\u2019s blood must be let to rid her of the poison that draws her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d Maris clenched her fingers to keep from screaming in frustration. Maggie knew that as far as Maris was concerned, leeches should be banned from the village of Langumont. But there were many in the village who believed in the ways of the leeches.</p><p>Offering a swift prayer to the heavens, Maris threw back the blankets to reveal the pitiful figure of Mary, seeing immediately that it was too late. There was too much blood, and it still flowed freely, bright red and fresh. \u201cGood Venny says leeches have little use\u2014and oft cause more damage! God\u2019s teeth, what have you done?\u201d This last she managed to keep to a hiss of despair, knowing that the cooper had acted in fear and ignorance.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Twas Thomas, my lady,\u201d Maggie whispered. \u201cShe bled the night through, and he didn\u2019t know what to do. We didn\u2019t wish to spoil your Christ\u2019s Mass celebration now that the lord has returned. The leech promised to save her.\u201d</p><p>Maris looked at the terrified cooper and swallowed her anger as well as she could. He could not have known\u2014leeches were famous for promising the moon if they were paid enough. She noticed that Dirick, who\u2019d followed her inside, had moved quickly to tear the heavy, cloying blankets from the windows. Oiled cloth covered the openings, and he made a slit in the top of one near the fire so that the smoke would wend its way out of the hut.</p><p>Grateful for his help, she transferred her gaze to the seven black slugs that sucked away the lifeblood of her patient. \u201cRemove the leeches,\u201d she told Maggie shortly, then turned to Thomas. \u201cLeeches do not come into Langumont Village. I do not know how he came, but if you see this man again, you will send for me immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lady,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMy lady, my Mary...will she...?\u201d</p><p>Maris spared a look at the grey faced woman, and her fears were confirmed. She hadn\u2019t stirred since her arrival. Blood soaked the bed beneath her as the leeches drew even more from her arms and legs. \u201cI will do all I can, but likely \u2019twill not be enough.\u201d</p><p>The babies were screaming in the corner. \u201cWhere is the smith\u2019s daughter?\u201d Maris asked, gritting her teeth at the sound.</p><p>\u201cShe went home this morrow,\u201d Thomas told her, his hands wringing in front of him. \u201cThe leech thought Mary would suckle the babes this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFetch her,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cShe is not to leave until I say.\u201d</p><p>Thomas scurried for the door as Maggie pulled the last reluctant leech from the woman\u2019s flesh. Again, Maris noted out of the corner of her eye that Dirick had moved silently to where the babes lay. Suddenly, silence reigned and she breathed a deep sigh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She worked quickly to mix a paste from dried yarrow to press over the open wounds from the slugs, and ordered Maggie about to steep a decoction of peppermint and clove to dribble down the woman\u2019s throat.</p><p>Maris lost track of time. She vaguely remembered Thomas returning with Bernice, the smith\u2019s daughter, and hardly took note of when Dirick stepped over to assist her or Maggie. The silence that hovered as she worked became monotonous and hung like death over the small, bleak house.</p><p>Time blurred. Maggie brewed a draught from herbs meant to ease the pain, and Maris helped her choke it down Mary\u2019s parched throat. The woman breathed ever so slowly. Her hands remained cold and clammy while her face suffused with heat. Soft groans of pain emitted from her dried and cracked lips. The other women bathed her and found too much blood still coming from between her legs.</p> <p>At last, she had no choice. \u201cSir Dirick,\u201d Maris said as she turned to him, brushing the hair from her eyes. He looked down at her, comprehension in his face. \u201cGo you to seek Father Abraham.\u201d</p><p>Thomas\u2019s eyes widened, then his stare dropped to the dirt floor of the hut. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he whispered, moving to the bed to grasp his wife\u2019s lax hand.</p><p>Maris didn\u2019t know what time it was when Mary finally stopped breathing. With a muffled exclamation, she fell on the bed next to her patient, frantically feeling her chest for the beat of a heart, then put her cheek near Mary\u2019s mouth in hopes of feeling the soft, labored breath that had kept the woman alive. Nothing. She looked slowly up at Maggie, struggling to keep her tears in check.</p><p>Dirick arrived with the priest moments later. Maris stood wearily and stepped back from the bed to allow Father Abraham to shrive the woman. She leaned against the wall, passing a grimy hand over her cheek, and her gaze was caught by Dirick\u2019s. His face was grim and his eyes soft as they looked at her with admiration and regret.</p><p>She shook her head, turning away, feeling as though she\u2019d failed miserably\u2014and in front of him. Had she or Maggie been aware of Mary\u2019s condition before the leech was brought in, perhaps she could have prevented the bleeding that most assuredly cost her her life. The struggle to give birth to two large boys, and the subsequent loss of blood was simply exacerbated by the bloodletting.</p> <p>What does it matter now? she thought, wiping away a tear that suddenly appeared. She had done what she could and the woman had died.</p><p>Good Venny told her that when God called someone there was naught she could do to prevent that person from going. There would be many times when she would succeed, but she could not work against God\u2019s will.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twill be a hard lesson to learn, Maris,\u201d he\u2019d told her somberly. \u201cYou may learn it early, you may take years to learn it. But you must never question your gift of the ability to heal. You are blessed to be chosen, to save God\u2019s people when ill befalls them. Use your gift, but do not seek to play God.\u201d</p><p>She wished he were here now.</p><p>Tears of frustration welled in her eyes, and she blinked them back before Sir Dirick saw them. Plucking at Maggie\u2019s sleeve, she whispered, so as not to disturb the prayers of the priest, \u201cI must go.\u201d</p><p>With that, she slipped quickly from the hut.</p> <p>Dirick found her not far from the cooper\u2019s hovel, leaning against a tree, staring at the ground. He approached without speaking, knowing that the sound of his boots crunching through the icy snow would announce his presence.</p><p>Standing to the side, he took a moment to observe the woman, allowing his gaze the leisure of absorbing every detail. The hood of her brilliant blue cloak had fallen back, leaving her head bare and thick strands of rich brown hair fluttering in the breeze. Her nose and cheeks were red, whether from the chill or from weeping, he did not know. She stood motionless, like a tree herself, her chest rising and falling under the heavy cape.</p><p>Dirick felt something warm seep through his limbs, warming him even in the coldness. He\u2019d never seen a woman act so decisively, so magnificently in the face of such strife and danger. She\u2019d worked so hard to save the dying woman, and he had been able to do naught but stand back and watch. Doubtless she\u2019d known from the instant she stepped foot within that the woman would perish, but Maris had worked urgently to save her.</p><p>Even now, he could see the results of her efforts in a rusty streak of blood across her cheek, and the disheveled look of her hair and shiny dampness of her face. He had never seen a noblewoman look so unkempt...so work roughened...and yet, so noble.</p><p>It was no wonder her father adored her.</p><p>Maris turned suddenly, surprising him in his study of her. Her eyes were red rimmed and faintly bloodshot, and the tip of her nose quite scarlet. She looked at him with a mixture of resignation and embarrassment, and Dirick struggled to find something to say. Words of comfort usually sprang easily to his lips when he was faced with consoling a woman whose gown had been stained, or one whose feelings had been hurt by another...and all at once, those moments seemed as superficial as the veneer of ice over snow when faced with a woman such as Maris of Langumont.</p><p>\u201cYou have a great gift,\u201d he spoke finally, his words rough, rumbling from a throat tight with emotion.</p><p>She sighed. \u201c\u2019Twas not enough of a gift this day, I fear.\u201d</p> <p>She stepped away from the tree and started toward him. A tremulous smile quirked her mouth, and a small dimple echoed it in her chin. \u201cI have yet to learn, as my mentor tried to teach me, that despite many lives saved, there are others that I cannot turn from God\u2019s will.\u201d Her face saddened and her eyes took on a faint sheen. She blinked quickly and brusquely turned to pick up her pouch of medicinals, starting off toward the keep\u2019s walls.</p><p>Feeling clumsy and inarticulate, Dirick was moved to action. He took Maris\u2019s arm and gently propelled her so that she looked up at him. For a moment, he stilled, looking down into her beautiful face, streaked with tears and blood, her chin quivering as she valiantly tried to hold back her emotions. Her eyes seemed to beg for him to speak, and he groped mentally for something that would cause the pain to melt away.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis amazing to me, Lady Maris, that we men should spend our lives seeking war, when you should work so hard to save a simple life. The wars are fought for lands and riches, yet you would spend all of the day slaving to save the life of a simple peasant. It shames me, and at the same time, I\u2019m filled with admiration for you.\u201d</p><p>Snow drifted lightly down from a graying sky. Maris tilted her face up, catching one of the filigree flakes on her pink cheek, and blinked quickly. \u201cThank you, Sir Dirick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and I know the pain of losing a loved one,\u201d he added, his sensitivity allowing the grief of the loss of his father to bubble to the surface.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cPraise God, I cannot say the same. Though \u2019tis nearly as bad if a patient dies,\u201d she added. \u201cWas your loss recent?\u201d</p><p>He nodded but remained silent, looking at her and then needing to tear his eyes away. \u201cThe sun is lowering. We must return.\u201d</p><p>With a short nod, she slipped the strap of her pouch over her shoulder and gestured toward the river. \u201cI must find a bit of bearberry before we return,\u201d she told him apologetically. \u201c\u2019Tis for my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d With an effort, Dirick threw off the heaviness of grief and sobriety that had cast a pall over them and summoned a smile. \u201cLead on, my lady.\u201d</p><p>They were nearing the edge of the village and the huge stone wall of Langumont Keep loomed ahead of them when she stopped and crouched on the ground.</p><p>Dirick watched as she knelt to dig in the icy snow with a stick. Maris made a comely picture\u2014squatting near the snow, her deep blue cloak a swirl on the brilliant white, her dark head silhouetted against a nearby drift. Thick locks of hair had fallen from her braid during the day, and now light wisps of it blew about her face, dancing against a pink cheek and catching at the corner of her mouth. In the clear light of day, despite the waning sun, he could see that the color of her hair was a mixture of many shades of brown and rich with red, gold and topaz\u2014just as vibrant as she was.</p><p>When Maris looked up at him, she caught him by surprise and he blinked to recover his normal expression. She didn\u2019t seem to notice his besotted look, and she gestured to the patch where she\u2019d cleared away the snow.</p><p>\u201cLook you here,\u201d she pulled at his cloak, and he kneeled down next to her. Shiny, dark green leaves clustered under the snow, cluttered with dried leaves and branches. A few red berries still clung tenaciously to the sturdy mahogany stems, but she ignored those and began to pluck the leaves.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis called bearberry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Maris explained, stuffing the leaves into a leather pouch that she\u2019d pulled from the folds of her cloak. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder the leaves are still here under all this snow,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>Dirick started to pull some of the berries from the plant. \u201cNeed you the berries as well?\u201d he asked, proffering a small handful.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis only the leaves are good for steeping in a draught. They help fluids pass easily from the body. The berries are beautiful, but I know of no use for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see,\u201d he tossed the dark red berries onto the snow where they scattered like drops of blood.</p><p>He turned to clearing away more ice while she picked as many fresh leaves as they could find. Their heads were bent together and he was close enough that a light lock of her hair tossed daintily against his cheek. The fresh scent of lemon and another smell he could not identify reached his nose above the crisp cold of winter. It was so very different from the thick floral scents favored by the ladies at court.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis pretty,\u201d he said without thinking, sniffing lightly.</p><p>Maris turned and the smell became stronger. \u201cPardon?\u201d she asked, her green and gold eyes so close that he could count the thick lashes that framed them.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis lemons. I smell lemons and another scent,\u201d he said quickly, moving away from her.</p><p>Dirick felt her smile all the way to the pit of his stomach. \u201c\u2019Tis a soap for my hair,\u201d she told him, \u201cIt cleans it well and makes it smell fresh. Lemon verbena and mint and rosemary,\u201d she explained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI find it very unusual,\u201d he told her, trying not to be obvious as he sniffed again.</p><p>The tiny dimple on the left corner of her chin appeared. \u201cAh, Sir Dirick, \u2019tis quite the diplomat you are,\u201d she brushed the errant lock of hair behind her ear. \u201cI know \u2019tis unfashionable, as my mama tells me. I shouldn\u2019t smell of utilitarian herbs, and I should be embarrassed ere \u2019tis noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he told with a warm smile, \u201c\u2019tis but uncommon\u2014as you are, my lady. After all,\u201d he said, trying to ignore the heaviness singing through his veins, \u201cit has never happened before that a lady has me digging in the snows for shiny green leaves!\u201d</p> <p>Maris looked up at him so quickly that she almost lost her balance. \u201cMarry, Sir Dirick, I did not think...oh, what you must think that I have involved you in the tasks of an old midwife!\u201d The tinge of pink from the cold flared into a darker, rosy flush over her face. Obviously flustered, she began to struggle to her feet, but her cloak had become wrapped around her foot and she lost her balance, tilting backward into the damp snow.</p><p>\u201cNay, my lady, \u2019twas a jest!\u201d Dirick grasped her hand to help her regain her balance. \u201cAnd a poor one at that.\u201d He smiled as he faced Maris, squatting in the ankle deep snow as he steadied her by holding both of her hands.</p><p>Their faces were near each other, as near as they\u2019d ever been, and his breath misted in the chilling air. \u201cLady Maris,\u201d he said quietly, then was caught by her gaze. Her lips parted slightly and he felt the slight shift in her breathing. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure to be in your company all the day, throughout the time at the cooper\u2019s as much as assisting you in this simple task. \u2019Tis only as a compliment that I call you uncommon...and you are uncommonly beautiful as well.\u201d Those last words came as a surprise to him, and he found himself caught in a very warm, trusting, golden gaze.</p><p>Dirick swallowed heavily, knowing that he was going to kiss her and fearing that her reaction might be a heavy hand across his cheek. Pushing that aside, he tugged gently on her hands and she came forward\u2014easily\u2014and he met her lips halfway.</p><p>They were sweet lips...so sweet....</p> <p>His mouth was tentative at first, but when she didn\u2019t pull back, he pressed more firmly against her lips. They were chilled from the winter air, but melted warmly, softly against him. One of his hands freed her fingers and slid to cover the back of her head, digging into her braid. He fingered the thick rope of hair, touching its fat smoothness, his rough skin snagging it as he slid his hand down its length. A charge of desire swept through him with such force that he made a soft noise in the back of his throat, surprised, wanting more. The scent of lemon verbena and rosemary caught in his nostrils, mingling with the crispness of the cold air, dancing through his being with the nearness and the taste of Maris.</p><p>She was responsive, warm, taking him into her mouth and kissing him back with a passion he hadn\u2019t expected. He felt a tiny shiver race through her body and knew it was not the cold. Nevertheless, he slipped his mantle over her shoulders, pulling her closer and into his arms. She was small and delicate and he sighed, sliding his hands down her waist and over her hips.</p><p>At last\u2014though it seemed like hours, it was a mere few seconds\u2014Dirick regained his senses and pulled away quite suddenly. His breath was coming in faster, whiter puffs now and he forced himself to set her away from him. He was heavy and hard with arousal, and when she looked up at him with glazed hazel eyes and swollen pink lips, he nearly reached for her again.</p><p>Instead, he pulled away from the temptation, resting his hand against the smooth bark of a birch tree as if to keep it from doing any further damage. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he said, trying to speak coherently when all he wanted to do was pull her to him again, \u201cthat was unforgivable. I hope you will find it in your heart to allow my escort back to the keep. I\u2019ll return you to your father\u2019s care and you need not be bothered by my presence again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, Sir Dirick,\u201d she said, struggling to her feet with a dazed look on her face. \u201cHave no worries that I\u2019ll bring tales to my papa,\u201d she said, brushing two fingers lightly over her full mouth. \u201cI allowed you leave to kiss me only to have some questions of my own answered.\u201d</p><p>He quirked an eyebrow at her, ignoring the throbbing between his legs and trying to act as cool as she. \u201cAnd did you have your questions answered?\u201d he replied.</p> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d she breathed, still touching her mouth unconsciously, \u201caye, that I did.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>At dinner that evening, Maris avoided looking at Sir Dirick.</p><p>He sat on the far side of Merle, sharing a trencher with Lady Allegra. The two men, seated next to each other, were engrossed in conversation regarding the latest news that had come in from Westminster\u2014the king\u2019s call to arms for his battle to subdue Geoffrey of Anjou.</p><p>Though he sat away from her, and she couldn\u2019t see him unless she leaned around her father, Maris was as aware of Dirick\u2019s presence as if he\u2019d brushed against her. His hands, serving Allegra and himself, moved in and out of her view, and she found herself watching them, noticing their tanness, the short, clean fingernails, the molding of muscle and tendon and sprinkling of dark hair, the way the sleeve of his tunic fell back to expose a narrow, tanned wrist.</p><p>She heard him laugh\u2014a low, masculine, husky laugh that heightened her awareness of him. His conversation carried over the noise of the meal, collecting in her consciousness, as close to her as if he whispered in her ear. The cadence of his voice, rising and falling as he alternately admired and charmed Allegra, and debated and argued with Merle, was soothing and exciting and haunting.</p><p>A simple kiss...a simple kiss had made her as aware of him as she\u2019d become aware of herself.</p><p>Even now, her fingers trembled when she remembered the heat, the shock of pleasure that took her by surprise and made her body come alive. Warm, demanding lips and the hard strength of his body were enough to steal her breathing and pool desire into the center of her being.</p> <p>Even now, she felt the stirring of desire, the flutter of arousal in her middle.</p><p>The memory of his lips still burned on her mouth as she sipped from her wine. She wanted to taste him again. She wanted to know if the kiss they had shared could be duplicated, if it would be the same charge of energy should it happen again.</p><p>Casting a covert look in his direction, she saw him leaning flirtatiously toward her mother, a smirk curling his mouth, and realized suddenly, with a cold shock, that he was most likely well accustomed to kissing maidens in the wood. That knowledge settled in her middle like a large chunk of bread and she turned away to sip from her goblet.</p><p>It was her own doing, she reprimanded herself, for she had wanted to kiss him, and had known he wanted to kiss her when he helped to pull her to her feet. She\u2019d welcomed the chance to see if kissing was any better now that she was older than when her father\u2019s squire Raymond of Vermille had stolen a kiss from her years ago.</p><p>It was.</p><p>\u201cDaughter, are you ill?\u201d her father asked suddenly, turning his attention to her, and startling her from her own thoughts. \u201cYou are no louder than a mouse this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, Papa,\u201d she gave him a soft smile. \u201c\u2019Twas a long and wretched day, for I could not save the cooper\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>His face sobered. \u201cAh, aye, Father Abraham\u2019s servant sent word to me.\u201d</p><p>Maris pushed back the sadness that threatened to bring tears back to her eyes and replied, \u201cThere was naught I could do.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed a comforting hand over her arm. \u201cI know you did all you could, dearling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had a leech in!\u201d she said, her grief replaced by anger. \u201cIt was the cause of it, and still the villagers won\u2019t listen.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMaris, I know Venny taught you well, and he knows many things, but there are others\u2014leeches\u2014that know medicine as well. They are not always bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have yet to meet one that has not worsened the situation,\u201d she told him defiantly.</p><p>Her father tsked, for they had had this conversation many times. Obviously knowing that neither of them would win the argument, he said, \u201cI am sorry that she died. I will send three chickens to the cooper on the morrow, and visit on Justice Day. Is the smith\u2019s daughter still wet nursing the babes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. She will do a fine job, and mayhap the cooper and she will marry. She is of an age, and lost her own husband to the fever several moons ago.\u201d She flickered a glance at Dirick, who was mooning over her mother\u2019s slim hand, then looked back at her father. \u201cI\u2019ve brewed some fresh tea from the bearberry bush for you this night.\u201d She patted his arm lightly. \u201cI know you\u2019re in need of it, for Mama told me this morn in Mass. The leaves are fresh and the tea is strong. I\u2019ll have Verna bring it to your chamber when you retire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, dearling. Though I despise the taste of it, I cannot complain about the good your bearberry tea does for my pains. Have Verna bring it to me anon, and I vow I\u2019ll drink it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, Papa. I shall hold you to that vow,\u201d Maris said as she stood. \u201cI must see to Maisie\u2019s daughter, for she\u2019s not feeling well, and then I will brew your tea,\u201d she explained, carefully avoiding any more than a brief glance at Dirick. \u201cGood night, Sir Dirick, good night, Mama.\u201d She bent over to kiss her father on his cheek, then she turned to walk from the hall.</p><p>Dirick watched her go. He\u2019d spent the entire meal alternately cursing and congratulating himself for seizing the opportunity to taste those lovely lips. He was not an impulsive man when it came to women. He took his time, wooing and flattering, teasing and titillating a woman until she was like a ripe peach falling into his hand. There were plenty of willing women, ladies and whores alike, that made themselves available and giving him no cause to take chase. That was the way he preferred it.</p><p>Nevertheless, not only had he enjoyed his day at Maris\u2019s side, but he knew he would kiss her again\u2014betrothed or nay.</p><p>She had just disappeared into the kitchen and the hall was beginning to quiet down when the messenger made his appearance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most of the men-at-arms had retired from bawdy conversation and raucous story telling to the beds of whores, chess and dice games, or the night watch. Dirick himself was ready to find his own pallet when the seneschal approached Merle.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, a messenger at the gate brings tidings to our guest, Sir Dirick de Arlande.\u201d The man stood silently, waiting permission to call the messenger within.</p><p>All thoughts of sleep and of Lady Maris\u2019s luscious mouth fled Dirick\u2019s mind to be replaced by anxiety. The news must be bad indeed for a messenger to track him whilst on a secret mission for the king. Fresh from the experience of having news of his father\u2019s death brought in the same way, he was immediately concerned.</p> <p>Merle nodded his assent to the seneschal, who disappeared to retrieve the messenger. The moments that passed until his reappearance seemed an age to Dirick as he forced nonchalance, sipping more ale. At last the messenger appeared, and Dirick\u2019s concern was heightened when he recognized a man-at-arms of his brother Bernard, now the Lord of Derkland.</p><p>\u201cThe message I bear is best given in private,\u201d the messenger said as he approached the high table.</p><p>\u201cThen let us step to a private corner.\u201d Dirick stood, his mouth compressed and his middle roiling.</p><p>The man followed him to a dark, chilly corner of the room and Dirick rounded on him as soon as they were out of earshot of the others. \u201cWhat is the news, Sir Ivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Bernard sent me thus\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is well then? Bernard is well? Is it Thomas? Speak, man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, your brothers are well, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother! \u2019Tis not Mother?\u201d Dirick\u2019s body turned cold. Her grief over the loss of her husband had been deep and long. Had her broken heart weakened her?</p><p>\u201cNay, nay Sir Dirick\u2014all is well.\u201d The emphasis on these last words at last penetrated and Dirick\u2019s tension eased.</p><p>\u201cWell, man, you nearly affrighted me into an earlier grave than I should wish! What news is it that Bernard should send you to find me whilst on the king\u2019s business?\u201d He held his hand out for the missive.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis not writ,\u201d Ivan told him. \u201cLord Bernard didn\u2019t wish to chance the wrong eyes to see it and alert them of your assumed identity. He learned a story from a traveling knight who stopped at Derkland en route to the king. Upon hearing the details of your father\u2019s murder\u201d \u2014Ivan crossed himself\u2014 \u201cthis man, Samuel of Lederwyrth, told the tale of another murder thus.\u201d</p> <p>Ivan began to speak from memory, his eyes glazing over as he recited the message:</p><p>\u201cHe came upon a terrible sight near London, nearly two leagues south of the city. It was obviously the scene of a robbery. There were two men dead and picked bare of their valuables. Both lay on the ground, facedown, in the most odd position: with their arms positioned as if their hands had been joined or clasped as they died. One of the men, knights they were both\u201d \u2014Ivan crossed himself again\u2014 \u201chad been stabbed so as to leak blood for hours, and his throat cut. He was placed in the ground with his face in the dirt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his neck broken by the hoof of a horse, and his face pulled back so that his forehead touched the sky?\u201d Dirick felt his heavy meal surge in his stomach.</p><p>Ivan shook his head, his eyes coming into focus again. \u201cNay, though a there was the imprint of a horse\u2019s hoof deep in his back.\u201d</p><p>Dirick closed his eyes as the image of his father\u2019s similar fate swam into his memory. Nay, he hadn\u2019t been tortured by seeing it himself, but he could imagine it all too well.</p><p>\u201cMy lord Bernard bade me also tell you of the horse found on the scene. \u2019Twas a fine horse with two legs broken, and it was hobbled to a tree. The horse had died thus.\u201d Ivan\u2019s face mirrored the horror that Dirick felt\u2014but there was still more to tell. He drew forth a small bundle from the deepest folds of his cloak and offered it to Dirick. \u201cThe knight also showed Lord Bernard this, which was found embedded in a tree above the horse.\u201d</p><p>Dirick\u2019s hands trembled slightly as he held them out to catch the object rolling from the cloth.</p><p>The item was a wicked looking dagger. Dirick caught it easily in his hands, measuring the blade against the length of his hand from wrist to the tip of his longest finger.</p> <p>The blade was silver, and the tip had been nicked off so that instead of a perfect point, it ended in a jagged edge. The dagger\u2019s handle was wrought of silver filigreed roses intertwined with serpents, the blooms as true to life as the sharp thorns, as wicked as the slithering serpents. A small crystal was set in the end of the handle and it glittered in the light of the blazing fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen naught like this workmanship,\u201d he murmured, gazing at the dagger for a long moment. He turned it over and over in his hands as if willing it to speak. At last, looking up at Ivan he asked, \u201cWhat said my brother\u2014shall I send this back with you to go to the king?\u201d</p><p>Ivan shook his head, \u201cNay, my lord\u2014Lord Bernard wished you to keep the dagger if you thought it of use to you. The king bade him send it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Dirick wrapped the knife in its cloth and tucked it into his tunic. \u201cThis Samuel of Lederwyth\u2014where did he come from? I should like to speak with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hails from the southern lands\u2014near London. Lord Bernard sent word to the king, who ordered him to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Dirick was nodding. \u201cAye. This dagger will do me more good than his majesty, and mayhap soon I will have an identity to this mad killer now that we have something of his.\u201d He looked down at the elegant, murderous weapon.</p><p>A wave of rage flooded him and his determination to find his father\u2019s killer settled in the forefront of his mind.</p><p>Dirick suspected he would sleep ill this night.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>Verna pulled the mantle more closely about her face, pushing back the hank of hair that threatened to obscure her vision. She trudged through the drifts, stepping carefully over the branches of the deepest part of the forest bordering Langumont Village. Her burden was secured tightly at her waist with a heavy cord, and she patted it several times to assure herself of its continued presence.</p><p>After a very long walk, Verna at last came upon a tiny hut nearly hidden in the trees. She shivered, but, gathering her courage up with her wrap, she approached the hovel. The forest was deathly still. Even the birds were silent. She glanced over her shoulder, half expecting a red eyed wolf to be watching.</p><p>Something touched her leg through the long cloak that caught in the snow. Verna leapt back before she could catch herself, nearly tripping over a huge black cat.</p><p>It hissed at her, then eased through a crack into the hut as Verna stilled in frozen trepidation. Her eyes wide, she stared at the hut, wondering if the cat had been the old crone herself.</p><p>Her fears were justified when, moments later, without her even raising her hand to knock, the door swung silently open. No one was there. She didn\u2019t move except to clutch at the packet hanging from her side.</p><p>At last she took a hesitant step forward, and then another, until she could see into the dark, cavern like interior. The only light came from a blazing fire in the far corner.</p><p>\u201cAre ye comin\u2019 in er not?\u201d a voice suddenly shrieked.</p><p>Verna started, but was galvanized to move forward. \u201cDame Marthe,\u201d she whispered, crossing the threshold into the meager hovel.</p><p>Inside, she found a room filled with an assortment of tables and stools, and each stick of furniture was cluttered with crude wooden bowls and utensils. A heavy odor pervaded the room, and she saw what looked like the remains of several animals on a nearby table. The huge black cat was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>At first, Verna didn\u2019t see the tiny, wizened lady ensconsed in a corner chair. But when her eyes finally rested on Dame Marthe, they were held there by a cold, rheumy blue pair. The crone\u2019s face had more lines in it than a linen altar cloth, and her mouth was yet one more deep line. Spidery wrinkles radiated from the place her lips would be, and when she opened the lipless orifice to speak, Verna caught a glimpse of one stump of a tooth.</p><p>\u201cMy, my! A pretty lady has come to call!\u201d the hag cackled with poorly concealed distaste. \u201cAnd who might ye be?\u201d</p><p>Verna swallowed, but forced herself to speak with confidence. \u201cVerna of Langumont,\u201d she answered. \u201cLady of Langumont.\u201d</p><p>Overcome with mirth, Dame Marthe nearly fell off her rickety stool. \u201cLady of Langumont in a pig\u2019s eye, ye are!\u201d she returned harshly. \u201cYe\u2019re no more The Lady than I am the Blessed Virgin!\u201d</p><p>Verna nearly winced at the blasphemy. She\u2019d deviated too much to devote any thought to such mundane cares as blasphemes. \u201cI shall be Lady of Langumont, old woman\u2014my time will come. My time will come with help from you.\u201d</p><p>The hag contained her laughter; then her runny eyes narrowed. Mucus spilled out of them, running into the deep crevices in her cheeks. \u201cVerna, ye say? Verna of the miller, might ye be?\u201d</p><p>The maidservant nodded slowly, \u201cAye, dame. If you know of me...then you know of my plight. I have brought something to you. I am in need of assistance, old woman. You will be well rewarded upon completion of this deed.\u201d</p><p>She pulled from her waist a cloth wrapped package. With a swift flick of her wrist, she opened it and a cloth of gold snood tumbled onto the dirty table. \u201cAnd when we are through today,\u201d she looked expectantly at Dame Marthe, \u201cyou shall tell my future.\u201d</p><p>It was more than a se\u2019ennight past Christ\u2019s Mass and Lord Merle\u2019s return to Langumont. One afternoon, shortly after the midday meal, Merle sighed and adjusted himself in his chair.</p><p>Allegra looked up, wondering if his wound still pained him. \u201cHusband, may I pour thee more ale? Thy cup is near empty.\u201d She was seated in the chair next to him, working on her embroidery. The dais on which they sat was near the fire, yet not near enough to be well lit. Merle had had torches and candles on tall stands set about so that his wife did not have to strain her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAye, love, more ale. And mayhap some cheese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord husband.\u201d Allegra provided him with his wishes as he watched Maris and Dirick play a game of chess. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allegra didn\u2019t play chess; she found it too daunting to keep in mind all of the pieces and they way they marched across the board\u2014let alone planning one\u2019s moves several steps in advance. But based on the number of pieces collected on each side of the table, their daughter was giving the handsome knight a bit of a challenge in the game.</p><p>Just settling back in her chair, Allegra was startled by a quiet voice in her ear. \u201cMy lady Allegra.\u201d Turning, she found Maris\u2019s maidservant, Verna.</p><p>\u201cAye, Verna?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are needed in the kitchen,\u201d Verna whispered, tugging at her mistress\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI am needed in the kitchen?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>As they walked away from Merle, Verna spoke in a humble voice, \u201cAye, my lady, there is someone that has asked to speak with you. He did not wish Lord Merle to know of it.\u201d</p><p>Fear gripped Allegra\u2019s chest and she felt her heart thumping uncontrollably behind her ribs. She had hoped and prayed that Bon had forgotten his threat, or had given up when she had not responded.</p><p>In sooth, she had not had the courage to broach Merle on the subject of Maris\u2019s betrothed, for she could not fathom a solution to the problem. If Maris married as her husband wished, Bon would make good on his threat to expose her true parentage. But Allegra could not allow her daughter to wed with her own half uncle\u2014most especially to a man such as Bon de Savrille.</p> <p>Nor, did it seem, that she would be able to sway her husband in a decision he had already made. Only this evening had Merle commented that the man he awaited should arrive on the morrow, and the contracts would shortly be signed.</p><p>In despair, Allegra recalled the day of her own wedding and the private vow she\u2019d made that her daughter should never marry against her will. In all these years, Allegra had not forgotten Michael, nor had her love for the man she remembered dimmed.</p><p>Someday, she vowed, she would be with him again, or may God strike her dead. She had never grown to love Merle as she should. Although she\u2019d been a good wife to him, and served him well, she did not feel the passion and blind love that she still harbored for Lord Michael.</p><p>The maid stopped just near the kitchen door, gesturing to the entrance to the bailey. \u201cMy lady, the man awaits near the stables. I did not wish to alarm you in Lord Merle\u2019s presence.\u201d</p><p>The wind was cold and Allegra had not pulled a cloak around her. Her dread grew, causing her stomach to churn, and she forced herself to walk across the courtyard, head bent. She shivered and stumbled to the stables, aware that Verna was no longer in her wake.</p><p>Stepping hesitantly inside, she breathed a sigh at the inherent warmth from the building filled with whuffling horses. The stable was dark, but a shadowy figure stood near the rear.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d she asked in a quivery voice.</p><p>\u201cMy Lady Allegra,\u201d a slight man stepped forward so that she could make out the barest of his features. \u201cI bring you a token from my master.\u201d He reached out, and she stepped back in alarm. He was, however, too quick for her reaction, and his fingers closed around her hand. Something heavy was pressed into her palm, then he closed her fingers tightly around it. Metal pressed into her tender palm and Allegra cried out at the pain.</p><p>The man laughed and leaned forward. \u201cMy master insists that if you do not heed his warning, you will be in much more pain. Good eve, my lady.\u201d He pushed roughly past her and suddenly she was alone.</p><p>Allegra stumbled out of the dim stable moments later, still clutching the heavy metal object. The light of the moon led her through ankle deep snow to the chapel. Leaning on the heavy door, she nearly fell into the haven.</p><p>Candles flickered along the altar and at each corner of the chapel. Allegra slowly unfurled her clenched fingers. Even in the varying light, she was able to make out the markings on the heavy metal brooch. De Savrille.</p><p>If she\u2019d had any doubt that Bon still intended to marry her daughter, that doubt was now gone.</p><p>The next day was unusually fair for January. The sun glared high in the sky, and the serfs and men-at-arms disdained cloaks and gloves alike as they went about their business.</p><p>Merle was in the bailey watching his men practice their swordplay when the visitors arrived. Dirick, who had just put his own sword down, looked up curiously as Gustave approached.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d announced the seneschal, \u201cthe Lords d\u2019Arcy have identified themselves at the portcullis. I shall show them to the great hall, and have them take their ease, but you wished to be informed upon their arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gustave. Dirick, do you come with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you have much to discuss that does not concern me. Surely I can occupy myself until the evening meal so that I don\u2019t interrupt your business.\u201d Dirick wiped an arm across the sweat that trickled down his forehead, brushing his hair back in one slick motion.</p><p>\u201cNay, nay,\u201d Merle said heartily\u2014and so firmly that Dirick did not argue, \u201cCome with me and meet my dear friend and his son. At the least, they shall have news, for they come from south of London, and will bring the latest from there.\u201d</p><p>Merle led the way to the huge entrance of the keep, beckoning for Dirick to follow. Resigned, he pulled on his tunic and followed, wondering why Merle was so insistent that he meet his guests.</p><p>Inside the hall, Dirick sheathed his sword and rested it on one of the heavy oaken benches that lined a trestle table. Merle had already greeted the two men that were settled on stools in front of a blazing fire. Dirick approached, scrutinizing the Lords d\u2019Arcy.</p><p>The elder\u2014presumably the father\u2014was comfortably sprawled on a three legged stool on which he sat tilted so far that his back rested against a nearby table. Pale, wheat colored hair hung in a cap just to his ears, cut straight across his forehead, and looking like a silvered helm. Pale blue eyes darted quickly to Dirick as he approached, then to Merle, then back to Dirick.</p><p>The younger visitor was definitely related to the elder: he had the same pale blue eyes that were colorless as ice, and thin wheat colored hair hung raggedly to his shoulders. He was a fairly large man\u2014easily as tall as Dirick\u2014with a tanned, square face and full lips.</p><p>As Dirick extended his hand to the father, he felt the gaze of the younger d\u2019Arcy boring into him. An unaccountable sense of mislike swept over him and in a bald moment of self-recognition, Dirick understood why.</p><p>This man was to have Maris.</p><p>\u201cSir Dirick de Arlande, meet Lord Michael d\u2019Arcy of Gladwythe and his son, Sir Victor.\u201d</p><p>Dirick clasped the proffered wrist of Michael d\u2019Arcy, feeling a renewed trickle of unease at the strange light in his pale eyes. Had the man a fever, or was he merely tired from travel?</p><p>Then he turned to greet the son, hiding his reluctance and sudden dislike. \u201cSir Victor,\u201d he said, taking his time to observe the other man while he tried to place the familiar name.</p><p>\u201cSir Dirick de Arlande,\u201d mused Lord Michael, running a finger slowly over his full lower lip. \u201cI do not believe I have heard mention of you at court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Dirick\u2019s lips thinned in a cool smile, \u201c\u2019tis not likely, as I am lately come from Paris, and have not spent time in the court of your Plantagenet.\u201d His words carried the authentic French accent he\u2019d become accustomed to while serving the queen in Aquitaine. He was determined not to divulge his true relationship with the king and queen.</p><p>Merle stepped in. \u201cSir Dirick has pleaded succor during his journey through England. I have kept him quite busy at Langumont for the past fortnight.\u201d</p><p>Michael drank from a warmed goblet of wine, then, daintily wiping his lips and the tips of his fingers, glanced around the hall. \u201cAnd where might the fair Lady Maris be? I am keen to meet her. As, I am certain, is Victor.\u201d</p><p>Dirick accepted, and acknowledged, the little tic of annoyance at the reminder of the impending betrothal\u2014then ruthlessly dismissed it. Why should he waste any thought or concern that the man was to wed Maris of Langumont?</p><p>The lady was not hard on the eyes\u2014and quite delicious on the lips\u2014but Dirick had no further interest in her, even if he wished to wed. Aye, she was a fair chess player and quick of wit, but it was of no difference to Dirick. He had a task to complete, for both his king and his father\u2014and he\u2019d wasted more than enough time here at Langumont.</p><p>Just then, Merle called across the room, \u201cAllegra, wife, come attend our guests!\u201d</p><p>The frail woman had just entered the hall, likely having been drawn from her solar at the arrival of the honored guests. She glided across the rush strewn floor.</p><p>Merle reached out for her hand and drew her into the circle of men around the fire as she looked up. \u201cWife, do you meet Sir Victor d\u2019Arcy and his father, Lord Michael of Gladwythe.\u201d</p><p>Dirick\u2019s attention was on Allegra as she curtsied and nodded to her future son by law. She turned to Michael, and Dirick saw her eyes go wide, her mouth open in a silent gasp, and he watched as she crumpled slowly to the floor.</p><p>Instantly, the room was astir. Merle leapt to his feet, bellowing, staring down helplessly at the small heap at his feet. Michael\u2019s face had registered no shock, and, in fact, Dirick noticed that he was the calmest of the bunch, leaning forward to ease Allegra by loosening the ties of her bliaut.</p><p>By the time Dirick had taken in these jumbled facts, Widow Maggie and Maella had scurried to their mistress\u2019s side. The healer waved a small bouquet of herbs in front of Allegra\u2019s nose, and Dirick was gratified to see her stir.</p><p>Allegra\u2019s eyes fluttered open and her gaze rested upon the face that was nearest hers, one that was bent over her in concern.</p><p>Her lips moved and although he couldn\u2019t hear the syllables, Dirick read the word on her lips. Michael.</p><p>Michael D\u2019Arcy\u2019s name. Dirick felt a prickle of interest and foreboding, and glanced at Merle. But the elder man\u2019s face showed only concern as he assisted Lady Allegra to her feet.</p><p>\u201cAllegra, are you ill? Is there aught can be done?\u201d he was saying solicitously.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d she replied. \u201cNay, my lord, I\u2014\u2019twas just a spell of dizziness.\u201d She drew a shuddering breath and pulled herself to her full height, stiltedly keeping her eyes from Lord Michael. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The maid, Maella, had a stricken look on her face, and Widow Maggie was pressing a steaming draught upon her lady. \u201cShall I call for Lady Maris to attend our guests?\u201d asked Maella.</p><p>\u201cNay. Nay,\u201d Allegra forced herself to sound calm, forced the spots that danced before her eyes to disappear. She could not bring Maris into this mess until she thought how to handle it. \u201cMaris is in the Village,\u201d she explained, \u201cAnd the ache in my head has gone.\u201d She made a smile of her lips, and bravely turned to look at Michael.</p><p>Oh, God, it\u2019s Michael. After so many years, how have You delivered him to me?</p> <p>\u201cMay I offer my lord to bathe?\u201d she said, trying not to sound too eager. \u201cYou are likely weary from your long journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, a bath would be more than I could hope for!\u201d</p><p>Allegra remembered their other guest and turned to the younger man. \u201cI cannot attend thee myself, Sir Victor, but a bath will be prepared for you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twould be most welcome. Mayhaps Lady Maris could attend me,\u201d Victor suggested.</p><p>Merle spoke. \u201cMaris is in the village, tending to the sick. I\u2019ve sent a man at arms to fetch her, but likely she will not return until the evening meal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Victor replied, his disappointment obvious.</p><p>But Allegra gave little care to young man\u2019s discomfort. One of the maids could see to him; there were plenty who would do. She had only one thought in her mind, and that was of Michael.</p><p>Here. Now.</p><p>Praying that her face didn\u2019t show the high color that heated it, and that her husband had noticed nothing untoward, she led their guest out of the great hall to one of the large guest chambers.</p><p>Moments later, they were alone except for the serfs, bringing buckets upon buckets of steaming water for his bath.</p><p>Allegra could not stop her fingers from shaking as she unlaced Michael\u2019s cross garters. She had to force her attention to the task, else her fingers would travel up the curve of his calves to relearn their strength.</p> <p>To touch him.</p><p>How can this be? How can this be? Her mind chanted the phrase, echoing the incredulity that swept through her each time she looked at the man she had pined for, fantasized about, and begged God for since marrying Lord Merle more than seventeen years ago. How could he come here, be here...and plan to marry his son to his own daughter?</p><p>Allegra tamped back the panic and instead centered her thoughts on the fact that he had finally come to her. That he was here.</p><p>For of course. Michael did not know that Maris was his daughter. She\u2019d tell him and then all would be well. And then, mayhap she could find some way to suggest Bon as a husband.... Nay. That she could not do. There would be another solution.</p><p>Michael would see to it.</p><p>A maidservant bustled about the small chamber, laying out a tunic and hose from Merle\u2019s trunks to clothe Michael after his bath. Boys from the kitchen came and went with buckets of steaming water. Maella sprinkled dried lavender over the filling tub. The room was busy and crowded, so much so that it played upon Allegra\u2019s nerves and it was all she could do to keep from screaming at them all to leave...to leave her alone with Michael.</p><p>\u201cMaella, go you to see that Verna has found the other tub and is serving Sir Victor,\u201d she said at last, uncaring of the shrewd look her maidservant flashed at her.</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady.\u201d Maella reluctantly turned to leave, glancing at the two other maidservants who still assisted her mistress.</p> <p>No sooner had Maella brushed out the doorway than Allegra found other contrived excuses to send the remaining servants away...and at last she found herself alone with Michael.</p><p>He rested comfortably in the tub that had been fashioned to hold a body as large as Merle\u2019s, eyes closed restfully. A wad of soft linen propped his neck up from the rough wooden edge of the oval tub. Allegra knelt, folding his tunic, and watched as steam rose from the water. His fine blond hair was plastered to his neck, and the fine features she\u2019d never forgotten were flushed with the heat. He breathed easily, and she allowed herself the luxury of remembering the warmth of his smooth, muscular chest.</p><p>As she watched, one ice blue eye slowly opened and his gaze rested knowingly upon her. \u201cAt last,\u201d he murmured as a smile quirked his generous mouth. \u201cI\u2019d given up hope that we should be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Allegra breathed, clasping her hands in her lap to keep from stroking a thick lock of hair from his forehead.</p><p>His eyes, both fully opened now, greedily looked over his former lover. She knew she was still a very beautiful woman, and when he shifted in the tub, turning slightly to the side she was gratified that his response to her was as obvious and immediate as it had been eighteen years ago. \u201cYou\u2019ve not changed much at all, Allegra,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNor have thee.\u201d Her chest swelled with love and affection, making it quite difficult to breathe.</p><p>\u201cCome, soap my back,\u201d he invited, and sat fully upright.</p><p>Allegra\u2019s hands trembled as she drew a fine linen cloth from the water and over the large expanse of his back. There were more scars that marred its golden surface, and the ridges of muscle that she remembered were not as pronounced. But it was Michael.</p><p>The strong lye soap that was usually used for bathing had been replaced by one of Maris\u2019s specialties: a rosemary basil scented soap. Its minty smell pervaded the air, accented by the steam rising from the scented bathwater. Michael eased back into the tub so that Allegra could massage his hair with the same soap. And when he closed his eyes, she wanted nothing more than to lean over and press a kiss to his lips.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak to him until she was nearly done scrubbing his body. Relearning every area, finding every new scar and marking.</p><p>At last she broke the silence. \u201cMichael, did you\u2014did you not know that Merle is my husband? Did you not know whence you came that I would be here?\u201d</p><p>He stood at that moment, water cascading down the length of his slim, wiry body. Allegra\u2019s breath caught in her throat, and she turned quickly to retrieve a cloth that had been warming by the fire. As he stepped onto a thick wool rug in front of the fireplace, he spoke, \u201cAye, my love, I\u2019d hoped to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Her hands, wrapped in the towel, smoothed over his legs and upward to his buttocks. She could not think, could not make sense of what he was doing here....</p><p>When she reached his chest, she caressed his shoulders with the towel. \u201cAllegra,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She tilted her head up and his arms suddenly wrapped around her waist, pulling her up against his body as he lowered his mouth to hers. With a moan of relief, she dropped the towel and found herself in his embrace. His damp body pressed into her bliaut and left marks at her breasts and thighs, and his arms slid into a taut band around her waist.</p><p>She\u2019d felt nothing like this in her years of marriage to Merle. Aye, he\u2019d been patient and slow when he thought she was a virgin, and, aye, he\u2019d been tender with her and passionate during the nights they coupled...but he\u2019d not been able to spark her insides as Michael had ever done.</p><p>His hands were on her breasts now, and his mouth left a moist trail on her neck. She felt his need pulsing against her thigh, and her hand slipped to touch him. Suddenly, they were on the floor in front of the fireplace, and she felt his hands moving up her legs. Michael\u2019s weight pressed her head back onto the floor as he kissed her thoroughly. She was raising her hips to him even as he pushed her bliaut up to take two handfuls of bare breast and bring a nipple to his mouth. Allegra nearly screamed at the pleasure of it, her breath coming in small little pants.</p><p>At last. At last.</p><p>At the urging of his wicked fingers, she spread her legs and suddenly he filled her as he\u2019d done eighteen years earlier. He breathed her name as his fingers threaded through the mass of curls that was her hair. Allegra raked her fingers down the length of his back, gouging his skin when she felt him climax, shuddering against her.</p><p>Tears shimmered in her eyes when they opened as he pulled away to sit up moments later. \u201cMichael...I have missed thee so,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a chance to answer, for at that moment Maella burst into the room, stopping short at the sight that greeted her. Allegra had rolled to her knees as Michael left her body, but her hair and clothing were disheveled and there were wet marks on her bliaut.</p><p>\u201cAye, Maella?\u201d Allegra asked sharply to hide her guilt. She hadn\u2019t thought to bolt the door, it had all happened so quickly. Her lips tight, she struggled to her feet. Knowing that her maidservant was loyal to her above all gave her the courage to act as if nothing had happened.</p><p>\u201cMy lord Merle wishes to see you in the hall,\u201d her servant told her pointedly. \u201cHe bade me finish bathing Lord d\u2019Arcy and send you to speak with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord Michael\u2019s tunic and hose rest by the fire,\u201d Allegra said with as much grace as she could muster as she fled the room.</p><p>Maella, in turn, gave Michael a hard look as she proceeded to clothe him in silence.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>That evening, Maris returned from the village in just enough time to change from an herb stained over tunic to a well laced bliaut of cinnamon colored wool with gold embroidery.</p><p>Her day had been a fine one for the sun had shone gloriously, melting the snow into wet, sticky masses. She\u2019d spent the morning in the herbary, preparing tonics and poultices for her first trip into the Village since her near drowning. Then, her leather bag filled with dried herbs and small bottles of medicines and tonics, she slipped out of the dark keep into the sharp, clean air.</p><p>Drawing a deep breath, Maris started across the bailey with brisk steps. The morning sun in her eyes, she nevertheless noticed her father\u2019s men gathered to practice their art of warfare. She would have passed them by with naught but a bare glance except that her gaze was drawn to one mock battle.</p><p>Maris stopped, curious, and recognized Dirick matched against Raymond of Vermille. Dirick had tossed his dark tunic aside and wore only a sleeveless linen pelisson and close fitting woolen chausses. The swords flashed, catching the rays of the sun with each twist and thrust, arms and legs moving in perfect accord. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In spite of her other tasks, Maris\u2019s attention focused on Dirick, admiring his grace and relentless power as he drove her father\u2019s best swordsman back into the crowd of bystanders.</p><p>She leaned against the stone wall, watching from the shadows. She couldn\u2019t help but study every fluid motion as Dirick\u2019s breeches clung and loosened, embraced and released his powerful legs. When the chausses tightened over his thighs during one forceful lunge, she swallowed deeply, her hand clutching the leather sack.</p><p>Sweat gleamed on his tanned arms, trickling over the ridges of muscle and tendon to fling into the air as he parried Raymond\u2019s skillful sword. Sun and shadow played over his huge arms and glistened on hair sprinkled forearms. Maris\u2019s throat grated when she tried to swallow. He was beautiful, godlike, graceful...masculine.</p> <p>She could not pull her attention away, even when she felt her father\u2019s gaze shift briefly to her. The dark haired warrior fought on, ignoring the bystanders, unaware of Maris\u2019s own presence\u2014even disregarding the thick hank of hair that dripped sweat into his eyes. Intensity furrowed his face. His eyes, hooded from the sun, did not waver from his opponent. Dirick\u2019s full lips\u2014those same ones that had so sweetly kissed her\u2014were now tight with concentration, perfectly sculpted in his granite face. Chin thrust forward, he pushed a grunt of exertion from his chest, and veins and tendons coursed his neck as he rounded ferociously upon Raymond, driving him back, back, back\u2014in one powerful pass.</p><p>A sword clattered to the ground and with a bellow of triumph, Dirick raised his own weapon aloft, then dropped his arms to his sides and stood, breathing heavily. A victorious grin lit his face and he swiped the hair out of his eyes amid the whoops and hollers of the spectators.</p><p>As he turned to acknowledge the ring of men clustered around him, Maris spun on her heel, hurrying away before he could notice her goggling at him. She rushed out of the bailey, barely greeting the guards at the portcullis, and hastened into the Village.</p><p>Though she busied herself for the rest of the day by visiting the ill and making suggestions to the village goodwives, Maris\u2019s thoughts returned again and again to the powerful, agile knight. She\u2019d spent time with him, teasing and conversing as if he were little but a squire or an ordinary man-at-arms...but now...now she could see him as naught but a fierce warrior, harsh and ruthless, relentless...formidable...manly.</p><p>Her breaths became shallow. A warrior had kissed her with gentleness. \u2019Twas impossible to reconcile the tenderness and warmth of that kiss after seeing what great strength he owned.</p> <p>Maris brushed her fingers over her own lips, remembering the surprise of desire welling inside her on that crisp, cold day. Even the memory of it made her fingers tremble. And she knew he would kiss her again, given the chance. That truth had been evident in his gaze yesterday, when she sat to play chess with him. She swallowed, remembering the heat smoldering in those thick lashed, silver black eyes.</p><p>Another truth became known to her, suddenly and with a shock of heat. Should he try to kiss her again, she would not deny him. Maris shivered.</p><p>A noise behind her jerked Maris\u2019s thoughts back to the present, back to her chamber, where she was dressing for dinner.</p><p>Verna stood beside her, offering a wimple and looking at her with an odd expression. Pulling to her feet, she took the wisp of cloth and started from her chamber.</p><p>Hurrying down the dark stone stairs, she tucked her thick hair into the sheer wimple, and entered the hall just as the meal began. As she pushed her way among the serfs that served the food, and between the rows of trestle tables, Maris saw the two strange men sitting with her parents and Sir Dirick on the dais. Her heart leapt into her throat and she almost stopped in the center of the hall. Could the man her father intended for her have arrived so soon?</p><p>Merle rose as Maris approached the table. \u201cAh, at last, my daughter joins us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to be late, Papa,\u201d she said as she made a neat curtsey. Although she didn\u2019t look up, she felt the absence of Dirick\u2019s attention on her, and at the same time, the weight of attention from the newcomers.</p><p>\u201cCome dearling, let me make you known to Lord Michael d\u2019Arcy of Gladwythe,\u201d and he continued, \u201c...and his son, Sir Victor.\u201d</p><p>The emphasis Merle placed on those last words was enough to confirm her suspicion. Victor d\u2019Arcy was the man he\u2019d chosen for her betrothed. The band of discomfort tightened around her chest and she found herself hardly able to swallow past the lump in her throat.</p><p>When she glanced at her father before turning to greet the men, she saw a hint of warning in his eyes, an expectation that she should act accordingly.</p><p>Maris masked her anxiety and extended her hand first to Lord Michael and then to his son. The elder d\u2019Arcy seemed to hold her fingers longer than necessary before pressing a kiss to her palm.</p><p>Victor clasped her hand lightly, and his lips brushed the inside of her wrist. \u201cMy lady, I have already prepared the most tender pieces of capon and removed all bones from the fish,\u201d he told her, patting the seat between himself and her father.</p><p>Maris leaned over before taking her seat to greet the other guest at table. \u201cGood evening, Sir Dirick,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d he replied. His gaze was cool and flat, as if they were strangers and had never even spoken.</p> <p>Stung by his curtness, Maris sank onto her seat next to Victor and forced herself to smile at him. Steeling all of her composure, she gathered her wits and courage and dutifully began to play the part in which she\u2019d been cast.</p><p>Edwin Baegot entered the great hall of Breakston\u2019s keep to find his friend and lord, Bon de Savrille, in an uproar.</p><p>\u201cAt last he deigns to grace us with his presence!\u201d Bon bellowed drunkenly when Edwin was announced.</p><p>The man was sprawled on a heavy oaken chair that would have rivaled Henry Plantagenet\u2019s throne had someone the urge to move them side by side. His buff colored tunic, embroidered with red stags and stallions, was stained and hung haphazardly over his broad shoulders. The cross garters that should have kept the hose fitted to his legs had drooped into a pile just above his ankles.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, my lord,\u201d Edwin gave a short little bow, then turned to help himself to a cup of ale.</p><p>\u201cWhat news of my bride have you?\u201d demanded Bon, sitting straighter in his chair. \u201cIt has been a se\u2019ennight since I left you in Langumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Edwin paused and swallowed. The news he bore would not be well-received. He looked about to see what might be within arms\u2019 reach of his friend and could be flung at him.</p><p>But before he could speak, Bon shouted, \u201cMy lute, Agnes, fetch me my lute!\u201d</p><p>A curvaceous young woman with a long purple scar on her face hurried to do his bidding. She brought the instrument forward and knelt at his feet, rubbing her head against his leg as a kitten.</p><p>\u201cAh, my lady love...\u201d Bon sighed, his bleary eyes gazing into the distance. \u201cHow I pine for her! Edwin, by my troth, I cannot wait for much longer to have my hands on that delicious piece.\u201d He strummed a chord on the lute, his face taking on a mournful expression. \u201c\u2019Twas, at the first, her lands\u2014my lands\u2014that I wished to regain. But now\u201d \u2014another chord accompanied his wistful words\u2014 \u201c\u2019tis more than mere wealth.\u201d</p><p>There was silence as Bon slopped another long gulp of wine down his throat, nevertheless taking care not to spill any on the beautifully carved lute. He pulled the goblet away with a gusty sigh. \u201cMy lust for material goods has grown to full, mature love, Edwin,\u201d Bon told him earnestly, his lips and tongue thick with drink, his gaze foggy. \u201cI cannot live without her....\u201d</p><p>Edwin rolled his eyes and finished off more ale. He might as well drink and relax, for the bad news would wait on the morrow.</p><p>Although, come to think of it, telling Bon that Lady Maris was to be wed to a man of Merle Lareux\u2019s choice on the morrow when the man was recovering from tonight\u2019s overindulgence could be painful.</p><p>Edwin looked up. God\u2019s bones, his master was a pussy when he imbibed in too much wine. He would have to ask the castellan to stop importing that red wine from Bordeaux\u2014it made Bon impossible to live with. He was glad English brewed ale did not affect his master in such a way.</p><p>\u201cDo ye hear what I say, Edwin?\u201d Bon\u2019s words were hardly discernible and his hand flopped awkwardly on the table. \u201cListen you, I have written a song for my beloved. I shall play it for her on my wedding night.\u201d</p><p>Drunk as he was, Bon\u2019s short fingers stumbled agilely over the strings of the lute and the resulting melody was surprisingly moving. He sang in a careful, off key voice, obviously making up the words as he went along:</p><p>O, Lady of the Fairest, I praise thy beauty...The clouds will cry for thee, for they see not such grace in heav\u2019n....Thy face, thy voice make my heart swell with joy, and on thy wedding day, thee shall have my love for\u2019er more....</p><p>\u201cShe would make more than my heart swell,\u201d Edwin mumbled into his ale. Fortunately, Bon didn\u2019t hear him, for he was well into his second pitiful verse.</p><p>As Bon continued his tribute to his intended, the men-at-arms crept one by one from the hall. His verses became more and more redundant, and of the worst poetry, and Edwin was forced to be subjected to the poor musicality of his master. Once, he dared to rise from his seat, hoping to follow suit of the other cowards that had since left him alone in the room, but a look from Bon froze him in his tracks. Edwin sank onto a cushioned chair, and, refilling his ale cup yet again, prepared himself for a long night.</p><p>And an even longer morrow, when, with dawn, he must break the ill news to his master.</p><p>Merle strode across the parapets of Langumont Keep.</p><p>His breath blew like white smoke from the bristling hair that lined his mouth, and a winter breeze brushed his thinning hair. The men at arms that stood at the north and south ends of the roof of the keep stoked small fires to warm their hands, nodding to their lord as he walked past them.</p><p>A sliver of moon cut the deep blue sky, and hundreds of stars twinkled above. Merle stopped at the southeast corner of the parapet, looking into the darkness over the vast lands that he was blessed to rule. They stretched as far as one could see from this vantage point. Lands that he loved nearly as much as his daughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He drew in a deep breath that was so cold it hurt the deepest part of his lungs, then exhaled strongly. Somewhere, out in that darkness, was the great channel he\u2019d crossed once to France. If he listened closely, he\u2019d hear the crashing waves upon the cliffs. He stopped breathing, just to hear the sound.</p><p>A movement from the corner of his eye drew Merle\u2019s attention. Turning, he found that Sir Dirick had come pell mell around the corner, then came to a stop when he caught sight of his host.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Dirick said, clearly uncomfortable.</p> <p>\u201cNay, Dirick, you do not disturb me. Come.\u201d Merle smiled at a sudden thought. \u201cUnless \u2019tis you who does not wish to be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, my lord. \u2019Tis just that I did not expect to come upon you. I...wished...thought to be alone. I am glad for your company.\u201d</p><p>Merle beckoned him closer, gesturing out into the darkness. \u201cSee you here, Dirick.... See you all of the blessings that have been bestowed upon me.\u201d</p><p>Dirick looked out into the dark, though Merle knew he was unable to see far in the dim, starry night. \u201cYou\u2019re worthy of them, my lord,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cListen and you can hear the sea...it has been the cause of the wealth that has come to me. My father\u2019s grandfather was a Saxon thegn, betrothed to the daughter of a Norman lord in great favor with The Conqueror. My great grandfather\u2019s land, here near the sea, was a most important fief. Since the day my great grandfather wed with Lord Humphrey\u2019s daughter, Margaret, this keep and this fief have served the King of England with no regret, and no hesitation\u2014even when Stephen of Blois ruled, and ruined, this land.\u201d</p> <p>Merle was silent for a moment, aware that he\u2019d thrust his pensive mood and meandering thoughts upon his companion. Then he gave a short, bitter laugh. \u201cForgive me, Dirick, but my solemnity comes from the knowledge that my beloved Maris will soon belong to another man....and these lands will someday be ruled by another.\u201d He took a deep breath, shaking himself from his melancholy. His decision was good. It was the best he could wish for Maris.</p><p>Yet, of the man whom he\u2019d come to know and respect, and one who was clearly a confidant of the king, Merle nevertheless felt compelled to ask, \u201cWhat think you of my guests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seem pleasant dinner companions...full of much news...confident and brave.\u201d In the faulty light, Merle saw his companion\u2019s hands close over the roughness of the stone half wall.</p><p>\u201cYet you do not sound convinced,\u201d he pressed. Then gave a wry chuckle. \u201cHas my daughter complained to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady does not seem overfond of the idea of marriage,\u201d Dirick admitted in dry tones.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, ever the chivalrous knight, do not wish to see a damsel in distress.\u201d Merle grinned, then sobered. He was full aware of the way Dirick\u2019s eyes often settled on his daughter, and the way she tended to avoid looking at him...unless the man was turned in the other direction. \u201cAye, Maris has a way of manipulating even her father with her sad stories. \u2019Tis the best for her, I believe, Dirick. The world can be an unfriendly place, and I\u2019ll not have her alone and vulnerable should aught happen to me.\u201d His voice softened at the last.</p> <p>\u201cShe may not understand my decision,\u201d Merle continued, \u201cbut \u2019twill stand. I owe a great debt to Michael d\u2019Arcy...for \u2019twas because of him that I was able to return to my own once again. I was grievously wounded and Michael saved my life. For that blessing, I will bestow upon his son the greatest gift I have to give.\u201d</p><p>Dirick nodded in acknowledgment, but remained silent.</p><p>Thus the men stood in the dark for a time, not speaking. A cold, brisk breeze ruffled their hair and the cloaks that huddled about their shoulders, yet each was lost in thought and \u2019twas as if the other were not present.</p><p>The world was quiet but for the breeze, and when he heard the sound of voices below, Dirick looked down into the courtyard. He stood near the edge of the crenellation and peered over the waist high stone.</p><p>Voices drifted up to him, and he watched as two figures trod through the snow to the stables. Even in the low light, Dirick recognized the brilliant blue cloak. \u2019Twas Maris, and with her, the silvery-blond Sir Victor, his hair gleaming like a beacon in the moonlight. The two disappeared into the stables and Dirick turned abruptly from the view to find Merle watching him closely.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, I feel my pallet beckoning to me,\u201d Dirick said. He bowed slightly\u2014not one to forget his courtly manners even when there were other things that preyed on his mind. \u201cI beg leave of you, now, Lord Merle, and for the morrow. I\u2019ll leave early in the morn for Breakston. I thank you for your great hospitality now, and for all of the assistance you\u2019ve given me in my quest for the murderer of my father. But I\u2019ve dallied too long here, enjoying your hospitality and your pallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis sorry I am to see you go,\u201d Lord Merle said slowly.</p><p>\u201cI must be on my way,\u201d Dirick said, as if to reaffirm for himself the need to leave. He\u2019d delayed his duty to move on to find Bon de Savrille long enough, merely to stay in the presence of the beautiful Lady Maris...and, in sooth, to be near a man who reminded him of his own father.</p> <p>Grief swept over him, pushing away the resentment he felt toward Sir Victor, and mayhap a bit of self pity. Dirick couldn\u2019t covet a woman such as Maris, and he had known that since he\u2019d been old enough to know what a woman was. \u2019Twas a hard truth, but one he had lived with forever. Naught had happened to change that but for his heart softening toward what he could not have. Yet, soon as she was out of his sight, she would be out of his mind as well.</p><p>Thus, he must return to his duty, and redirect his energies from a woman who was beyond him to finding the man who\u2019d taken his father from him. How foolish he\u2019d been to waste a se\u2019ennight here when he could have been following the trail of the creature who\u2019d wrought such horror.</p><p>Dirick\u2019s fingers closed around the broken dagger deep in the pouch attached to his tunic. He squeezed its handle, allowing the rage at his father\u2019s murderer to resurface...to replace his self pity and grief.</p><p>\u201cYou do not wish to bid my lady Allegra...or Maris farewell?\u201d Merle asked.</p><p>\u201cNay. I\u2019ve enjoyed the ladies\u2019 company, yet I wish for an early start on the morrow.\u201d It would be best if he were to leave without seeing her again.</p><p>\u201cThen fare thee well, my son,\u201d Merle said. He clapped a hand upon the younger man\u2019s shoulder. For just a moment, it was as if some unusual connection flowed between them. \u201cI bid you well wishes in your quest, and if I can be of further assistance, please let me know. If I can think of aught else to help you, know that I will send for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Thank you.\u201d Dirick felt unaccountably sad leaving Lord Merle.</p><p>It was a mere shadow of the grief he\u2019d felt at losing his father...yet it was sorrow all over again.</p><p>The sky hadn\u2019t the merest tint of light to it when Dirick rolled up his pallet. He stood, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dark, then walked over the other prone bodies in the chamber housing other itinerant men at arms.</p><p>The few belongings he\u2019d brought with him\u2014including the broken dagger\u2014were wrapped and stuffed in a leather satchel. He shifted the weight of this baggage and pulled his fur lined cloak about his shoulders. The edges of the cloak rustled against the sweet herbs and rushes that covered the floor of the great hall, stirring them among his booted feet. All was silent\u2014even the boy who tended the fire overnight dozed nearby. Only an orange tomcat prowled among the other snoring bodies, doubtless hoping to catch an unwary mouse among the rushes.</p><p>Dirick felt an odd sense of sadness as he stepped from the hall for the last time, and found himself under the dark blue, starred sky. He had enjoyed his stay here at Langumont, and the unhappiness he felt at leaving pushed into him like an annoying toothache. Mayhaps, he thought as he trudged through the powdery snow to the stables, \u2019twas because Lord Merle seemed to be the closest link he had to his father and his father\u2019s murderer.</p><p>The whuffling of the horses greeted him as he pressed the door into the stables. Nick was near the front, and he nickered as he sensed his master\u2019s scent. \u201cAye, boy, \u2019tis nigh time we were away from here,\u201d he said, leading the destrier from his stall. Nick pranced spiritedly within the small enclosure, obviously eager to get on his way, and Dirick patted his nose to calm him. \u201c\u2019Tis happy I\u2019ll be to see this place behind,\u201d he said aloud.</p><p>He heard the noise behind him and whirled, hand clapping to his sword, just as her words reached his ears. \u201cThen \u2019tis happy we shall be to see you go.\u201d Maris stood there, holding a tallow candle, looking ethereal in the glow of the shining beacon.</p><p>The annoyance in her eyes did not, however, bespeak of celestial bearing. Her head had been covered with a wrap, but as the woolen veil slipped, her rich hair showed and gleamed in the candlelight. Her little chin was pointed in annoyance and her full lips were firmed into a thin line. The blue cloak trailed in the rushes on the stable floor, effectively covering her from shoulder to toe.</p><p>Dirick recovered from his surprise and dropped his hand from the sword upon which it rested. \u201cMaris\u2014my lady,\u201d he amended quickly, \u201cwhat do you here?\u201d</p><p>Her frown did not dissipate. \u201cPapa told me that you planned to leave early this morrow, and I did not\u2014I thought you must not go without something for your journey. But I see that my consideration is unwanted.\u201d He noticed now that she held a packet under the opening of her cloak. \u201cSo happy are you to see Langumont behind you that surely you wouldn\u2019t wish to take any remembrance of this place.\u201d</p><p>She turned to go, her back straight as a sword and her shoulders thrown back.</p><p>\u201cNay, my lady.\u201d Dirick, annoyed at having been caught speaking such nonsense to his horse, spurred to action and reached for her arm. \u201cNay, \u2019tis not that I wish to leave Langumont...believe you me.\u201d</p><p>At his tug, she pivoted back, her eyes a hard, flat brown in the flickering light. \u201cI am not hard of hearing, Sir Dirick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He eased her toward him, now taking both shoulders and turning her so that she faced him fully. So close that her cloak\u2019s hem nudged his boots. She felt small and soft beneath his fingers. \u201cAnd so you heard the nonsense I spoke to Nick. I suppose it serves me right\u2014for did I not overhear your private conversation with Hickory?\u201d His smile felt forced. \u201cI must leave, and that I have no desire to do so the reason I spoke thus.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him as if trying to determine whether he was merely being gallant or whether the words actually were truth. \u201cI could not fathom that you would leave without a word of farewell....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bid your father good-bye,\u201d he told her, releasing her shoulders. They stood much too close. The smell of lemon and rosemary from her hair caught at his nostrils, mingling with the feminine scent of her. Dirick closed his eyes for a moment and forced himself to take a step backward. He turned into the stall to gather Nick\u2019s bridle. \u201cBut I must leave now, my lady. I have spent\u2014I have used your father\u2019s hospitality much too long.\u201d</p> <p>Maris worked the candle into a cup appended to the wall of the stable, leaving it to light their way, and stepped toward him, unwittingly blocking him into the stall. She proffered the leather wrapped packet from under the folds of her cloak. \u201cI\u2019ve brought you cheese and bread, and there is a bit of salted venison here. I...did not know how long your journey would be.\u201d</p><p>He took the packet, warmed by her thoughtfulness and tempted by her presence. \u201cThank you my lady. I was not able to break my fast and this will be a good meal for the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI am a traveling knight, my lady, and I go where I can find work,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not know where my next place of rest will be.\u201d</p><p>Maris frowned, a charming line crinkling around her nose. \u201cThen why do you leave? Papa has work for you. I\u2019m certain he would hire you for as long as you wished.\u201d</p> <p>A sudden flare of anger twisted his insides. Verily, she saw him only as a charity case. A man who could not make his own way.</p><p>Despite the fact that he\u2019d led her to believe just that, it rankled that she saw him in such a lowly light. \u201cNay.\u201d He turned his back to her, taking his time to loop up the reins and bit, hoping she would leave before he mortified himself again.</p><p>Or before he gave in to the base temptation she presented.</p><p>\u201cSir Dirick, I vow, you make little sense of anything. You need work, and there is work to be had, but you must leave nevertheless. I vow, \u2019twill be good to have you gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said as he turned, his hands brimming with the leather bridle, \u201cI am sure you will not miss my company now that your betrothed has arrived.\u201d As soon as he spoke those bitter words, Dirick wished he could cut out his tongue. Foolish.</p><p>\u201cHe is not my betrothed,\u201d she said tightly, the spirit draining from her voice.</p> <p>\u201cHe will be anon, and well you know it. When that happens, I am quite sure Victor will be pleased to trail you on your treks through the wood, digging in the snow for berries and watching as you nurse to the ill.\u201d He knew he should stop speaking, but the words continued to flow. \u201cI saw you come in here with him last night. Your father and I were watching from above. Mayhap you didn\u2019t realize you were seen?\u201d</p><p>Maris\u2019s expression altered, but he couldn\u2019t read her thoughts. \u201cAye. He wished to meet Hickory.\u201d</p><p>Dirick quirked one eyebrow and managed to look sardonic even as a barrage of unwanted images assaulted him. He well knew how comfortable the warmth of a stable could be when one\u2019s arms were filled with the warmth of a woman. Hay might be a bit prickly against bare skin, but it was springy and warm. \u201cAnd was there nothing more that he wanted? Mayhap he wished to taste the lips of the woman he is to wive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap he did,\u201d she replied, lifting her chin smartly.</p><p>\u201cFoolish girl. What if he had wanted more than a taste? Did you not think to have a chaperon with you? \u2019Tis not meet for a lady to have assignations alone with a man in the stable of all places, particularly if she is not yet betrothed to him.\u201d</p><p>Maris\u2019s eyes snapped. \u201cBut here I stand with you, then. Alone in a stable, with no chaperone...and my virtue has never been safer.\u201d</p><p>His resolve at an end, he dropped the bridle, reaching for her more roughly this time. \u201cI would not say that your virtue is safe with me, my dear lady,\u201d he said, pulling her flush against him. \u201cIn fact, Maris, I should say that you are treading upon very thin ice.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her and saw no fear in her eyes, only surprise, and he felt the warmth of her breath touch his face. His hands on her shoulders, he eased her backward until she felt the wall behind her and he imprisoned her there, holding her with his muscled legs.</p> <p>Maris\u2019s eyes sank closed as his tanned hands smoothed up the sides of her neck to cup the line of that stubborn chin. His thumb traced over her lips and her heart pounded madly beneath his fingers, pulsing in her long neck so that he could feel her unrest. Lifting her hair from the nape of her neck, he carefully pulled the long sweet-smelling tresses from the confines of her cloak. It was warm and silky and it twined like vines around his wrists and about her arms.</p><p>Dirick let his breath out slowly as his hands ran through her hair. She was not afraid, he noted, although if she had any sense, she would be. It was all he could do to keep from tearing off her clothes and tossing her onto the bed of hay in the next room.</p><p>When his hands stilled on her shoulders, and he eased back on the pressure from his thighs, she opened her eyes to look up at him. \u201cMaris,\u201d he said softly as their gazes met. He would never see her again, and she was not yet betrothed. It was a moment of madness, but not a sin. \u201cI cannot leave without kissing you once more.\u201d</p><p>He did not wait for a response, pressed her into the wall, his mouth descending to hers.</p><p>When his mouth closed on hers, Maris felt the same tide of pleasure wash over her as the day in the woods. Her lips opened beneath his and suddenly his tongue was in her mouth, sleek and strong, exploring and tasting her. She was as hungry to sample him and responded with fervor, tasting the faint mint of his mouth, sliding her own lips over his soft, slick ones.</p><p>Dirick dragged his lips away, kissing the corner of her mouth, nibbling at her lips and chin. She sighed, her arms creeping around his neck as she leaned into him. She felt a rush plunging through her body, and the responding shudder that came through him, the heat burning into her from where they pressed together. Hurried fingers worked the clasp at her throat as he covered her mouth again as if to stifle any cry of protest she might make. The fur lined cloak fell into a heap at their feet and his hands smoothed down the sides of her body in its trail, resting on the curve of her hips.</p><p>Maris was barely aware of the divestment of her cloak, but the pressure from his warm hands as they brushed the sides of her breasts caused her to draw in a sharp breath. Her nipples surged hard and she felt a heaviness descend upon her lower abdomen, a pleasant, insistent twinge. She dug her fingers into his hair, surprised at its silkiness. He pulled her hips flush with his and she was startled to feel a hard length pushing against her as the rough wall scraped her from behind. The pleasure grew and a tiny groan erupted from the back of her throat. She tilted her head back, exposing her neck to his warm mouth and sleek tongue. Dirick\u2019s hands smoothed over the curves that had been hidden in the bulky cloak, and he held the swelling of her breasts and the roundness of her hips.</p><p>Suddenly, he realized where he was, what he was doing, and he jerked away, nearly sending her spinning to the floor. \u201c\u2019Sblood!\u201d he groaned, staring at his trembling hands. His breath rasped harshly, as if he\u2019d just felled a man in battle, and his heart thudded painfully in his chest as he realized how very near he\u2019d come to taking her right there.</p><p>Maris had pulled back as if she too had just become aware of herself and her comport, and she stooped quickly to retrieve her cloak.</p><p>Dirick found his voice, hoarse as it was, and attempted an apology, \u201cMy lady, I cannot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, my lord,\u201d she cut in flatly. \u201cHave we not been through this act before?\u201d</p><p>Pushing a hand through his tousled hair, he stood, attempting to regain some semblance of order within. He could not understand why he made a living fool out of himself in front of this woman. \u201cAye we have\u2014but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that my conduct was inexcusable. Mayhaps \u2019tis best that I do be on my way.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, an indefinable emotion flickering in her gold and green eyes. \u201cAye. \u2019Tis best that you do.\u201d</p><p>He brushed past her, accidentally catching her hair on a nail in the wall, and paused to free the curl. His fingers slid down the shiny brown length and he brought it to press a light kiss to his mouth.</p><p>Then he turned away, annoyed at his sentimentality, and bridled the neglected Nick. She watched in silence. Feeling her gaze on him made his fingers clumsy beyond belief, causing him to hurry and thus tangle it up even more. At last, he led the destrier from the stable, aware that she followed behind, watching in an unusual silence.</p><p>Outside, where their breaths showed white puffs under the starlit morn, he swung up on Nick and looked down at Maris. She\u2019d covered her hair once again, drawing the veil closely about her neck. Dirick reined in and gave her a nod of farewell.</p><p>\u201cGo with God, Dirick,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cFare thyself well, my lady. I am certain Victor d\u2019Arcy will be a fine husband to you,\u201d he forced the words from between bitter lips, making them sound sincere. \u201cYour father wishes only the best for you, know you this, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay the Lord keep you,\u201d he said, turning Nick to ride away. \u201cAdieu, my lady.\u201d</p><p>And then he was off, giving Nick his head to unleash his stored power, feeling the green gold gaze that followed him into the darkness.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Breakston possessed a forbidding looking keep, set near the top of a low lying mountain. It was much smaller than both Derkland and Langumont Keeps, and it was not in the same pristine condition that those lands and buildings were in. Dirick could see parts of the walls crumbling even from a fair distance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The village, again smaller, was filled with peasants that veered from Nick\u2019s path and peeked out from behind closed doors as Dirick rode through. Most of the roofs seemed to be in decent condition, but the silence of the village ate right through to his bones.</p><p>The journey had not been long. He\u2019d spent the full day riding hard, spending Nick\u2019s pent up energy. Now that he approached the portcullis and the sun was sinking, Dirick was well ready for his pallet. Cold wind was bitter upon his face, and the food that Maris sent with him was long gone.</p><p>Maris.</p> <p>She had been much on his mind the day through. Too much.</p><p>Dirick reined in abruptly at the huge iron gates looming above him.</p><p>\u201cWho goes there?\u201d called a voice from above.</p><p>\u201cDirick de Arlande, begging for succor,\u201d he called back, tilting his head to see.</p><p>There was a long moment, then the voice returned, \u201cFrom whence come you, Sir de Arlande?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am originally come from Paris and most recently, Dover,\u201d he replied. \u201cI have traveled for days, looking for work. I am quite skilled in arms.\u201d</p><p>Again, there was a long pause. Then, \u201cYou are French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I hail from near Brest,\u201d Dirick replied, trying to keep the annoyance out of his voice. Most often, unless there were unusual circumstances, questions such as these were saved for after a lone knight was allowed entrance.</p><p>At long last, the portcullis began to creak and shake violently as the gate was raised. Dirick urged Nick forward, uncertain that the ailing gate was in good enough repair to ensure his safe passage. Once inside the bailey, he was greeted by a stocky, pock marked man that held himself in high importance.</p><p>\u201cYou are well come to Breakston, Sir de Arlande,\u201d he said. A man hovered in the background until he was urged forward, \u201cTake this man\u2019s mount, Severn.\u201d</p><p>Dirick relinquished Nick with some hesitation, yet the man seemed to know what he was doing and led the destrier away with little effort. \u201cMany thanks for allowing me entrance,\u201d he told the first man.</p> <p>\u201cI am Sir Robert, castellan of Breakston. My lord, Bon de Savrille, awaits your presence within.\u201d That was it. No smile, no friendly greeting\u2014just a barely disguised order that Dirick draw himself within.</p><p>He grimaced inwardly and followed Robert across the small, cluttered bailey, feeling even more certain that Henry was right. At the very least, de Savrille had allowed his fief to fall into disrepair\u2014which meant lower revenues and taxes for the king.</p><p>Dirick noted that the keep was in need of some repair, but it was by no means falling down about him. There weren\u2019t many serfs, nor were there many men at arms about. It was a much quieter, sullen place than his home and that of Langumont.</p><p>Sir Robert led the way across the smoky hall strewn with rushes so old and rotted that they ground away under their mailed feet. Several dogs greeted them, sniffing at their heels until Sir Robert lifted a foot to kick them away. Then they slunk off to a spot under one of the tables. Smoke hovered much too low in the air, along with the stench of old grease and rotting food. Breathing carefully through his nose, Dirick hoped that he would not be a guest of Breakston overlong.</p><p>Bon de Savrille, Dirick assumed, was the stocky, bearded man sitting in a heavy chair near the fire. The blaze, at the least, was in marvelous condition. De Savrille\u2019s dark eyes bored into him as he approached, slitted with mistrust. Immediately, Dirick allowed his features to relax and slip into a vacant expression.</p><p>\u201cMy Lord de Savrille,\u201d he greeted upon reaching the warmth of the fire. He made a fine bow, and upon the upsweep, was gracious enough to add, \u201cMany thanks to you for a spot to sleep for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Bon returned, sipping from a goblet.</p><p>Dirick inclined his head to the other man at the fire, a shorter, well freckled one with a shock of red hair. His paunch was nearly the size of Lord de Savrille\u2019s, and his eyes not nearly as sharp. But there was a hint of suspicion within his countenance as well. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he greeted the other man, uncertain of his title.</p> <p>\u201cMeet Edwin Baegot,\u201d Bon explained carelessly.</p><p>\u201cWell met, sieur,\u201d Dirick replied, then settled himself easily on a roughly hewn stool near Bon de Savrille.</p><p>\u201cAgnes!\u201d barked Bon, \u201cBring this man some food and more ale for me!\u201d</p><p>A shadow moved from a nearby corner, transforming into a skittish, gown draped woman, and hurried out of the room. As Dirick\u2019s eyes followed her, he noticed that the great hall was nearly empty of men-at-arms, serfs, and any other form of life with the exception of the mangy dogs that had followed them into the room. Feeling the weight of Edwin\u2019s suspicious gaze on him, Dirick kept his face blank despite the fact that his mind was racing. At the very least, Henry must find another vassal for Breakston.</p><p>Edwin asked about his journey and Dirick filled the silence with superficial babble about the roads and the holes in them, along with comments about the weather.</p><p>\u201cAh, at last you have returned you worthless creature!\u201d Bon greeted Agnes, who nearly stumbled over one of the dogs. \u201cClumsy bitch,\u201d he muttered as she carefully poured a healthy portion of ale into his goblet, spilling nary a drop in the process.</p><p>When she turned to offer Dirick a piece of hard bread and pale yellow cheese, he noticed the long purple scar that marred an otherwise pretty face. Her hair normally would cover it, but it swung out of the way as she stepped forward. \u201cThank\u2019ee milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady?\u201d scoffed Bon, nearly spewing ale in Dirick\u2019s face. \u201cIf ye take a liking to her, she\u2019ll spread her legs fast enough to knock you over. Lady, indeed!\u201d</p><p>Agnes ducked her head and her hair obscured her face once again. She turned away to her corner, drawing the folds of her gown so that she did not stumble again. Dirick turned to his food, stifling any outward signs of compassion for the woman.</p><p>Ale dribbling into his neatly cropped beard, Bon slugged a hand across his mouth and asked, \u201cHow fares the Earl of Chantresse? Is it true that his daughter was to marry Enrique du Mathilde?\u201d</p><p>Dirick idly scraped a bit of mold off the last bite of cheese, aware that de Savrille was likely attempting to confirm his guest\u2019s story of being French. The fact that he felt the need to do so was quite interesting. \u201cAye, my lord, they were wed Midsummer last. \u2019Twas said that the daughter, Elisabet, was near dragged to the altar and that her papa said her ayes.\u201d He gave a short bark of laughter, certain that Bon would find the story amusing.</p><p>\u201cGod willing \u2019twill not be such a trial on my wedding day,\u201d Bon mused behind the hand that wiped again at his beard. The words were soft and not meant for his ears, but Dirick discerned the comment with little trouble.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis fair unlikely to happen any different here,\u201d muttered Edwin more loudly.</p><p>Bon shot him a glare, but that didn\u2019t suppress Dirick\u2019s ingenuous question. \u201cIs there to be a wedding here then?\u201d He made it a point to not look around the quiet hall.</p><p>\u201cAye, if the wench\u2019ll have me,\u201d Bon replied. He and Edwin exchanged pointed looks followed by deep guffaws of laughter.</p><p>\u201cAnd the lucky wench? Does she bring a great dowry, then?\u201d Mayhap de Savrille needed more funds to set the place to rights and meant to get it from his wife.</p><p>Bon\u2019s eyes narrowed to slits as if he suddenly realized that the turn of the conversation was not to his liking. \u201c\u2019Tis a love match,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>This set Edwin to coughing. He began to choke on his ale and was forced to spit onto the floor. The dogs rushed forward with enthusiasm, then slunk away when they realized it was only ale.</p><p>Bon glared at his amused companion and stood abruptly. \u201cThere is a place for your pallet there. You will join us in a hunt on the morrow, Sir Dirick.\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned and, barked at the lump in the corner. \u201cAgnes! Come!\u201d</p><p>Dirick watched them leave, then, under Edwin\u2019s sharp stare, gathered his belongings and trudged to the corner indicated by de Savrille. There were no more than five other men snoring in what he took to be the knights\u2019 quarters, and as he shook out his blanket, a small furry creature darted from between them. Rats.</p><p>His stomach turned and he almost cursed his sovereign for sending him to spy on what seemed to be no more than two bumbling idiots who lived amongst rats. But he stopped himself in time, for cursing his God given sovereign, his brother the monk would warn, would result in either hanging for treason if done aloud, or damnation if done in private.</p><p>Instead, Dirick eased his travel worn body onto the only clean surface in the entire keep and closed his eyes.</p><p>Maris sat primly in her saddle, golden skirts fluttering lightly. The brilliant blue cloak that Dirick de Arlande had so admired covered her from shoulder to toe, and much of Hickory\u2019s rump as well. Maris\u2019s chestnut hair was modestly covered by a heavy golden wrap, edged in mink, and her hands wrapped in the folds of the rabbit lined cloak.</p><p>She looked every inch the proper, controlled lady of the manor.</p><p>Inwardly, she was seething.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain that you do not yet tire, milady?\u201d asked Sir Victor for perhaps the dozenth time since they\u2019d left Langumont Keep\u2019s portcullis behind.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d she replied, for the dozenth time, from between clenched teeth. In sooth, she was wearier from holding Hickory back from the spirited canter\u2014or even full gallop\u2014that the mare, as well as her mistress, desired.</p><p>Maris slanted a glance to the man who rode comfortably next to her. He sat tall and straight in the saddle, loosely holding the reins, allowing his gaze to cast about over the villagers and the town buildings.</p><p>Victor\u2019s straight cap of hair, as pale as the wheat grown in Langumont\u2019s fields, barely shifted as he was jounced along in his saddle. He was not an unhandsome man, she admitted to herself\u2014in fact, he was not at all hard on the eyes. He seemed to have an even temper, although he tended, like her mother, to protect her as if she were a child. It was Victor who had suggested the ride, and Maris, anticipating a great race across the northwest field toward the forest, had agreed with alacrity. Alas, when she\u2019d given Hickory her head and they moved into a canter just outside the wall of the keep, her companion had actually reached over and reined her mare into a trot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had taken every ounce of control that she possessed not to loosen a torment of fury upon him. Instead, Maris, thinking of her father\u2019s wishes, swallowed her angry words at his presumption and meekly settled into a trot. Mayhaps, she thought as they wound their way carefully down the main street of the village, he did not know of any woman as comfortable on a horse as she.</p><p>\u201cGood day, Mistress Beth,\u201d she called in English to the smith\u2019s wife with a wave.</p><p>\u201cGood day, milady,\u201d the other woman responded with a bright smile. She had her youngest child by the hand, and nudged the toddler to wave also to the grand lady who rode past.</p> <p>\u201cYou are much too familiar with the peasants, my lady,\u201d murmured Victor with distaste. \u201cAnd why on earth would you learn to speak their coarse language?\u201d</p><p>Maris stared at him in shock. \u201cAnd how else would I communicate with them if I did not speak their language?\u201d she sputtered.</p><p>Victor turned to her in surprise, \u201cAs I\u2014and all other nobility\u2014do: through an interpreter. \u2019Twould be in your interest when you go to court that you forget your knowledge of English...else you will make of yourself, and me, a laughing stock.\u201d</p><p>Maris turned an annoyed glare upon him. \u201cThen my papa must not be nobility in your eyes, as he is the same one who encouraged me to learn the language. He himself does better than I!\u201d</p><p>Victor flushed ever so slightly; in fact, it may have been just a stinging wind that caused his cheeks to pinken, and looked taken aback. \u201cMy lady, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Tis in my best interest, Sir Victor, to rely on no one but myself as to what is spoken to me. Interpreters have been known to twist words into their own. Even the king and his queen read and write their own words, speak the language of their people as well as their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Maris\u2014\u201d</p><p>She would not let him finish. Her temper had snapped and her father\u2019s wishes thrown to the birds for the now. \u201cAnd I am Lady of Langumont,\u201d she drew herself up in the saddle to her full, diminutive height. \u201cI care not what the ladies\u2014or even the men\u2014at court think of me. And I particularly should not care if you are a laughing stock because I choose to communicate with my people. And,\u201d she leaned out of her saddle toward the now silent Victor to drive her point home, \u201cyou, sir, presume overmuch, as a betrothal has neither been announced nor signed!\u201d She sat back and drew a deep breath, ready to do more battle.</p><p>\u201cAh, but my lady, \u2019tis where you err.\u201d Victor\u2019s voice was silky...too silky, and a surprise shiver sang along her spine. \u201cEven as we trot along at such a sedate pace, our fathers are finalizing the betrothal arrangements. The agreement is to be announced at dinner, and we shall seal the contract two days hence.\u201d</p><p>As Victor\u2019s words sank in and Maris realized that her betrothal was truly going to happen, she gave in to the urge to run away.</p><p>With a swift movement she\u2019d perfected years ago, she gathered her skirts and brought her right leg over the saddle so that she was straddling the mare in a most unladylike but practical fashion. All in one instant, she gave a sharp kick and loosed the reins. Hickory shot forward. She heard Victor\u2019s shout of surprise behind her, and, looking over her shoulder, saw that he\u2019d started after them.</p> <p>Containing a cry of joy at the freedom of tearing across a pristine field of white snow, she urged Hickory on, fully enjoying the risk she took of angering her soon to be betrothed. \u2019Twould be worth the inevitable lecture, she thought, grinning into Hickory\u2019s mane.</p><p>They easily cleared the stone fence that marked the end of the Lord of Langumont\u2019s grain field, heading straight for the dense forest. Maris\u2019s head covering jounced loose and landed on a low bush. Her long braid flew free, the end bouncing off Hickory\u2019s rump with the rhythm of the mare\u2019s strides.</p><p>Glancing over her shoulder, she saw Victor, bent over his mount\u2019s neck, racing across the field. With a mental sigh of capitulation, she slowed Hickory just as they reached the beginnings of the forest. Turning about, Maris watched as Victor roared up beside her, nearly trampling them both. Either he was overcome with rage and did not care if he injured her, or he did not handle his mount as well as a he should.</p><p>Before she had a thought to speak, he grabbed the reins from her hand and drew Hickory\u2019s head around toward the rear of his stallion so that he and Maris were very close and facing each other. His eyes were nearly black and his mouth compressed in a firm line. \u201cAre you a madwoman?\u201d were his first words. \u201cAm I to wed a madwoman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d he thundered so furiously that she reconsidered finishing her sentence. His eyes closed into slits, and, still holding tightly to her reins, he slid off his horse, landing in snow to his mid calf. Looping his own reins over an arm, he reached up and grabbed her wrist. \u201cLet me help you down, milady,\u201d he said in a voice that brooked no disobedience, nearly yanking her off the saddle. She came down gracefully, landing in the circle of his arms.</p><p>Dropping the reins, he yanked her closer, and the other hand reached up to close tightly over her chin. The expression on his face was dark and determined, and for the first time, Maris had a sense of real trepidation and she reflexively stepped back, twisting her face away.</p><p>\u201cOh, nay,\u201d he whispered, jerking her close, his fingers tightening on her arm. \u201cDo you not step away from me, wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am not your\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words were stifled as he crushed his mouth to hers. At her involuntary gasp, his hand went to the back of her head, his fingers curling roughly into her hair, dragging down on it to hold her steady. He held her immobile as his lips and tongue brutally invaded her mouth. The hand on her wrist loosened to move around her waist and pull her close to his hips while the fingers of his other hand pressed into the back of her skull.</p><p>Maris fought the nausea that rose in her throat at his angry onslaught. Her eyes closed and she pushed against him fiercely. She should have known better than to anger him thus.</p><p>At last he pulled away from her mouth, breathing heavily, and looked down at her with eyes glazed with desire. \u201cAye, you\u2019ll be a fine wife,\u201d he breathed frost into her face, \u201conce you have learned that I am to be obeyed in all things.\u201d As she stood frozen, he reached up to fumble with the ties of her cloak.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you to remain silent.\u201d His hand shot up to pinch her chin, and he gave it a vicious twist. \u201cI would learn what other treasures I win along with the lands of Langumont.\u201d Before she could protest, her cloak fell to the snow in a pool of blue. With horror, she realized what he was about. Surely he did not mean to disrobe her...here.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d she cried, clutching her overtunic to her neck.</p><p>He grabbed her wrists, forcing them behind her back, and settled his hand into a vee beneath her chin, holding her by the throat. Maris felt the rough bark of a tree behind her, rasping over her hands, as he forced his mouth onto hers. As the kiss deepened, his hand slipped from her chin to cover one of her breasts. She jolted in shock, pulling her mouth away with a desperate twist.</p><p>\u201cRelease me,\u201d she demanded, her voice unsteady with shock. To her horror, she felt the warm trickle of a tear down her cheek.</p><p>Victor ignored her command, pressing his hips into hers. She felt the rise of his desire, hard and threatening against her thigh and Maris struggled to keep her breath steady. Surely he wouldn\u2019t...here. Surely. Those thoughts were the only things that kept her from going mad with desperation.</p><p>Victor smiled with cold satisfaction as he kneaded her breast through three layers of wool, pinching and fondling her thoroughly. \u201c\u2019Tis well that you are not used to this kind of touch, else there might be other things you will learn.\u201d He pressed an almost tender kiss to her bruised lips.</p><p>Maris twisted away. \u201cRelease me,\u201d she said again, trying to slip free.</p><p>\u201cYou are soon to be my wife,\u201d he said, his voice hard, his hands tightening over her breast and around her wrists. \u201cAnd I am determined that we shall suit well, my lady. In fact, I shall ensure that we will suit.\u201d</p><p>This last was said conversationally as his fingers found and teased the nipple that had stiffened with cold. He pinched it enough to bring a gasp from her throat. Bending his knee, he pressed his groin into her thigh as he forced her mouth open once again with his teeth. A low moan escaped from him as he ground his throbbing erection into the joint between her torso and thigh.</p><p>He pulled back and looked down at her. Still holding her wrists, he used his other hand to comb through her loosened braid. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he breathed with satisfaction. \u201cWhen we are at court, you shall cover this with naught but a net of jewels.\u201d With a sudden twist of the wrist, he grabbed a fistful of hair and yanked hard enough to bend her head back so that she looked into his face.</p><p>Victor met her wide eyes. \u201cYou angered me, my lady. You angered me with your sharp tongue, and your disregard for your person\u2014tearing across the fields as you did. Take care not to anger me in the future, Maris, and we shall do well together.\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned and clomped away through the snow. Gathering up the reins of his mount, he swung himself into the saddle, and, without a backward glance, urged the horse into a loping canter back toward the keep.</p><p>Shaken and numb, Maris stiffly gathered up her cloak. As she draped it around her trembling shoulders, she tried to hold back the tears. The Lady of Langumont would not cry. Turning to look about, she saw Hickory and whistled for her mare.</p><p>A heavy weight settled over her as she climbed into the saddle, her trembling hands fumbling with the reins. He would be her betrothed two days hence. As her wedded husband, he owned her\u2014owned her\u2014and could do as he wished. He could beat her, rape her, even kill her if he chose. Maris had met and cared for a young woman just a little more than a year ago, Lady Joanna, who had been beaten nearly to her death by her husband.</p><p>With a fearful, shuddering sigh, she urged Hickory into a slow trot. Tears stung the corners of her eyes as she held onto the reins so tightly that her nails bit into the palm of her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Never in her life had Maris been subjected to violent anger such as Victor\u2019s. Her father had never raised a hand to either her or Allegra\u2014though the rage in his voice threatened to bring the timbers of the roof down upon them at times. Her heart was slowing its crazy pace, and now Maris began to get over her fright and become angry.</p><p>Much of the anger was directed at herself, for though she might be impulsive and headstrong, Maris knew that she owned faults enough to make a man mad.</p><p>She was furious with herself partly because she\u2019d chosen to enrage a man before knowing his temper and disposition...but she was mostly disappointed in herself for submitting to his actions without fighting back more violently. She\u2019d been stunned at Victor\u2019s anger and the humiliating form it had taken...and had not had the presence of mind to bite the hand that held her chin, or raise her knee into his pulsing groin.</p> <p>The memory of that hard length pressing into her thigh caused bitterness to well up into her throat, and she gagged, swallowing it back. How could she allow him to touch her again? How ever would she submit to his husbandly demands?</p><p>Michael d\u2019Arcy stifled a belch and wiped his hand over his mouth, his gaze scanning the hall. \u2019Twas empty of all but a few serfs preparing for the evening meal, and he took this moment to savor the knowledge that it would all soon be his...his and his son\u2019s.</p><p>Merle had agreed to the betrothal contract only that morning, and would make the anticipated announcement at dinner that evening. They would sign the contract after a ceremony two days hence, and all would be his.</p><p>Taking another gulp of ale, Michael fought to keep a complacent smile from curving his face as he contemplated the power that Langumont would bring him. His own lands weren\u2019t nearly enough to give him leverage with the king, but with Langumont, Edena and Damona behind him, even Henry must listen to him.</p><p>At that moment, a movement near the stairwell caught his eye, and Lady Allegra walked into view. As always, his body responded to the mere sight of her and he shifted languorously in Merle\u2019s chair. Jes\u00f9, but the woman had him by the stones.</p> <p>He\u2019d never forgotten her over the years, for she\u2019d warmed his bed and tended to his needs better than any whore, noblewoman, or even his own wife. He supposed he loved her, for even now, after eighteen years, he could not get enough of her body. Just this morrow, they\u2019d met in the far corner of the stables as Victor and Maris saddled their mounts for a ride...and Michael had had a pleasant ride of his own.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t able to keep the self satisfied smirk from his lips now, but hid it behind the goblet of ale.</p><p>Since their arrival at Langumont, he\u2019d not had any of the raging aches in his head, and that, too, was cause for satisfaction. Those aches frightened him with their intensity, and with the black memories and images that came with them. He sought ways to expel the fury that clawed inside him when those spells incapacitated him, but it was becoming more and more difficult to do so as time passed.</p><p>Michael pushed such minor nuisances away as he saw Allegra passing nearby. He wanted her again. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he called, raising his goblet, \u201ccome you and serve me.\u201d</p><p>It was an interesting group that was assembled at the high table that evening: an evening of utmost importance to all involved.</p><p>Lady Allegra\u2019s face, to anyone who passed even the most cursory glance over her, was drawn and tight. Her eyes were ringed with the purple of sleepless nights, and her usually neat coiffure was loose, leaving several straggling strands of hair about her face.</p> <p>Lord Michael, seated next to Allegra, looked obsessively pleased with himself. He was particularly attentive to the woman beside him\u2014but she seemed oblivious to everything and spent most of the meal staring into nothing with a haunted look in her eyes.</p><p>Sir Victor could barely keep his burning gaze from his soon to be betrothed. There was a proprietary air of complacency about him as well.</p><p>Maris was subdued. She concentrated on her meal, accepting the choice tidbits of capon and goose from Victor without comment.</p><p>When the meal was nearly finished\u2014just before the final, sweet course was brought from the kitchens\u2014Lord Merle stood, stepping carefully to stand behind the long bench on which he and his guests were seated. He called for attention, although gossip had spread throughout the keep and all had been waiting for the announcement of their lady\u2019s betrothal.</p><p>\u201cTwo days hence,\u201d he began jovially, with a full cup of ale in his hand, \u201cwe shall celebrate a most auspicious event. It has taken many years for this decision to be made, and tonight I wish to make known to you the betrothed husband of my daughter, Maris of Langumont.\u201d</p><p>Beaming behind his silver beard, Merle helped his daughter to her feet as the room erupted in loud cheers\u2014at the prospect of a day of celebration as much as the announcement of a wedding.</p><p>\u201cTwo days hence,\u201d he repeated, smiling down at his daughter\u2014who managed a tremulous curving of the lips in response, \u201cthe castellans from Cleonis, Firmain, Shawdon, Edena, and Damona, shall arrive to once again pledge their fealty to me, and to my heir, Lady Maris. At that time, they shall also witness the betrothal covenant of my daughter to Lord Victor d\u2019Arcy of Gladwythe.\u201d</p><p>The room erupted with joy, and Lady Allegra slid to the floor in a dead faint.</p> <p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>Dirick was seated comfortably in the corner of Breakston Hall that was the darkest and most unobtrusive, but close enough to the roaring fire that warmth emanated to his very toes. It was after the evening meal\u2014if one could call the fare that had been set before him food\u2014and there were fewer people than usual in the hall.</p><p>His mail hauberk, one that was of such quality that it would certainly be remarked upon as to how an itinerant mercenary knight had come to own it, had one taken a close look at it, lay draped over his crossed knees. He sat in rushes that were so old that he dared not contemplate what might be living among them, polishing the mail, and silently observing the lord of the hall.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much to observe.</p><p>Dirick had been at Breakston for nearly three days, and he\u2019d come to the conclusion that de Savrille and his comrade Edwin Baegot were merely sloppy, stupid men who had no business calling themselves knights, let alone land-owning lords.</p><p>There was, he intended to remind his sovereign, no law against having a lack of common sense...and although Henry Plantagenet had good reason to feel slighted that Bon had not graced his presence, Dirick intended to inform the king that it was no great insult. In fact, he planned to leave on the morrow to make a full report to his king, along with the recommendation that Bon de Savrille be disseissened from Breakston. There could not be another fief in all of Henry\u2019s kingdom that was in such disrepair.</p><p>And then, God willing, Dirick would be free to follow the lead on the other task he\u2019d set himself to.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, Berkle has returned. He has news of great import,\u201d proclaimed Sir Robert as he burst into the hall.</p><p>Even from his shadowy corner, Dirick could see Bon\u2019s head snap up from his ever-present goblet of ale. \u201cSend him in immediately,\u201d was the reply.</p><p>Curiosity and instinct had Dirick melting into the shadows, attempting to make himself as inconspicuous as possible.</p><p>Moments later, a tall, thin man dressed in a heavy black cloak was ushered into the hall. He hurried over to Bon and Edwin, and muttered something that, try though he might, Dirick could not understand. He caught the words \u201cbetrothal\u201d and \u201ctwo days hence\u201d before Bon erupted from his huge chair with a roar.</p><p>\u201cThe bitch!\u201d he snarled. \u201cHow dare that cock licking whore ignore me!\u201d He flung the tankard of ale across the chamber. It splattered all over before it hit the stone wall with a loud clang. \u201cI will have her! I will have her if\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bon suddenly stilled as if he realized there were other ears in the room. He glanced over his shoulder at Dirick.</p><p>But Dirick had prepared himself for such an eventuality. He was propped in a far corner, head back against the wall, jaw relaxed...certain that even Bon could hear the snores that rose from an obviously drunken man-at-arms.</p><p>Yet Dirick watched through slitted eyes as, red faced with rage, Bon sat back down on his stool and gestured Edwin and Berkle to pull their seats closer. And then he began to give orders in a low, urgent voice.</p><p>The day after her betrothal was announced, Lord Merle was in his receiving room, going over the accounts with Gustave, Langumont\u2019s seneschal.</p><p>It was a large chamber on the same floor as the women\u2019s solar, but much smaller than that woman\u2019s chamber. It was, however, comfortably furnished, with two heavy chairs, a table for the scribe, and several stools. A large abacus graced the table, along with sheets of vellum, writing utensils, and wax candles for sealing documents. Bright tapestries hung on the walls and candles lit every corner of the room.</p><p>Merle looked up from the table where he and Gustave were perusing the account books when Maris walked in. He couldn\u2019t help but note how very elegant and ladylike she looked in a pale blue overtunic that trailed behind her. Her eyes were wide and dark in her set face, and immediately he knew that this would not be a pleasant conversation.</p><p>\u201cGustave, please excuse us. I believe my daughter would like words with me.\u201d</p><p>Ever since the evening before, when he\u2019d stood and announced that she would marry Victor d\u2019Arcy, Merle had been expecting this moment. In fact, he\u2019d been surprised it had taken nearly a whole day for his daughter to approach him. After all, he\u2019d finalized the contract and made the announcement without warning her in advance.</p><p>She\u2019d taken it stoically the night before, he admitted to himself.</p><p>\u201cHow fares your mama this morrow?\u201d he asked, gesturing for the person he loved the most in the world to sit on a cushioned chair next to him.</p><p>Maris\u2019s pretty face creased in a frown. \u201cShe has been awake since last evening, but she mumbles and raves on about things I do not understand. She speaks of a \u2018great sin,\u2019 and of \u2018damnation,\u2019 and in great despair of \u2018halting this mistake\u2019. She will not explain to me. Her body is fine, \u2019tis her mind that worries me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do not understand this,\u201d Merle stroked his beard as he was wont to do when confronted with such a problem. \u201cMy lady has never been as energetic and strong as you, daughter, yet she has not been prone to such fainting spells either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she is with child?\u201d Maris suggested, then shook her head before Merle was able to react. \u201cNay, Papa, for you have just returned home. I do not understand it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that is not why you have cornered me in my chambers, is it, my sweeting?\u201d Merle asked. \u201cMethinks you have come to share with me your displeasure for the announcement I so rudely surprised you with last eve.\u201d His gaze was soft, but his words were firm. \u201cI shall tell you now, daughter, that I will brook no arguments from you in this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Twas not as much of a surprise as you may have anticipated, my lord,\u201d she told him primly. \u201cYou did make a warning to me when Victor and his father arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that is true. I confess, I expected more of an argument from you on this. Have you then come to terms with my decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Victor made it very clear to me that I was soon to belong to him,\u201d Maris told him without trying to hide the bitterness in her voice. \u201cAs we rode through the village, first he deplored my knowledge of English, telling me I will be a laughing stock when he takes me to court...and then he attacked me.\u201d Tears welled in her eyes and she wiped them away with sharp movements.</p><p>Merle stilled, shocked at the presumption of the young man, and yet, at the same time, he knew how provoking his daughter could be. \u201cHe attacked you for no reason?\u201d</p><p>Maris had the grace to drop her eyes from his steely gaze. \u201cN nay, Papa. I could not bear to listen to his pompous words and hold Hickory to a mere trot, so I let her go and we raced across the north field. We stopped at the wood, and he caught up to us there. He was not in good humor.\u201d Her face had gone pale.</p> <p>\u201cDid he strike you? I see no bruises,\u201d Merle asked, more disturbed at the expression of revulsion on her face than her words.</p><p>\u201cNay. He did not strike me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a man\u2019s right to strike his wife,\u201d Merle reminded her, though his concern was heightened. \u201cAlthough I do not believe it is seemly for a stronger one to exert his power over a weaker one in such a way.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMayhaps I have not done right by you, Maris, in keeping you not only from court and those who live there, but also in protecting you from the harshness of this world. You\u2019ve not been raised to expect anger or violence from your hoydenish ways...yet outside of Langumont, many would be appalled at your actions, and your disregard for propriety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa\u2014\u201d Maris\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>He stopped her by drawing her into a tight embrace. \u201cMaris, love, you must know that it is above all important to me to provide for you, and ensure that you are cared for. I know that you do not wish to marry, but you must know that I love you, above all things on this earth, and that it is only the recent reminder of my mortality that has prompted me to finalize your betrothal. I know that I will not always be here to protect you, sweeting, and that is the only reason that I would send you away to wive with any man. Lord Victor will care for you, and for Langumont.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Papa.\u201d Her voice was choked with tears. \u201cHe hurt me, Papa, and I fear what he will do when we are wed.\u201d</p><p>Merle turned cold and he set her away from him. \u201cDid he violate you?\u201d Rage began to build from his core.</p><p>He well remembered the broken, bruised Joanna of Swerthmore, whom Maris had helped with her healing salves. The girl was now wed to Bernard of Derkland, but her first marriage had been one of violence and fear.</p><p>He would never allow such a thing to happen to his own daughter.</p><p>Maris swallowed heavily, \u201cN nay, Papa. He was rough, and he groped about....\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>Merle forced a kindly smile for his daughter, and though he was more disturbed than he let on, his words were jovial. \u201cMy love, you are a beautiful woman...and I am certain it was merely that he was overcome with passion for you. Remember, you are soon to become his wife. Do you not fret, love, he will be good to you.\u201d Or I shall peel every piece of skin from his body. \u201cNow, go you and see to your mother. Tell her I will visit anon.\u201d</p><p>When Merle was left alone in his chamber, he found himself unable to concentrate on the tasks at hand. His daughter\u2019s fearful, yet resigned, face haunted him. Truly, was he doing right by her? Had he made the right decision?</p><p>His mind wandered back to the evening he\u2019d spent wandering the battlements of his beloved Langumont...and the conversation he\u2019d exchanged with Dirick Derkland. Harold must have been very proud of his son, Merle thought to himself.</p> <p>Merle thought for a long time, all that day and for the remainder of the evening. He watched with a hawk\u2019s eye the others at table with him: his wife and daughter, Michael and Victor d\u2019Arcy.</p><p>Maris braved the evening meal as she imagined her father would stand in battle. She was polite, if a little reserved to their guests, solicitous to her mother, who had insisted upon rising from her bed, and warm to her father.</p><p>Yet the time to retire did not come too soon for her. She was anxious to be away from Victor\u2019s proprietary gaze, anxious to have time to plan her next strategy. The betrothal ceremony would take place the next afternoon, and at that time, she would truly belong to Victor d\u2019Arcy as completely as if she\u2019d wed him. Maris was realistic enough to know that while she couldn\u2019t stop the betrothal, or change her father\u2019s mind, she might be able to delay it.</p><p>Or, if she truly had no other choice, she thought, gnawing at her lower lip as she gathered her skirts to climb over the bench, she would find a way to make peace with Victor.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Papa,\u201d she stopped behind her father\u2019s chair at the fireside.</p><p>He looked at her with sad, old eyes. \u201cDaughter, I vow, all will be well. Know that I love you above all.\u201d</p><p>Tears skimmed the corners of her eyes: she loved and trusted her father. \u201cAye, Papa,\u201d she said softly, trying to regain her composure. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her nearly onto his lap in a bear hug, making her feel as if she were but three years of age. \u201cI want only the best for you,\u201d he told her yet again. \u201cBelieve you this. Good morrow, my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morrow, Papa,\u201d she pressed a kiss to his bristling cheek and swept from the room, dashing back the tears that once again threatened.</p><p>In the privacy of her chambers, Maris found Verna strangely jumpy. \u201cGo on,\u201d she told her maid tiredly. \u201cGet you to the man who waits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, milady,\u201d her servant told her, slipping from the room with undue haste.</p><p>Maris collapsed on her bed, drawing thick furs up to cover her from head to toe. The fire that had been laid was burning merrily, and the chamber was not cold at all\u2014still, she felt the need to hide from the world.</p><p>She must have slept, for suddenly she was being shaken awake.</p><p>\u201cMilady,\u201d whispered Verna urgently, shaking her shoulders rather too roughly. \u201cMilady, you must come\u2014Ernest of the hillock has been grievously injured.\u201d</p><p>Maris\u2019s mind cleared of sleep instantly. She nearly leapt from the bed. \u201cPlease, Verna, my green overtunic,\u201d she said, fumbling to draw her shoes on.</p><p>\u201cNay, milady, there is no time,\u201d Verna told her, pulling Maris\u2019s blue cloak from a trunk. \u201cWidow Maggie says you must come at once.\u201d</p><p>Maris tied her long hair into a knot and stuffed it into an enveloping scarf. Her servant moved closer to wrap her in the cloak. Quickly, she pulled the basket with her herbs from the nearby trunk and whisked from the room in Verna\u2019s wake.</p><p>The keep was fairly silent, and very dark. Even the boy who tended the fire in the Hall was nodding off at his post. Maris did not have the heart to waken him on such a chill, dark night\u2014although upon her return, she\u2019d have a few words with him.</p><p>\u201cCome, milady,\u201d Verna urged, reaching for her arm to pull her through the hall.</p><p>Maris did not care for the strength of the other woman\u2019s grip\u2014nor her familiarity\u2014and she shook the tight fingers from her wrist. Her servant scarcely noticed, so quickly was she skirting through the Hall, and then out into the bailey.</p><p>At the gates to the portcullis, Maris hailed the guards\u2014who were not, fortunately, following the example of the fire tender\u2014and explained her mission. They waved her on through, misliking her intent to wander through at the darkest part of the night, but following her commands to remain at their post. \u201cYou need not rouse a guard for me,\u201d she told them. \u201cI have Verna, and we are going only to Ernest Hillock\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>Verna, for her part, barely stopped as Maris greeted the guards. \u201cCome, milady,\u201d she urged again. \u201cHe is not well.\u201d She led her mistress through the dark streets of the village, through the center square and to the south side.</p><p>\u201cWidow Maggie awaits within,\u201d Verna told her, opening the door to a dark hut and gesturing Maris to go ahead.</p><p>Maris stepped incautiously through the doorway and instantly, two strong hands grabbed her. One covered her mouth tightly, smothering her instinctive scream, and the other banded around her arm as she struggled against a forceful grip that dragged her up against a solid body. The cloak fell from her shoulders, leaving her only clothing the light chemise she\u2019d worn in bed.</p><p>A man grunted as he felt a well placed kick, and he retaliated with a blow to her face that sent her head snapping aside. The pain stunned her for a moment, and the next thing she knew, a thick cloth was shoved into her mouth, gagging her. She tried to bite at the fingers that pressed it in there, and succeeded in tasting dirty flesh. Before she knew what was happening something rammed her knees from behind, sending her buckling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cTake care, ye idiot,\u201d came rough voice. \u201cHe wants her alive and well!\u201d</p><p>She gasped in pain and fear, struggling weakly now as her hands were bound behind her back with heavy rope. Lying on a cold dirt floor, she was suddenly overcome by violent shivering and a rising swell of nausea. Her cheek throbbed from where she\u2019d been hit and though she twisted and fought, she was held tightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMake haste!\u201d someone whispered.</p><p>A heavy cloth was thrown over her head, and she felt herself rolled loosely in the burlap from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the cloak,\u201d came a voice she recognized as Verna\u2019s, and Maris\u2019s struggles began anew at the realization that her own maid had betrayed her.</p> <p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d sneered a man\u2019s voice.</p><p>Maris, shocked, but still able to hear, focused on the sounds that followed. There was a surprised gasp from her maidservant, then the sounds of slaps against flesh, then thuds and and grunts. Verna gave a stifled shriek, moaning throughout the struggle. There were at least three men, Maris\u2019s fogged mind decided, and through the sounds that ensued, she had an ugly suspicion as to what they were doing to her.</p><p>One of the men groaned loudly, and there was a particularly harsh whimper from the maid.</p><p>Finally, there was silence but for the sounds of harsh breathing. Maris, truly terrified, held her breath, wondering if she was next. Rough hands plucked at the enveloping burlap, and she felt herself being lifted into the air, over someone\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHide her,\u201d said the voice closest to her. \u201cI\u2019ll take this on ahead. Make haste, for the alarm may be sounded at any time.\u201d</p> <p>Maris felt herself being carried, and then felt herself flying briefly through the air as she was tossed into some type of platform. She landed heavily, bumping her head and hips against the floor, and then the vehicle began to move thereafter. The cold was beginning to seep through the cloth, and her fingers and toes felt the worst of it. Though the smelly, rough burlap was thick, she had not been rolled too tightly. Although her breathing was labored, she was able to draw it in some air.</p><p>After a time, she either lost consciousness or slept, for it must have been later that she was jostled from the cart. Her head pounded and the side of her face still hurt from where she\u2019d been struck. Still wrapped in the burlap, she shivered as she was placed over what must have been the back of a horse. Something warmer covered her then, and then she felt a rope over her back, securing her to the mount. Fear gripped her again as the horse was urged to a canter and then a hearty gallop, for she had no way to hold on, and if the rope gave, she would be trampled beneath the horse\u2019s hooves.</p><p>Up until now, her kidnappers had been relatively silent, except for short, terse directions from the one who gave the orders.</p><p>Who could have done this? she asked herself, willing her mind to focus. Earlier, someone had mentioned a \u201che\u201d, and obviously this \u201che\u201d didn\u2019t want her to be harmed.</p><p>Her first thought was Victor\u2014but that she dismissed immediately. Why would he abduct her if she was about to be betrothed to him?</p><p>She forced her mind to remain clear and work through the events slowly. Verna was involved\u2014although from the sounds of the struggle that had taken place\u2014it seemed that she was also somewhat expendable, for she\u2019d been left behind. In what condition she\u2019d been left behind, Maris, didn\u2019t know. She shuddered at the thought.</p> <p>Whoever it was, then, wanted her alive and for his own purposes. Ransom was a probable cause, or, mayhaps someone wished her powerful father to bend to his will in a political matter. At any rate, Maris tried to put her fears of being harmed to rest: obviously, if it were for a ransom, she would be returned unharmed.</p><p>They traveled for an interminable length of time, it seemed to her. In reality, she had no idea of day or night. Once, she was yanked off the horse and roughly unrolled from her covering then allowed to relieve herself in the nearby brush. Her arms were kept tied and her captor, whom she did not recognize, stood with his back to her. Embarrassed but desperate, Maris tried not to think of his proximity as she crouched in the snow.</p><p>Then she was made to sit near a small fire with the three men, and they fed her a hunk of cheese and a small crust of bread. One of them poured ale into her mouth, heedless of the streams that ran down her chin and throat. At one point, Maris tried to ask them who they were and what their purpose was, but she was silenced by the threat of a gag.</p><p>She was rolled back up into the burlap and loaded on the back of the horse again, and the journey continued.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Dirick sopped up the last of the juices from his bread trencher of bread with a hard crust. The Great Hall of Breakston was as loud and dirty as usual, and the food had not improved in the five days he\u2019d spent there. He\u2019d intended to leave the day before, but after witnessing the scene in which Berkle delivered his bad news to Bon, Dirick changed his mind. He sensed something was afoot, and decided to remain under Bon\u2019s roof for another day or two.</p><p>He\u2019d chosen an unfortunate day to remain at Breakston, however, for \u2019twas cold and snowing out side of the keep, and there were few amusements other than sitting near the stilted fire, or trading stories with the other men-at-arms. Dirick ached to be outside, exercising his swordplay and perhaps riding Nick, who was as eager as his master to be away from Breakston. As it was, it was barely past midday, and the time stretched before him.</p><p>Shoving away from the crude table, he ambled through the moldering rushes. One of the other mercenary knights who was in Bon\u2019s employ hailed him to a chess table, and Dirick gratefully accepted. They\u2019d just arranged their pieces when a great commotion erupted in the bailey.</p> <p>Bon leapt to his feet from the bench on which he\u2019d partaken of the midday meal. Dirick could see the glitter of excitement in his dark eyes, even from the corner where he sat. Excusing himself from the chess game, he stood slowly and unobtrusively made his way to stand near the high table. A group of men led by Berkle burst through the large oaken door carrying what looked like a long, rolled tapestry. As Dirick watched in amazement, a dozen of the men-at-arms gathered around. The serfs hovered in the background, staring with wide eyes.</p><p>With a quick flick of the wrist, Berkle yanked the tapestry roll, dropping it to the floor. It unrolled and a person\u2014a woman\u2014tumbled out, landing in the putrid rushes in a swirl of white gown and long, dark hair. Her hands were tied behind her back and she lay in the midst of her thick hair and the rushes, wincing as one of the dogs loped up to sniff at her. She wore a light chemise that had ruched up past the knees when she landed in her ignominious heap.</p><p>The gathered men reacted loudly with hoots and whistles, but the woman didn\u2019t move. \u201cSilence,\u201d shouted Bon angrily at his men. \u201cYou shall show respect to my bride.\u201d The jeers and laughter quieted momentarily.</p><p>Her long hair hid her face, but when Bon leaned forward to brush it back, thus revealing a pert nose and sensual lips, Dirick froze.</p><p>It was Maris of Langumont.</p><p>Stunned, Dirick barely refrained from leaping forward to shield her from the men that gathered around. The moment that he paused, and thus remained anonymous, likely saved his life. There was naught he could do at this moment. \u2019Twas best to stop, watch, and listen before acting.</p><p>As Dirick struggled to master his horror\u2014while at the same time, praising God that he had decided to stay longer at Breakston\u2014Bon solicitiously helped Maris to her feet and sliced through the rope that bound her wrists.</p><p>\u201cYou are well come to my home, my lady,\u201d he made a short bow.</p><p>Maris stood as straight as her stiff, trembling legs would allow. She was frightened and exhausted, her heart thumping so loudly she was sure it echoed throughout the hall. The trembling of her limbs made it nearly impossible to maintain what little composure she could draw to her defense. The chemise she wore was of the lightest linen and did not afford much protection from either cold or prying eyes, so she was thankful for her long hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you brought me here?\u201d she asked in a hoarse voice. She recognized him immediately from his visit to Langumont.</p><p>As of yet, she had not turned her attention from Bon de Savrille, and had not looked closely at the crowd of gawking men. Instead, though she was overwhelmed by fear, she forced herself to hold the dark gaze of the bearded man standing before her.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, I have brought you here to do you the honor of making you mistress of Breakston,\u201d Bon de Savrille told her as he reached for her hand.</p><p>But he froze, pushing back a thick lock of hair to look at what must be a large, purplish bruise on her left cheek.</p><p>He whirled on Berkle, the man who\u2019d been the leader of the group who\u2019d abducted her. \u201cYou have allowed my wife to be ill used!\u201d de Savrille screamed, spittle flying from his mouth. \u201cYou were not to harm a hair on her head were my very words to you, you low lying, cat sucking whoreson! Throw him in the dungeon,\u201d he screamed at a nearby guard.</p><p>A violently protesting Berkle was dragged from the hall, and immediately after issuing that command, a calmer Lord de Savrille returned his attention to Maris. He made a surprisingly subservient bow. \u201cI pray you will accept my apologies, my lady, for your abuse at the hands of my loyal knights.\u201d He leered at Maris, leaning forward to capture one of her hands in his and raising it to his mouth for a damp kiss.</p><p>Maris had been struggling to focus, to make sense of her predicament at the same time as keeping her composure.</p><p>Just as her thoughts began to separate and to clear, her gaze swept the group of men surrounding her. They rested on a face that was familiar, but out of place...and as the realization that Sir Dirick de Arlande stood in the crowd with her enemy, the world went blank.</p><p>She slid to the floor in the first swoon of her life.</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d exclaimed Ernest of the hillock as he was ushered to the dais in the great hall. Merle, along with his guests and wife, was breaking his fast after attending mass that morning.</p><p>\u201cMy lord Merle,\u201d began Gustave, who approached with the horrified serf, \u201cErnest begs an audience.\u201d</p><p>Ernest fairly trod upon the seneschal in his excitement to reach his lord\u2019s table. Executing a brief, but respectful bow, he stammered in his guttural English that he\u2019d found not only the body of Lady Maris\u2019s maidservant, Verna, but also his lady\u2019s brilliant blue cloak crumpled in the snow.</p><p>\u201cWhat say you?\u201d Merle bellowed, standing in his alarm. His words, too, were in English, and thus the meaning was lost upon the other nobility at the high table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, my lord, \u2019twas a fright to me, my lord, whenst I came upon the bloodied, ravaged body of Verna of Langumont. Her\u2019s not breathing or moving and sure as I stand, the wench is dead. And my lady Maris,\u201d his eyes grew round, \u201c\u2019twas nawt sign of her\u2019n but for her cloak, \u2019round the bend from mine own home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGustave, send for the guards of last eve,\u201d Merle roared in French to the hovering seneschal.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, what is it?\u201d cried Allegra, standing with a horror-stricken look on her face. Victor and Michael d\u2019Arcy had stopped eating as well.</p> <p>\u201cKnow you where Maris is this morn?\u201d asked Merle fiercely of his meal companions. \u201cHave ye seen her yet this morrow?\u201d</p><p>They each in turn shook their heads. Allegra\u2019s eyes had grown wide and her face pale as the snow beyond.</p><p>The guards from the watch of the night before rushed into the hall, startled out of their sleep, half dressed and with mussed hair.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d bowed the captain of the night watch. \u201cWhat is amiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid my daughter leave in the company of her maidservant during your watch?\u201d Merle fired the question before the man rose from his bow.</p> <p>\u201cAye, my lord, she said on as she were called to the side of Ernest of the hillock,\u201d explained the captain. \u201cHe was gravely injured.\u201d His eyes swiveled to Ernest and realization washed over his face. He looked back at his lord, \u201cShe is gone missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d said Merle. Then, his voice rising in supplication, he bellowed, \u201cHas no one seen my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Silence greeted him.</p><p>\u201c\u00c1 Langumont!\u201d he cried, standing and nearly toppling the large table in his haste. \u201cWe must search while the trail of her abductors is fresh! \u00c1 moi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord husband,\u201d Allegra\u2019s voice wavered, barely heard above the roar of men calling to arms. \u201cMy lord!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall return her to you safely, fear not,\u201d Merle told his wife, worry creasing his face even as he gave orders to his men.</p> <p>\u201cBut my lord, I\u2014I believe I may know whence she has been taken.\u201d Allegra plucked at the sleeve of his tunic. \u201c\u2019Tis my\u2014my brother\u2014my half brother, Bon de Savrille.\u201d</p><p>She was hardly able to choke out the words. Merle froze and turned, giving her his full attention as she stammered a wary description of his visit, including his threat to have Maris to wive.</p><p>Maris regained consciousness as she was carried up a long staircase.</p><p>Having never swooned before, she felt a momentary pang of shame that she\u2019d succumbed to such a feminine weakness...and then dismissed the misbegotten feeling immediately in light of her predicament.</p><p>Strangely, her blind fear had ebbed with her faint, and now she was able to think more calmly.</p><p>The buffoon who carried her none too gently up the stairs misjudged a corner, and one of her hands\u2014still ice cold\u2014slammed into the heavy stone wall. She could not hold back a moan of pain, but, mercifully, no one was behind to notice that her eyes had flown open at the shock. She determined to feign unconsciousness long enough to gain her bearings and make some sense of her situation. Assess the situation, her father told his pages and squires during their long training in the art of war, before developing a strategy.</p><p>It was, however, more difficult than she\u2019d anticipated to fake an extended faint...especially when she was dumped unceremoniously onto a bed of some sort. Through slitted eyes, she recognized that the clumsy oaf who\u2019d carried her jerkily up the stairs was none other than her intended husband\u2014at the least, it was his intention that he be her husband.</p><p>\u201cAgnes!\u201d he bellowed suddenly, and Maris nearly jumped at the loud noise.</p> <p>Then there was a rustling sound, followed by a voice, squeaky with fear. \u201cAye, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee to my betrothed,\u201d ordered Bon in a rough voice. \u201cShe is weak after her long journey. I would that she were bathed and dressed and prepared to sup with me at the evening meal.\u201d There was a short silence, then, \u201cAnd see to it that she is cared for as befits her station. Do you not forget she is to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>Maris held her breath as she felt his presence near her face. A large hand took hers and raised it to dry lips and a brush of prickly moustache. \u201cUntil later, my lady,\u201d he murmured. She felt the air stir as he whirled and left the room, bellowing for hot tubs of water for her bath.</p><p>She was to be his wife. Maris held back a shudder at the thought. Not bloody likely!</p><p>She listened carefully, eyes still closed, as Agnes bustled about the room. She heard calm, efficient orders were given to the servants who brought sloshing buckets of water, along with linens and other rustling items, into the chamber.</p><p>As she lay in repose, listening, her mind whirled, uncontained.</p><p>The biggest shock of all was no longer her abduction\u2014for Bon de Savrille\u2019s purpose was clear\u2014but that Dirick de Arlande was here. In the home of her captor.</p><p>The pit of her stomach\u2014mostly empty, for the fare on her unexpected journey had been little more than hard bread and old cheese\u2014twisted in fear and anger. Had he merely wooed her, and her father, too, in order to plot her kidnapping for Bon de Savrille?</p><p>Many things made sense now, she thought, trying to keep her lips from twisting bitterly. His destrier was much too fine and expensive to belong to a mere mercenary knight...and his knowledge about Henry\u2019s court had been so pat that she\u2019d wondered how a traveling knight from France knew such detail. And Papa\u2014and she\u2014had taken him at his word, invited him into their home, and treated him as an honored guest all the while he plotted to snatch her for his master!</p><p>Maris swallowed, holding back tears. And he\u2019d even kissed her, making her feel as if\u2014</p><p>Nay. She would not think on that.</p><p>At the last, there was silence. Maris heard the door close, and the unmistakable sound of a bar sliding into place across it. She was just about to open her eyes when the barest of sounds told her that someone was still in the room.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, you may open your eyes,\u201d came a quiet voice. \u201cAll have gone save myself. But be yourself ware, my lord has stationed a guard outside your chamber.\u201d</p><p>Maris\u2019s eyes snapped open in surprise. They rested on a woman, similar in age to herself, with thick honey colored hair and a long purple scar that ran from the corner of one eye to the edge of her jaw. It was old enough to be healed, but it had done so by misshapening her eyelid.</p><p>Agnes tilted her head shyly. \u201c\u2019Tis oft I have feigned the same faint, my lady. I knew you were aware.\u201d She drew near the bed as Maris\u2019s gaze traveled the chamber for the first time.</p><p>It was larger than she\u2019d expected, and while not as luxurious as her own chamber at Langumont, the bed was fairly comfortable and there were tapestries\u2014threadbare though they were\u2014over the slitted windows to keep out the drafts. The fire, at least, was enthusiastic, although the rest of the chamber left little to on which to comment.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to bathe, my lady?\u201d asked Agnes. \u201cThe warm water will ease your hurts.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, Maris could smell the comforting scent of rosemary wafting from the tub that had been placed before the fire. \u201cAye, I think that I should do that, at the least.\u201d</p><p>She struggled up from her repose on the bed, and Agnes, though less quick than her own maid Verna, was just as efficient in pulling off her filthy, stained shift and helping her into the tub.</p><p>Verna.</p><p>The thought of her maid shot into Maris\u2019s mind and a well of fear and anger erupted within. How dare her own maid betray her in this manner! There was no doubt that Verna had lured her from the comforts of her own bed to the waiting arms of her kidnappers. Maris felt ill. She\u2019d been betrayed by two people she trusted.</p><p>Then Maris recalled the violent sounds of Verna\u2019s own fate. Swallowing back a lump in her throat, she tried not to think about what those sounds had meant.</p><p>Agnes, though awkward, was gentle as she washed the tangled mass of Maris\u2019s long hair and bathed her with a faintly scented rosemary soap. In fact, Maris felt lulled by these familiar comforts as she struggled to determine a strategy. She must have a plan, for she had no intention of wedding the coarse, greasy Bon de Savrille.</p><p>Verily, her father had noted her disappearance by now. That realization gave her some ease. If anyone could rescue her, her father could. All Maris had to do, she realized, was delay Bon\u2019s intent\u2014for it didn\u2019t make sense that he\u2019d plan to hurt his intended bride\u2014until her father could get there. He\u2019d besiege the keep, take it apart stone by stone, brick by brick, to get to her.</p><p>Maris drew in the first easy breath since her abduction two days ago. She must stall and delay and play along with Bon de Savrille and his game.</p><p>Agnes helped her out of the tub and to a stool that sat before the fire. Maris, wrapped in a woolen blanket, stared into the flames as the maid tugged a wooden comb through her hopelessly snarled hair.</p><p>\u201cYer hair is beautiful, my lady,\u201d said Agnes, breaking the silence.</p><p>Although Maris did not feel inclined toward conversation, she responded, \u201cMany thanks, Agnes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord wishes for you to sup with him this eve,\u201d Agnes told her. \u201cDo you wish for me to say you are still ill?\u201d</p><p>Maris was silent for a moment, considering. How she would love to remain ensconced in this chamber, away from the prying, greedy eyes of her kidnapper...yet, the start of a plan had already begun to formulate in her mind, and she needed more information to know if \u2019twould work.</p><p>\u201cNay, Agnes,\u201d she replied after a moment. \u201cI shall sup with Lord Bon, as he wishes. It does not seem prudent to anger him, aye?\u201d Hoping to learn more about her captor, and as yet unsure whether Agnes would be a help or a hindrance to her, she craned her head to look back at the maid.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, my lady, my lord has a brutal temper,\u201d agreed Agnes. \u201cAn\u2019 one ne\u2019er knows when \u2019twill break.\u201d She could not suppress a shudder. \u201cYet, my lady, he seems overly fond of you...in fact, I have heard stories that when he is in his cups, he sings love ballads in your honor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Maris could not hide the shocked expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d began Agnes, hesitating. She took a deep breath and began again, \u201cMy lady, you did not come here of your own will, I trow.\u201d</p><p>Maris gave a short, humorless bark of laughter. \u201cNay, Agnes, of course I do not. I would wed with no man under my own will. Yet, I have a betrothed of my father\u2019s wishes that I have been snatched from...though he is hardly no more a prize than is Lord Bon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy lady, I would\u2014I would do all I may to help you...an\u2019....\u201d Agnes swallowed, trembling, her eyes fearful as she looked up at Maris. \u201cI would ask a boon, my lady. I know \u2019tis unseemly to ask, my lady,\u201d her words now tumbled out as if she could not stop them, \u201cbut I would wish to leave here in exchange for\u2014for helping you.\u201d</p><p>Maris turned a cool gaze on the frightened maid before her. A prickle of mistrust niggled up her spine. \u201cHow might I help you leave as I am my own prisoner here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, you are the daughter of a powerful lord, \u2019tis certain that he or your betrothed will come for you,\u201d Agnes whispered, yet cowering as if waiting for a hand to strike her face. \u201cAn\u2019 I would go with you when they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are mistreated?\u201d Maris asked mildly.</p><p>Although she\u2019d never been approached by a servant requesting aid, it was not an uncommon occurrence. The serfs that were bound to a land were also bound to its master, and even though she may escape with the help of her father, stealing a serf was another matter entirely. \u201cI cannot take you from your master.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d Agnes swallowed heavily, then continued, \u201cI am a freewoman, my father a merchant near York, when I was taken from him. I wish only to be free from Lord Bon.\u201d She unconsciously touched the purple scar. \u201c\u2019Tis but a reminder of his anger.\u201d Tears welled in her eyes, and despite her misgivings, Maris felt sympathy washing over her.</p><p>\u201cAs you shall help me, I vow repayment in kind,\u201d she told the other woman, who, by mere misdirection of the Fates, was serving her rather than living the life of a merchant\u2019s wife. Ofttimes, the family of a merchant was even wealthier than those of the nobility, whose wealth lay in the land rather than commercial goods. She could not leave Agnes here.</p><p>\u201cThank you my lady!\u201d Agnes fell to her knees, the tears tumbling forth. \u201cPraise God and thank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, then.\u201d Maris became business like and drew the maid to her feet. \u201cWe must have a strategy. You must tell me all that you know about my lord and his plans, and we shall decide how to proceed from there.\u201d</p><p>As the women plotted in the abovestairs chamber, taking care to keep their voices at a low level, a different scene unfolded below.</p><p>Dirick had not missed the look of shock, and then loathing, that had flitted across Maris\u2019s face when she saw him. Fortunately, she\u2019d slumped to the floor before announcing thus to the entire great hall, and he considered that not a small bit of good fortune.</p> <p>And though no one else seemed to notice her reaction, he felt her anger slice through him, followed by a stifling fear when Bon de Savrille gathered her up in his arms to carry her above. Dirick almost started after them, determined to do whatever he had to in order to protect the lady\u2019s virtue.</p><p>He would have, in fact, done so if he\u2019d not noticed Edwin Baegot watching him carefully. Despite his urgent desire to protect her, Dirick forced himself to remain still. He would be no help to Maris of Langumont if Bon learned his true reason for being there.</p><p>When Dirick heard the lord of the keep bellowing for hot water to be brought to the above stairs chamber, and then the heavy footsteps of Bon himself returning to the hall, he realized he had some time yet before Maris and her maidenhead were in danger\u2014assuming that Victor d\u2019Arcy hadn\u2019t already helped himself to it.</p><p>Sinking onto a short stool, Dirick stared into the fire that snapped viciously in its enclosure.</p><p>First, he must send a message to Merle of Langumont. Finding someone in the village that could be trusted would be a battle in itself, but a healthy palm of coin would ease the way.</p><p>Then, he mused, plucking at a string on his tunic, he must find a way to delay the imminent wedding while protecting Maris\u2019s virtue: all without arousing his host\u2019s suspicion.</p><p>Dirick was just returning from his sojourn to the village\u2014ostensibly to visit a whore\u2014when the keep\u2019s inhabitants were shoving and jostling for place for the evening meal. He\u2019d paid a heavy coin to a young man to carry the message to Langumont, as well as promising him that Merle would place him in his household as reward for defying Bon de Savrille.</p><p>Pushing his way between two men at arms who were arguing about the most desirable quality in a destrier\u2014its weight or its thirst for blood\u2014Dirick was able to find a place on the third bench from the dais. Hoisting a leg over the crude bench, he nudged at one of the hounds that slept beneath the table, moving the dog so he could take his seat.</p> <p>Glancing at the high table, he saw Bon sitting in his large, throne like chair. The bearded man sent expectant looks toward the stairs between strains of his conversation with Edwin, who sat at his left. Dirick was surprised to note that Bon seemed to have tidied his appearance. His beard was trimmed for the first time in three days, and the tunic he wore was not despoiled with any stains or tears. Even the man\u2019s dark hair had been subdued, brushed back from his high forehead and leaving wings of gray at his temples.</p><p>There was a murmur at the back of the hall, and, the nape of his neck prickling with expectancy, Dirick turned to see Maris descending the stairs. Voices quieted and Bon\u2019s attention snapped to the woman who wended her way between the benches and tables. A tall, fierce looking man with a hooked nose followed in her wake.</p><p>The hall seemed to have frozen in time, all conversation dying, as Maris passed through. She did not at all look like a maiden who had been kidnapped from her beloved father, wrapped in a tapestry for a day, dumped into a room of gawking men, and threatened with an unwanted marriage. She looked regal, confident, and incredibly beautiful.</p><p>Someone\u2014Dirick assumed that it was the scar faced Agnes\u2014had combed through the length of rich brown hair, coiling a huge mass of it intricately at the back of her head. She wore no wimple, and a great length of it, glinting gold and chestnut in the candlelight, fell from the coil, brushing the backs of her thighs as she walked. The gown she wore, though not as fine as one she might have worn at Langumont, was more than appropriate for this ramshackle hall. The blue of the gown was so deep it shone like the midnight sky, and bright yellow embroidery trailed along the edges of long sleeves that nearly brushed the floor. A girdle encircled her waist and she wore a heavy chain of gold links around her neck.</p><p>Dirick took a deep steadying breath. How could she look so beautiful and unconcerned when she was in so much danger? Had she realized by now that he would help her, that she had naught to fear from him?</p><p>Maris took her time making her way to the high table where Bon awaited her. The hook nosed man that trod upon the train of her gown was Sensel, the guard appointed to watch over her. She breathed easily, keeping her pace slow as she fought to maintain her composure.</p><p>Papa is on his way. Papa is coming. She repeated the chant over and over in her mind.</p><p>When she reached the high table, Maris almost lost her nerve. But then, steeling herself, she took the last step and swept into a beautiful curtsey at Bon\u2019s feet. \u201cMy lord,\u201d she murmured, looking at the battered boots he wore.</p><p>There was a moment of stunned silence, and then she heard a rumbling voice. \u201cAnd see you, Edwin, the honor my wife pays me.\u201d Bon stepped down from the dais, taking Maris\u2019s hand and raising her to her full height. She modestly kept her eyes downcast until he said, \u201cMy lady, \u2019tis I who am honored at your presence. Come you and sup with me.\u201d</p><p>Maris barely restrained a nervous giggle. Honored at her presence, indeed. As if she\u2019d found her own way to Breakston\u2014wherever that was. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Bon was solicitous as he assisted her onto the bench next to his place. \u201cI had half expected to drag you kicking and screaming down to sup with me,\u201d he said, filling her goblet with thin wine. \u201cSensel had my orders. \u2019Tis glad I am that you chose to obey my wishes.\u201d His steely blue stare fastened upon her.</p><p>Maris looked at him from under her long lashes, refusing to be intimidated by his glare. \u201cAye, my lord, your wish that I join you\u2014and not only for supper\u2014was quite evident,\u201d she said demurely. \u201cYet, I beg that any future travel arrangements you make for me will have more care to my comfort than these last.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Bon laughed, turning every head in the hall back to the dais. He cocked his head to one side, taking a large gulp of wine. \u201cAnd have you any other requests regarding your comfort, my lady?\u201d</p><p>One of the serfs approached with a wooden platter of food, followed by another with several bread trenchers. Bon, as gallantly as any courtier, chose bits of meat and potatoes for them, placing the choicest pieces of rabbit on her side of the trencher.</p><p>Maris favored him with a brilliant smile, and its brightness seemed to be enough to stun even the sour Edwin, for he smiled in return.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, how kind of you to ask after my comfort,\u201d she said sweetly, dragging a crust of hard bread through the meat\u2019s juices. \u201cThere are a few suggestions I might make, my lord. For I am to be your chatelaine, am I not? I should not wish your hall to seem lacking to any visitors.\u201d</p><p>Bon stilled, turning to look at her. She could almost see the suspicion darting through his mind, like a rabbit through its warren. \u201cYou are to be my chatelaine, and my wife,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cYou seem to be much too well accustomed to this notion, my lady. What game do you play?\u201d</p><p>Maris wondered if perhaps she\u2019d gone too far, but \u2019twas too late now and she must dodge his blow, thrusting with her own. \u201cMy lord,\u201d she looked at him without wavering, \u201cit appears that I have no choice in the matter. And in truth, as I must wed, methinks I\u2019d sooner wed with a man whose desires for me are such that he should risk everything to whisk me away under my own father\u2019s nose\u2014rather than wed the sop eyed man chosen by my papa.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bon looked surprised for a moment, and then a pleased smile settled over his features. \u201cI do believe I have received my first compliment from the lady,\u201d he said to Edwin.</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord,\u201d Maris agreed, \u201cand now, may I ask a boon of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMay I be given charge of your steward and your cook?\u201d</p><p>The expression on his face would have been comical if she\u2019d been in the mood to appreciate it. \u201cMy steward and my cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord. The state of this hall is deplorable...and this food is not fit for the dogs that crowd about my feet.\u201d Her words, for the first time that evening, were truly in earnest.</p><p>Maris did not think she could survive until her father arrived to rescue her if she had to partake of what passed for food in this keep. \u201cWhen was the last time these rushes were changed?\u201d she asked, kicking at them under the table and landing her pointed toe in the ribs of a well fed hound. \u201cAnd though my chamber is comfortable enough, it could use a good cleaning as well. It must be done before we are wed, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are to be wed on the morrow, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn the morrow?\u201d Maris managed to turn an expression of shock into one of joy before he could note the difference. \u201cMy lord, how you honor me!\u201d Then, as if ashamed, she ducked her head.</p><p>After a quick, sharp prick of her fingernail at the corner of her eye, Maris raised her face and fixed him with a wide eyed look pooled with manufactured tears. \u201cBut, Lord Bon, I have naught to wear...and surely you would not wish to dishonor me by inviting our guests to a hall in such a state. Why, and if we are to wed on the morrow, I cannot have the time to prepare a proper meal for your vassals and your men. I do not know what the stores hold, nor the talents of your cook.\u201d</p><p>He fixed her with a shrewd look and her heart stopped. Had she gone about it too obviously? \u201cMethinks you are inventing excuses, my lady,\u201d Bon said. \u201cI shall not be dissuaded from wedding with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, my lord, I am most aware that we shall wed upon your word...yet, I implore you...please do you not dishonor me in this way.\u201d She wiped another tear away. \u201cI should at the least want the bedchamber prepared for our wedding night.\u201d Maris had to work to make the words sound convincing, hardly believing that those words could issue from her mouth without nauseating her. She caught his gaze shyly from under her lashes, then turned away, lest he think her too bold.</p><p>\u201cAh...aye, our wedding night,\u201d he responded thoughtfully. \u201cMayhaps I shall make tonight our wedding night, my lady, and delay our nuptials as you ask.\u201d</p><p>Maris felt the blood drain from her face. \u201cMy lord, you would not dishonor me such!\u201d she replied carefully, trying to sound only frightened and not as desperate as she was. \u201cIf we do not have the blooded sheets to display after the eve of our wedding, there will no doubt be questions as to whether we are truly wed. All will cast aspersion on our vows, and mayhaps I shall be taken from you and returned to my betrothed.\u201d</p> <p>Bon did not reply immediately. She knew she was right, though he may be loath to admit it. Taking a bride by force was one thing, and being able to prove the validity of the wedding and its consummation was the crux of its success. It all came down to the one in possession of not only the bride, but her maidenhead as well.</p><p>After what seemed like forever, Bon replied. His words were magnanimous, as if he were doing her a great favor. \u201cAye, my lady, as you argue so prettily, I shall grant your wishes and allow you to order my kitchen and steward. However, I will not delay the wedding more than one day hence, my lady, so mark me well and be efficient in your work. On the day after the morrow, we shall be wed.\u201d His face leered close to hers, \u201cAnd I shall anticipate that evening greatly.\u201d</p><p>Maris took a large swallow of wine. Folding her hands in her lap, she asked demurely, \u201cMay I then beg your leave, my lord, as I have much with which to occupy myself on the morrow. And, truly, I cannot partake of this meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Lady Maris, hie yourself to your chamber. Sensel will guard your door this night so you may sleep in peace.\u201d</p><p>Head held high, Maris gathered her skirts and stepped over the bench, and off the dais. She made her way carefully through the hall, aware not only of the man dogging her footsteps, but also of the many pairs of eyes that followed her.</p><p>There was one countenance that she recognized among the sea of faces. And upon that familiar face, she turned a look of such loathing and disgust that Dirick de Arlande could barely hold her gaze before returning to his goblet of ale.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>Maris found her chamber a welcome refuge after a meal at which she poised on tenterhooks. Agnes was waiting for her when Sensel swung the door open, gesturing for Maris to enter.</p> <p>As the great oaken door closed ominously behind her, Maris resisted the urge to sag weakly onto the bed. Instead, she stood in front of the fire that roared in the grate and tried to calm the tremors that shook her hands. Although she\u2019d hid it well, her heart had been lodged in her throat during the entire meal, making it nigh impossible to choke down the smallest bits of food. That, at the least, she had not had to lie about.</p><p>She seemed to have fooled Bon, however, and for that she was thankful.</p><p>\u201cAgnes, know you whither herbs are kept here at Breakston?\u201d she asked, sinking onto a three legged stool next to the blazing fire. She shivered.</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady, there are some still in the kitchens. Methinks the midwife in the village may have some as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am in need of as much pennyroyal as you can locate,\u201d Maris told her wearily. \u201cCan you gather it without arousing suspicion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I shall say \u2019tis a tonic for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Maris stared into the fire for a long moment, watching as the orange flames curled about the logs. \u201cWe must not give Lord Bon or Sensel any reason to believe you will assist me. Come you, sit near the fire\u2014here, Agnes, turn your face so that your cheek reddens. I shall make as if you have displeased me, and then you must leave quickly to fetch the pennyroyal. Be certain to show Sensel your reddened cheek so that he believes I have struck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady,\u201d Agnes agreed. She turned her unscarred cheek as directed, and as the warmth spread to her face, she watched in shock as Maris began to play act.</p><p>\u201cStupid wench!\u201d cried Maris suddenly, knocking over a tankard of ale. \u201cDo you not have any more sense than a dog?\u201d</p><p>With a loud shriek, she dropped a piece of wood near the fire. Just as the door swung open, Maris slapped her hands smartly together, creating the same sound as hand meeting cheek, and in a swift movement, grabbed Agnes\u2019s arm and jerked her away from the fire. \u201cGo you and do not come back until you have learned not to be so clumsy!\u201d</p><p>Giving the startled maid a shove toward Sensel, who glowered at the door, she added, \u201cI must have my tonic immediately!\u201d</p><p>Then Maris whirled angrily on Sensel, for he had no business bursting into her chamber unannounced. \u201cHow dare you enter my chamber without my leave?\u201d She planted her hands on her hips and stared up at him.</p><p>By this time, the altercation had caught the attention of the residents of the hall. Great clomping footsteps hurried up the stairs, and Bon, followed by several other men-at-arms, including Dirick de Arlande, crowded into the doorway of the chamber to see the interesting sight.</p><p>Apparently unaware of the witnesses behind him, Sensel\u2019s face darkened and he leaned threateningly toward Maris. \u201cMy lord has commanded that I guard you day and night, my lady, and I answer only to my lord Bon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may guard my door all you like, Sensel,\u201d Maris continued imperiously, \u201cbut you will not enter unless you are bid.\u201d</p><p>Then, as if she had just caught sight of her intended husband, who stood watching the scene, she swept into a curtsey. \u201cMy lord, I am sorry if I interrupted your meal. \u2019Tis only that clumsy girl pulled on my hair and overturned a goblet of ale. It nearly stained my gown. I\u2019d as lief take a switch to her if she does not attain some grace!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Agnes does not please you, my lady, I shall find another maid to serve you,\u201d Bon told her, taking her hand to his lips. He stared at her as if bewitched, and Maris knew she must take advantage of her success.</p><p>Maris paused as if to think on his suggestion. \u201cNay, my lord, as I have already begun her training. I should not wish to start again. I shall try her for a time. And if she does not improve, she will feel the back of my hand until she does.\u201d</p><p>Thus assured that his lady was satisfied, Bon turned on Sensel, his face darkening. \u201cNever did I bid you leave to enter my lady\u2019s chamber. You are dismissed. You shall take the night watch at the south tower until you are bid otherwise.\u201d His gaze scanned the gawking group of men and rested on Dirick. \u201cYou, sir, will replace Sensel. And know that if you should displease my lady, you will find yourself in a less desirable duty.\u201d</p><p>Dirick nodded smartly. \u201cAye, my lord.\u201d His eyes flickered to Maris, whose heart sank at the man\u2019s new appointment. He was the last man she would want guarding her door, for she suspected he would be more efficient than any of the other slothful ones. Likely, Bon had the same opinion of his men, and that was why he\u2019d selected Sir Dirick.</p><p>Before she could react, the chamber door slammed shut, leaving her in the chamber with Bon. He turned to her. \u201cAt last, my lady, we are alone.\u201d</p><p>Not for long, I pray. She eyed him with trepidation. \u201cAye, my lord, that we are. And what will be your pleasure? Wine, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBon. I wish for you to call me Bon when we are private.\u201d He was still looking at her as if besotted.</p><p>She used that opportunity to pour him a goblet of warm wine, wishing that she had a store of herbs in her chamber. \u201cDid you have ought you wished to speak with me on, my lord\u2014Bon?\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes glinted dangerously as he looked at her in the dim light. \u201cNay, my dear Maris. \u2019Tis only your company that I wished.\u201d</p><p>His heavy gaze did not waver from her, and Maris was beginning to feel discomfited. She carefully took a seat on the three legged stool closest to the fire, watching him warily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she began, wanting to keep the conversation going so that his thoughts would settle on the fact that she was alone with him and helpless, \u201cit would please me greatly to have use of the large chamber betwixt this and the garderobe. I will need such a chamber for a solar, where I and my women might work.\u201d</p><p>Bon\u2019s eyes, which had drifted to her bosom, snapped back to her face. \u201cYour women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord. How else shall I keep you in tunics, and tapestries on the walls?\u201d She looked guilelessly at him. \u201cYou are in need of a new tunic for our wedding...and do you not think me shallow, my lo\u2014Bon, yet I should like other than this to wear for that day.\u201d She gestured to the gown that fit rather too snugly through the bosom, and whose sleeves were the merest too long to be considered a perfect fit.</p> <p>His dark eyes gleamed. \u201cAnd for such a boon as that, my love, I wish a token of your affection in return. Come hither, dearling.\u201d He gestured to the floor near where he sat.</p><p>Maris hesitated, then, gathering her skirts, sank into a kneel next to his stool. Keeping her head lowered, for now she was truly fearful for her virtue, she made a great play of arranging her gown about her ankles. Bon reached down and grasped one of her hands, pulling it firmly to his lips. She concealed a shudder as moist lips smoothed over the back of her hand, then over the tender, inner side of her wrist. His tongue flicked out, like that of a snake, tracing the pale blue vein beneath her skin and she nearly jumped at the sensation. It was not pleasant in the least, reminding her of the way one of the hounds licked her hand when she had liniment on her fingers.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she murmured, trying to pull away. His grip tightened and he chuckled quietly. The lips continued to trail along her wrist, his fingers sliding her sleeve back, as he pressed moist kisses on the inside of her elbow.</p><p>\u201cBon, please,\u201d she looked up at him. \u201cPlease do not...tempt me so.\u201d Maris swallowed the clot of fear in her throat and managed a tremulous smile. \u201c\u2019Tis only one more day and we shall be truly wed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, \u2019tis one more day...an\u2019 two more nights,\u201d Bon agreed, his voice rough. His eyes glittered darkly, and she felt that same well of fear that she had when Victor slammed her against the tree. \u201cI would have a taste of what it is I\u2019ll wed, Maris.\u201d</p> <p>His fingers like iron bands, Bon pulled her to the front of his stool. Placing a hand under each elbow, he lifted her so that she was between the crux of his legs and half risen on her knees. One hand reached to hold the back of her head, his thick fingers sinking into the intricate coils of hair, as his bearded face leaned toward hers, blocking out the light from the candle behind him.</p><p>The hair on his face was rough over her smooth skin, and his lips were damp and sloppy. She tried in vain to twist her head away, but Bon\u2019s strength prevailed, and he succeeded in lifting her onto his lap even as his mouth smothered hers. Heavy, rough breathing rasped into her mouth as his kiss coaxed and demanded in turn.</p><p>Maris curled her fingers into his tunic to keep from scratching his face. Then she tried to push him away, and, at last, was able to free her mouth from his. His arms were around her waist, pinning her onto his lap, and, gasping for air, he looked down at her own heaving chest.</p><p>\u201cDo not be affrighted, my love,\u201d he said in what he must have thought was a seductive voice. \u201cI\u2019ll not hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Just then, there was a loud knocking at the chamber door. Maris leapt to her feet, but was jerked back onto a solid lap. \u201cNay, sweeting. I\u2019ll not be interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, my lord, \u2019tis no doubt Agnes with my tonic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour tonic can wait,\u201d he growled, seeking her lips once more.</p><p>With a cry, she managed to slide her face from his mouth, gaining a good scrape of beard across her cheek. \u201cNay, please my lord, if we do not answer the door, there will be much talk of what is happening herein, and then we shall be in quite a fix if there is any question as to our marriage.\u201d</p><p>The knocking became louder, sounding almost as desperate as she felt.</p><p>Bon\u2019s hand slipped down the front of her bodice, closing around her breast through the thin chemise under her bliaut. The other hand plucked at the lacings that held her bodice together.</p><p>Suddenly, the door swung open. Bon\u2019s head snapped up from Maris\u2019s bosom.</p><p>\u201cBegging your pardon, my lord, my lady...did you not bid me entrance?\u201d Dirick had a surprised look on his face, but he strode boldly into the chamber. \u201cIt looks as if the fire needs to be stoked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fire does not need to be stoked,\u201d Bon said meaningfully to Maris, his palm sliding down her back, all the way to the curve of her rump.</p><p>She squirmed in his lap, her face hot and her breathing unsteady. What was Sir Dirick doing? Then she saw Agnes hovering in the doorway. She pulled firmly from Bon\u2019s hands. \u201cThere you are, you lazy fool!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cHave you brought my tonic?\u201d</p> <p>From the corner of her eye, she saw Dirick jolt in surprise.</p><p>\u201cA aye, my lady,\u201d Agnes was obviously so accustomed to being spoken to in that manner that it was not difficult for her to feign fear. \u201cA tea of pennyroyal and chamomile, to help you sleep, my lady...and peppermint leaves to chase the ache from your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd about time it is,\u201d Maris snapped, taking the pitcher from Agnes more roughly than necessary. She turned, curtseying to Bon. \u201cMy lord, as we have been interrupted, I pray you will allow my maid to prepare me for bed. I have much to accomplish on the morrow to prepare for our wedding, as I wish to make you proud.\u201d She fairly held her breath, waiting to see if he would acquiesce, or if he would order Dirick and Agnes from the chamber and continue with his hands down her bliaut.</p><p>Bon swaggered to his feet and she gave a silent sigh of relief. \u201cAs you wish, my dearling,\u201d he said, as if granting her the moon. \u201cBut know that the taste I have had will barely suffice until we are well and truly wedded.\u201d</p><p>With the last press of a kiss to her hand, he turned to make his way from the chamber. After two steps, he halted in his tracks, turning toward Dirick\u2014who was still meddling with the fire. \u201cDirick, you belong on the outside of this chamber, and do you not forget that. Come now\u2014the fire is blazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you are dismissed.\u201d Maris turned regally away from him.</p><p>She felt Dirick still behind her, and then sensed it as he pulled himself to his feet with careful deliberation. For an instant, she felt him towering behind her. The hair on the back of her neck prickled, and she fancied she felt the spear of his stare driving into her back. Keeping her head high and her face averted, she walked over to the bed, untying the curtains that would keep the drafts out during the night.</p><p>Maris didn\u2019t turn until both men quit the chamber and the door shut behind them. At last she was able to breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady, are you\u2014are you untouched?\u201d Agnes asked in a low voice, pouring the pennyroyal tea into a goblet. \u201cI hurried as quickly as I could. Did my lord\u2014did he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d Maris took a long drink of the lukewarm tea, then refilled the goblet and drank again. \u201cThough \u2019twas a near thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, what is the purpose of the pennyroyal? Is it not for Lord Bon, that you planned to poison him in some way?\u201d</p><p>Maris shook her head and forced herself to drink more of the bitter tea. \u201cNay, for were he to be poisoned, would I not be the first at which the fingers would point? \u2019Tis to bring on my monthly flux. Bon will not touch me while I am unclean, and I pray my Papa will arrive before \u2019tis through. Bring me as much as you are able, as I must drink a good portion to ensure that it begins on the morrow. I must needs find some other way to keep him from me tomorrow night, as \u2019twill surely not start ere then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap there is something to put his lordship to sleep early,\u201d Agnes suggested.</p><p>\u201cMayhap, yet that is bound to be discovered. Is it not common for a bridegroom to spend the eve before his wedding fasting and doing penance?\u201d Maris asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not heard of such a thing, my lady,\u201d Agnes shook her head.</p><p>\u201cMethinks I\u2019ll make such a suggestion to my lord Bon, and I\u2019ll pray he swallows it.\u201d Maris took a final draught of pennyroyal tea, then, looking ruefully under the bed, added, \u201cI\u2019m certain to be up in the night to use this\u201d \u2014she pulled a chamber pot from under the high bed\u2014 \u201cafter drinking so much of this tea, but it cannot be helped. Here, Agnes, climb you into bed, and we shall keep the other warm.\u201d</p><p>Outside the chamber door, Dirick leaned against the rough stone wall, trying to erase the mental picture of the helpless Maris sprawled on Bon\u2019s lap, her breasts spilling from her gown.</p><p>He snorted. Helpless? Maris of Langumont was anything but helpless. She already had her abductor wrapped neatly around her little finger, and the ease with which she\u2019d done so was both admirable and frightening. Bon would probably set her free if she begged prettily enough.</p><p>Yet, he thought there\u2019d been more than a trace of fear in her eyes when he burst unannounced into her chamber. Maris was definitely not out of danger yet.</p><p>Dirick did some quick calculations: he\u2019d sent the messenger to Langumont just before the evening meal. The man would not reach his destination until late on the morrow...and then it would no doubt take Merle some time to gather his forces before they were on their way to Breakston. He estimated two days at best, more likely three, until Dirick would have help from that quarter. Unless by some miracle Merle had already discovered the identity of his daughter\u2019s abductor.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t have the luxury of three days, for Bon was determined to wed the day after the morrow.</p><p>Dirick leaned against the wall, considering his options. It wasn\u2019t the marriage itself that would be so much the problem: a forced marriage could easily be annulled, and he was a clear witness to the forced aspect of it. Nay, what concerned him the most was the harm that could be done to Maris in the meanwhile. The loss of a maidenhead, so crucial to a profitable marriage, could not be rectified, but it was the manner it which it would be taken that troubled Dirick. His insides soured at the thought of the stocky, hirsute Bon poised over Maris\u2019s delicate, white body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had to find a way to get her out of Breakston. But first, he had to get her to trust him, and in light of the dark, loathing looks she\u2019d sent his way...it wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>Maris awoke with a start to find her mouth muffled by a large hand, and a great weight pushing her into the bed. She panicked, thrashing frantically beneath the figure above her, ignoring his urgent whispers. Her eyes bulged wide open above the firm hand, trying to see her tormenter.</p><p>The chamber was still dim, although the fire, which had quieted during the night, gave off a low light, and a hint of dawn peered around the tapestries that covered the windows. She kicked and clawed viciously, forcing him to capture a wrist with his free hand.</p> <p>\u201cMaris, calm yourself,\u201d the voice urged, coming altogether too close to her ear.</p><p>She was as startled as he when, with one lucky thud, she placed a heavy kick near his groin and in the ensuing confusion, tumbled him off the bed. Then she let loose a blood curdling scream.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s blood, Maris!\u201d Dirick scrambled to his feet, tangling in the rumpled bedclothes. \u201cDo you want me killed that badly?\u201d He stood, staring down at her, hands on his hips, breathing heavily, his dark hair wild and his face furious.</p><p>\u201cSir Dirick!\u201d she exclaimed, her heart pounding madly and her knees still weak. \u201cHow dare you\u2014Where\u2019s Agnes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still and listen to me,\u201d he spoke rapidly and urgently. \u201cBy God, I mean you no harm. I will help you escape if you will only trust me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust you!\u201d she spat, pulling the bedclothes up to cover her bare thighs. \u201cPah! You were here to welcome me to this\u2014this serpent\u2019s lair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaris.\u201d In the interest of time, Dirick resisted the urge to throttle her. In fact, he could hear the stomping of feet drawing near. \u201cDammit, woman, I mean you no harm! I am sent by the ki\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door flew open and Bon burst in, followed by Edwin and two other men-at-arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat goes on here?\u201d Dressed only in a long loose shirt and sagging chausses, he brandished a sword and immediately set its point at Dirick\u2019s throat. \u201cI shall kill you as you stand for daring to enter my lady\u2019s chambers!\u201d The other men surrounded Dirick as he froze in place.</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d Maris\u2019s commanding voice stopped the final thrust of the sword. \u201cMy lord, this man\u2014er, Sir Drake? I cannot recall his name\u2014but entered the chamber in response to my scream.\u201d</p><p>She took on an expression of mortification. \u201cI am sorry, my lord, I could not sleep, and as I prepared to rise to stoke the fire, I saw a mouse skitter across the floor.\u201d She ducked her head in embarrassment as one of the men-at-arms snickered.</p> <p>Before Bon could question why he had had to open her chamber door if, indeed, Dirick had rushed in to her rescue, Maris put a pout of indignation on her face, even thrusting her lower lip out a bit as she\u2019d seen the little girl Bit do when she wanted aught from her father. \u201cAn\u2019 I see, my lord, that the rodents are yet another matter to which I must attend in this keep. Do you not think I could find a cat in the village and keep her in my chamber\u2014our chamber\u2014until we are well rid of these mice?\u201d She widened her eyes innocently, all the while heavily aware of Sir Dirick\u2019s attention on her and the sword-point at his throat.</p><p>Slowly, Bon dropped his blade and made the slightest bow to Dirick. \u201cMy apologies, sir. I am well pleased that you have taken my lady\u2019s well being to heart.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned to Maris. \u201cAlas, my lady, I do not care for cats...however, I shall think on your request.\u201d He said these words with such sincere formality that she had to swallow back a nervous giggle.</p><p>\u201cNow, if you please,\u201d she said, the imperiousness returning to her voice, \u201cI fear I am much exhausted from all of this excitement and should seek my bed.\u201d Her eyes fastened purposely on Bon. \u201cUntil the morrow, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil the morrow, my wife.\u201d And for the second time that night, Bon de Savrille meekly led his men from her chamber.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>Allegra had not risen from her bed since Merle led his army of men at arms to Maris\u2019s rescue. Maella fussed worriedly over her mistress, but the frail woman did nothing but clutch at a worn wooden crucifix and pray.</p><p>\u201cMilady, \u2019t has been nearly two days. You must eat!\u201d The maidservant thrust a bowl of broth under her lady\u2019s nose. \u201cLord Merle will bring the lady home safely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNay.\u201d Allegra\u2019s voice was hoarse from overuse in cantations to the saints. \u201cI have not much chance for life when he returns to Langumont. My lord Merle will kill me.\u201d</p><p>Maella\u2019s face grew soft at her mistress\u2019s confession. Pulling a stool near the bed, she smoothed a worn hand over the furrowed forehead of the woman she had served since birth, noticing the new white streaks throughout her soft brown hair. They had appeared over night. \u201cMy lord is just and fair. He holds no anger toward you for the actions of your brother, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d Allegra\u2019s hand curled around the hand that stroked her forehead. \u201cNay, Maella, \u2019tis not for that that I fear my life. \u2019Tis that I\u2014I have told Michael that he is Maris\u2019s true father, and begged him to release her from the betrothal.\u201d</p><p>The maidservant drew back sharply. \u201cMy lady, you did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter cannot wed with his son!\u201d Allegra\u2019s voice was stronger.</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady, but you did not tell the lord of the truth\u2014yet you told Lord Michael?\u201d</p><p>Allegra moved her head in affirmation. \u201cI dared not tell Lord Merle, Maella. I dared not,\u201d her voice trailed off weakly. \u201cGod forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Maris had a plan.</p><p>She spent the day ordering the serfs about in the Great Hall, poking into the foodstuffs in the kitchen, and finalizing her plans to escape. Sir Dirick trod, it seemed, in her every footstep so that she was unable to turn without barreling into his large frame, and despite her mistrust of him, she found herself almost\u2014almost\u2014relieved to have him near.</p><p>Lord Bon sat for much of the day in his throne like chair, watching in astonishment as Maris took the reluctant serfs to task. If either man noticed the absence of Maris\u2019s maid, Agnes, they did not comment on it.</p><p>At the midday meal, the preparation of which had been supervised by Maris, Bon dug heartily into the excellent fare\u2014as did the other diners.</p><p>\u201cAhh,\u201d he belched, patting the hand of his intended wife. \u201cI\u2019d not realized the lacking of my cook! If you continue to feed me thus, I\u2019ll not be able to sit a horse.\u201d He laughed as if \u2019twas impossible to imagine this coming to pass.</p><p>Maris, noticing his already considerable girth, chose not to comment. Instead, taking a last drink of ale, she poked the venison in her trencher to the side. \u201cMy lord, there was a stink to some of the meat hung in your kitchens,\u201d she told him. \u201cI do not believe any of it was prepared for the meal, yet I cannot be certain. Much of the venison had been stewing before I came upon it. In any case, I rid the kitchens of what was left of the bad meat, but, my lord, there is naught for our wedding feast on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not fret, my lady,\u201d Bon stroked her fingers, heedless of the grease that slicked his own. \u201c\u2019Twill not be the first I\u2019ve eaten bad meat...an\u2019 I have already planned a hunt on the morrow for our wedding feast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, you have astonished me yet again with your foresight!\u201d Maris fluttered her eyelashes at him as she pulled her hand away. Wiping it surreptitiously on the edge of his tunic, she clambered over the bench, noting with satisfaction that there was nary a crumb of food left for even the dogs to nibble on. \u201cPray excuse me, as I must see to the evening meal, now, my lord,\u201d she hurried away.</p><p>\u201cIt was an excellent meal, my lady,\u201d Dirick\u2019s deep voice came behind her as she crossed the hall.</p><p>Her back stiffened even as her heart leapt. She had not forgotten his rude awakening of her the night past, and the way his warm, solid body had pressed into hers. Thus, Maris studiously ignored the man as she entered the kitchens. After giving rapid direction to the cook, she gathered her skirts and returned to the hall to order the rotting rushes to be removed.</p><p>By the time new rushes were being spread upon the floor, Maris\u2019s stomach was churning. \u2019Twill begin any time now.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, I will withdraw to my chamber,\u201d she approached the dais. \u201cI do not feel well.\u201d The queasiness that stole over her was not entirely fabricated. \u201cI will nap and join you for supper.\u201d</p><p>Bon nodded graciously, \u201cOf course, my lady. I shall send Agnes to you ere I see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d Maris turned and walked steadily toward the stairs, aware of Dirick\u2019s dark gaze boring into her back. He must not suspect anything, she thought, pulling herself slowly up the steps. Desperate, knowing that his gaze had held a hint of suspicion at her excuse, Maris jammed a finger down her throat as she rounded the corner at the top of the steps.</p><p>She managed to gasp a convincing, \u201cSir D\u2014\u201d before she turned and retched up her dinner\u2014right onto Dirick\u2019s leather boots. Sagging against the rough stone wall, she struggled for breath against what was actually a laugh at the horrified look on his face.</p><p>\u201cPardon,\u201d she managed to make her voice sound embarrassed and contrite. \u201cI must lie down.\u201d She fled from his presence and into her chamber as quickly as her \u201cillness\u201d would allow.</p><p>Once behind the closed door, she allowed her mirth to escape, smothering her giggles with the heavy pillows on her bed. It was several moments before she heard Dirick take up his post outside her door\u2014just enough time for him to have wiped off his boots and called for someone to clean up her mess.</p><p>Maris dozed whilst she waited for Agnes to join her...and for all chaos to begin belowstairs. She would need all of her faculties about her later that night.</p><p>When the maid arrived at the bedchamber, she was in good spirits. \u201cMy lady, \u2019tis happening,\u201d Agnes announced as the door shut heavily behind her. \u201cJust as you said!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Maris smiled complacently. \u201cHow does our guard seem to be faring? \u2019Tis he who concerns me the most...besides my lord Bon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Dirick has not become ill yet, though from the very look on his face, verily he will be reaching for a chamberpot soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr rushing for the garderobe.\u201d Maris stifled a giggle.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you put in the food, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a plant called broom,\u201d she explained. \u201c\u2019Twas all good fortune, really, Agnes, for one of the old brooms in the kitchen had bristles made from the plant. The dried branches, with leaves and flowers, may be steeped and used for medicinal purposes. Yet, my mentor, Good Venny, always warned that \u2019tis an herb that must be used with care, for it has great power. It causes the body to\u2014ah\u2014dispose of its contents in a violent manner. Though it won\u2019t kill them, it will likely cause more than one to wish for death. It was a much better choice than elder bark, which I had thought to use until I saw the broom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not think Lord Bon will suspect \u2019twas you that poisoned the meal?\u201d asked Agnes.</p><p>Maris rose from her prone position on the bed. \u201cNay, for I told him that the meat stank, and that mayhap some of it was prepared for supper. Then, I made myself sick upon Sir Dirick\u2019s fine leather boots.\u201d She drew the tattered tapestry back from the window slit, noting with satisfaction that the sun had nearly set. \u201cIs all in readiness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I have hidden the foodstuffs I purchased in the village with your ring, my lady, and a mount awaits us near the hidden entrance to the keep.\u201d</p> <p>Maris turned in surprise, delight spanning her face. \u201cA mount, you say? Agnes, how on earth...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stable master bears no love for Lord Bon, my lady, and \u2019twas no great feat to convince him that I plan to escape with a lover now that my lord has found a bride!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then. \u2019Tis nigh time that we should leave.\u201d She scrabbled through a trunk and pulled a large leather pouch from its depths. Inside were two heavy cloaks she\u2019d found in the piles of clothing Bon had made available to her, as well as a dagger she\u2019d sneaked into her sleeve earlier that day.</p><p>As the two women moved toward the heavy door, they heard a loud groan from without. Maris looked at Agnes and carefully opened the door.</p><p>Dirick was doubled up on the floor, his face pasty with pain and glistening with sweat. When he heard the oaken door creak open, he struggled to sit, but the pain that wracked his abdomen had obviously weakened him. There was a pool of vomit nearby, proving that he had not chosen to leave his post when the sickness struck.</p><p>Maris tried to slip past him, but Dirick gathered enough strength to snatch under the hem of her gown and grasp her ankle. \u201cYou are not ill!\u201d he grated, comprehension in his face. \u201cBy God, woman, you have done this!\u201d</p> <p>Agnes hurried past, but Maris, still caught by the ankle and not wishing to make a great disturbance, struggled to free herself. \u201cI had no choice,\u201d she told him, confident that he was too weak to stop them. Indeed, his strong arm trembled with the effort to hold her and she saw a ripple of pain cross his face. \u201cPapa would not be here soon enough.\u201d With her other foot, she kicked at his hand, but his grip did not loosen. \u201cRelease me,\u201d she hissed, bending to claw at the arm that held her firm.</p><p>Dirick\u2019s other hand shot up to grab her wrist. \u201cHave you poisoned me, then?\u201d his eyes glittered. \u201cHave you poisoned the whole keep in your haste to escape?\u201d He could barely force the words forth and he yanked her down to her knees next to his prone body.</p><p>Her face was nearly in his, and her long hair caught in the sweat on his cheek. For a moment, a brief instant, regret washed over her that he should be in such pain because of her doing.</p><p>Then sanity reigned, and she pulled with all of her strength. Dirick, weakened beyond measure, could not hold her and she came free, tumbling backward onto the floor. Scrambling to her feet, taking care to pull her skirts out of reach from his fingers, she stared down at him as a spasm shook his body. He groaned aloud, breathing a foul curse as his arms crossed over his belly as if to hold the pain at bay.</p><p>\u201cWitch....\u201d The word was more a breath than a curse.</p><p>Gathering her skirts and the leather pouch, Maris forced herself to turn from the agonized man and hurry to the steps in Agnes\u2019s wake.</p><p>Then she stopped, whirling at the top. \u201cYou are not poisoned,\u201d she told him. \u201cI am a healer, do you not forget. All will be well ere the morn. Adieu, Sir Dirick, and mark you well: though I doubt to see your deceitful face again, if I do, I shall see you pay for this treatment of my person!\u201d</p><p>With that, she whirled again and hurried down the narrow stone steps, leaving him in a heap behind her.</p> <p>The last thing Dirick remembered before he succumbed to the pain was Maris\u2019s caustic words.</p><p>And that defiant threat was the first thing to come to mind when he regained his faculties many hours later. He knew it was much later because a stream of light came up the stairs, indicating that it was daylight.</p><p>Struggling to his feet with the rough wall as his prop, Dirick tried to swallow to moisten his bone dry throat. He\u2019d lost count of how many times he\u2019d vomited and otherwise expelled the contents of his body through the night. From the stench that greeted him as he made his way to the steps, others afflicted with Maris\u2019s poison had not found their way to a garderobe either.</p><p>Cursing the woman who\u2019d caused this havoc, Dirick carefully picked his way down the stairs, leaning heavily against the wall. If he could sit a horse, he and Nick would be out of this bloody place and on the trail of Maris and her maid as soon as he could walk to the stable.</p><p>In the great hall, prone bodies strewn about bespoke of the effects of whatever Maris had done to the food. Even the dogs were in heaps amongst the men. Dirick tried to swallow again and managed to choke up enough saliva for his throat to convulse. It made a harsh, grating sound.</p><p>Nary a soul stirred as he picked his way toward the outside entrance to the hall, bent on reaching the fresh air. Dirick wondered, fleetingly, if Maris and Agnes had actually made it safely past the guards at the drawbridge...and then he dismissed the question. Of course the woman had succeeded\u2014every man in the place had been incapacitated, thanks to her meddling.</p><p>His empty stomach roiled painfully, and he cursed Maris. Again.</p><p>Out in the crisp, cold air, the fog lifted from his head and he felt stronger. The bailey was relatively quiet\u2014some of the men-at-arms were stirring, groaning and complaining about their sickness of the night before\u2014and even the guards posted at the drawbridge sat slumped against the crenellated walls.</p><p>God\u2019s blood, he thirsted!</p><p>Dirick bent heavily to scoop a mass of clean snow to his mouth. The wet coldness felt like life to his cracked lips and swollen tongue. Another handful followed, and then another, and then he realized that he was hungry.</p><p>Maris had been right. She had said all would be well ere morning. There had been a time, many times, during the night when he\u2019d doubted her words, certain that he\u2019d be standing before God before long.</p><p>His stomach roiled again, this time indicating its emptiness. He turned to make his way back to the hall\u2014\u2019twould be best not to leave with an aching belly, but froze in his tracks at the sound of a bellow from within. Weak though the shout was, Dirick recognized Bon and what must be his fury at the disappearance of his bride.</p><p>Making a swift, prudent decision, he swung back to his path toward the stables, hobbling as quickly as possible to their refuge. Once inside, he wasted no time finding Nick, and, slipping the bit into the destrier\u2019s willing mouth, Dirick vaulted onto his back, sans saddle.</p><p>The shouts from the hall were getting louder, spilling out into the bailey, and he knew he\u2019d be hard pressed to make his escape now. Weakness made his knees tremble and his head light, but he forced himself to keep his mind clear and to find a way to get out of Breakston.</p><p>Nick was eager to go, and Dirick gave him his head once out of the stable. The scene in the bailey was one of chaos: men stumbling to their feet, sluggish and bewildered. Bon stood in the doorway of the hall, screaming orders, even as he leaned heavily against a feeble Edwin.</p><p>As the only man ahorse, Dirick immediately caught Bon\u2019s attention and was the recipient of an enraged bellow. Wheeling Nick, Dirick gathered all of his bravado and urged the stallion to the Lord of Breakston.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d he gasped as if in a hurry, \u201cI caught sight of them over the hill yonder!\u201d He gestured in a northeasterly direction, realizing in the back of his mind that he actually had no idea in which direction they\u2019d gone, and hoping that he wasn\u2019t sending the forces onto their trail. \u201cI\u2019ll catch them! Send after me!\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for an acknowledgement, and praying that Bon would accept his actions and not order arrows to be loosed at his back, Dirick kicked Nick and let him go. Men jumped from their path, rightfully wary of the fierce destrier, who, true to his nature, sensed a battle to come.</p><p>Bon screamed in his wake\u2014what words, Dirick did not care to find out\u2014and some of the men tried to spring their weakened bodies to action. None dared grab at the destrier, however, and man and horse easily plowed through them. The men at the drawbridge were just reaching for the winches to lower the portcullis when Nick and Dirick tore past them, kicking up snow and narrowly missing a clumsy man.</p><p>Dirick bent low over his mount\u2019s neck, urging him on. The hair stood at his nape as he waited for a shower of arrows to engulf them. The ragged drawbridge began to rise slowly as they thundered across, but Nick, who had not been ill, made a beautiful, flying leap. They soared easily to the ground on the far side of the moat.</p><p>The first arrow landed in the crusty snow not far from them and Dirick cursed. Glancing back, he saw the drawbridge lowering again and was just in time to duck when a cross bolt whizzed past his head. \u201cAye, Nick, go! Go!\u201d</p><p>The arrows were falling further behind, and the men swarming over the bridge were not moving with enough energy to pose a threat. Dirick saw the haven of the forest ahead and knew he\u2019d succeeded in putting Breakston behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, God willing, he\u2019d have luck and would find Maris and take her to safety.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>Merle had been driving his small army of knights at a ferocious pace. Still, it was nearly two days since Maris had been taken before they approached Breakston.</p> <p>Though they\u2019d stopped both nights, Merle had slept little. The grinding fear in his middle kept him staring at the stars for the few hours he\u2019d allotted his men for rest. On the second night, when they were within hours of Breakston, a dream had pulled him from the restless sleep that his body finally accepted, and the content of that dream brought him fully awake.</p><p>Terrible foreboding lingered as he struggled to still his pounding heart. He sat upright. The rest of the camp lay still, many of the men snoring, as Merle reached for a leather sack. From the sack\u2019s depths, he pulled parchment, writing utensils and ink, along with his wax and seal.</p><p>The moon was bright, and its reflection on the snow covered hills lent enough light to find what he needed for a letter, but \u2019twas not enough illumination to see to write. Merle lit a candle, his insides having settled slightly, but the horrible apprehension that had seized him in his dream did not abate.</p><p>He wrote for a long while.</p><p>When he had at last finished the missive, and having no sand to sprinkle on the wet ink, he waved the parchment in the cool air, praying that the words would not run. He hadn\u2019t the time to write another.</p> <p>Once satisfied that the words were dry and affixed to the paper, he folded it, sealed it with the seal of Langumont, and crept between the sleeping men until he found the one whom he sought.</p><p>\u201cRaymond, attend me.\u201d Merle pulled firmly at the shoulder of the man.</p><p>With barely a groan, the knight came fully awake, his eyes unglazed though moments earlier he\u2019d been fast asleep. \u201cAye, my lord!\u201d he nearly leapt to his feet, hand reaching for his sword.</p><p>Merle drew Raymond of Vermille away from the watchmen clustered about the fires to give him terse instructions about the delivery of the missive. \u201cWell I know that you are the greatest asset I may have should we be forced to battle at Breakston,\u201d he concluded, \u201cyet \u2019tis this which I place the greatest import upon. Ride fast and hard and place this in my liege\u2019s hands if you do no other task for me on this earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord.\u201d Raymond nodded solemnly at the trust that was being placed upon him.</p><p>\u201cGodspeed to you.\u201d Merle placed a heavy hand on his man\u2019s shoulder, then watched in satisfaction as he mounted a powerful destrier and charged through the crisp snow.</p> <p>It was dawning, then, and once Raymond of Vermille had disappeared into the distance, Merle returned his attention to the sleeping army. \u201c\u00c0 moi!\u201d he shouted, \u201cTo me, to Langumont!\u201d</p><p>The well trained knights sprang to their feet, instantly awake and wary. Lord Michael and Sir Victor were among the first to mount their horses, and all drew near Merle as he barked out orders.</p><p>\u201cOn to Breakston!\u201d he announced after splitting the group into two smaller parties, placing Michael as leader to one and pulling Maris\u2019s betrothed to follow in his steps. \u201cGod willing, we\u2019ll have my daughter in our hands by noon tide!\u201d</p><p>\u2019Twas good fortune, Dirick thought hazily, that Nick had been well sated with food and had rested comfortably ere they began their journey, else he may have found himself in more dire straits than he did now.</p><p>True, he and his mount had been following what appeared to be the trail of Maris and her companion Agnes for much of the day, but they\u2019d not yet come upon the two women, and the sun was beginning to sink into the far trees.</p><p>Upon leaving Breakston with such haste, Dirick had presumed to catch up with them by mid morn. But he\u2019d not anticipated that they\u2019d be ahorse. Ahorse. Even his befuddled mind grasped the incredulity of that fact. How, on God\u2019s earth, had they managed to sneak a mount from the keep?</p><p>There was no doubt that the trail he was following was that of Maris and Agnes: his mind had been functioning well enough at the start to recognize the unmistakable sweep of two skirts in the snow before the women had mounted the horse.</p><p>His abused stomach tightened painfully and a flash of lightness made the earth tilt. Dirick\u2019s only sustenance had been handfuls of snow when he\u2019d cared to stop, and, once, a few red berries he\u2019d spied in the crusty white. Fervently praying that they were not poisonous, Dirick had munched on what he could find. They tasted minty and did little to fill his stomach, but were enough to take the staleness from his mouth.</p> <p>Thus, he thought he was hallucinating when he saw smoke curling through the trees. Urging Nick closer, Dirick caught sight of some type of structure. It was a small building with a neatly thatched roof and well fitting door. Ignoring the fact that the trail he was following veered well away from the building, Dirick coaxed Nick toward the hut, hoping at the least for a bit to eat.</p><p>He stumbled to the door, taken by surprise at the violence of his weakness. His vision seemed to spin in slow circles as he banged a fist upon the sturdy oak.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until that door opened, and the elderly woman\u2019s presence registered in his mind, that Dirick allowed his ravaged body to succumb to its infirmity and he sank to the ground.</p><p>Maris drank deeply of the rich venison broth set before her. Its warmth flowed through her body and she sighed with a smile. \u201c\u2019Tis wondrous, Mother Abbess,\u201d she told the bewimpled nun.</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 you have your fill,\u201d the woman with the stern, wrinkled face told her. \u201c\u2018Tis glad I am that the Lord saw fit to lead you here, my lady. We\u2019ve enough passersby that certainly some will come to lead you back to Langumont in safety.\u201d The face wrinkled more to express a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of Langumont, my lady, and of the beauty of the ocean that can be seen from its highest towers. And of its richness, and the skill of its tradesmen.\u201d</p><p>Maris stifled a smile. Her welcome had been warm, of course, but the intensity of the abbess\u2019s friendliness, and her personal attention, indicated her hopes for a generous donation to the sisters and their work. The older woman was as shrewd as Lord Merle when it came to bettering her estate and caring for her charges.</p><p>\u201cTis certain my papa will express his gratitude for your hospitality on my return to Langumont,\u201d Maris told her. Then she turned her attention to more pressing matters. \u201cMy maid, Agnes\u2014where have you settled her for the night?\u201d Of the two of them, it had been Agnes who\u2019d succumbed more readily to the elements, and she\u2019d been nearly frozen when they were lucky enough to come upon the abbey just before sunset.</p><p>\u201cSister Gracia made a pallet for your woman in the infirmary. She\u2019ll be cared for there until we are certain the dangers of frostbite are nil. I\u2019ve had a chamber prepared for you, my lady, and you may bathe before retiring. You may wish to join us in the chapel for the evening vigil. \u2019Tis announced by the tolling of the bells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany thanks, Mother, yet I\u2019d prefer to say my confession in my chamber and bathe before I sleep. I fear I\u2019m more exhausted than I realized!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my dear,\u201d the abbess patted her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll call for Father Alphonse to see to your confession now, if you\u2019ve eaten enough, while your bath is prepared.\u201d</p><p>Maris rose and followed the black gowned woman as she wound her way through the corridors of the abbey. Though not much lighter than the keep at Breakston, the building was warmer and more inviting than that dreary place.</p><p>And, indeed, Maris\u2019s chamber, though not richly furnished, held more welcome than hers at Bon de Savrille\u2019s home\u2014mainly because no guard was stationed outside of the door. The bed was smaller, and not as plush, but the bedding was clean and thick and promised heavenly warmth after a long, frigid day of wandering through the countryside. A fire nearly burst through the grated fireplace, easily heating the room, and Maris sighed as she sank onto a stool nearby.</p><p>Father Alphonse, summoned by the abbess\u2019s servant, arrived to hear her confession. When that was done, and her penance given (Maris did not blink at the large number of paternosters that was her penance. In light of the many lies to Lord Bon and the pain she\u2019d inflicted upon the folk of Breakston \u2019twas a small enough penalty) a tub and buckets of steaming water paraded into the room, carried by quiet and efficient servants.</p><p>When the priest had left and one of the servants had assisted Maris with disrobing, she sank gratefully into the generous wooden tub. One of the women sprinkled chamomile flowers over the warm water and Maris inhaled the sweet, calming scent as they steeped in her bath.</p><p>As she rested her head back, she felt a folded cloth being inserted between her head and the rough stone wall. The vapor from the tub swirled about her face and she could feel the fear and tension of the last few days easing away as tiny rivulets of sweat trickled down her cheeks. She was safe at last. She sighed and closed her eyes.</p><p>They popped open as an image of the agonized face of Dirick de Arlande intruded into her thoughts.</p><p>She firmly turned her mind toward the thought of seeing her father again, refusing to let the face of the man who\u2019d betrayed her encroach upon her peace. Nor did she allow herself to think long and hard about the fact that she\u2019d saved his life when Bon de Savrille would have slain him. Maris might despise the man, mistrust and dislike him, but she would not have his death on her hands.</p><p>Dirick\u2019s face, and the fury in his voice as he\u2019d cursed her \u201cwitch,\u201d would not be banished, however. Maris shivered, remembering the glint of anger in his grey eyes as she\u2019d yanked free of his grip and swept past him to the steps. She\u2019d felt something akin to remorse as she left him behind, knowing the pain her herb was capable of inflicting. He\u2019d always appeared so large and strong that it disturbed her to see him laid low. An odd thought, she allowed. For should she not have been glad to see such a threatening man laid weak and slow?</p><p>He\u2019d been grey with fatigue and breathing heavily against the agony in his middle. Thick hair clung to the sweat on his face and neck, and Maris remembered how his hand, though gripping her ankle tightly, trembled with the effort. She could not dismiss the memory of the lines of pain that radiated from his eyes and mouth. His lips had been thin and taut...not at all like the full, soft ones that had closed upon her mouth in the stables. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment, she was back there, his arms around her and that mouth devouring hers. She remembered the feel of his fingers grasping handfuls of her hair, pushing up through her scalp...the warmth of his hard body in the chill of the early morning...and the spiraling pleasure curling up into her belly.</p><p>Maris jerked her thoughts from their pathway so violently that her body moved in the tub, splashing water onto the floor and startling the servant who sat silently in the corner. Must she call her confessor back so soon?</p><p>Pulling upright in the tub, she gestured for the maid to attend her. As the sure fingers of the servant massaged her scalp, spreading a rose scented soap in her damp hair, Maris allowed her eyes to ease shut again.</p> <p>Lulled by the fingertips stroking her head, she found herself back in Dirick\u2019s arms. His eyes were a silvery grey flecked with black and blue, and fringed with dark lashes, half closed with desire, his soft, smooth lips moving closer to hers...she could not block the image from her mind.</p><p>Instead, she focused on the expression of loathing in his face. The fury and disgust. And the abject pain and misery.</p><p>When the maid gently pushed, Maris bent her head so that the soap could be rinsed into the tub in front of her. The water trickled down her neck and the sides of her face, spilling into the water.</p><p>All at once, fear struck. Had she given too much of the broom? Mayhap he\u2019d not survived, as she\u2019d promised. Mayhap she\u2019d risked overmuch in using the potent plant...and even now, Dirick and other innocents could be lying in their death pools.</p><p>She shuddered, pushing the thought away. Nay, she\u2019d taken care so as not to make the dose too strong. But the look of agony...and the hatred in his eyes....</p> <p>Maris swallowed deeply as she was made to stand in the shallow tub. Careful hands soaped her body as she struggled to dismiss the fears and regrets that plagued her mind now that it was not occupied with thoughts of escape.</p><p>Nay, she decided firmly, she\u2019d not worry over it. Her papa may not have arrived in time, and she could not give pause to regret. What she\u2019d done, she\u2019d done. She\u2019d escaped Breakston and would return home to her family.</p><p>Banishing the lingering thoughts of Sir Dirick, Maris stepped from the tub and allowed the maid to towel her dry. The fire still roared in the grate, keeping her warm until a borrowed night shift was slipped over her head. The maid braided the long dark hair then helped Maris climb into the high bed.</p><p>Just as she began to slip into sleep, a menacing thought prodded her wide awake. Returning home to Langumont meant returning home to her betrothed.</p><p>For an instant\u2014a brief one\u2014Maris contemplated returning to Breakston and accepting Lord Bon\u2019s offer of marriage. At the least, he was malleable and would do her bidding. Sir Victor was naught but a rough bully.</p><p>But, nay, she\u2019d return to Langumont and find some way to dissuade her father from finalizing the betrothal.</p> <p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>Dirick\u2019s head swam.</p><p>He closed his eyes, then reopened them carefully. Aye, the room was still shifting, tilting to one side.</p><p>Then a face bent over his.</p><p>It was a woman\u2019s face, aged and covered with the fine, soft hair of the elderly.</p><p>\u201cAh, milord, you\u2019ve come back to this world at last.\u201d The voice was gentle and its accompanying smile the same. \u201cYe gave me quite a scare, lord, for how was I to explain how a dead knight came to be in me home?\u201d Old eyes sparked with humor, but Dirick was too weak to acknowledge it with more than a grunt. \u201cDrink this.\u201d She firmly shoved a crude wooden mug of something warm and heavenly smelling at his mouth and he accepted it gratefully.</p><p>She held the cup long enough for him to take several sips, then eased it back.</p><p>\u201cMy horse,\u201d he was able to ask now that his mouth was moistened.</p> <p>The woman nodded. \u201cAye. He\u2019s well tended. He\u2019s had more to eat than ye have in the day past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA day?\u201d Dirick croaked, struggling to a seated position on his low pallet.</p><p>\u201cAye. Ye came to me yestereve, lord, an\u2019 \u2019twas a struggle to get ye in here when ye chose me doorway to collapse in.\u201d Again, the eyes glinted with humor. \u201cBut I coulden leave ye there, now could I? \u2019Twould get to be horrible cold in here for me auld bones if the door weren\u2019t shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaris.\u201d Hell. He\u2019d surely lost her by now if he\u2019d been bloody sleeping for a day.</p><p>\u201cAh, aye, ye called for her last evenin\u2019, lord. There weren\u2019t no one with ye, that I could see.\u201d The head tilted to one side as she looked down upon him. \u201cBut she weren\u2019t with ye, were she, lord? Ye were after her, for what I know not, but the leaves will tell me. Here ye, drink all of this now as yer sittin\u2019 up.\u201d She pushed the mug into his face and brought his hand up to hold it.</p><p>Dirick drank the rest of the brew, thankful that the room had righted itself. The old woman, who wore a long, heavy gown that dragged the floor, took his empty cup and peered into its depths. \u201cAh, aye, I\u2019ll look at these in a moment.\u201d</p><p>He watched as she trundled over to the fire and stirred something in a large pot. She ladled its contents into a bowl modeled in the same crude fashion as the mug and brought it to him, accompanied by a piece of hard bread and a wooden spoon. Dirick smelled rabbit stew, and his mouth began to water when the food came into his presence.</p><p>Knowing that he was in need of sustenance before continuing his search for Maris, he would have eaten eagerly even if the food were barely palatable. However, the stew tasted just as delicious as it smelled, and he was so engrossed that he barely noticed that the old woman. She was clucking over his empty tea mug, peering with a tallow candle into its depths.</p><p>\u201cAhh, aye....Ye\u2019ve some grief of late, milord . . .\u2019tis sad I am to see it.\u201d She glanced up at him, then back at the mug. \u201cYer Papa, \u2019twas, aye?\u201d</p><p>Dirick swallowed a chunk of rabbit meat and stared at the woman. How could she have known? \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Her white head shook sadly. \u201cMuch blood, I see \u2019t...an\u2019 much evil \u2019round, too...spreadin\u2019 \u2019round this land. \u2019Tis a madman\u2019s hand is in \u2019t, I warrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find him,\u201d Dirick told her fiercely, no longer shocked that she seemed to understand what she could not know.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAye, Godspeed to ye in that task. I pray ye\u2019ll find it afore more bloodshed.\u201d</p><p>The woman turned her attention back to the herb leaves plastered over the bottom of the mug. \u201cAn\u2019 what of this Maris ye was callin\u2019 fer?\u201d The woman spoke more to herself than to Dirick as she frowned into the mug. \u201cAhh...mmm....The lady\u2019s bound fer some hardship herself, \u2019though it don\u2019t \u2019pear that ye\u2019ll be the one to bring it to her.\u201d She slanted a knowing look at him.</p><p>\u201cHardship?\u201d Dirick asked. \u201cShe\u2019s hurt? Lost?\u201d He struggled to pull himself from the bed, hardly daring to credit the fact that he was not only believing the words from the old crone\u2019s mouth, but asking for direction as well.</p><p>\u201cSit yerself, if ye please, milord...yer jarrin\u2019 the tea leaves an\u2019 I cannot read them,\u201d grumbled the woman. \u201cShe \u2019pears to have no evil \u2019bout her now. Fact is, I see naught but calm amongst her in th\u2019leaves. Fer now. She\u2019ll soon have a bad time, milord, but \u2019tis naught ye, nor any man, can shield her from. An\u2019 ye won\u2019 be seein\u2019 her to prevent it, so don\u2019 be harin\u2019 yerself off when yer so weak ye can barely move yerself. It\u2019s all over and done with, lord, an\u2019 ye won\u2019 be seein\u2019 \u2019er,\u201d she repeated, waving her hand as if to dismiss him into the bed. \u201cMmmm...an\u2019 I see that she\u2019ll soon be safe in the company of many armed men...so ye\u2019ve naught to worry yerself \u2019bout, milord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014will I not see her again?\u201d he asked. Something hollow settled in his fully belly, and then he dismissed the thought. Even if he should care to see Maris of Langumont again, how would the old crone know of the future? How did she even know of the present?</p><p>The woman frowned at the mug, angling the tallow candle over its depths. \u201cPah!\u201d she spat suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat see you?\u201d Dirick demanded.</p><p>\u201cAhh, nay, \u2019tis only that I dripped a bit of wax onto the leaves.\u201d She waved the offending candle in disgust, nearly splattering Dirick himself with hot tallow. \u201cI s\u2019spect ye\u2019ll see the lady again, milord, but not fer many moons an\u2019 \u2019t may not be to yer likin\u2019 when ye do. But if ye go easy with the lady, mayhap...mayhap ye\u2019ll win her.\u201d</p><p>Win her? Even if he desired to try, the likes of a third son could not win a powerful heiress such as Maris of Langumont.</p><p>Dirick snorted and shoved the tattered blanket from his thighs. Go easy with her? He dropped his bare feet to the dirt floor. He had every intention of throttling the life from the wench at the next he saw her...which, if he could stand enough to mount Nick, would be very shortly.</p><p>\u201cMilord,\u201d chirped the woman in surprise, \u201cye cannot be well enough betimes to be up an\u2019 about!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood woman,\u201d Dirick said, dismissing her concern as he groped for the boots resting near his pallet, \u201cI am much thankful for your kindness, but I must be on my way. I must see to Lady Maris and get her to safety.\u201d He stood, pausing to see if his legs would hold him and if the world had stopped, and then started toward the doorway with a fair amount of stability.</p><p>He stopped short, realizing that he had little to thank her with. \u201cGood woman, I\u2019ve only this to leave you with for my gratitude.\u201d He dug into the small leather pouch that always hung from his tunic. There was only the cloth wrapped dagger\u2014the clue to his father\u2019s murderer\u2014and a very few small coins. Pinching one from the bottom of the pouch, he pressed it into her hand, promising, \u201cI\u2019ll send to you with more as soon as I\u2019m able. I give you many thanks, woman, for caring for me. I\u2019ll see that \u2019tis not forgotten.\u201d</p><p>The woman took the coin, admonishing, \u201cMilord, ye needn\u2019t be in any such hurry. Ye\u2019ll not see the lady in the murderous mood yer in...and \u2019tis just as well, else ye\u2019d be prone to do or say as ye shouldn\u2019t!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAgain, good woman, I thank you, and I thank you even for your dire predictions,\u201d Dirick said, flashing a brief grin, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>Tsking to herself, the woman followed in his unsteady footsteps to the doorway, and leaned against the wall as he let himself into the cold air.</p><p>\u201cHave a care, milord,\u201d she called as he mounted upon Nick. \u201cAn\u2019 most especially, be yourself ware of the dagger!\u201d</p> <p>Though it had been nearly a full day since Dirick collapsed at the old woman\u2019s hut, it wasn\u2019t difficult to pick the trail left by a tired horse carrying two women. Since there\u2019d been no snow, and the winds were low, he was able to see faint hoof prints and, more than once, the sweep of a skirt in the powdery white. Thank God women were prone to stop more often than a man for relief.</p><p>It was not long before he came upon an abbey. He rode to the entrance gate, hailing for entry. A robed sister accompanied a male serf to the gate and invited him inside.</p><p>\u201cSister, I seek a noble woman and her maidservant with only a single horse between them,\u201d Dirick told her, declining to dismount until he learned if Maris was within.</p><p>The nun bowed her head. \u201cYou must speak with the Mother Abbess, my lord, an\u2019 you seek information about any of our guests. Please come within.\u201d</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Dirick slid from Nick and handed the reins to the serf. He forced himself to retain a grip on his patience as he followed the calm sister. She trudged so slowly he was tempted to take her arm and yank her along in his wake, but that would certainly not endear him to the Abbess.</p> <p>In fact, once in front of the stern looking woman\u2014whose disposition reminded him more than a little of his father\u2019s hawk-faced mother\u2014he managed to state his query in a calm, unhurried manner. He felt the Abbess\u2019s look keenly upon him. She did not appear to be fooled by his seeming nonchalance.</p><p>\u201cA lady such like you describe did just leave our gates early this morrow,\u201d the woman told him. \u201cA party of traveling monks and their escort did pledge to see the lady safely to her lands, as they rode in that direction.\u201d</p><p>Dirick felt a keen sense of disappointment. Maris was in good hands to be returned to Langumont and he no longer had reason to be involved. As it was, Lord Merle\u2019s lands lay in the opposite direction as Westminster, and \u2019twas well past time for Dirick to report to Henry on his findings about Bon de Savrille.</p><p>Alas, he\u2019d not see Maris of Langumont again. It was only as he was drifting off to sleep on a pallet in the abbey that he remembered that the old crone had predicted just that.</p><p>Nearly a sevennight after she\u2019d been abducted from Langumont, Maris and her escort rode up to the gates of the imposing keep.</p><p>\u201cHail, guard!\u201d she called, urging her mount to the raised portcullis and separating herself from the rest of the travelers. \u201cDo you raise the gate for me!\u201d</p> <p>She heard the shout of surprise from the watchman and the sudden scrambling to comply with her wishes. The portcullis rose quickly and easily as the drawbridge came down, and Maris, not waiting for the monks behind her, eagerly cantered across the slanted bridge.</p><p>\u201cMy lady! My lady!\u201d The greetings and men at arms surrounded her so that her horse could go no further.</p><p>\u201cWe thought you dead, my lady!\u201d cried one of the knights she recognized from her father\u2019s retinue.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, \u2019tis horrible bad!\u201d another man called, grabbing the bridle of her horse.</p><p>Maris slid from the saddle unassisted, smiling with relief, and patting the shoulders of the men she recognized. \u201cBut I am here and now all is well,\u201d she told them, looking toward the keep. Verily her mama had been informed of her arrival, but there was no sign of anyone coming to greet her except the men in the bailey.</p><p>\u201cNay, nay, my lady!\u201d Bern of Tristoff, the captain of the men-at-arms, urged her forward. \u201cNay, my lady, all is not well. You must see to your mama, as she is distraught and will not rise from her bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Bern, I\u2019ll see her and she will regain her life, for I am safely returned.\u201d She smiled gaily, so glad to be returned home...but none of the men and serfs seemed to share in the joy of her homecoming. \u201cSend to me a messenger and I\u2019ll see to Mama.\u201d</p><p>She hurried toward the keep, noting that it seemed oddly quiet for the normal bustle of Langumont. She\u2019d need to send a messenger to find Papa and relay the news that she was returned; their paths must have missed each other as he was on his way to find her. But first, she\u2019d kiss her mama and show her that all was well.</p> <p>\u201cLady Maris!\u201d Bern dogged her heels, an urgent frown creasing her face. \u201cLady Maris, \u2018tis the lord!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I must send to him that I am returned\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady!\u201d The frustration in his voice was not to be ignored and he was at last gratified by his lady\u2019s full attention. \u201cLady Maris, \u2019tis because of Lord Merle that the lady rises not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa? He is here?\u201d Maris\u2019s heart leapt for joy. \u201cI\u2019ll not need the messenger, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, the lord\u2014he is dead.\u201d</p><p>~ Part II ~</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>Three months later</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis only his right that the king requires my presence at court,\u201d Maris told her mother wearily.</p><p>\u201cBut your papa has been gone for a mere three moons,\u201d Allegra wailed, her ever present handkerchief fluttering to the face that seemed much more weary and old since her husband\u2019s death. \u201cCan his majesty not leave us in peace until we have finished mourning?\u201d</p><p>Maris shook her head in frustration as she pulled a bolt of finely woven linen from a trunk. In a terrible twist of fate, her father had been slain by a loose arrow as his men prepared to besiege Breakston\u2014at a time after she\u2019d already made her escape.</p><p>The irony and horror that she\u2019d already been safe when her Papa was killed had sat like a heavy black stone in her belly for months.</p><p>\u201cMama, I must go to the king to pledge mine own fealty to him as heir to Langumont. \u2019T has been more than time enough since Papa\u2019s passing in King Henry\u2019s eyes, and it\u2019s my duty as his vassal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not go,\u201d Allegra told her.</p><p>\u201cAye, Mama, you\u2019ll not. \u2019Tis I who must pledge to my lord. You\u2019ll stay here.\u201d Maris didn\u2019t think that her frail mother would last the journey to London. In the last few moons, her grey streaked hair had become almost pure white and the lines that creased her face bespoke of a great weariness and worry.</p><p>\u201cAye. An\u2019 I\u2019ll offer a score rosaries a day for your papa\u2019s soul.\u201d The words came out in a moan.</p><p>\u201cAgnes, this green linen I\u2019ll have for an over tunic,\u201d Maris announced, turning from her mother with relief. She handed the cloth to the woman who\u2019d become an invaluable support since her return to Langumont and the death of its lord.</p><p>Taking the bolt, the maid added it to a growing pile of other fine cloths. If the Lady of Langumont was to be summoned to court, she\u2019d be dressed in all the finery and fashion that her position warranted. The seamstresses had been working night and day since the missive from Henry arrived two days earlier, and still Maris delved into the stores of imported fabrics held in Langumont\u2019s storage chambers. Most of her gowns would be made whilst she was at court to be certain that they were of the latest fashion, she thought to bring her own fabrics rather than pay the higher price most certainly demanded in London Town.</p><p>As Agnes took the cloth, a corner fell and something clattered to the floor. \u201cPeste!\u201d Maris exclaimed in surprise, reaching under the stool for the object. It was a dagger\u2014one she\u2019d never seen before\u2014and she examined it with interest.</p><p>Allegra, brought from her trance of woe by her daughter\u2019s unladylike language, sat upright when she saw the small weapon. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten. . . .\u201d she murmured, reaching to take the ornate dagger from Maris.</p><p>\u201cHow did this come to be in a trunk of cloth?\u201d Maris hadn\u2019t taken her eyes from the delicate but lethal dagger, replete with filigree and carved roses on its handle.</p><p>\u201cIt was your papa\u2019s,\u201d Allegra said dreamily, turning the wicked looking knife around in her hands.</p><p>\u201cPapa\u2019s?\u201d Maris couldn\u2019t imagine her father owning something so feminine and delicate.</p><p>\u201cNay, \u2019twas a gift of his to me,\u201d her mother explained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it with me,\u201d Maris said, knowing she might very well be in need of protection. The small weapon would be easily hidden and transported, yet would do very nicely slipping betwixt the ribs of a thief or other danger. She suspected that court could be more dangerous than a battlefield...with its dark, dank hallways and ears that listen betwixt the walls.</p><p>She leaned over and pressed a light kiss to her mother\u2019s worn face. \u201cGod willing, I\u2019ll see his majesty and return to your side before two moons,\u201d she told Allegra.</p><p>London!</p><p>Maris straightened in her saddle, straining to take in every detail of the bustling city. The streets were narrow, beaten paths, lined with buildings and strewn with refuse. Hawkers selling their wares crowded between the people on foot and darted out from under the hooves of well reined mounts.</p><p>It was even louder than she\u2019d expected, and much dirtier. But, to Maris\u2019s innocent eyes, there was beauty in the variety of people that filled the streets. Since she rode Hickory, she had no concern of treading in the garbage that was everywhere. Instead, she gawked like the country girl she was as Raymond of Vermille led the entourage from Langumont to the king\u2019s palace.</p><p>When he rode up beside her, she beamed upon him in a smile rare since her father\u2019s death. \u201c\u2019Tis wondrous loud,\u201d Maris commented. \u201cAnd it seems as if it will never stop moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady, loud and filthy,\u201d Sir Raymond responded. \u201cAnd unsafe, Lady Maris. You\u2019ll not venture out without several guards.\u201d His words were the merest tentative, for he well knew that she was used to coming and going as she pleased. \u201cI\u2019ve sent Sir Garrek with the news of your arrival to his majesty. \u2019Twill be some days before the king will see you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye. Then I shall have time to settle and learn my way of the court. I hope to have chambers within and near the other ladies.\u201d Maris\u2019s attention was drawn to a vendor dressed in unusual garb: dusty, draping clothing and a headdress of cloth wound around his head and face. He reminded her of Good Venny, for he had the same dark skin and her mentor had worn similar clothing. The man\u2019s wares did not interest her, but the small furry creature that perched on his shoulder caused her to rein in Hickory for a closer look. \u201cSir Raymond, look you at that creature!\u201d</p><p>The knight paused beside his mistress, \u201cAye, my lady. \u2019Tis called a monkey and comes from afar, mayhap from Jerusalem itself.\u201d</p><p>The other men at arms drew themselves near Maris and Raymond, causing a large blockage of the street. \u201cMy lady,\u201d Sir Raymond said, attempting to pull her attention from the creature that held her fascination, \u201clet us go on to the castle. We can return to the market when you wish, and, I vow, you\u2019ll see more than a mere monkey.\u201d</p> <p>Maris nodded in agreement. She could gawk and stare at the sights of London Town at another time. Now, alas, she must heed Sir Raymond and proceed onward.</p><p>The party gained entrance within the bailey walls of Westminster, and Sir Raymond helped Maris alight from her mount. Inside the castle, of which the great hall had been built by William the Conquerer himself, the steward greeted the Lady of Langumont and directed her to the chambers she would inhabit near the other wards of the king.</p><p>\u201cWard of the king,\u201d Maris muttered to herself, her full lips flattening into a frown. \u2019Twas the first time she\u2019d realized the reality of her new position, and its implications shook her composure.</p><p>She followed a page through the intricate hallways of the castle, suddenly aware of how different her life could become. The king\u2019s ward was his to do with as he wished, to marry to whomever he desired a political alliance with, or give as a reward to a faithful vassal. He could even, Maris realized, require that she remain a permanent member of the royal court until such time as he chose to bestow her person\u2014nay, her lands\u2014upon some greedy lord that was not of her choosing.</p><p>Yet....Her heart\u2019s pounding slowed its breakneck pace. She was already betrothed, she was safe from that\u2014was she not? If her papa had signed the betrothal contract, it would be no easy task for even the King of England to go against the Church and annul a betrothal agreement, even though no betrothal vows had been spoken.</p> <p>Since Papa\u2019s death, neither Victor nor Michael d\u2019Arcy had come to Langumont nor sent any messages. Maris, enveloped with grief over her loss, and further distracted by the failing health of her mother, had hardly given it any thought. In fact, she\u2019d considered it a boon of good fortune not to have to face her betrothed and her father. But now, she wondered on it.</p><p>Had the d\u2019Arcys left the Langumont women alone to their grief? Had they needed to return to their own lands, and would return after some time had passed?</p><p>It mattered not to Maris, just so long as she didn\u2019t see Victor d\u2019Arcy. In an ironic sort of way, it was a good position in which she found herself: she was betrothed and thus not free to any other single man, but not yet wed. And her future husband was not there to order her about.</p><p>The page stopped at a large oaken door, drawing Maris from her unpleasant labyrinth of thoughts. She realized she had no idea how they\u2019d come through the twisting halls of the castle to these chambers and turned questioningly to the page.</p><p>Before she could speak, the young boy said, \u201cHere is your chamber. Your maid and trunks will be brought to you, my lady. When you wish to go to the hall for dinner, you have only to send for me or another of the pages and we will happily guide you within.\u201d And then, with a little bow, he was gone.</p><p>Some time later, Maris smoothed the cloth of gold fabric of her wimple and swallowed hard. She hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d feel so nervous before seeing the king\u2014and her trepidation was heightened by the fact that she\u2019d barely received the trunks in her chambers when Henry summoned her to his presence.</p> <p>She could hardly believe the king had found time to see her so soon upon her arrival, and Maris couldn\u2019t help but fear the reason for it.</p><p>The page who brought the message from His Majesty was not the one who\u2019d escorted her only an hour earlier. He was slightly older than his predecessor\u2014mayhap nine or ten years\u2014and he wore his dignity about him like a bishop.</p><p>Despite her nervousness, Maris bade him wait in the hallway whilst she and Agnes tried frantically to make her presentable enough to appear in the royal presence. She had no time for the benefit of a bath to wash the dirt from travel, nor the opportunity to press the wrinkles from her gowns. As it was, apprehension spurred Maris to leave the chambers with her hair still merely braided and her traveling shoes still upon her feet.</p><p>Now, waiting just on the other side of the door leading to Henry\u2019s court chamber, she regretted her haste. The wimple covered her simple braid, but the toes of her shoes were stained and worn and peeped from beneath the skirts of her best gown. The gown itself would do (although the brief glimpses Maris had seen of other ladies of the court told her that it was seriously out of fashion), for the fabric was a brilliant gold that shimmered as she moved, with long sleeves that opened nearly to the ground at her wrists. A dark red overtunic, complementing the garnets that she wore in a heavy necklet, fitted over the gown and displayed the talents of the seamstresses at Langumont, who\u2019d labored over its gold and green embroidery for days. The gown had been intended for her betrothal ceremony and, in spite of its out-of-date style, was certainly fit for meeting her king.</p><p>Maris was just beginning to fidget nervously when the doors opened and yet another page gestured for her to enter. Standing regally, although her heart was pounding, Maris followed him into the room, praying that her knees would not give away.</p><p>Henry stood directly to her left near a large, gilt chair. He was a handsome man, she thought to herself, with his reddish hair and muscular build. Maris drew near, noting that the chamber was empty of people other than the king and the page who\u2019d summoned her.</p><p>\u201cMy liege,\u201d she murmured, sweeping into a full curtsey before him with her forehead nearly to the ground. Her skirts pooled around her and she covertly adjusted them to cover her shoes.</p><p>\u201cMaris of Langumont.\u201d The king\u2019s voice was booming but kind. She could almost hear a smile in its timbre as he continued, \u201cRise, child, I\u2019ve long waited to meet the daughter of the fine Merle of Langumont.\u201d</p> <p>Though he was a mere four years her elder, somehow it was appropriate that the stunning, powerful man before her call her \u2018child.\u2019 \u201cThank you, your grace,\u201d Maris told him as she pulled lightly to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve long wished to meet you as well, sire,\u201d she said, emboldened by the warmth in his blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe were aggrieved to hear of your father\u2019s demise,\u201d Henry told her in his regal voice. \u201c\u2019Twas unfortunate that one of my most loyal vassals should die in an attempt to retrieve his kidnapped daughter. And in such a tragic manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, your grace.\u201d Maris\u2019s voice was shamefully unsteady. \u201cMy father was well loved and \u2019tis a tragedy that he should be felled by a wild arrow during my rescue, most especially since I had already made my escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Henry nodded. \u201cMost unfortunate, my dear Maris. Yet, I understand you were quite enterprising to have made your own escape.\u201d Before she could respond, he beckoned to the shadows. \u201cWell, Dirick, now you have seen that indeed the lady lives. Are you well satisfied?\u201d</p><p>Maris froze. Her disbelief turned to mortification and annoyance as the figure stepping from a dark corner metamorphosed into the familiar person of Dirick de Arlande. The blood drained from her face and she felt a pounding in her temple take its place. Clenching her fists into the folds of her skirt, she turned to the king.</p><p>\u201cWith respect, my lord,\u201d she said, keeping her eyes from the man who drew near the throne, \u201cyou harbor a traitor in these chambers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraitor?\u201d Henry\u2019s fine red eyebrows rose in question. \u201cTreason is a very serious charge, my lady. Are you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, your majesty.\u201d Maris darted an angry glance at Dirick, then returned her attention to the king. \u201c\u2019Tis this man who plotted with my captor after lulling my father into complacence during his stay at Langumont.\u201d</p><p>The barest hint of a smile playing about his lips, Henry turned. \u201cDirick, what say you to these accusations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy liege.\u201d Dirick\u2019s voice was easy, but laced with a hint of annoyance. \u201cYou are as well aware as I that I was at Breakston at your behest and became accidentally entangled in this nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Maris gasped at such a bald faced lie. Whirling to face him, she countered, \u201cSir Dirick, how then do you explain your stay at Langumont if it were not to plot against myself and my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may come as an enlightenment to you, Lady Maris, but the entire kingdom does not revolve about you in its every working,\u201d Sir Dirick said, again in that mellow, smooth voice that made her want to shriek in frustration. \u201cI hope you are not too overset to learn that I had other reasons for availing myself of your father\u2019s hospitality than aught in regard to your fair person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was I to think, then, when you were one of the gawkers at whose feet I was cast by my abductors? You, who made no move to assist me, even to the extent of breaking into my chamber\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Maris, I do not believe this conversation need continue here.\u201d Dirick\u2019s mellow voice carried a hint of warning.</p><p>She drew herself up, suddenly aware that she stood shrieking like a harpy in the king\u2019s chambers. Her cheeks warmed. \u201cWell said, Sir Dirick,\u201d she lowered her eyes as mortification swept over her. \u201cI have no wish to continue this conversation at any other time,\u201d she muttered to herself.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, my lady?\u201d asked Henry, the trace of a smile still lingering.</p><p>\u201cIt was of no import, my liege,\u201d she said with a small curtsey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Henry glanced at Dirick, who stood next to him, then turned his regal gaze back onto Maris. \u201cAbout this charge of treason, my lady. You do realize that the sentence for this crime is hanging?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, refusing to look at the dark haired man who stared at her mockingly. \u201cYour grace, I\u2014I may have misspoke myself and\u2014and may not have fully considered the situation. I withdraw my accusation\u2014for the time being,\u201d she added with spirit, still keeping her gaze averted from Dirick.</p><p>The king nodded. \u201cAye, then. I think that a wise decision.\u201d He stroked his beard with thick fingers as if deep in thought. \u201cYou\u2019ll pledge your fealty to me three days hence, Maris of Langumont.\u201d</p> <p>The king might have continued speaking had there not been an urgent knocking upon the chamber door. The sole page left in their presence hurried to answer it, and Henry looked on curiously.</p><p>\u201cYour majesty.\u201d A royal messenger entered and swept toward the king, his bow fluid and elegant.</p><p>\u201cRise, Merren. What brings you in such haste?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis terrible news. But mayhap I am interrupting?\u201d The lanky messenger glanced at Maris, giving an expectant pause.</p><p>Henry nodded then turned to Maris. \u201cMy lady, you may return to your chambers. I will expect to see you at supper this eventide. In fact, you shall find your place as my guest this night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d she managed to stammer, stunned by his invitation and disappointed that she would not hear what terrible news the messenger brought. Picking up her skirts, she turned, avoiding making any eye contact with Dirick, who now leaned casually against the throne chair. It was not lost on her that she, and not Sir Dirick, had been asked to leave the king\u2019s chambers.</p><p>Nervous worry and indignation accompanied her movements as Maris made a curtsey to the king. Nevertheless, she walked unhurriedly to the chamber door, acting for all the world as if she had not conducted herself the complete fool in front of her liege lord.</p><p>When Maris felt rather than heard the heavy door close behind her, she released her breath in a forceful whoosh of relief.</p><p>\u201cLady Maris?\u201d</p><p>A voice from behind startled Maris. She whirled, embarrassed at being observed in such an informal state. A woman, mayhap a few years older than she, stood near one of the torches that lit the hall. She had an aura of ease and peacefulness about her, and the smile she bestowed on Madelyne was warm and friendly.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Maris recovered and looked imperiously at her. How could the woman know her name? She\u2019d arrived at court less than two hours ago and had gone nowhere but to her chamber. Was she trying to be friendly, or was she looking for gossip to spread among the court?</p> <p>\u201cI am Lady Madelyne of Mal Verne. My husband, Lord Gavin, is a confidant of the king and I am visiting briefly as lady in waiting to Queen Eleanor. Her highness bade me bring you to her upon your dismissal by the king.\u201d She gestured toward one of the hallways leading from the entrance to the royal chambers.</p><p>\u201cQueen Eleanor?\u201d Somehow, the thought of meeting that great lady was far more imposing than meeting her husband. \u201cWhat would the queen wish of me?\u201d Maris found herself falling into step alongside the other woman. \u201cI\u2019ve only just arrived at Westminster this day.\u201d</p><p>Madelyne gave a dainty shrug, her gray eyes like luminous moonstones. \u201cI am not privy to her majesty\u2019s intentions, but had I to make a guess, I\u2019d expect she should like to determine if you\u2019ll do in her court. Come, now, she awaits\u2014and her highness is not known for her patience.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>The harsh wind of April whipped violently, stinging Dirick\u2019s cheeks and nose. He pulled the fur lining of his cloak closer, burying his mouth in its warmth. Merren, the royal messenger, rode just ahead of him, setting the urgent pace.</p><p>If he had no need for haste, Dirick would have waited a day or two for the spring weather to change to something more comfortable. He\u2019d still be at court and partaking of a warm, filling meal in the Great Hall. Course upon course of food prepared for the purpose of impressing the king would be served to his court. Jesters and troubadours would take their turn at entertaining the ladies and lords who gathered at the king\u2019s pleasure\u2014including the lately arrived Maris of Langumont.</p><p>Even in the frigid winter air, the thought of that woman made his blood boil.. She had more brash than a stallion in heat, and more feminine guile than Queen Eleanor. The manner in which Maris had turned those wide golden brown eyes toward his sovereign and blithely declared Dirick a traitor...and then, mere moments later, simpering that it had been an error....God\u2019s nails, was the daft woman out to see him hanged or merely thrown in a dungeon for life?</p><p>Over the last months since returning from his adventure in Breakston, Dirick had come and gone from the royal court while investigating the murder of his father and the other similar victims. It had been most fortunate that he\u2019d been not only at Westminster, but actually with Henry when news of Maris\u2019s arrival was brought to the royal chamber. Dirick had already apprised his liege of the events that took place at Langumont and at Breakston. The only part he\u2019d declined to share was the description of Maris\u2019s last revenge upon him.</p> <p>Henry had been in an energetic, jovial humor today and had called for Maris to attend him immediately. To Dirick\u2019s surprise, he\u2019d invited him to stay for the audience. It might have been more prudent for him to have announced his presence immediately, but the perverse woman had such a contrary effect on him that he wanted the advantage of surprise.</p><p>She was still the beauty his mind had conjured and conjured again over the past several moons. Even travel weary and worn as she must have been, and dressed in fashions that the court had not seen since King Stephen, Maris of Langumont would have outshone any other lady at court had one been there to see her. Mayhap the exception would be Queen Eleanor...but Maris would indeed cause all to look twice or thrice at her, even in the presence of the queen.</p><p>Aye, the woman was beautiful...and spirited...and resourceful...and, aye, intelligent\u2014though most men would not consider that an asset. She was also a drain on his patience and overly spirited, as well as tart-tongued and sharp. It occurred to Dirick, just then, how many times he\u2019d privately vowed to strangle Maris of Langumont and he gave a little laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Merren\u2019s voice broke into his thoughts. \u201cDraw near me now and I\u2019ll show you the scene.\u201d</p><p>All thoughts of Maris driven from his mind, Dirick urged Nick abreast of the messenger\u2019s mount. \u201cThe bodies are here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lord, there.\u201d Merren pointed to two lumps that were covered with a smattering of snow.</p><p>They approached the bodies of Sir Harris of Bristol and his squire, the news of whose deaths had interrupted the king\u2019s audience with Maris. When Henry learned that they had been found in a state similar to that of Harold of Derkland, he\u2019d sent Dirick posthaste to the scene of the murders.</p><p>Now, Dirick dismounted, commanding Nick to stay, and gingerly moved toward the larger body. The new snow that covered the man was not heavy enough to obliterate the splashes of blood that colored the old, crusty snow. Nor was the posture of the man, and that of his squire, to be mistaken.</p><p>It was just as it had been described in the earlier events: both men were face down, sprawled on the ground, with their arms bent awkwardly above their heads, each hand meeting that of the other man. It looked as though they\u2019d fallen from some great height while clasping each other\u2019s wrists. Sir Harris\u2019s neck was broken, and his throat slit so that his head flipped back eerily onto his shoulders, blank eyes gaping up into the falling snow.</p><p>\u201cTry this, my lady.\u201d Agnes knelt at Maris\u2019s feet, holding a finely crafted leather slipper.</p><p>Maris slid a foot into the embroidered shoe, then the other into a second. \u201c\u2019Tis a good fit,\u201d she mused. \u201cI was not so certain in light of the haste in its making, but Lady Madelyne assured me the shoemaker would meet my needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and the seamstress as well,\u201d nodded her maid as she stood to survey her mistress. \u201cThe gown becomes you, lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the least it is more stylish,\u201d Maris replied with a shrug. Yet, she was more pleased than her words indicated.</p><p>Upon Lady Madelyne\u2019s suggestion, she\u2019d retained a tailor and his seamstresses to create a gown from the store of material she\u2019d brought from Langumont. Now, only two days after her arrival, she was dressed more like the other ladies clustering about the queen in her chambers.</p><p>The undertunic and bliaut were cut to fit more closely than her old gowns, making her feel a bit self-conscious about how well they molded to her hips and breasts. The girdle of gold links wrapped thrice about her waist, and its ends dangled nearly to the floor. And the sleeves of her pine hued bliaut were so long and wide that Agnes had tied knots in the ends of them so that Maris would not tread upon the yellow and orange embroidery that decorated their cuffs.</p><p>A heavy necklet of rubies and one large emerald sat about her neck, and three rings adorned her hands. Though Maris never wore such amounts of jewelry at Langumont, Allegra had warned that she must decorate herself so at court, else the strength and wealth of her title be questioned. Agnes had plaited her long red-brown hair into four braids and stuffed them into heavy gold hair-cases, then covered her head with a fine gold veil.</p><p>A knock came at the door and the maid opened it to find Lady Madelyne, along with her cousin by marriage, Lady Judith of Kentworth.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely,\u201d Madelyne said, her moonstone eyes lighting with approval. \u201cI cannot believe how quickly the seamstresses worked.\u201d Her hand rested on a subtly-rounded belly that rose beneath her own gowns, hardly noticeable in the voluminous folds of her skirt.</p><p>Judith, whose coppery hair shone from beneath a sheer wimple, agreed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that you weren\u2019t dressed finely before, but now those lady cats can sheath their claws and keep their comments about country mice to themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough,\u201d she added, looking at Maris with dancing blue eyes, \u201cI suspect that you would have no problems clipping any claws that came too near you. Verily, that emerald is the size of a goose egg!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maris looked down at the jewel, suddenly uncertain. \u201cIs it too large? Will the queen be annoyed?\u201d She didn\u2019t care if the other ladies envied her jewels, but she surely didn\u2019t wish to flaunt her wealth if it would insult the queen.</p><p>\u201cOh, nay,\u201d Judith said, laughing merrily. \u201c\u2019Twill just cause her to suggest that her husband raise the rents and taxes on Langumont. She will say that you obviously have too much excess in your coffers!\u201d She looked at Madelyne, still grinning. \u201cAt the least you aren\u2019t hiding them beneath your trunks, as Maddie tried to do.\u201d</p><p>Madelyne gave a soft laugh when Maris looked at her in surprise. \u201cJudith speaks the truth. I had to become used to wearing such baubles when I came to court, for I\u2019d spent nearly a decade cloistered in an abbey, where everything was very simple. Even now, Gavin feels the need to prod me into showing off my finery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery well, then,\u201d Maris said, comfortable now. \u201cI shall flaunt my jewels beneath the queen\u2019s very nose. Shall we be off?\u201d</p><p>Upon entering the Great Hall, the three women made their way toward the trestle tables where Eleanor\u2019s other ladies in waiting were seated. After her brief audience with the beautiful but austere queen two days earlier, Maris had been given a firm royal invitation\u2014which amounted to nothing less than an order\u2014to join Eleanor\u2019s court until further notice.</p><p>The ladies had to pass in front of the royal dais as they wended their way through the rows of tables and hoards of self seeking courtiers. Intent upon her feet and their placement, Maris didn\u2019t look up at the royal couple and their supper guests until Madelyne paused to sweep a curtsey in front of the queen.</p><p>\u201cYou look well, Lady Madelyne,\u201d Eleanor said from her high seat. \u201cYour condition agrees with you, and your husband too, I trow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, your majesty,\u201d Madelyne replied in her easy, serene way. \u201cI only hope to look as fine and healthy as you have after the babe comes.\u201d</p> <p>Eleanor, who had just given birth a month earlier, smiled and gave her a look that seemed to say, Mayhap you will be as fortunate...but \u2019tis unlikely. \u201cAnd good evening, Lady Maris,\u201d said the queen, turning her attention from Madelyne. \u201cI see that you have been visited by a seamstress since yestereve. And you have unearthed such lovely jewels from your trunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, indeed, your Majesty,\u201d Maris murmured, curtseying first to Eleanor and then to Henry. As she straightened, her gaze fell upon a tall figure just settling into his seat near the king.</p><p>Sir Dirick.</p><p>Their gazes clashed for a moment\u2014his stormy blue and gray, remote and impersonal\u2014before Maris pulled hers away.</p><p>But her heart was pounding and her palms felt clammy, and even the insides of her belly felt as if a flock of birds had taken flight therein. As her heart thumped in her throat, Maris kept her gaze averted and her chin lifted proudly. She gathered her skirts and followed Madelyne and Judith when they turned from the dais.</p><p>This was the first she\u2019d seen of Dirick since their meeting in the king\u2019s chambers two days earlier. One of the ladies had gossiped that Sir Dirick had been sent off on the king\u2019s business, and Maris had hoped for his return to be long in coming.</p> <p>Yet even as she took her seat, gracefully gathering up her gown to swing it over the bench, the image of his solemn face was foremost in her mind. In that brief moment, she\u2019d noted how tired he looked. His face was drawn and deep lines creased his lean, tan cheeks. His thick, dark hair was pulled unstylishly from his face and tied at the nape of his neck.</p><p>Under the pretext of turning to fill her cup with wine, Maris sneaked another look at him. He was deep in conversation with the king, having taken a seat next to his lord instead of with a lady between them, as was proper. Their discussion seemed to be intense and humorless, and she wondered what they were discussing. Yet, even as she wondered that, she noticed the breadth of his shoulders next to that of the king, and the way his dark head loomed over that of the ginger-haired king. One sleeve of Dirick\u2019s undertunic had fallen back to the elbow, revealing the hardness of his well toned, tanned forearm.</p><p>He looked up at that moment and Maris jerked her gaze away, lifting her cup quickly to hide her face. \u2019Twas her misfortune that the hasty swallow of sweet red wine choked her, and she was overcome by a fit of coughing. Once she\u2019d regained her composure, a quick peek at the dais revealed that a complacent smirk had settled on Dirick\u2019s face, making her certain he was laughing at her.</p><p>Feeling the warmth of a flush spread through her cheeks, Maris leaned toward Judith and Madelyne, forcing herself to concentrate on their conversation.</p><p>\u201cAye, an\u2019 he\u2019s not too telling upon the eyes,\u201d Judith was saying with a sly look toward the high table. \u201cBut he knows it well, I vow. That kind always does. Gavin is well-acquainted with him, is he not, Maddie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. In fact, they both were pressed into service by the king on a recent problem related to some fief in the west. It kept Gavin traveling quite oft from here to there in the last two moons, and he would tell me naught of it.\u201d Madelyne smoothed her hands over her pregnant belly as if to explain her husband\u2019s reticence. \u201cBut his majesty was highly pleased at the result, and rewarded my husband well.\u201d</p><p>Eager to join the conversation\u2014any conversation\u2014Maris said, \u201cOf whom do you speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you acquainted with Sir Dirick?\u201d replied Madelyne.</p> <p>Her face heating, Maris shook her head and took a nibble of roasted pheasant. \u201cHe and I have met but briefly, and did not find each other to our liking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Judith turned a bemused look onto her. \u201cI cannot imagine finding anything not to like about such a man. If I were the king, I vow I\u2019d not allow the man to stand next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirick de Arlande\u2014\u201d Maris began, but Judith interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cDirick de Arlande? Nay, you mean to say Dirick of Derkland, do you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerkland?\u201d Maris blinked, remembering the kind, giant of a man to whom her father had tried to betrothe her. But he\u2019d only had eyes for Joanna of Swerthmore, and that had suited Maris just fine. \u201cDoes he have a brother named Bernard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Madelyne said, watching her with interest. \u201cGavin knows the family well. There is also the middle brother, Thomas, who is a priest.\u201d</p><p>Maris glanced up at the high table and saw Dirick looking at her with an arch expression. \u201cWhatever his name might be,\u201d she continued tartly, turning away, \u201cDirick of Whatnot is nothing like his elder brother, for Dirick is naught but an arrogant, rude, man at arms with little to his name but a fine destrier, which he no doubt won in some lucky moment of combat. He might have fooled the king, but he has naught to bring a woman but lies and tricks.\u201d</p><p>Madelyne and Judith exchanged glances but neither spoke again, although Maris felt the latter\u2019s assessing glance on her.</p><p>She turned away and helped herself to a soft roasted turnip, ignoring the pang in her middle. The man was insufferable. And despite what Madelyne had said, she still had no reason to believe that he hadn\u2019t participated gladly in her abduction, confidante of the king or nay.</p><p>She was just beginning to enjoy her meal when a heavy hand settled on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy Lady Maris,\u201d purred a familiar voice in her ear. \u201c\u2019Tis glad I am to see you in full possession of your health.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she looked up to see Victor d\u2019Arcy with a cold smile on his face.</p><p>Dirick stuffed a large chunk of bread into his mouth, watching as Victor d\u2019Arcy approached Maris. The familiar surge of dislike oozed through him at the sight of the blonde man and he chewed rapidly.</p><p>The sound of the queen\u2019s husky, pleasant laugh rang next to him, and she leaned closely enough to speak in his ear. Her exotic scent wrapped around him, drawing Dirick reluctantly from his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat ails you this night, Sir Dirick?\u201d Eleanor asked. \u201cYou have the expression of one who\u2019s eaten a lemon.\u201d</p><p>Willing to be distracted, he turned to her, summoning his most charming smile. \u201cNaught, your majesty, of any import. \u2019Tis only that I hoped to be closer to finding the man who has murdered my father\u2014and the other men as well. And though I have spoken over and over to those who witnessed the scenes, and even examined the most recent one myself, I cannot seem to find a path to follow.\u201d And so he had passed his time these last months after returning from Langumont and Breakston by setting to other tasks as ordered by the king.</p><p>The queen\u2019s smile faded. Although at the first, she might seem a woman of mere frivolity and sensuality, Eleanor was as shrewd and serious as her husband when it came to her lands and the people thereon. \u201cAye, \u2019tis worrisome to my husband as well, for when and where shall this madman strike next? But he has great faith in you, sir, and you\u2019ve never failed him before. I know that you and Gavin Mal Verne were attending to another matter in Wales only a moon past, and the king was well-pleased on the results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Dirick replied, referring to the Welsh problem that had kept him busy for more than a few fortnights. \u201cNary a life lost, and a rogue castellan imprisoned for his impudence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a fief, undamaged by besiegement, returned to my husband\u2019s control,\u201d Eleanor reminded him. \u201cI know you were ill-pleased at being distracted from your other task, but mayhap a bit of space from it might allow your mind to clear a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, mayhap you are correct,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut the death of Sir Harris only three days ago has made it clear that this murderer is still about, and must be nearby as well.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor nodded. \u201cAye, and the weariness and frustration shows in your face and disposition. You have traveled far in the last days, and seen a horrific sight. Oh, aye, my husband has told me all,\u201d she added when he looked at her in surprise. \u201cHe spares me naught, for which I am both grateful and, at times, dispirited. But for this night, Sir Dirick, why do you not take your mind from such evil thoughts and join my women? They always enjoy a knight with your penchant for poetry, and I have seen you cast your eyes that way more than once this evening.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unease curled in his stomach at the thought of facing Maris with the trite, empty phrases praising the lips and hair and forms of other women. He\u2019d become quite popular with the ladies of the queen\u2019s famous Court of Love years earlier, when Henry traveled to Aquitaine to woo Eleanor. Somehow, he could not picture Maris receiving such superficial praises without making him feel a fool.</p><p>\u201cPray, your grace, excuse me from fulfilling your request tonight. I am rather weary, and fear that my skills may desert me under such duress.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor looked at him shrewdly. \u201cDirick of Derkland,\u201d a smirk curved her well shaped mouth, \u201cdo you not feed me such a lie. The day that your skill with women deserts you is the day I cannot hold a man to me, should I wish to do so.\u201d Despite her confident words, they both knew that her loyalty to the king was unequivocal. Now that the seriousness of their conversation had passed, her eyes twinkled as she made a little moue with her lips. Gently pressing a long nailed finger onto his forearm, she teased, \u201cI vow, your disinterest can only mean one thing.\u201d</p> <p>As he was well and truly a man, Dirick could not help but respond to the femininity of the queen, for she smelled lush and erotic, and her skin and figure were feminine and beautiful. \u201cAye, your grace,\u201d he replied in the flirtatious manner he knew she expected. \u201cMy disinterest could mean only this: that as you, my lady, are well beyond my reach, I have no stomach to play meaningless games with women who can be naught to me.\u201d That latter part, at the least was true.</p><p>And though his charming smile may have fooled a less artful woman, Eleanor was not taken in. \u201cSuch pretty words trip from your beautiful mouth. I do envy the woman who finally steals your heart. And I relish the day of seeing you thus befuddled.\u201d She took a sip of wine from her native lands, her thick lashed eyes watching him closely over the rim of the cup.</p><p>When she replaced the goblet, the expression on her face had changed from that of a coquette to one of certain knowledge. \u201cAn\u2019, by the rood, it has happened, has it not?\u201d Before he could open his mouth, she placed a hand over his. \u201cSave your protestations, Dirick. Though the Courts of Love over which I\u2019ve ruled consist of worshipful love from afar and knights honorably laving attention upon ladies out of their realm, I believe there is a place for a more earthy, reachable love\u2014such as I have with my lord.\u201d A genuine smile warmed her face. \u201cAye, Dirick, even love can be found in such an alliance as that of the Angevin and the Aquitaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour majesty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve long been loyal to my husband, and, through him, to me. Though Henry oft does not see what is before his eyes, and may not hasten to reward those who are true to him, I do not.\u201d Her glance flickered to the table of her ladies, casting over them as if to measure the possibility of whom he loved. \u201cYou\u2019ll have her, Dirick. I will see to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I did not say that I love her. I do not love her. I do not love anyone,\u201d he stammered, feeling unaccountably overwhelmed by Eleanor\u2019s all knowing demeanor. \u201cAnd I have not sought out a single one of your ladies\u2014how can you think this?\u201d</p><p>She laughed her husky laugh again. \u201cIf \u2019tis true love, you shall not be able to hide it from me\u2014or anyone who cares enough to watch. You\u2019ll have her, Dirick, unless she is promised to another.\u201d And with that, she turned from him to rejoin her husband\u2019s conversation.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>Wall sconces were the only light, and they cast flickering shadows upon the rough stone walls.</p><p>Despite the lack of natural illumination, the hallway was well enough lit for Maris to see the glint in Victor\u2019s eyes. Her hand rested reluctantly on his forearm, as it had since he\u2019d led her from the Great Hall, and she walked sedately beside him.</p><p>Maris couldn\u2019t help but remember the last time she\u2019d been alone with Victor\u2014the time she\u2019d raced her horse across the fields of Langumont in a rash challenge to his manhood. A little shiver raced up her spine as she relived the humiliating moments when his mouth invaded hers, and his hands groped her breasts.</p> <p>\u201cHave you taken a chill, my lady?\u201d His voice was smooth and mellow with concern. \u201cTake my mantle.\u201d They paused beneath one of the sconces as he slid the cloak from his shoulders.</p><p>His hands, cold and rough, brushed her chin as he pulled the fur lined wool about her, taking much too long with the fastening at her throat. A finger brushed the line of her jaw, then slid underneath her chin, lifting it to raise her face. \u201cYou\u2019ve yet to cast your eyes upon me this night, my wife.\u201d With a slight movement, he shifted his finger and the nail pressed into the soft underside of her chin. \u201cIf I did not know better, I should say you are disappointed at my presence.\u201d</p><p>Maris swallowed and attempted to keep her voice steady in her reply. \u201cAye, I confess, \u2019twas a surprise to see you here. As you\u2019ve made no chance to contact me since Papa\u2019s...demise,\u201d she said, \u201cI had no choice but to presume you\u2019d decided against our betrothal.\u201d</p><p>A smile that was by no means meant to be soothing settled over his slender lips. \u201cAh, you\u2019d like that, would you not, Lady Maris? You\u2019d like nothing more than to see me walk away from the riches and power that Langumont would bring me.\u201d His hand opened and slid down to cup her throat. She swallowed again and felt the constricting band of his fingers. \u201cAnd the beautiful heiress that was promised me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d she whispered, then gave a little gasp as the hand tightened\u2014not enough to cut off her breath, but enough to threaten her. When she reached up to pull those fingers away, he was quick enough to snatch her wrists and force them down between their bodies.</p><p>\u201cIf you were not to be my wife,\u201d he murmured, bending closer to her face, \u201cI\u2019d not have this at my pleasure.\u201d His lips were cool and dry, but his tongue thrust hot and wet into her mouth.</p><p>Maris struggled to turn her face aside. His hand tightened, holding her head immobile as his mouth continued to delve into hers. She allowed her body to slacken in his grip, then rammed a knee into his belly, narrowly missing a more tender spot. Taking advantage of his shock and breathlessness, she jerked away and groped beneath her overtunic for her dagger.</p><p>As he straightened from his doubled over position, she met him with a glinting blade that rose with the level of his eyes. \u201cBitch!\u201d he hissed, clumsily swiping at her wrist.</p> <p>Maris easily avoided his lunge, but did not turn her attention from him as she began to back away. \u201cIf I am so unfortunate as to be forced to wed with you, you will never touch me in that manner again. Else,\u201d she slowed her gasping breaths, \u201cyou\u2019ll find a third party joining us in the bridal bed.\u201d She brandished the dagger.</p><p>Victor would have grabbed for her wrist again had the sound of voices not reached their ears. As it was, he pinned her with a look filled with hatred before swiveling on his heel and starting off in the direction from whence they\u2019d come.</p><p>Miraculously, the approaching voices faded away, leaving Maris alone in the dank hallway. She ripped Victor\u2019s mantle from her shoulders, flinging it into a corner. A tapestry fluttered against the wall above her head, but all else was still. She slumped against the cold stone, relieved, and struggled to stop the trembling that made her knees weak.</p><p>\u201cBis!\u201d came a voice from the shadows. \u201cWell done, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Maris whirled to see Dirick materializing from a dark alcove. \u201cYou!\u201d she gasped, fury lighting her face. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>He stood, leaning against the wall, arms folded nonchalantly across his middle. \u201c\u2019Twas a close one, that, Maris. I was near ready to step in to assist you.\u201d The hardness in his grey-blue eyes belied his seeming ease, and his gaze covered her as if to assure himself she was unharmed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you here?\u201d she demanded, stepping back and finding the rough wall behind her. She angled the blade of the dagger as if to ward him off.</p><p>Dirick stepped closer, blocking the light from the torch behind him. Maris\u2019s heart bumped in her throat and her breath became shallow. \u201cI suspected you might find yourself in danger when you left the hall in his presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not need your help,\u201d she hissed. \u201cI want nothing from you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. But that is where we differ. I most definitely want something from you, Lady Maris.\u201d</p><p>Her heart leapt, and sweat sprang from her palms even as a rush of heat flooded her. His eyes were so very dark and hard, gleaming with something intent, indefinable, and the hard set of his mouth bespoke of little patience. His calm intensity unsettled her as Victor\u2019s rough anger had not. She edged the dagger in warning. \u201cWhat\u2014what is it you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a great many things, Maris.\u201d He stepped into the pool of torchlight, drawing close enough that the dagger\u2019s blade wavered near his shoulder. \u201cBut my greatest desire is to hear an apology on your lovely lips.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, his hand shot out and closed around her wrist. Knowing the futility of struggle, she allowed the dagger to fall from nerveless fingers and it clattered to the floor.</p><p>She looked up at him, unable to speak...hardly able to keep her breath steady. He was close, so close and tall, broad and warm...familiar. She could even smell the clean, masculine scent of him above the scent of damp wool and clinging wood smoke.</p><p>\u201cCome now, Maris, it cannot be that words have failed you.\u201d His smile was arrogant, then faded into bitterness. \u201cOn the last we met, you accused me of treason in the presence of my lord...and, on the time before that, you left me to die in a pool of my own leavings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not leave you to die,\u201d she burst out, finding her voice. \u201cI am a healer and I well knew what I did.\u201d</p><p>He quirked an eyebrow. \u201cOh, aye, of course that is what you say when faced with the other choice of admitting that you tried to kill me.\u201d He leaned forward, so near that she could see the blue and black flecks in his furious eyes. \u201cDid I not risk my life to help you at Breakston? First you repay me by attempting murder...and then, failing that, by trying to see me hanged for treason.\u201d His fingers tightened around her wrist. \u201cI should be praised for not choking the life out of you, woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLeave me be!\u201d She wrenched out of his grip. She could have fled, running down the hall away from him...but she did not. Nay, and Maris would never understand why she did such a foolish thing and stay.</p><p>\u201cLeave you be?\u201d he said. His voice had changed and he was looking at her with such intensity that Maris suddenly felt weak. And flushed. And...expectant. \u201cDo you not think I\u2019ve tried that simple solution?\u201d</p><p>When he stepped toward her again, she found that she still couldn\u2019t move. Her heart was in her throat, pounding sharply and rapidly while her breathing turned shallow.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting quite some time to exact my vengeance for the dirty trick you played on me at Breakston,\u201d he said, holding her gaze with his, the scuff of his boot brushing her hem. \u201cAnd since an apology does not seem to be forthcoming, I may have to demand a different sort of boon, my lady.\u201d His lips softened as he searched her eyes with his own. \u201cAye. I believe you owe me a boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirick\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis sweet to hear my name on your lips, Maris.\u201d</p><p>Then his hands were on her shoulders, pulling her to him. As their bodies collided gently, his arms went around her and Maris closed her eyes. The next thing she knew, he was devouring her mouth, tasting it as if he\u2019d been without food for a fortnight. And as she slackened in his arms, and began to kiss him back, she felt the low rumble of a moan from deep in his chest as his arms tightened.</p><p>His rough, calloused hands tenderly smoothed over the sensitive line of her jaw, brushing their knuckles against her ear, trailing a fingertip down the sleek line of her neck and leaving a shiver in its wake. They plucked at the veil that covered her thick braids, freeing them from their confines and loosing them from the intricate plaits that held them prisoner.</p> <p>Maris sighed against his mouth, against the warmth and sleekness of his kiss, the insistent delving and dancing of their tongues. He smelled of wine and smoke from the fire, of horses and leather, of wool and a tinge of sweat, of...maleness. She could not help herself, but reached to touch the thick, dark hair that had come loose from its leather thong and found that it was heavy and soft. With light fingertips, she tucked the lock behind his ear and allowed her hand to fall along his warm neck, where a pulse pounded strongly, and rested her palm on the plateau of his chest. The stone wall was cold against her back, and the heat from his body burning against her breasts, hips, and thighs. A sharp pleasant twinge surprised her when one large hand slid up to cup one of her breasts, closing over its firmness, to thumb over her thrusting nipple, to gently massage its heaviness.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Sblood,\u201d he breathed into her ear, his words warm and rough. \u201cHow easily you make me lose my anger, lovely witch. And try as I may, as far as I travel, I cannot seem to banish you from my mind.\u201d He pulled away enough to look down into her eyes.</p><p>His gaze was hot and dark, and Maris\u2019s insides fluttered, bursting into a sharp pang of pleasure and desire. \u201cDirick,\u201d she managed to whisper before he pushed her against the wall again, his mouth covering hers.</p><p>This time it was she who pulled away, for the depth and strength of her response to this man frightened her. Maris stood motionless as her breathing began to slow, as the world around her began to come back into focus.</p><p>\u201cYou say you came to save me,\u201d her voice was husky, \u201cyet I do not know that the danger has passed even now.\u201d She turned, bending to pick up the veil lying crushed on the floor, stunned by the desire she\u2019d felt...and afraid of what it meant. Even if it were more than mere passion, they could never act on it.</p><p>Thus Maris forced her voice into steadiness, hardness. \u201cIt was not so great a boon you asked, Sir Dirick Derkland. Oh, aye, I have learned your true name by now. Nay, it was no great boon you\u2019ve taken, for I have been groped by no less than two other men...both of whom, verily, had more claim to do so than yourself.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped back as if slapped. \u201cI am well aware that I have no claim to you...nor\u2014\u201d He paused, then continued, \u201cDo not misunderstand, nor do I wish to claim you.\u201d Dirick stepped aside, his movements rigid and his face dark. \u201cI\u2019ll not bother you with my presence any longer than to see you safely to your chamber.\u201d He bent to pick up the dagger lying harmlessly in the pool of light.</p><p>When he straightened, the fierce look in his eyes was enough to make her back away. All at once, those grey eyes glittered with an anger and hatred that she had never seen before. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she breathed, her hand going to her throat as his hand shot out to grab her arm.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d His face filled her vision, fingers tight over her skin. \u201cTell me, where did you get this dagger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u2019twas Papa\u2019s,\u201d she stammered, drawing as far away as his grasp would allow. \u201cRelease me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he come by it?\u201d Dirick ignored her demand, staring at the silver handled dagger as if he\u2019d seen a ghost.</p><p>Maris tried to jerk away, but her puny strength was naught against his ferocity, and this time, he was not playing. \u201cI do not know! What is it to you?\u201d she replied, becoming truly afraid. \u201cYou are bruising me, Dirick.\u201d</p><p>With an oath, as if he\u2019d just realized his strength, he released her arm. Maris backed away, rubbing the spot he\u2019d gripped, staring at him in horror. What had befallen him?</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get this dagger?\u201d he asked again, controlled but still intent upon the small weapon.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you\u2014\u2019twas my papa\u2019s. I found it in a trunk when I packed to come to court,\u201d Maris explained. Still wary of his sudden temper, she sidled along the wall.</p><p>\u201cDo not fear, I\u2019ll not harm you again,\u201d he told her wearily. Then he looked at her with that intensity again. \u201cIf I replace it for you, may I keep this?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNay, please do not ask that of me. It\u2019s one of few things I have left from Papa.\u201d She knew that he would keep it if he liked, so when he handed it back to her, she breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cI did not ever express my sorrow at your father\u2019s death,\u201d Dirick said, his face grave. \u201cHe was a good man. He reminded me of my own father.\u201d</p><p>Maris nodded, sudden tears choking her throat. She\u2019d become adept at stopping the tears of grief, now, more than three moons since Papa\u2019s death...but the pain had not lessened. \u201cI miss him terribly,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cAs I do my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not know you\u2019ve lost your father as well,\u201d she said. It struck her at that moment that she knew nothing of his family or of whence he came. Only that the king seemed to place great trust in him.</p><p>\u201cA knife such as this,\u201d Dirick said, \u201cthe workmanship of which I\u2019ve never seen before or since, was found at the scene of a murder...and that murder scene was identical to the one at which my father was found.\u201d Dirick\u2019s eyes held a sober pain. \u201cAt the king\u2019s command, I\u2019m searching for the man who has now killed seven people, leaving behind three scenes of the most senseless slaughter in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard naught of such killings,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd I trow you\u2019ll hear little else. Do you not speak of this to anyone until the man is found...I do not wish him to know that I am on his trail. Come,\u201d he was suddenly abrupt, \u201cI will take you to your chamber.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring Victor\u2019s cloak, which still lay in its ignoble heap on the cold floor, Maris turned, sweeping her skirts, and without further conversation, allowed him to return her to her chamber.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTTEEN</p><p>\u201cLady Maris, her majesty requests that you attend her.\u201d A page stood in the doorway of the ladies\u2019 solar, giving a slight bow. \u201cShe asks that you bring your bag of herbal medicines, for she is in need of your skills.\u201d</p><p>Maris sprang to her feet, at once nervous that she would be asked to personally attend the queen, and grateful that she would have something to do other than embroidering in a room filled with chattering women. Judith had been smart enough to beg off from sewing tasks today in favor of taking her gyrfalcon for a brief hunt, leaving Maris with the idea that mayhap she would acquire herself a hunting falcon.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell her majesty that I will be at her service anon,\u201d she told the page.</p><p>He gave another bow and remained at the door. \u201cI will take you to her, lady.\u201d</p><p>With a quick smile to the other women, who looked on with interest, Maris dropped her embroidery in a heap on a stool next to her chair, hoping to not see it again before the day was over. \u201cI shall meet you at supper,\u201d she told Madelyne, who was busily stitching a surcoat for Lord Gavin. Without waiting for a reply, she swept from the room and directed the page to her chamber.</p><p>Within, she unlocked one of the trunks she\u2019d brought from Langumont, retrieving a well worn leather sack with dried herbs packed in wrappings of linen, wool, or leather. Digging deeper, she pulled a wooden box, tied shut with a silken tie, from the bottom of the trunk. The box held a mortar and pestle, tinctures and oils, knives and spoons and small wooden bowls for mixing. Though it was likely that the queen already had such tools available to her, Maris felt more comfortable with her own equipment and was determined to be prepared for any request Eleanor should make.</p><p>The trip to the queen\u2019s presence was not long, but it was complicated, and Maris soon lost her way. Not for the first time did she wonder that a young boy could find his way with such ease. At last, they reached a large oaken door with heavy metal slats bracing it, and ornate carvings on the wood framing the doorway.</p><p>The page knocked on the heavy oak, then, although Maris heard nothing from within, bowed yet again, and gestured for her to enter.</p><p>She opened the door and stepped in.</p><p>Eleanor sat in a large, well cushioned chair lodged in a far corner. A small table next to her held a pitcher, two goblets, and a silver platter loaded with cheese and bread. The fireplace, near enough the chair to cast shadows from its flames but far enough that there was no danger of skirts catching afire, contained a crackling blaze. Another chair, positioned to face that which the queen used, was not so well cushioned; though the pillow on its seat was generous enough. A thick, heavy tapestry covered the floor, Maris noted in surprise, having never seen such a luxury before, and more tapestries hung from the walls and over the arrow slits in the stone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome in, Lady Maris,\u201d came the mellow voice of the queen.</p><p>Maris did as she was urged, closing the door in her wake, and taking in more of the room. A large, curtained bed hugged another wall, and was warmed by its own fireplace\u2014it, too, filled with a roaring fire. A table littered with parchments, quills, and a pot of ink sat near the two chairs, and trunks bursting with gowns, cloaks, cups, plates, cloths, leather bags, and all types of trinkets lined the walls throughout.</p><p>\u201cYour majesty.\u201d Maris curtsied when she reached the edge of the luxurious floor covering.</p> <p>Eleanor waved a graceful hand to an empty chair next to the table. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Maris\u2019s quick glance about the room revealed that she was alone with the queen, and she wondered whether her grace\u2019s affliction was that of a private nature. Placing her leather sack and wooden box on the floor, she did as ordered and sat, waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou may pour some wine, Lady Maris.\u201d</p><p>Accepting this as an invitation to serve both herself and the queen, Maris filled two of the goblets with a heavy red wine. \u201cHow may I assist you?\u201d she asked, placing a cup within Eleanor\u2019s easy reach.</p><p>\u201cYou are well versed in healing and the use of physic herbs I am told. Your skills surpass even that of Madelyne of Mal Verne.\u201d</p> <p>Maris bowed her head in acknowledgement. \u201cI have studied such medicines since I was ten summers.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for her drink with long white fingers, the queen said, \u201cTell me how you were taught.\u201d</p><p>Sipping her own wine, Maris explained, \u201cMy mother, Allegra Lareux, began to teach me the simple uses of herbs. As I became more skilled and yearned to know beyond her knowledge, I studied with a midwife of Langumont. Some years ago, a man well taught in the healing of the Holy Lands lived at Langumont and shared his great mastery with me.\u201d Emboldened by the queen\u2019s interest, she asked, \u201cHow did you come to hear of my skills?\u201d</p><p>A faint smile quirked Eleanor\u2019s lips as she drank. Her blue eyes were shrewd. \u201cI am told by a trusted friend that your skill is so great that you can bring a man\u2014nay, a whole keep, the tale goes\u2014near enough to death that he wishes to die, yet not so close that he does expire.\u201d</p><p>Maris felt her face heat to what was surely dark rose in color, and she was suddenly fearful that she\u2019d been brought here for reprimand. \u201cI am ashamed that you should hear of my expertise in such a sorry way. \u2019Tis not the way I was taught\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eleanor laughed. \u201cDo you not apologize, Maris, as I am of the mind to reward a woman\u2014not reprimand her\u2014when she rises to an occasion to save herself! Does the Church not say that God helps those who help themselves?\u201d She reached for a piece of cheese. \u201cI am one to espouse such actions if the end justifies the means.\u201d She chuckled again. \u201cIt would have been an interesting sight to see an entire keep laid low whilst yourself and your maidservant tripped blithely over the drawbridge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a more memorable moment in my history,\u201d Maris admitted with a wry smile, \u201cthough I would never choose the words \u2018tripping blithely\u2019 to describe our hasty departure.\u201d She took a sip of wine, wondering that Dirick had such familiarity with the queen that he should tell her of his own misfortune. \u2019Twas a testament to his own cocksureness that he would freely share of an event in which he was bested by a woman. \u201cMy lady, how may I assist you?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a minor affliction, Lady Maris\u2014naught but an ache to my ear. I often have the same complaint during the winter months, and most often, the leeches or physicians direct me to soak my feet in a bath of hot water with ground mustard seeds.\u201d She settled back into her chair, her gaze direct upon Maris whilst her fingers stroked the tassel of her girdle. \u201c\u2018Tis not the most convenient treatment and I but search for another answer to this illness.\u201d</p><p>Maris nodded her head in understanding. She found it not at all surprising that the beautiful and regal Eleanor of Aquitaine would not wish to do something as ungainly as to soak her bare feet, particularly among her ladies and courtiers. \u201cTell me, does the pain in your ear feel like the beat of a drum, or more like a sharp pinch of pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis most like the beat of a drum, far inside my ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it accompanied with a sound like the peal of a bell as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, tell me, your majesty, have you any other complaints at the same time you have this ache of the ear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d</p> <p>Maris rose. \u201cWith your permission, I\u2019ll prepare a remedy that will be easily and discreetly administered, and mayhap even decrease the frequency of the affliction.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor nodded, watching with hawk eyes as Maris delved into her leather satchel, and then into the smooth wooden box. She withdrew a small knife, a small, empty bottle with a tight cork stopper, a second, larger bottle, and a fruit that looked like a small, bulging onion. Watching Maris peel the crisp, white skin from the onion, Eleanor asked, \u201cIs that not a garlic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Maris looked up in surprise. \u201c\u2019Tis not a common fruit here in England, though it is popular near the Holy Lands. Other healers I haven spoke with complain of its rank smell, though I rather like it. It has many uses aside of which I will show you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have seen it on my own Crusade to the Holy Land,\u201d the queen told her as Maris used the little knife to crush then chop a clove of garlic. A pungent smell pervaded the room.</p><p>Maris adjusted her long sleeve and reached for the large bottle. \u201cYour majesty, I\u2019ll pour a small amount of this oil over the chopped garlic in a small vial. You should pour a tiny drop of this oil into the ear which pains you one time in the morning, and one time in the evening until the ache is gone.\u201d She scraped the chopped garlic into the smaller bottle, then added a generous amount of oil. Using the cork to stop the vial, she shook it briskly, then offered it to the queen.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my dear,\u201d Eleanor took the bottle, studied it, then set it upon the table next to her.</p><p>Expecting to be dismissed, Maris gathered up her equipment and packed it away.</p><p>Thus, the queen\u2019s words took her by surprise. \u201cDirick of Derkland speaks well of you, Lady Maris.\u201d</p><p>Unable to control the color that once more rose in her face, Maris kept her attention on the silken cord she wrapped around her wooden box. Her fingers became clumsy and would not cooperate as she sought to tie the knot. She did not know how to respond to the queen. Indeed, she was not altogether sure that Eleanor required a response.</p><p>It seemed that she did not. \u201cAre you promised, Lady Maris?\u201d</p><p>Maris looked up into an intent gaze. \u201cMy father arranged a betrothal but he was killed before the ceremony could take place. I do not know\u2014I do not believe that the contracts were signed.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor steepled her fingers. \u201cVery good. I thank you for your service. Payment shall be rendered to you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p><p>Maris pushed back her hood, letting the spring breeze caress her face. She tilted her face toward the sun, eyes closed. It felt heavenly to be out of the dark castle and away from the busy, smelly streets of London.</p><p>Hickory nickered next to her, as if to agree with her mistress\u2019s unspoken thoughts. They were wading through the tall grass of a meadow just outside of the city, harvesting herbs to replenish the ones Maris had used throughout the winter. Sir Raymond of Vermille, along with three other men at arms from Langumont, stood in the road at the edge of the meadow, idly watching over his mistress.</p><p>Pleased to see that the bright blue chicory was already blooming, Maris pulled several plants from the soil, shaking dirt from the heavy roots. They were sturdy plants with bristly leaves and finely haired stems and were good for many uses. She cut the roots and wrapped them in thick cotton sleeves to later be brewed into a light tonic, then stuffed the leaves into a different cotton bag. The leaves were useless when dried, so fresh ones were always of value when available.</p><p>She strolled further across the meadow, toward a smattering of trees where she suspected raspberry bushes grew. Those leaves created the best tea, along with peppermint, for breeding women. The tea eased nausea and helped the babe root itself firmly inside the mother. As she reached the line of shade from tall oak trees with branches that spread across the sky, she noticed the shiny, dark green leaves and pale pink buds of a familiar herb.</p><p>Maris stopped, crouching in the cluster of the ground covering plant, and stilled her hands. Bearberry, the leaves of which she and Sir Dirick had gathered one chill winter afternoon. The scene, with all of its vibrant color, had imprinted itself upon her memory: she\u2019d been clutching those thick, padded leaves, and he\u2019d tossed the bright red berries over the snow before drawing her to his mouth for the warmth of a first kiss.</p><p>A pang of heat hummed through her as she remembered the sweetness and fire of that meeting of mouths...and how on later occasions the demands of his lips had coaxed a more compelling response, her limbs becoming liquid and her heart thudding heavily in her breast. Drawing a shaky breath, Maris plucked a few leaves, running her calloused finger over their smoothness.</p><p>Try as she might, as furious as she might be with him, Sir Dirick\u2019s face and presence had not been far from her mind since...aye, since the eve he\u2019d nearly trampled her with his prized destrier. She lowered her rump to the ground, sitting surrounded by tall grasses and shaded by the oak trees. Her fingers were busy, tearing the leaves into halves and pulling the petals from the flower buds, even as her thoughts rambled through the range of emotions he evoked in her: anger at his complicity with Bon de Savrille...warmth and passion from his kisses...laughter and smiles from their bantering in the stables...and, increasingly, an unsettling fear for the depth of her emotions, from her inability to forget Dirick for more than a short time.</p><p>Was it possible? Could she love him?</p><p>Maris closed her eyes tightly, trying to block away the unwelcome thought. Even if she did\u2014God in heaven!\u2014love him, even if it were true, there was naught she could do about it. Her life and lands belonged to King Henry to do with as he would. He\u2019d never bestow the well landed heiress of Langumont upon a mere knight\u2014no matter how much Dirick amused him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something obstructed the glare of the sun, and her eyes sprang open. A figure, a man, sat on a horse just in front of her, casting his shadow over her. Blinded by the blazing sun, at first she did not recognize him\u2014but then he spoke.</p><p>\u201cLady Maris,\u201d his voice was familiar, purring\u2014and unwelcome. \u201cMay I assist you to your feet?\u201d</p><p>Bon de Savrille!</p> <p>Strangling a cry of surprise, Maris started to her feet, caught herself in her skirts, and tumbled back into the tall grasses. Lord Bon loomed over her, but she still could not see his features for the glare of the sun behind him. A large, blunt fingered hand reached down from the saddle and clasped her arm, pulling her easily to stand.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d she spoke at last, looking surreptitiously about for Sir Raymond.</p><p>\u201cDo you not fear,\u201d Bon said as his mount danced aside, blocking the sun so that she could see him. \u201cYour men-at-arms are near\u2014I did not come from the road, but through the forest whence I saw you start across the meadow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you here in London?\u201d Maris was not able to comprehend his sudden appearance.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, you are never far from my thoughts...an\u2019 in turn, I did not wish to be far from your person.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBon, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>A far off shout reached their ears, and both turned to see Sir Raymond and his companions galloping across the field toward them.</p><p>\u201cAh, your saviors come.\u201d Before she could react, Bon took one of her hands and, inclining his head, brought her fingers swiftly to his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll have you, my lady, if \u2019tis the last action I make on this earth. I find I cannot live without you. Though you nearly murdered me with your poisons, you are the water this thirsty man must sip, the meat this starving man must partake...and, make no mistake, you will be mine\u2014lands or no.\u201d</p><p>And with that, just as her escort came thundering up, Bon wheeled his mount and cantered off into the forest.</p> <p>\u201cMy lady, are you hurt? Shall we go after him?\u201d Raymond reined in next to her.</p><p>\u201cNay, I am well,\u201d Maris replied, still stunned at Bon\u2019s sudden appearance and disappearance.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that man?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAye, that was none other than Bon de Savrille of Breakston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Raymond would have started after him had Maris not raised her hand to halt him.</p><p>\u201cNay, Raymond, do you not trouble yourself. He did not harm me, or even threaten me\u2014except with his desire to have my person.\u201d She giggled, as much with relief as mirth. \u201cI do believe Lord Bon is quite harmless, as he could easily have swept me up and away with him. And, in truth, I prefer him to wed over Lord Victor.\u201d Her smile faded at the ugly memory of his advances two nights earlier.</p><p>\u201cWill Lord Victor press his suit with the king?\u201d Sir Raymond asked, alighting from his steed. He stood close to Maris, protectively, and they stepped away from the other three men.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201cPray God he does not, else I\u2019d as lief be a traitor or a murderess before I\u2019ll share his bed!\u201d</p> <p>Raymond dashed a glance about, as if to be aware of unseen ears. \u201cNay, Lady, ne\u2019er should you compromise yourself thus. \u2019Tis I who would free you from such an unwelcome match, know you this.\u201d His gaze did not waver. \u201cI should be branded murderer in your stead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Raymond\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your father\u2019s wish, lady.\u201d</p><p>She looked up a him, confused. \u201cWhat say you, sir? It was my father who arranged for my contract with Victor d\u2019Arcy.\u201d</p><p>Raymond shielded his eyes from the sun that glared from behind her. His rugged face settled into serious lines and he drew her further from the rest of her escort. \u201cLady, your papa saw his error in promising you to Victor and had taken steps to reverse his offer whence we came to free you from Breakston. He sent me with a missive to his majesty on the chance that he\u2019d not live through the battle ahead to retract the betrothal himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 he did not.\u201d Maris\u2019s words were pained. Tears welled in her eyes for the loss of the person she\u2019d loved most in the world.</p><p>\u201cNay, he did not...an\u2019 I am thus torn that I was not there to cover his back in the battle, brief though \u2019twas, for they opened the gates as soon as the men nocked their bows. But instead of being there, I brought the message to the king. I was your father\u2019s man, and I am now your man for my life.\u201d</p><p>She rested a hand on his muscular arm. \u201cThank you, Raymond, I thank you for your words. I could not bear to think that I would go against my father\u2019s wishes if I were to fight the betrothal contract. Now, at the least, I know that his spirit is with me ere I do.\u201d</p><p>He squinted into the lowering sun. \u201cLet us back to the castle, my lady. Eventide draws near.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, suddenly elated at the thought of returning to the city. Doubtless, she would share the evening meal with her friends Judith and Madelyne...and, mayhap, chance to speak with Dirick of Derkland.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>\u201cSir Dirick, would you not play the lute for us?\u201d Lady Gladys simpered, looking at him over the rim of her goblet. \u201cHer Majesty praises your talent.\u201d</p><p>He forced his attention from the entrance to the Great Hall. Why had Maris not come to dinner? \u201cAye, my lady, how could one not have great talent when faced with such inspiration?\u201d His lips curved into a smile that he did not feel as he pulled a leg from the goose offered by a page. The leg twisted easily from the roasted fowl, juices running down into the trencher he shared with Gladys. \u201cDo you wish some, my lady?\u201d he asked, avoiding a commitment to honor her request.</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord, as you prepare it so prettily.\u201d She gave him a coy glance that failed to stir even the slightest response from him, and tore a small piece of bread from the trencher.</p><p>Even as he passed the meat to his dining companion, Dirick\u2019s gaze scanned the room, searching yet again for the absent Maris. He sought, and found, Lord Victor and his father, who sat several tables further from the royal dais than he did. Their presence, at the least, soothed some of his concern as to why she was not at dinner. But, just as he brought his wine to his mouth, he noticed a man seated near the rear of the hall, where naught but the meanest men-at-arms were seated. Dirick froze and returned the goblet to the table, rising to his full height in surprise. Aye, \u2019twas him. Bon de Savrille.</p><p>The bastard should have been disseizened from Breakston after his abduction of Maris, but the king had yet to do so\u2014a fact that annoyed Dirick to no end.</p><p>And what in the name of Christ was the man doing here, when he hadn\u2019t been to court for years? Dirick was certain he knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Sir Dirick?\u201d Gladys asked from next to him.</p><p>He barely heard her as he stepped over the trestle bench with the barest glance at her. \u201cPardon, my ladies,\u201d he muttered to the table at large, pushing hastily around a page holding a pitcher of wine.</p><p>Dirick made his way to Bon de Savrille\u2019s side in moments, ignoring the surprised murmurs of the other man\u2019s table companions when he barged along behind them. \u201cWhat do you here?\u201d he demanded, placing a firm hand on Bon\u2019s soft, broad shoulder</p><p>The other man craned his head around, then nearly fell back off the bench in surprise. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>Dirick did not remove his hand. Instead, he slid his grip down to Bon\u2019s upper arm and propelled him away from his dinner seat. \u201cWhat have you done with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your hands from my person,\u201d growled Bon, making a great show of brushing crumbs of bread from his tunic. When he finished arranging his clothing, he held a dagger in one hand.</p><p>Dirick stilled. Blood rushed through his limbs and he became aware that the attention of several men-at-arms from the table was focused upon them. A glint of steel winked in the torchlight, barely flickering as Bon held the blade steadily under his nose. Dirick forced himself to breathe normally, gathering his wits enough to look at the handle of the knife gripped tightly in the hand of the combative man before him.</p><p>\u201cWhat say you sir?\u201d sneered Bon. \u201cYou demand answers from me when \u2019tis you who availed yourself of my hospitality under false pretenses.\u201d</p><p>Dirick jerked his gaze to a point behind Bon, reaching to the side as if to catch something. The ruse worked and the other man lost concentration, letting his glance shift away from Dirick for the barest of moments. It was enough to suit Dirick\u2019s purpose as he lifted his knee in a powerful thrust, ramming Bon\u2019s wrist and sending the dagger scuttling to the floor. He stepped closer to him, setting his jaw and muttering between clenched teeth, \u201cWhat have you done with her?\u201d</p><p>Bon grasped the front of Dirick\u2019s tunic and shoved him aside. \u201cLeave me to finish my meal.\u201d</p><p>Before Bon could return to his seat, Dirick clamped a hand on his shoulder and yanked him back. \u201cWhere is Lady Maris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep back, cockspittle.\u201d He shook off Dirick\u2019s hand and swung.</p><p>Dirick ducked, aware that more attention had turned to them. He grabbed Bon\u2019s tunic and dragged him so that they were chest to chest. Ale from his breath blasted into his face, and Dirick could see a piece of meat stuck between Bon\u2019s two front teeth. \u201cBy God\u2019s bones, man, tell me what you\u2019ve done with Lady Maris.\u201d</p><p>Bon shoved hard and succeeded in pushing Dirick off-balance. \u201cI\u2019ve naught to say to you, sirrah, that cannot be said with the steel of my knife. An\u2019 I\u2019ll gladly speak to you with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vow, if you\u2019ve laid a finger on her person, I\u2019ll carve you into little pieces\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis just as well my person is fine and fit,\u201d came a musical voice from behind him, \u201celse His Majesty\u2019s meal would most certainly be ruined by the bloodshed!\u201d</p><p>Dirick dropped his hand from Bon and turned to find Maris, flanked by Sir Raymond and another man-at-arms, with an amused, quirked mouth. She was unharmed, he noted immediately, and she was also laughing at him with those beautiful green and gold eyes. Laughing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An annoyed flush rose to his cheeks and he realized that more spectators had been drawn to the watch the altercation, and that even the attention of the king and queen had come to rest upon them. The hall, usually so loud that the barking of a dog or the dropping of a platter went unnoticed, breathed as close to silence as a crowded chamber could.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d He gave a stiff bow and didn\u2019t quite meet Maris\u2019s laughing eyes. \u201c\u2019Tis glad I am that you are unharmed.\u201d He bent to retrieve Bon\u2019s dagger, noting its unexceptional wooden handle, and returned it to the other man. \u201cUnharmed. And she had best remain thus,\u201d he said, his eyes boring into the other man\u2019s dark gaze.</p><p>As he spoke those words, the attention of the diners returned to their meals as if the entertainment had never occurred. With one more glance at Maris, who watched him with an unfathomable expression, Dirick turned to make his way back to his place at the front of the hall.</p> <p>Somehow, amid the din that had started back up to accompany the meal, he heard her gasp. He spun about in time to see Bon\u2019s dagger slashing down upon him. Dirick instinctively raised his arm and the blade, which had been meant for his back, sliced through the woolen tunic, along the back of his shoulder. With a howl of rage, he leaped at Bon, knocking him to the floor.</p><p>Kneeling over the stocky man, he pinned one thick arm in the sweet rushes and grappled with the other that held the dagger.</p><p>\u201cI did not ever,\u201d he grunted, \u201chave the occasion to repay the hospitality which\u2014\u201d Dirick\u2019s breath was cut off by a knee shoved into his ribs, but that effort cost Bon the battle for the knife. \u201c\u2014The hospitality which you provided to Lady Maris.\u201d</p><p>The brief, close struggle ended with the point of the blade very near Bon\u2019s throat, and a crowd of men pressing in upon the scene. Dirick pulled himself to his feet, slightly winded but enlivened from the sudden intensity of the quarrel. \u201cGet you out of my sight, else I will well and truly repay your graciousness to the lady. And know this\u2014you need have no fear of turning your back to me, Bon de Savrille, for when I mean to strike you, there will be no need for stealth.\u201d</p><p>His face distorted with rage, Bon pulled himself to his feet and pushed through the cluster of spectators. Again, as the altercation dissipated, so did the viewers, returning to their interrupted meals with the aplomb of long acceptance of such scenes.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a care in the dark hallways, anon,\u201d murmured a voice behind Dirick.</p><p>He turned to Maris. Her smirk had been replaced by a frown that creased her forehead. \u201cThe man is a buffoon,\u201d he said carelessly. She stood close to him, her long cuff brushing against the hem of his tunic, and he did not move away.</p><p>\u201cAh, buffoon though he is, \u2019tis he who walked away unscathed and you who have the wound.\u201d Concern lurked under her nonchalance as she rose on her toes to look at his shoulder. Dirick became aware of the spreading dampness of warm blood and a throbbing pain beneath it. \u201cCome, I\u2019ll see to your ill, as you made the fool of yourself on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>Her brisk voice dampened any tenderness that may have been in her eyes and Dirick was strangely annoyed. \u201cNay, lady, I\u2019ll not keep you from your meal.\u201d</p><p>Maris tilted an eyebrow, looking up at him. \u201cI have little hunger left, as your talk of bloodshed sapped my desire for food. Come, if I am skilled enough to treat the queen, verily I can do you little harm. And while you stand there and dawdle, your tunic is getting soiled!\u201d</p><p>He muttered that she could indeed inflict harm upon him, as he had the memory of an agonizing night on a cold floor to prove it, but in the end, he followed her from the hall. Sir Raymond dogged their footsteps as Maris led the way toward the main hallway to the other side of Westminster.</p> <p>\u201cI will watch over your mistress, Raymond, you may return to the hall for your meal.\u201d The other man ignored Dirick\u2019s comment while Maris stopped short and turned a cool look on him. \u201cMy men take orders from no one but me, Sir Dirick.\u201d Then she turned to Sir Raymond. \u201cNevertheless, the man is in the right. Raymond, you may return and join the others for dinner. Though he has a wounded shoulder, I vow Dirick will allow no harm to come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d Raymond began hesitantly, then tried again. \u201cBut Lady Maris, you cannot take him to your chamber! \u2019Twould be but more fuel to the fire already started back there!\u201d</p><p>Maris shook her head, \u201cAgnes awaits me\u2014we\u2019ll not be alone. I\u2019ll give him a poultice and send him on his way before anyone is the wiser. Now, go you.\u201d</p><p>They were silent for the remainder of the long walk to her chamber. When they reached the heavy oaken door, Dirick opened it and preceded her in.</p><p>Maris stood in the entrance, watching as he scouted the room with a sharp gaze. His attention went from the smoldering fire to the trunks lined neatly along one short wall, to the narrow bed piled with pillows from her own bedchamber at Langumont.</p><p>\u201cYour maidservant is not here.\u201d He\u2019d moved back to the door and stood half in and half out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI did not expect her to be,\u201d she said, dismissing the thought with a wave of her hand. \u201cCome within.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the door closed, nudging him out of the way, then knelt beside a trunk, untying its leather straps and flinging its lid open. As she rummaged through cloths and small bags, the hem of her veil fell forward and tangled in the contents of the trunk. With a mutter of frustration, she yanked it off, uncovering the four thick braids that were looped up at her crown. Tossing the wimple aside, she delved once more into the depths of the trunk and at last retrieved a small pouch. She set it aside, rummaged further, and withdrew a small square of folded cloth.</p> <p>When Maris pulled to her feet, she found Dirick poking at the fire, his back to her. The dark red stain on his shoulder had seeped further, but not alarmingly so. She reached to shift the cloth away from the wound, but he moved just as she touched him. \u201cYou must remove your tunic and shirt,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He hesitated as his gaze rested on her unveiled head, then dropped to her hands holding the leather pouch. \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>She waited for a moment, but when he did not move, she stepped toward him. \u201cDoes it pain you to move? Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d He stopped her. \u201cIt does not pain me overmuch. Mayhap\u2014\u201d he craned his head at an odd angle, twisting to see the blood stain, \u201cmayhap it has stopped bleeding and I do not need nursing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirick, do not be foolish. \u2019Twas a deep enough cut and I\u2019ve seen many lesser wounds fester. Take off your tunic and I will see to it.\u201d She gestured to a three legged stool in front of the fireplace. \u201cYou must sit, as I\u2019ll not be able to see well at your height.\u201d</p><p>Maris frowned at him until he acquiesced and began to struggle out of the tunic. As he sat on the stool, clad only in a thin linen shirt and breeches, she turned to find another candle. Lighting the tallow, she placed it on one of the trunks where it would cast a ready light on his shoulder. Then, she added water to a small pot hanging over the fire. At last, she returned her attention to him just as he slowly pulled off the linen shirt.</p><p>Her breath slowed, shallowed, and caught when she saw his sleek, muscled back and broad bare shoulders. She must have gasped, for he turned from his contemplation of the fire to look at her with half hooded eyes.</p><p>For a moment, she could not speak. The fire played golden and rust shadows over the planes of his arms, caressing the dip in his shoulder and the hollow of his collarbone. It tipped the curling ends of his thick hair with sunlight, smoothing over the jut of angular cheekbones and square chin. Shadows mingled with the thick covering of hair that grew from the widest part of his chest down...down to a place she could not see....to where heavy, muscled arms rested between his knees.</p><p>She had seen many a bare torso in her work as a healer, and also as Lady of Langumont. But she had not expected to find herself so...aware...of this one.</p><p>Maris forced herself to recover. \u201cAh, the stab\u2014\u2019tis worse than I\u2019d thought.\u201d She moved toward him and he turned back to look at the crackling fire. She\u2019d treated countless injuries of this type. The only cause of her sudden nervousness was that they were alone in her chamber. Pushing aside these thoughts, she bent to examine the laceration.</p><p>No sooner had she turned her attention to him than she realized this was not the same as any other time. He was not merely a patient to her, a wound to be healed, a bit of skin to be cleansed.</p><p>And that thought made her all the more aware of what she was about to do.</p><p>His skin was warm and taut, with a few wiry hairs scattered over the curve of his shoulder. There were many, many other scars healed into pale puckers of skin...and some that were purple or red, ugly and jagged. Maris wanted to touch them all, to smooth over the remnants of the dangers he\u2019d faced in the service of the king, to be certain they were as healed as possible.</p><p>Her fingers trembled as they brushed over Dirick\u2019s shoulder blade and little bumps erupted over his skin. One of her braids fell from its mooring and thunked onto his shoulder, and Dirick started so that it slid down his back and rested along his spine.</p><p>She felt him draw a breath when she dabbed a damp cloth over the cut, then poked gently at it. It was a clean cut from a very sharp dagger, not deep enough to slice through the tendons, but enough that it would take some time to heal. Some threads from his shirt had caught in the coagulating blood and Maris used a bit of the heating water to wash them free. As she became more engrossed in her work, he seemed to sense it and released a long, slow breath.</p><p>When she left his side to prepare the poultice, Dirick shifted on the stool, watching her. Her fingers seemed to have grown twice as long and thrice as fat, as first they dropped the leather pouch, and then could not undo its knot. And finally, when she pulled a handful of dried woad leaves forth, her fingers did not hold them tightly enough and the leaves scattered over the floor and table.</p><p>Muttering to herself, Maris stooped to scrape up the dried herb, taking care not to crumble the fragile leaves further. By the time she gathered them into a small wooden bowl, the water on the fire was bubbling and steaming. When she glanced over to check it, Dirick noticed, offering, \u201cI\u2019ll get that for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded and returned to her work. The dried woad, at one time a pretty blue green color, but now dried into a dull black, crumbled in the bowl. She took a handful of dried chamomile flowers from a different leather pouch and added them to the woad. Dirick stood at her side, holding the hot water, and she gestured for him to add some to the herbs. He poured gently, taking care not to splash it, and when the water embraced the flowers and leaves, a pungent but pleasing scent filled the air.</p><p>Maris brushed past him, lightly touching his bare arm as she reached for the square of cloth. He stiffened, stepping out of her way, and returned to his seat on the stool. She stirred the contents of the bowl, unfolded the cloth into a long strip, then turned back to her patient. The bleeding had slowed to a mere ooze, and she washed the cut once more.</p><p>Then, using a flat wooden utensil, she scooped up the mass of herbs and water and murmured, \u201cIt will be warm.\u201d Dirick did indeed start when she smoothed the poultice onto his injury, but she felt him relax as the treatment began to work to soothe the pain and cleanse the cut. Maris placed the cloth over his shoulder, lifting his heavy, muscular arm to wrap the bandage.</p> <p>Once it was in place, she patted the poultice gently, checked that none of the herbs were leaking from beneath, and tied the cloth into place.</p><p>Then, her hands did not want to leave him: they brushed his thick hair from the nape of his neck, pulled a few strands from under the bandage, and smoothed over his uninjured shoulder. Dirick\u2019s chest rose as he drew in a single, ragged breath, and then he stilled.</p><p>\u201cYou have many hurts,\u201d Maris said, tracing a finger over one scar, and then another, and another.... His skin was warm and smooth, the little bumps erupting wherever she touched him.</p><p>\u201cAnd none tended as carefully as this one.\u201d His voice was rough. Reaching over his good shoulder, he captured her hand and pulled it forward, turning his head to place a kiss on her knuckle, and pressing her palm to the center of his chest..</p><p>The front of him was hot from the proximity of the fire. She smoothed her hand through wiry hair over the hard swell of muscle, brushing a flat nipple and tracing the ridge of bone down his center. The tingling that began in her fingers flushed through her body, culminating in a pool in her middle that warmed and stirred her entire being. Her chest rose, breasts pushing against his back, and her breathing became shallow and labored.</p> <p>She wanted more. She wanted all of him.</p><p>Maris gasped at the thought, pulling her hand away, and stepped back. Before she could speak, to explain, Dirick whirled off the stool, turning onto her with dark, glittering eyes and a taut mouth.</p><p>\u201cJes\u00f9, Maris,\u201d he breathed, reaching for her. He was beautiful, dark, masculine: all muscle and thick, wild hair, haloed by the dancing fire, towering over her.</p><p>She did not resist when he pulled her flush to the long, hard length of his body. Sinking against him, fingers closing over his shoulders, she tilted her head back to receive his kiss. His mouth covered hers, desperate and hungry, and Maris felt herself swept into a maelstrom of heat and energy, kissing him back, forgetting where she was, that she had to breathe....</p><p>The warmth of his bare chest, the texture of wiry hair and heated skin, the sleek bulge of muscle...all of him pressed against her, burning through the thin cloth of her gown. Her breasts felt tight, straining against him, her core tight and swelling and damp. When she eased a hand up into his thick hair, and the other back down over his chest, he pulled away enough to look down at her.</p><p>The intensity in his eyes, the deep need there, caused a great tightening in her middle. She met his gaze, reaching up to touch his parted lips with trembling fingers. \u201c\u2019Tis not right,\u201d Maris whispered in a shaken voice.</p> <p>He wrapped his fingers around her hand, pressing his lips to its sensitive wrist. His mouth closed over the thick pad of her palm, biting gently, sliding full lips over the inside of her hand. His tongue slipped out to thrust slick and wet between two fingers, and Maris closed her eyes, sagging against him as the sharp stab of pleasure arrowed into the pit of her belly and lower.</p><p>His fingers closed over her shoulders. \u201cI want you,\u201d his words were forced, harsh, as if wrung from his very depths. \u201cI have no claim to you, but God above, I want you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, forcing herself to ease away despite the need trammeling through her body. \u201cNay. I cannot give what belongs to the king.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened to black and his face settled, livid with shock. \u201cHenry?\u201d</p><p>Maris realized his mistake. \u201cNay, Dirick, you mistook my meaning,\u201d she pulled firmly from him, aware that her breathing was too rapid, too shallow, and that her entire being suddenly felt bereft and empty. \u201cI am the king\u2019s ward, to do with what he will. And I must pledge all to him on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>The fury drained from his face. \u201cAye.\u201d His eyes still glittered with desire as his gaze swept over her. \u201cMaris,\u201d he said, low and deep.</p><p>She had to turn away, else she would drag him to the pillow-strewn bed. \u201c\u2019Tis my fate to be used as a pawn, dangled as a prize, no doubt, for some well landed baron close to the king,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cAnd of all men in this kingdom, it could not be you, as you\u2019ve naught to bring to the great lands of Langumont.\u201d</p><p>Dirick stepped back as if slapped. \u201cAye, \u2019tis true, I\u2019ve naught to bring to your great lands,\u201d he said caustically. \u201cAnd I doubt you\u2019d lower your great self to be given to one as mean as I, even if you did not answer to the king.\u201d</p> <p>He stalked to the door, pausing to give a mocking bow before he opened it. \u201cGood night, my Lady Maris. And thank you for your services.\u201d With a sharp gesture to his bandage, he turned and walked through the door.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>Maris knelt in front of King Henry, holding an old, dried bit of bone that the bishop claimed to be a finger of Saint Peter. The king closed his hands over hers, drawing them under his mantle, as he looked down at her with steely blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI become thy woman of such tenement to be holden of thee.\u201d Maris spoke clearly so as to be heard above all the rustling of the crowded abbey. \u201cTo bear thee and thine heirs faith of life, and member, and earthly worship against all men who can live and die on this earth, in the name of God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\u201d She bent her head to kiss his hands.</p><p>\u201cWe renew upon thee thy vassalage to the lands of Langumont, Cleonis, Firmain, and all such properties encompassed by the baronage of Langumont.\u201d Henry pulled her to her feet, pressing a dry kiss to her cheek.</p><p>Maris gave a short curtsey, then moved aside and off the dais, turning to watch as the Lord of Southampton took her place opposite the king. The bishop took Saint Peter\u2019s finger bone from her with reverence, and she shifted so that she could see the crowd filling the abbey.</p><p>Her gaze wandered the many faces, looking for whom or what she did not know, and rested at last upon two silver beaconed heads near the front of the chamber. The Lords Victor and Michael d\u2019Arcy looked back at her with twin pairs of shimmering eyes, purposeful and glinting with anger.</p><p>Suppressing a shudder, she turned her attention away. Clenching her fingers so hard that her ragged nails bit into her palms, Maris closed her eyes for a moment. She feared those two men as she\u2019d never feared before...but she could not understand why they should strike such loathing in her heart. Lord Victor was her intended betrothed, but surely he was not an evil man.</p><p>Then the memory of his brutal lips and grasping hands returned, and she felt nauseated. If he wasn\u2019t truly evil, at the least he was greatly reprehensible. She renewed her private vow that if she were unfortunate enough to be bound to him, if he raised a hand to her or otherwise used force, he\u2019d not live past their first moon of wedded bliss.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, Maris\u2019s gaze fell upon a tall, dark haired man no more than a few rows from the dais. Dirick\u2019s handsome, unshaven face as appeared to be carved of stone, and his stare was trained upon her. Abruptly, he turned away, bowing his head slightly.</p><p>A tremor of heat rushed up her spine even as her lips pursed in anger. Aye, the man could melt her with his kisses and the strength of his large, powerful hands\u2014</p><p>\u201cMaris of Langumont.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her name ringing out jerked Maris\u2019s attention back to the altar, where the king stood, looking expectantly at her. The bishop gave her a none too gentle push and she caught her balance before she stumbled onto the dais.</p><p>What was this? She had already pledged her fealty. What was happening now? Gathering up her skirts, she took two steps onto the altar.</p><p>\u201cMonique of Trysdon.\u201d The king\u2019s secretary solemnly intoned another name. \u201cBertilde of Hyannes.\u201d</p><p>Bewildered, but taking great care to keep her face devoid of emotion, Maris stood near the king, joined by Lady Monique and Lady Bertilde. She clasped her hands over her abdomen, tangling her fingers in the heavy silver and gold girdle that wrapped about her waist.</p><p>There was silence after the three women were assembled, and then the king spoke. \u201cIt pleases us to decree the betrothals of three of our wards on this day, to such lords of the realm who have since pledged their loyalty\u2014and who have maintained it in instances of great adversity.\u201d</p><p>Maris\u2019s heart plunged to her stomach and she felt light headed. Betrothal! She\u2019d not expected this, had had no time to prepare herself for this eventuality. She\u2019d been certain that the king would simply collect the tithes from her lands as his ward for many years before giving her to one of his barons. Unless...her heart tripped and she flashed a glance at Michael and Victor. Had they pressed their suit to the king and did he now intend to honor the betrothal her father had made?</p><p>She dared not look at Dirick, dared not let him see what was surely in her eyes. He must not know how she felt. Instead, she returned her attention to the king, who\u2019d just announced the name of Lady Bertilde\u2019s betrothed\u2014one of the powerful barons whose holdings fell upon the Welsh border.</p><p>\u201cLady Monique of Trysdon.\u201d</p><p>The lady in question stepped forward, and Maris saw her gaze flicker to Dirick. Her stomach plummeted and she tightened her fists, digging her nails into the palms of her hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nay, not to him. Her silent plea to God was instinctive, if not selfish, and Maris took a small step backward in her confusion, jostling the priest.</p><p>\u201cLady Monique of Trysdon is hereby promised to Lord Bartholemew d\u2019Ausignan.\u201d</p><p>A wave of relief swept over Maris, but was instantly usurped by a light headed faintness when her name was called. She steeled her features to show no emotion as she stepped toward the king, her gaze brushing over Queen Eleanor, who sat with a satisfied smile behind him. Maris gave a little curtsey, then straightened, swallowing the lump in her throat as she awaited her fate.</p> <p>\u201cLady Maris of Langumont is hereby promised to the Baron of Ludingdon and Fairhold.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause as the audience digested the announcement, and then, as exclamations of confusion and surprise erupted, a loud voice shouted, \u201cThe lady is already promised!\u201d</p><p>Voices quieted as Michael d\u2019Arcy pushed his way through the crowd, followed closely by his son. \u201cThe lady is promised!\u201d his voice rang loudly into the sudden stillness.</p><p>Maris\u2019s heart thudded in her chest and her limbs prickled with tension. Though she had no knowledge of the Baron of Ludingdon, verily he was a more desirable groom than the one who now stood at the base of the dais in his father\u2019s shadow. She prayed that was so.</p><p>Henry looked down at the d\u2019Arcys, raising his brows. \u201cWhat say you, man? The lady is promised?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour majesty, the lady\u2019s father, Merle of Langumont, entered into a betrothal contract between his daughter and my son, Lord Victor d\u2019Arcy.\u201d</p><p>The king stroked his beard. \u201cAnd can you produce the contracts to verify your claim?\u201d</p><p>From his place in the crowd, Dirick could see a glitter of humor in the king\u2019s grey eyes. Through his numbness, he wondered what game Henry played, even as he was desperate to learn who this Baron of Ludingdon was.</p><p>Who was to have Maris?</p><p>Who was the man?</p><p>Michael d\u2019Arcy was speaking. \u201cThe contracts were drawn up but the lady was spirited away before they could be finalized. Lord Merle was slain during her rescue. But there are many witnesses to the lord\u2019s intent, for \u2018twas announced to the people of Langumont.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd \u2019tis your claim that the contract should be honored though it was not signed?\u201d Henry glared down at the man before him.</p><p>Maris had been still throughout the exchange, and now Dirick saw her move as if to speak. Henry must have sensed the same, and he turned to her. \u201cLady Maris, what have you to say of this? Do you wish to pursue his claim of betrothal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grace, I did not see the betrothal contracts of which Lord d\u2019Arcy speaks,\u201d her voice was steady, \u201cbut \u2019tis true that my father announced such an intention.\u201d A grin of satisfaction creased Michael\u2019s face, broadening with her next words. \u201cBut, my lord, \u2019tis my intent to abide by my father\u2019s last wishes before his untimely demise.\u201d</p><p>Coldness swept over Dirick. She\u2019d honor the betrothal! The bitter tang of disappointment touched his tongue, and he swallowed back a retort of frustration. He almost missed the small smile touching her lips as she bent her head demurely. What game was she playing now?</p><p>The king shot Maris a glance, giving a slight nod and a matching smile. Sensing some undercurrent between the two, Dirick renewed his attention as Henry spoke. \u201cAh, aye, my lady. We, too, intend to honor the final wishes of our faithful vassal.\u201d</p><p>Michael started to speak, confident that he\u2019d won the battle. The king cut him off, producing a curling parchment sheet. \u201cWe have a missive writ in the hand of Lord Merle of Langumont, to ourselves, on the thirteenth day of this January. This letter, scribed as he prepared to besiege the castle where Lady Maris was held, repudiates the intended betrothal contract between his daughter, Maris, and Lord Victor d\u2019Arcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d shrieked Michael d\u2019Arcy in surprise, echoing his son\u2019s shocked exclamation.</p><p>Henry looked down his nose at the furious man. \u201cWe assure you, \u2019tis true,\u201d he said regally. \u201cThe contracts were not signed, and the lord recants his decision to betrothe Lady Maris to Lord Victor.\u201d</p> <p>The bishop nodded in agreement and Michael and Victor had no choice but to retreat.</p><p>Henry raised his gaze from the angry men, casting it about the chamber. The rising noise subsided when he lifted his hand. \u201cLady Maris of Langumont is hereby promised to the Baron of Ludingdon and Fairhold,\u201d he repeated his earlier decree. \u201cThat is a title has been undesignated since the baron\u2019s death without issue for some moons. This day, Dirick of Derkland shall swear fealty to us in that name of Baron of Ludingdon and Fairhold.\u201d</p><p>Dirick felt a rush of blood to his face as shock numbed his body. His head snapped up to meet the king\u2019s gaze and the twinkle of mischief in those pale blue eyes, and, dazed with his sudden good fortune, Dirick moved toward the dais. A barony! He\u2019d been awarded a barony!</p><p>And Maris.</p><p>Stepping eagerly onto the altar, he could not keep back a grin. \u201cYour majesty, you honor me beyond my belief! \u2019Tis my greatest pleasure to pledge my loyalty to you and your heirs.\u201d Though intent upon the king\u2019s presence, Dirick could not keep from flashing a glance at Maris. His look at her was brief, but her pale, wide eyed face, stony with shock, impaled its impression on his mind. She looked as though her death knell had been rung.</p><p>He could attend to that anon, but for now, he returned his attention to Henry. Kneeling on one knee before his sovereign, Dirick took the bone of St. Peter into his hands and swore his vassalage to the king with strong, steady words.</p><p>When he rose from his knees, Dirick found himself facing Maris. Her gaze was so cold and blank that he nearly shivered. Of necessity, he kept his face devoid of emotion as the bishop stepped between them to administer the betrothal vows.</p><p>Maris\u2019s small, cold, scratched hand was placed in Dirick\u2019s larger one, her skin pale next to the brown roughness of his fingers. He repeated the vows with a clear, strong voice as he studied her inclined head. As he spoke, a rush of energy shot through him. She was to be his.</p><p>\u201cAnd to thee I plight my troth,\u201d Maris\u2019s voice uttering the words that would make her his brought his attention back to the present. She withdrew her fingers from him as soon as she finished reciting her promise.</p><p>They stood side-by-side, arms brushing sleeve to sleeve, as the other couples cited their betrothal vows. Dirick felt Maris\u2019s unyielding stiffness next to him and he was overwhelmed with the sudden yearning to gather her into his arms and kiss her into a malleable handful of woman. He\u2019d coax away any reservations she might have.</p><p>Henry announced that the wedding ceremonies would take place on Sunday next\u2014four days hence\u2014and that the betrothal contracts would be prepared within two days. With that, he dismissed the crowd.</p><p>\u201cFelicitations, Lord Dirick,\u201d purred a voice behind him.</p><p>He turned to find the queen with a complacent smile on her face. \u201cYour majesty,\u201d he kissed her hand, suddenly realizing his debt to her.</p><p>\u201cLook you here,\u201d she spoke, resting a possessive hand on his forearm, \u201cin the space of one morn, you are entitled, enfeofed, and engaged to be married to a well landed heiress!\u201d Her eyes danced with pleasure and mischief.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, I have never met a more fortunate man\u2014with the great exception of your husband,\u201d he said with all sincerity.</p><p>The teasing left her eyes to be replaced by earnestness. \u201cAs you have served us well, \u2019tis well deserved. I wish happiness for you and your lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you with all of my heart.\u201d He kissed her hand again, and turned to confront Maris. She was gone. He whirled back to an amused Eleanor.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your wife so soon?\u201d the queen teased, tucking her hand into the crook of her husband\u2019s elbow. \u201cShe\u2019ll be quite the challenge for you, Lord Dirick, I trow.\u201d</p><p>Henry chuckled in his booming way. \u201cAye, my love, I should say Dirick may have to raise his hand to her rump more than once in their life anon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour majesties,\u201d Dirick bowed, his mouth tightening. \u201cI beg excuse to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Dirick, go you in search of her. I wish you the best of luck in taming that lady!\u201d</p><p>Maris had made her escape from the abbey as soon as Dirick turned to greet the queen. Raymond of Vermille met her as she slipped from the crowded chamber, dogging her footsteps as she hurried down a narrow hall back to the castle.</p><p>Betrothed! Betrothed to Dirick, Lord of Ludingdon!</p><p>Her heart had been choking her since the announcement.</p><p>How had he done it? How had he convinced the king to award him not only a title, but her hand as well? Her mind spun with the incredulity of it, with excitement and titillation. She\u2019d been unable, unwilling to react during the announcement for fear she\u2019d misunderstood. Or that it was all a jest.</p><p>How had he done it? Only last evening had he been so below her reach.</p><p>Suddenly she became aware that Raymond had followed her from the chamber, and she slowed her frenzied pace. They paused, ducking into an alcove not far from her chamber in the keep.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d said her faithful knight with a question in his voice.</p><p>\u201cRaymond,\u201d she said, leaning back against the stone wall. The hall was lit by the sun, which shone brightly through the arrow slits above her. She sighed wearily, passing a hand over her face. \u201cI am to be married in four days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lady, and not to Victor d\u2019Arcy. Praise God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d She breathed more calmly now. \u201cThere is that.\u201d</p><p>He waited silently, as if knowing she must gather her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDear God, Raymond, what am I to do?\u201d Her voice sounded piteous even to her own ears. How could she face Dirick now? The man who was to be her husband?</p><p>Raymond rested a light hand on her arm. \u201cLady, lady...I\u2019ll not let any harm come to you!\u201d He hesitated, and his voice dropped as he edged closer. \u201cDo you wish that I rid you of your betrothed as I promised once before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Do you plot against me already?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maris jerked her attention to the spot behind Raymond where Dirick had appeared. Though his words were light and filled with humor, darkness flashed in his eyes and she knew to beware of his anger. Raymond\u2019s face paled and he stepped in front of Maris as if to protect her, hand dropping to the dagger that rode at his waist.</p><p>\u201cDo not be a fool, man,\u201d Dirick said when he saw Raymond\u2019s stance. \u201cI am in the right, and I intend no harm to the lady anyway.\u201d He looked at Maris as if to quell any argument on her part, then ordered the other man, \u201cLeave us.\u201d</p><p>Before Raymond could speak, she nodded, knowing that Dirick would have his way. \u201cYou may go,\u201d she agreed. With a quick look to assure her that he would be nearby if she was in need of him, Raymond left their presence.</p> <p>\u201cCome,\u201d Dirick took her hand, placing it firmly on his arm. She let it rest there, resisting the urge to close her fingers over the pronounced muscles and feel his warm strength.</p><p>They proceeded down the hallway and directly to an opening that led to a courtyard. He did not speak, but walked her out into the spring sunshine, leading her to a single bench at one end. Proffering her a seat, Dirick waited until she sank down before sitting next to her.</p><p>Maris busied herself by arranging her gown, grateful for an excuse to remove her hand from his arm. He\u2019d sat upon the edge of her skirt, and when she looked up at him to ask him to move, she froze at the cold anger in his eyes. Suddenly, she knew why he\u2019d brought her outside: so that they would be alone and no one could overhear.</p><p>\u201cNo sooner is our betrothal announced than you are plotting to rid yourself of me.\u201d He leaned close to her face, close enough that she felt the warmth of his breath on her cheek. Dirick tipped up her chin, forcing her to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll not be rid of me that easily. You haven\u2019t a chance in the world, Maris.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back, disturbed by the fluttering in her stomach. \u201cDirick\u2014\u201d</p> <p>But he cut her off. \u201cI\u2019ve just been given everything I want in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d she whispered, wondering, hoping, that perhaps she had been part of what he wanted in the world...she, not her lands. But the hope was futile, as his next words proved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been given a title, and my own lands\u2014and Langumont will bring even more leverage to the Barony of Ludingdon. \u2019Tis more than I\u2019d ever thought possible.\u201d If Maris hadn\u2019t been so hurt by his words\u2014for there was no mention of her, only her lands\u2014she would have been warmed by the pride and happiness that lit his silvery-blue eyes. \u201cIf you are so repulsed by the notion of wedding with me, so be it\u2014but do you not squander my own life for your whim.\u201d The warmth in his eyes evaporated, replaced by the flashing anger that had been there before.</p><p>She rose, looking down at him. \u201cIt was only the concern of my loyal man that you heard, as I\u2019d made it clear to him in the past that I\u2019d not suffer Victor d\u2019Arcy in my bed. He merely wished to assure me of his protection regardless.\u201d</p><p>Dirick\u2019s face took on a serious cast. \u201cAye, lady, \u2019tis certain d\u2019Arcy is miffed by the dissolution of your betrothal to him. Have a care to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Mayhap he did care for her. Nay, \u2019twas more likely he feared aught would happen to her before their wedding gained him her lands. Maris\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cVictor would gain naught by harming me\u2014\u2019tis you who should watch your back.\u201d A cool smile flitted across her mouth. \u201cIn less than the space of one day, you\u2019ve made two enemies on my behalf.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled to his feet, tall and powerful in his great height. \u201cMy dearest Maris, I have many, many enemies, and two more, especially for your sake, mean naught to me.\u201d His gaze caught hers, holding it steadily, then falling downcast as he took one of her hands. He raised it to his mouth, brushing full, warm lips over the sensitive skin of the back of her hand. She shivered and tried to pull it free, but he held her firmly, turning it palm side up and pressing a gentle kiss to the cup of her hand. Little prickles of awareness shivered up her arm.</p><p>\u201cDirick,\u201d she breathed through a heavy, tight chest.</p><p>\u201cI require a kiss to seal our betrothal,\u201d he told her, gathering her to his chest. \u201cIt is my right.\u201d He was warm and solid, his arms a strong band holding her to him. Dirick looked down at her, not to seek her acquiescence, but for her to see the determination in his gaze before his mouth descended.</p><p>When their lips met, it was with a clash of heat and tenderness, a rush of pleasure. A new strength, a possessiveness, colored his kiss as bold confidence exuded from his person...and yet there was an easiness about it all. As if he had every bit of time he needed to explore, to taste, to coax and tease\u2014as if he would do it so thoroughly that she would be left fully plundered.</p><p>And Maris, for her part, could hardly recall that she must breathe at some point. The world fell away and there was only Dirick, only his strength about her, only his clean, sharp scent the heat of his body burning into hers.</p><p>His hands slipped from her back down over her rump, pulling her up against the ridge of his arousal. He sighed, dipped his head to gently bite her neck, and released her. They looked at each other for a moment, assessing the other, gathering their wits, realizing that in four days they would be wed.</p><p>\u201cI shall tell you this only once, my lady,\u201d he said at last in a voice rough with desire. \u201cThough you may find marriage to me repulsive, you will suffer me in your bed...at the least until you have presented me with an heir.\u201d</p><p>He stepped away, his chest still moving with quickened breaths. \u201cCall upon your faithful knight to see you to your chamber. But I shall escort you to dinner this eve.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY ONE</p><p>The next morning, Maris broke her fast alone in her chamber. She had no desire to rest her attention upon her betrothed husband any sooner than her wedding day demanded. She\u2019d been so stunned by his kisses, and then broad sided by his steely command that she bear him an heir, that she\u2019d been able to do naught but gape after him as he left her standing in the courtyard.</p><p>Dirick had not escorted her to dinner as he\u2019d promised, for the king had called his council of barons together to discuss the problems with his brother in Anjou. As a newly confirmed lord who also had the ear of the king, Dirick was expected to participate in this activity, and, Maris thought, \u2019twas no hardship to her. Verily, she hoped he\u2019d spend the rest of his time in the company of his liege lord.</p><p>He\u2019d left her confused, uncertain, and trembling with something that she didn\u2019t understand. And until she could determine how she must act around him\u2014cool and remote, giddy and complimentary, or some other way\u2014she was happy not to be in his presence.</p><p>According to Dirick\u2019s pronouncement that she would join him in his bed, there would be time enough for that anon.</p><p>Agnes assisted her to dress in a traveling gown for a trip into London Town. Despite her annoyance with Dirick for his blunt, offensive orders to her the day before, Maris knew that she would be wed three days hence, and the womanly part of her desired to dress the part. And she must find a wedding gift for her husband.</p><p>Raymond and five other men-at-arms waited without her chamber, following as she and Agnes started down the hall.</p><p>Their horses were ready for them at the great royal stables. Maris offered Hickory a scrubbed carrot in apology for not visiting the day before, then, using a tree stump reserved for that purpose, hoisted herself lightly into the saddle.</p><p>As they approached the market area of London Town, the six men-at-arms stayed close around the two women. Once they reached the stalls where the cloth makers were, Maris and Agnes dismounted from their horses and, leaving their mounts with two of their burly guardians, began to weave their way through the crowds of people.</p><p>Raymond and the rest of the men cleared a path for the women, stepping out of the way when they reached a vendor that interested Maris.</p><p>She spent a better part of the morning searching for cloth to make her wedding gown, fingering silks and wools and linens from France, Italy, even the Holy Lands. At last, she discovered a merchant with brilliantly colored, tightly woven fabrics of such quality that she\u2019d not seen. Each bolt cost more than one peasant family subsisted upon in one year at Langumont, and Maris nearly went on to a different stall.</p><p>But the merchant knew his trade, and when he saw the interest in her eyes and noticed the fineness of her clothing, he pulled a special cloth from the bottom of a trunk. Maris\u2019s eyes widened when she saw it, and her mouth opened in a soft gasp. She\u2019d never seen anything as beautiful as the shimmering pale gold cloth. Nearly sheer, and shot through with shiny gold threads in a spider web pattern, the fabric slithered over her fingers like a mere whisper. It would make a stunning under gown. Maris fingered it thoughtfully for a moment, then acquiesced to its beauty and commenced with haggling over the cost of the bolt.</p><p>Her undisguised interest was her undoing, and, though she was normally skilled in the technique of bargaining, the merchant was able to wring rather more gold from her than she should have paid. Maris purchased a second bolt of darker gold silk for her overgown at a much lesser cost, and a light, cinnamon colored wool for a cloak from the same merchant.</p><p>The party moved along from the cloth vendors, pausing to buy meat pies and cheese for a mid day meal. The libation offered by a local alewife was strong and pleasingly bitter, sending a tingle of happiness into Maris\u2019s belly. They found sweet pastries at yet another stall and stood enjoying them at the side of the busy street.</p><p>Now came the difficult part: a wedding gift for her betrothed.</p><p>The men-at-arms wandered along the streets in Maris\u2019s wake as she perused stall after stall, vendor after vendor, and was able to find nothing she deemed suitable for Dirick.</p><p>At last they came to the market section that housed the jewelers and the goldsmiths. Wandering up and down the narrow aisles between stalls, Maris felt a growing sense of frustration as nothing seemed appropriate for her soon-to-be husband. And why this task of finding a gift should plague her, she didn\u2019t know...but it did.</p><p>Finally, she paused at a goldsmith that specialized in fashioning brooches and pins for the cloaks and mantles worn by men and women alike. The thought came to her of a sudden. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow quickly could you create a pin with my lord\u2019s standard upon it?\u201d she asked the smith.</p><p>The man frowned and ventured, \u201cIn six days, mayhap, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHalf again as much if you can deliver it to me by Sunday morn.\u201d</p> <p>Obviously unwilling to the let opportunity pass him by, the smith considered briefly, then agreed. Maris dug out her leather pouch to give him an initial payment. When she pulled two silver coins from its depths, her dagger tumbled out onto the ground.</p><p>The smith stooped to retrieve it for her and made a little sound of delight. \u201cAh! Such a lovely piece. I\u2019ve not seen this work for many a year, my lady!\u201d</p><p>Instantly, her attention left the coins and focused on him. \u201cYou know of this work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. \u2019Tis the skill of Frederick of Gladwythe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere might one find this Frederick?\u201d she asked, knowing that Dirick would demand the same information if he were present.</p> <p>The smith shrugged. \u201cMy lady, I\u2019ve not seen the man for five or six summers. He may be dead for all I know, as I\u2019ve not seen any of his work for that long. He was not a young man.\u201d</p><p>Maris dug an extra coin from her purse. \u201cIf you recall anything more about him, or where he might be found, do you send word to me, Maris of Langumont, or my betrothed husband, Dirick of Ludingdon. \u2019Tis a matter of life and death.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the third coin with alacrity. \u201cAye, my lady. That I will do. And I will see that your husband\u2019s pin is delivered to you by Sunday matins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you, good sir.\u201d She bid him a good day and returned to Raymond and her other companions with a new bounce in her step. On their wedding day, she would have two presents for her husband.</p><p>Because the streets were so crowded, the party did not mount their horses. They were ambling along, the urgency of the trip now gone, when a loud noise behind them drew their attention.</p><p>A heavy cart was speeding down the narrow street in their direction, bouncing pell mell behind two heavy horses. Screams and shouts rang through the air, and passersby jumped out of the way.</p> <p>The cart narrowly missed the stall where Maris\u2019s goldsmith was and trundled along without pause. As the crowd surged and ebbed, frantic to escape the runaway cart, Maris became separated from her party.</p><p>\u201cLady!\u201d Raymond shouted when he saw the horses running straight at her.</p><p>She tried to duck out of the way, but the cart changed direction, following her as she dodged off the street. It rumbled along in her wake, tearing stalls from their moorings and knocking displays from their tables, gaining proximity as she stumbled down an alley.</p><p>Her lungs hurt and her leg ached where she tripped against the side of a stall, but Maris did not stop. The cart came closer, the noise barreling behind her like the rush of a huge wave, and she knew she would not come out of this alive.</p><p>Suddenly, as the alley opened onto a wide street, she spied the stone enclosure of a public well. Heading for it, she said a quick prayer. Maris grabbed the heavy wooden framework that supported a large bucket and jumped up and out of the way of the cart.</p><p>The cart stormed by, leaving dust in its wake, then disappeared down a side street.</p><p>Raymond ran up, his face tight with fear, exclaiming, \u201cLady, lady, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Shaken, Maris clambered down from her perch on the side of the well. Though she knew her eyes were huge, belaying her fright, she spoke calmly, \u201cAye, I am unhurt but for my leg.\u201d She looked down at her torn, dirty gown, and knew that her hair, which had come unveiled during the chase, hung in sagging braids and straggles down her back. Discreetly, she lifted her skirt to examine her bloody, bruised leg.</p> <p>Rufus, one of the other men-at-arms, brought Hickory to her and assisted Maris into the saddle. Her leg pained her and her head felt light, but she was determined to ride back to Westminster on her own accord.</p><p>They were nearly to the castle when they were met by a small company of men carrying the standard of Dirick of Ludingdon. Dirick himself rode at the forefront, and drew up his reins at the approach of the men from Langumont and its mistress.</p><p>\u201cHo!\u201d he called, separating from his men to ride up to Maris\u2019s side. His eyes widened at her disheveled appearance. \u201cMaris! What has befallen you?\u201d</p><p>She brushed a grimy hand over her face. \u201cNaught but a near miss by a cart. \u2019Twas a runaway that got loose in the marketplace and I fell while trying to evade it.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cYou did not tell me you were going to London. I would have been your escort had I known.\u201d</p><p>Maris bristled even as she felt Raymond stiffen beside her. \u201cMy men are more than an adequate escort for me, my lord, and I will visit the market when I will, with or without your permission.\u201d</p><p>Dirick\u2019s face became empty of emotion. He reached over and took the reins from her hands, then led Hickory and her mistress away from the group of men. It wasn\u2019t until he looked down at her that she realized she\u2019d never seen him that cold and angry.</p><p>\u201cI did not demand that you ask my permission to visit the market, Maris,\u201d he said in a carefully emotionless voice. \u201cHowever, you will never again speak to me in that manner in the presence of my men or your men. I was concerned only for your safety, as you are still unwed and a desirable match for any man\u2014and from the look of your clothing, I can see that I was right to think so.\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned and rejoined the party of men-at-arms, leaving Maris to follow him.</p><p>\u201cSir Raymond,\u201d Dirick said, trying to force his anger to subside, \u201cride with me if you please. The rest of you, see that my lady returns to Westminster without acquiring anymore dirt on her face.\u201d</p><p>Raymond approached him with a set look on his freckled countenance. Dirick shielded his hand against the beaming sun so that he could look him full in the eye. \u201cDo you not look at me with such fury, man. I did meant no insult to you\u2014\u2019tis only that I wish to be told of my wife\u2019s whereabouts in the future.\u201d He raised his hand to stop the other man from speaking. \u201cNay, \u2019tis not your task to inform me. \u2019Tis a courtesy I request of my wife. Verily, Raymond, I can think of no other man that I\u2019d want to escort my lady, with the exception of myself, than you. Truly.\u201d</p><p>The other man seemed to accept his apology. \u201cMy lord, I thank you for your trust in me. I\u2019ve served Langumont for greater than a score winters, and I will continue to serve my lady Maris until such time as she does not wish me around.\u201d</p><p>Dirick nodded, recognizing that the man, while not combative, was also clearly delineating his loyalty\u2014to Maris over that of Dirick. Such impertinence could have annoyed him further, but Dirick knew better. The safety of Maris was of paramount importance to both of them, and therefore, their intentions would be thus be aligned. \u201cVerily, Raymond, and as you serve her, you serve me as well. And I must tell you that I am not so greatly pleased that you should take your service so seriously that you would rid her of an unwanted husband\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Dirick,\u201d the other man interrupted, a shameful look shadowing his face, \u201cI meant naught\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, do you not apologize. You meant only to protect your lady as any man should, particularly from the likes of Victor d\u2019Arcy. However, as I am now her betrothed, I would take it as a personal affront should you attempt to rid her of my presence.\u201d He allowed a bit of humor to light his eyes, even as he kept his voice commanding.</p><p>Raymond smiled with obvious relief. \u201cThank you, my lord, and you can be certain I shall take your words to heart as I know full well you can beat me at swordplay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without much effort and a little luck,\u201d he told him, remembering their mock battle at Langumont. \u201cNow, tell me what passed this day in the market.\u201d</p><p>Raymond sobered. \u201c\u2019Twas not a runaway, my lord, I should stake my honor on it.\u201d</p><p>Dirick drew up in his saddle. \u201cWhat say you, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was no accident, my lord. The cart did not slow, and the horses did not act as though they were crazed...it seemed as though the driver urged them on. And,\u201d he looked behind as if to see how far back was Maris, \u201cit followed her when she ran down an alleyway.\u201d He described how she had escaped from the cart.</p><p>Dirick swore, cold fear rushing over him. Someone had tried to kill Maris. She had nearly died. The blood drained from his head, rushing to throb at the ends of his limbs. \u201cYou did not see the driver to recognize him?\u201d</p><p>Raymond shook his head. \u201cNay, my lord, he wore a helm pulled low and a mantle about his face. There were no markings on his clothing or on the cart.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Dirick looked up at the sky and offered a prayer of thanksgiving. Then he looked at Raymond. \u201cI will investigate, and I would welcome any assistance you might give me. In the mean while, do you double your guard about her, especially when I am not near, and let us not tell her of our suspicions as yet. She will only argue or disregard them.\u201d</p><p>With a grim smile, Raymond nodded.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY TWO</p><p>Two days.</p><p>Maris had two days until she was to wed Dirick of Ludingdon.</p><p>The thought had driven her from the chamber, where she badgered the seamstresses who worked diligently on her gown, into the courtyard near the queen\u2019s apartments. She was alone with her thoughts and sank onto a stone bench in the corner of the square garden.</p><p>An oak tree spread shady limbs over her perch, and a small forsythia bush burst with sprays of yellow flowers. Maris idly watched as a bee nipped into a blossom, then out, skipping over the expanse of the tree, buzzing happily all the while.</p><p>Dirick had not been far from her mind in the last days, though she\u2019d only seen him briefly when they met upon the road from London. She\u2019d angered and embarrassed him in front of his men and her men, yet he\u2019d done naught but give her a brief, pointed warning.</p><p>She sighed and broke a twig from the forsythia. Fingering the soft, tender blossoms, she closed her eyes. In two days\u2019 time, she\u2019d belong to him...and though she\u2019d fought the idea of marriage long enough, somehow she\u2019d come to accept\u2014nay, she must be truthful if only to herself\u2014come to welcome that she would be Dirick\u2019s wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A pleasant shiver spiraled down to her belly, fluttering and heating her insides. Her mouth became dry at the thought of his lips, his hands and that great, muscular body against hers, touching her, joining with her. The heat she\u2019d come to associate with Dirick pooled in her middle, surging to her womanly place, causing her breasts to tingle, and she drew a deep breath.</p><p>She suddenly became aware that she was not alone.</p><p>Her eyes flew open and she saw a page standing there, just off to the side, as if waiting for her to acknowledge him. He held a silver goblet encrusted with rubies and sapphires, and when her attention rested upon him, he gave a short bow, proffering the cup.</p> <p>\u201cMy lady Maris, I am sent by your husband with this gift to quench your thirst.\u201d</p><p>Her face heated at the possibility that Dirick was nearby and had seen her mooning over him. When she looked about, however, she saw that no one else was in the vicinity, and she returned her gaze to the page. \u201cIs he not to join me?\u201d She tried to submerge the pang of disappointment.</p><p>The page shook his head. \u201cNay, lady. The lord said only that \u2019tis a gift to you, his bride, and that he looks to the day you shall become one.\u201d</p><p>Maris took the goblet, admiring its weight. \u201cThank you, and you may thank my lord for his thoughtfulness as well.\u201d</p><p>The page bowed, turned, and walked sedately from the courtyard, leaving Maris alone with the bees.</p> <p>Ruby wine glistened in its silver cup, and she took a sip before resting it on the bench beside her. Mayhap Dirick, too, was willing to put their differences behind them as their wedding day drew near. It would be more than she could hope that he would welcome their marriage for more than the riches and lands she would bring him.</p><p>Another sigh escaped her lips. She could not deny it any longer: she loved him.</p><p>Though he caused her ire to rise at their every meeting, he was never far from her thoughts...and the memory of his touch lived in her dreams.</p><p>The soft rustle of someone\u2019s approach brought Maris\u2019s attention from the goblet beside her. Without looking up, she knew it was Dirick.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d He greeted her solemnly, almost warily.</p><p>She raised her face to him and was immediately ensnared in his piercing grey-blue gaze. \u201cMy lord. I did not think you would join me.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at her, tilting his head to one side as if surprised as her reaction. \u201cThe ladies told me you\u2019d come for some air. I thought to sit with you for a time, as I\u2019ve been otherwise occupied with the king for the last days.\u201d</p><p>Her heart leapt. He had sent her a gift, and then he\u2019d sought her out. \u201cPlease have a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur betrothal contracts have been finished,\u201d he began, sinking onto the bench next to her.</p><p>A sense of disappointment settled in her middle. He\u2019d not come to be with her for any other reason than to talk of their contract, and of the lands she would bring him. \u201cVerily they meet your approval,\u201d she replied coolly, refusing to look at him or his gift, \u201cand that of the king.\u201d</p><p>She felt him nod next to her. \u201cAye. They are more than fair, and follow the wishes of your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the missive he sent to the king, he repudiated your betrothal with Victor. He also named you as his heir, though you are not of his blood, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Maris turned to him, shock numbing her. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did not know?\u201d Dirick\u2019s face showed his concern.</p><p>\u201cThat I am not of my father\u2019s blood? Nay! Nay, I did not!\u201d She felt lightheaded, lost, paralyzed. \u201cHow can that be?\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand, and the warmth of his fingers over her suddenly icy ones was welcome. \u201cI am sorry that this is a surprise. Your father stated that he married your mother though he knew she was with child, but because he was unable to father a child, he chose to accept her babe as his heir. \u2019Twas the agreement he made with King Stephen.\u201d The breeze ruffled his hair, tossing a wave onto his forehead as he gazed at her.</p><p>\u201cWho is my father?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hand. \u201cI do not know that, my lady. He did not say in the missive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJes\u00f9,\u201d she breathed. \u201cAnd that is why he and my mother never had another child.\u201d Tears dampened her eyes and an empty, bereft feeling settled with her heart. \u201cHe was my father, though I am not of his loins. I do not care that another man sired me.\u201d</p><p>Dirick nodded. \u201cMerle was a fine man and had I not my own father whom to admire, I\u2019d be proud to be of his blood.\u201d He pressed her index finger to his lips. \u201cThe contracts are ready to be signed.\u201d He hesitated, then said, \u201cI will have them brought to you, should you wish, before I place my seal upon them. If there is aught that you do not like, I will try to change it to your liking.\u201d</p><p>Maris could only stare at him. He asked for her agreement before he signed the contracts? What man would do that? \u201cMy lord, I do not know what to say.\u201d Indeed, her tongue stuck in her throat, her mind both shocked and delighted at the realization that he should care for her opinion. \u201cI\u2014I...I thank you, Dirick, for your consideration. If you believe they are fair, and if they allow me to retain mine own lands should you pre decease me, I shall not contest them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry showed me the missive from your father, and his wishes were just that. Your dowry is generous and shall also be returned to you should I die, and even if we produce an heir, those lands shall revert to you upon my death. Our heir should accede to Ludingdon and Fairhill, unless \u2019tis a girl, and then, if you wish, she shall have Langumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis more than fair.\u201d She could barely form the words as she suddenly had an image of the babe they would produce. Her throat was dry, and she reached for the wine. \u201cThank you, my lord, for this beautiful gift,\u201d she raised the cup to him, then to her mouth to drink.</p><p>The goblet never made it to her lips, as a sudden force sent it spinning to the ground. Maris shrank back from him in surprise as much from his action as the fierce look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI did not give you such a gift.\u201d His grey eyes had darkened ominously, turning into steel in his ferocity. \u201cHow did you come by that thought?\u201d</p><p>She could not speak for a moment, so unexpected was his reaction. Then, sanity reigned, and she replied, \u201cBut only moments before you came to me, a page delivered it, saying \u2019twas a gift from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you drink of it?\u201d He grabbed her shoulders, pulling her near him as he searched her eyes. \u201cMaris, did you?\u201d</p><p>Maris pulled sharply away. \u201cAye, but no more than a small sip. What ails you, Dirick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been poisoned. It most likely was poisoned!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should anyone poison me?\u201d She could not contain her shock.</p><p>\u201cFor the same reason they should try to run you down in the market place. I do not know.\u201d His face sagged into serious concern. \u201cMaris, you must have a care! Someone here does not want you to live. Promise me, promise me, that you will go nowhere without me or Raymond until we leave this place.\u201d</p><p>Maris nodded, the lump in her throat lodging any words she may have wished to speak inside. Why should anyone wish to kill her?</p><p>\u201cDid you recognize the page? What did he say?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and described what had happened when he\u2019d brought the wine. There were no answers there, she knew, and even only the suspicion that the wine had been poisoned. They would never know for certain.</p><p>\u201cWe will leave Westminster the day after we are wed,\u201d Dirick told her firmly. \u201cI will take you to Derkland for a time, to meet my mother, and then we shall go on to Ludingdon. At any rate, I shall take you away from this place and we shall stay where I know you will be safe. No one will be able to get to you in Derkland or at Ludington.\u201d</p><p>Maris was just about to speak when another page approached. \u201cMy lady Maris?\u201d She nodded acquiescence and he bowed. \u201cI have been asked to inform you that your mother, Lady Allegra of Langumont, has arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother?\u201d she repeated dumbly. She had hardly given Allegra a thought in the last se\u2019ennight.</p><p>\u201cAye. She has been shown to the ladies\u2019 chamber, and wishes you to attend her.\u201d</p><p>Maris rose, guilt blossoming inside her. \u201cAye. I will go to her.\u201d She looked down at Dirick, who stared up at her with eyes that seemed to devour her. \u201cI will look to see you at dinner this night,\u201d she said, barely resisting the urge to touch his cheek.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, I look more to two days hence when we shall be wed.\u201d He grabbed her hand and pressed a kiss to the inner part of her wrist, then released her. \u201cUntil then.\u201d</p><p>Allegra had been summoned to Westminster in order to attend her daughter\u2019s wedding. She\u2019d had no choice but to respond to the king\u2019s wishes, and the journey had been one of haste and discomfort.</p><p>When Maris appeared, she wore a surprised but pleased expression on her face. \u201cMama! How glad I am that you have come to see me wed!\u201d</p><p>Allegra drew her daughter into a brief embrace, then set her back gently. When had her daughter grown into such a lovely, strong young woman? \u201cYou are to marry Sir Dirick de Arlande?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, only now he is called Lord Dirick of Ludingdon.\u201d Maris sat in a chair next to her. \u201cMama, why did you not tell me Papa is not my father?\u201d</p><p>Allegra\u2019s heart skittered in her chest, and stopped beating for a moment. \u201cHow did you come to learn this?\u201d</p><p>A familiar expression of stubbornness crossed her daughter\u2019s face. \u201cIt does not matter how I came to learn of it, only whether \u2019tis true.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, struggling to manage the sudden horrible foreboding that settled like a heavy stone in her middle. \u201cAye, daughter, \u2019tis true. Your papa did not sire you.\u201d She clenched her hands tightly. \u201cBut how did you come to learn this? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa wrote it in a missive to the king,\u201d Maris explained.</p><p>\u201cYour papa?\u201d Suddenly, she couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cYour papa told the king?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, Mama.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed tightly. \u201cYour Papa did not know\u2014oh, I did not believe he knew.

Damned!</p><p>If Merle knew that Maris was not of his loins, it would have been no hardship to tell him of Bon\u2019s threats...and why he could not betrothe her to Victor. Instead, she had lived the lie, protected it for eighteen years. Now Merle was dead, and she still had judgment to face. A sudden trembling overtook her and she stuffed her hands into the folds of her skirts.</p> <p>\u201cI must go to confession.\u201d She stood abruptly, moving without hesitation and without a backward glance, to the door. She ignored Maris\u2019s shocked stare as she swept from the chamber.</p><p>Later, when night had come, and when Allegra had said enough paternosters and Ave Marias, she hoped, to salvage her soul, she crept from the chapel, tucking her graying hair into her veil. She cast about, looking for a page, a maidservant, someone to guide her back to the ladies\u2019 chamber.</p><p>\u201cAllegra.\u201d</p><p>The smooth voice from the shadows caused her heart to leap into her throat, and she whirled to face him. \u201cMichael! Oh, Michael!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSshhh,\u201d he admonished, stepping fully into the light. He pressed a finger against her dry lips with a soft caress, \u201c\u2018Tis not meet for us to be seen together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Why should we care?\u201d she said, just so she could feel her mouth moving against his beloved flesh.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d He dropped his hand from her lips and grasped her own fingers, firmly tugging her along in his wake.</p><p>Allegra followed. She would do anything he bid\u2014and he drew her along in the shadows of the dark hall. Reaching a small alcove, he pulled her inside and into a bare chamber, then into his embrace.</p><p>With a cry of delight, she pulled his face to hers, sampling his mouth with her starving lips. \u201cMichael,\u201d she sighed. \u201cOh, my beloved, how I have missed you. I thought to lose you yet again after you left Langumont.\u201d</p><p>His hands were warm and possessive over the swell of her hips, pressing into her the need that pulsed at his groin. \u201cYou are my only love,\u201d he told her as his mouth slid to the hollow of her neck. \u201cMarry me. Dearling, be my wife.\u201d He pulled back so that she could see the glitter of hope and desire in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, Michael, aye. \u2019Tis half my life I have waited to hear those words of your lips!\u201d Her hands were busy, pulling his tunic up so that she could feel his warm, solid chest against her fingers.</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Tis a lifetime I have waited to utter them.\u201d He helped her by yanking off his tunic, then pushing his chausses down past his waist. Michael slid her to the floor, pulling up her gown so that it bunched above her hips. When he thrust inside of her welcoming body, she cried at the pleasure of it, raising and lowering herself to meet his rhythm.</p><p>With a sharp, guttural groan, he met his end, and she with him. They lay for a moment in a heap of tangled clothing, sweat, and lust.</p><p>\u201cLet us marry on the morrow,\u201d he suggested, pressing a kiss behind her ear, at a place that never failed to cause her to shiver.</p><p>\u201cBut, Michael, what of the banns? We cannot find a priest to marry us so soon! And what of Maris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have already paid a priest to marry us without calling the banns. I meant to ask you tonight and could not bear to wait any longer than need be. He awaits us on the morrow. And,\u201d he slid his tongue into the depths of her ear, sending a sharp, pleasant twinge down her spine, \u201clet us not tell Maris as yet...she may look askance at us for marrying so soon after Merle\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Allegra pulled away as a thought struck her. \u201cDid you tell Maris that you are her natural father?\u201d</p><p>Michael peered down at her in the dim light as if trying to read her face. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer betrothal to Victor was repudiated and now she is to marry Lord of Ludingdon...was it you who told the king of her relation to your son so that he would deny the betrothal?\u201d</p> <p>Michael nodded. \u201cAye, he was prepared to formalize the contracts between them, and I could do naught but step forward and share the truth with him. \u2019Twas all for the best. Dirick of Derkland seems a fine fellow.\u201d</p><p>Allegra nodded, pleased at his concern for their daughter, and overwhelmed by the comfort of his nearness. \u201cI have never stopped loving you, Michael, and I cannot believe that we shall be husband and wife at last!\u201d</p><p>She felt him smile against her cheek. \u201cAye. \u2019Tis all that I have ever hoped for.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY THREE</p><p>Dirick leaned heavily against Raymond\u2019s shoulder, his head reeling from the large amount of ale he\u2019d imbibed at The Blue Goat, The Bow and the Apple, The King\u2019s Shield...and all of the other places his men had been dragging him to.</p><p>\u201cThis way, m\u2019lord,\u201d directed Raymond, his voice slightly slurred. The party of men stumbled along the street, their way lit as much by the full moon as by the lanterns that hung intermittently about.</p><p>\u201cI know where I am,\u201d growled Dirick, struggling to hold his head upright. It was not the best thing to do the night before one\u2019s wedding, but it had been impossible to deny his men their chance to celebrate his marriage and the betterment of his position as well\u2014for his increase in stature with the king translated into their own improvement.</p><p>Verily, dawn could be no more than two or three hours away. Dirick groaned at the thought. Henry expected him, as well as the other two bridegrooms, to join him for a celebratory hunt not long after the sun rose...to be followed shortly after by the wedding ceremony. In a matter of hours, he would be married to Maris.</p><p>Even in his befuddled state of mind, Dirick grasped the clarity of that fact. At this time on the morrow, he\u2019d be abed with his new wife. And despite the amount of ale his men had poured down his throat, Dirick\u2019s body reacted accordingly, filling and hardening with desire.</p><p>He\u2019d not seen Maris since the announcement that her mother had arrived from Langumont. Between the king\u2019s demands on his time, his new responsibilities as Lord of Ludingdon, and Maris\u2019s attention to Allegra, neither of them had been in the great hall for meals at the same time. He\u2019d not see her again, he realized, until they met at the altar on the morrow.</p><p>Not for the first time, Dirick wondered if she\u2019d become accepting of the fact that he was to be her husband. He did not want a battle in their bedchamber on the night of their wedding if she had not.</p><p>She\u2019d ever welcomed his kisses in the past, he reflected, the heaviness between his legs growing...and if they were truly wed, she\u2019d have no reason, and, he prayed, no desire, to refuse him.</p><p>Dirick stumbled over a rock in the street and would have pitched face first onto the ground had Raymond not had a firm grip on his tunic. One of the men in their group\u2014he thought it might be Sir Gerald, but everything was a bleary mess\u2014guffawed loudly in the still night, commenting that his lord had nearly fallen into a pile of dung. Dirick responded with a slurred insult, which the rest of the men found so uproariously funny that they nearly failed to spot the shadow slouching along the wall near the castle\u2019s entrance.</p><p>\u201cHo!\u201d Raymond stopped short. He was the least inebriated of the bunch, Dirick realized, and was thankful \u2019twas he who\u2019d offered to guide him home. \u201cWho goes there?\u201d</p><p>As the shadow moved into the torchlight, metamorphosing into Bon de Savrille, Dirick pulled himself upright, standing solidly under his own balance. His muscles tensed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you here?\u201d Dirick demanded, separating himself from his men and approaching Bon. Through the haze of drunkenness, he found the comforting handle of his dagger.</p><p>\u201cDo not fear,\u201d sneered the other man, \u201cI do not wait to accost you, but only to issue a warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seek to warn me? Against what?\u201d Dirick choked back a deprecating laugh. Then he lashed out to grab the other man\u2019s arm. \u201cIs it you who seeks to show Maris to an early grave?\u201d</p><p>Bon shook off his grip with effort. \u201cNay, fool! Why would I wish to see the woman dead? \u2019Tis why I come to warn you.\u201d</p><p>Dirick stared at him, uncomprehending. \u201cSpeak more clearly, then, man!\u201d</p><p>Bon leaned toward him, his dark eyes glittering with intensity. \u201cI do not wish to see her dead, but there is one who does...and the same one wishes harm to you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you warn me, then, as I know you have no love for me!\u201d</p><p>The other man shook his head. \u201cNay, I do not,\u201d he agreed, \u201cbut \u2019tis Maris for whom I care...and I would see her protected.\u201d He looked at Dirick with bleary eyes. \u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is mine.\u201d Dirick snapped the words, suddenly afraid that Bon might find a way to have her.</p><p>\u201cI am aware that the king has promised her to you.\u201d Bon\u2019s reply was bitter. \u201cBut that is not the purpose of my warning to you. Ask yourself why did Merle of Langumont not return from Breakston, and you will know why someone desires her dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerle of Langumont died in the siege of Breakston, most like of your own hand,\u201d Dirick returned slowly, the ale still swimming in his mind.</p><p>\u201cNay. Merle of Langumont was alive to accept my surrender,\u201d Bon told him.</p><p>\u201cYou do not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bon began to melt back into the shadows. \u201cNay, that is all I can tell you, sirrah, as I do not wish to be the next casualty...an\u2019, in faith, I wish to be the one left to hold and comfort my lady when all is said and the battles done.\u201d With that parting promise, he disappeared from sight.</p><p>\u201cWho is it!\u201d demanded Dirick of the shadows.</p><p>\u201cHer father.\u201d whispered a voice before its owner swept away into the night.</p><p>Her father. Dirick\u2019s mind swam as he lay on his pallet, Bon\u2019s words echoing in his memory, swirling among the ale that sopped his brain. Her father was dead, he reminded himself. What did the man mean? Nay, Merle was not her father, he remembered foggily. Ask yourself why Merle of Langumont did not return from Breakston. Why?</p><p>I love her. Those words taunted him with their sincerity. Another man loved his betrothed wife\u2014truly loved her, if the pain in Bon\u2019s voice was to be believed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A heaviness settled over Dirick\u2019s chest. His breathing quickened, then slowed, then rose faster again. If another man loved her enough to warn his enemy of danger, just to ensure that Maris should be safe, what would he do to have her?</p><p>The chamber around him spun and swam as he lay there.</p><p>Could she love him?</p> <p>Nay, of course not.</p><p>Could she?</p><p>Dirick frowned at his absurd thought, fighting to crystallize the murkiness of his mind. Damn that last jug of ale!</p><p>Her father. The words returned. I love her.</p><p>Ask yourself why Merle of Langumont did not return.</p> <p>He slept, dreamt, slept.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR</p><p>Dirick\u2019s head felt thrice as large as normal, his ears a hundred times more sensitive, and his belly like the ocean during a storm.</p><p>The barking of the dogs was enough to drive him mad, yet he gritted his teeth and managed to smile at Henry\u2019s jest.</p><p>\u201cWhat ails you, Dirick?\u201d the king asked, obviously noticing his pained grin.</p><p>\u201cNaught but enough ale to drown a village,\u201d he admitted.</p> <p>Henry chuckled. \u201c\u2019Twould be a pity were you not at your best this eve when you take your bride to bed.\u201d He laughed outright. \u201cSay the word if you cannot perform your duties and would wish some assistance.\u201d</p><p>Dirick glared at the king, finding little humor in his liege\u2019s jest. \u201cNay, your majesty, I assure you\u2014I have waited long enough for this night, and I will have no problem performing as I should.\u201d</p><p>The king laughed again, then turned his attention to the howling hounds. \u201cThey\u2019ve scented a boar!\u201d he cried in excitement. With a spur to his mount, he leaned forward and the stallion leapt into the wake of the frenzied dogs.</p><p>A party of twenty some men and their horses trampled through the forest, bearing down upon the hounds. The fresh air whipping about his face dissolved the brunt of Dirick\u2019s nausea and he began to get into the spirit of the hunt. With a cry of delight, he brandished the spear he carried and urged Nick harder, so that they gained ground on the king.</p><p>At last, the howling of the dogs indicated that they\u2019d cornered the boar. The hunters raced into the clearing, reining up on one side, readying themselves to take passes at the snorting animal.</p><p>The boar\u2019s red eyes blazed from its long snouted face, and angry tusks curled with enough curve to rock a careless dog before tossing it into the air. Bristling, wiry hair sprang from the beast, and hot breath rasped from flaring nostrils as it cast frantically about for an escape route. Hound, horse, or man blocked all avenues of freedom, and the boar grew more frenzied as it readied itself to rush through the blockades</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d cried Henry, nodding at the three bridegrooms, who\u2019d been given the honor of the first strokes.</p><p>Lord Bartholemew readied his spear and dug his heels into his mount\u2019s sides. They leaped forward, crashing through the clearing, passing by the boar in a flurry of hooves, flapping cloak, and a well thrust spear. A spurt of blood sprang forth from the beast\u2019s shoulder, and a cheer erupted from the other hunters.</p> <p>Lord Richard followed shortly after, missing his stab at the boar, but distracting the howling beast from the spear wielded by Dirick. His aim was true, and the boar received another telling wound in its belly.</p><p>As Dirick halted Nick to the side, watching as the boar pawed the ground, readying itself for a vicious pass through the ring of men that surrounded it, he had a moment to reflect upon his garbled memory of Bon\u2019s warning from the night before.</p><p>Why did Merle not return from Breakston? If he were alive when Bon saw him last, and he was not felled during the attack upon the keep, then he must have died by the hand of someone else.</p><p>Michael and Victor d\u2019Arcy?</p><p>The thought sprang to his mind, followed quickly by the question of why.</p><p>A shout from one of the hunters distracted Dirick from his thoughts, and he saw that the boar was wavering on its feet.</p><p>Her father.</p><p>Could Michael be Maris\u2019s father? That could explain Allegra\u2019s odd reaction when she greeted them back at Langumont. The hair prickled at the nape of his neck. Things were beginning to make sense.</p><p>Dirick turned to Lord Bartholemew, who watched the last thrust at the boar with rapt attention. \u201cBart, know you much of Lord Michael d\u2019Arcy? Is he trustworthy?\u201d</p><p>The other man turned, a look of satisfaction on his face as the boar crashed onto its side. \u201cLord of Gladwythe, you speak of? Verily, the man has an oddness about him. Mayhap \u2019tis because of his parents\u2019 death...findin\u2019 them like that would have to touch anyone\u2019s mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of his parents\u2019 death?\u201d</p><p>Bartholomew shook his head sadly, turning from the bloody scene of the boar\u2019s demise and giving Dirick his full attention now that the hunt was over. \u201cHe was naught more than a boy when his papa and mama jumped to their death from a tower at Gladwythe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe found them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. They\u2019d jumped together, holding hands it looked, and landed thusly in the bailey at Gladwythe.\u201d</p><p>Dirick stared at him for a moment, a chill creeping down his back. The pieces slipped into place and he felt the blood drain from his face.</p><p>\u201cLudingdon, are you well?\u201d asked Bartholomew as if from very far away.</p><p>\u201cI must go.\u201d Dirick wheeled Nick around, his heart slamming in his chest. He drove his heels into Nick\u2019s sides, leaning forward over the stallion\u2019s neck, urging the horse on. \u201cTell the king I\u2019ve found him!\u201d he shouted over his shoulder as horse and man thundered through the brush.</p><p>He felt the saddle slip as Nick leapt over a tree trunk, and before he could think, its girth loosened, then gave way and suddenly, he was falling, falling.</p><p>His last thought before he hit the ground was that he had been sabotaged.</p><p>Maris opened the heavy gold box and gasped, sinking onto her bed.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis beauteous!\u201d she exclaimed, pulling a rope of fine gold links from the small chest. Topazes and emeralds dangled randomly from the necklet that would wrap around her neck at least thrice. Each jewel was set in an ornate, filigreed hasp, each one different and a work of art in its own right.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a wondrous bride\u2019s gift,\u201d said Madelyne with a twinkle in her eye. \u201cLord Dirick is a generous groom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Maris looked down at the small chest that rested in her lap. The box itself was a lovely gift, and along with the bejeweled necklet it held bespoke of the value Dirick placed upon his bride. She could not hold back a smile of pure joy. Mayhap he did care for her as much as he desired her lands.</p><p>She poured the gold rope back into the chest. Delivered by one of her own men from Langumont, the box had been tied with a golden ribbon and sprigs of rosemary, lemon verbena, and violets. Maris sniffed the small purple flowers and placed them, along with the herbs, on top of the necklet, and closed the chest. Her stomach fluttered and she smiled again.</p><p>Tonight, she would lie with Dirick, would feel his lips and hands over her body, would mate with him and feel his skin next to hers, would become his. Anticipation sent a shiver down her spine.</p><p>Today, she would marry the man she loved.</p><p>The fear and hesitancy were gone, and in their place was comfort, love, and happiness that she would belong to Dirick, with Dirick, and would live with him, bear his children and rule their lands at his side. Maris took a deep breath, hardly able to credit the fact that she was welcoming\u2014even embracing\u2014the event of marriage after having fought against it for so long.</p><p>An urgent knocking on the door drew her from her woolgathering, and Maris and the other ladies watched expectantly as a maidservant went to answer it.</p><p>\u201cMy Lady Maris,\u201d Michael d\u2019Arcy nearly burst into the room when the door opened. \u201cThere has been an accident! \u2019Tis your betrothed husband!\u201d</p><p>Maris jumped from her stool. \u201cWhat is it? Is he badly hurt?\u201d Her heart lodged in her throat, and she was dimly aware that Madelyne was drawing a cloak around her shoulders.</p><p>Michael shook his head soberly. \u201cMaris, I do not know. They are summoning the physicians to him, for he fell from his horse during the hunt. They are afraid to move him. You must come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She moved quickly toward the door, trying to quiet the tension and fear thrumming through her veins. \u201cI must fetch the medicines from my chamber,\u201d she told Michael as they started down the hall.</p><p>\u201cNay, there is no time. He has called for you to come to his side, and \u2019tis best that you come with me now...Maris, \u2019tis no small hurt, and he wishes to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>The fear in her middle grew and she found herself hardly able to breathe. To lose love so soon after finding it would be more than she could bear...especially coming so closely upon the heels of her father\u2019s death.</p><p>Maris clenched her fist in the folds of her skirt as she was propelled along by Michael\u2019s very firm grip. She would not think about that possibility. She would not.</p><p>At the stables, she was faintly surprised to find Hickory saddled and ready, with Victor holding the reins. \u201cCome, lady, before \u2019tis too late,\u201d he urged, helping her into the saddle.</p><p>Michael mounted his own horse and nudged Maris and Victor ahead of him through the bailey. They trotted quickly through the entryway, over the drawbridge, and away from the keep.</p><p>Bon de Savrille emerged from a corner of the bailey just after Maris and her escort passed by. His face was creased with concern as he hurried into the stable and selected a horse under the watchful eye of the marshal.</p><p>\u201cHurry, man,\u201d he demanded, looking in the direction in which she\u2019d disappeared.</p><p>At last, he was given the reins and he vaulted into the saddle. With a loud \u201cHah!\u201d he whipped the stallion and thundered through the bailey and across the drawbridge, following the path of the two men and the woman he loved.</p><p>Dirick forced his eyes open from the darkness that beckoned him with a soothing aura. There was something...something urgent....</p><p>Voices reached his ears, as if from far away. He thought he moved...aye, he must have, for pain ricocheted up his leg and curled in the low part of his back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The urgency came to him again...then it was gone.</p><p>Firm hands pulled and pushed at him, and he wanted to slip into that blackness and sleep...but the urgency kept kneading at him...kneading...like the hands that interrupted his comfort.</p><p>Maris.</p> <p>The name struck his consciousness like a lightening bolt and he jerked awake. Something about Maris.... His eyes were open, blearily focusing on the faces that stared down at him. Maris was not there, he realized dimly...Henry...Bart...Raymond...</p><p>Maris...his mind screamed the name, the urgency, but it took all of his effort to pinpoint his concentration. The urgency had aught to do with her.... Maris, his betrothed wife, his beloved....</p><p>D\u2019Arcy.</p><p>Dirick croaked the name as he struggled to sit upright. God in heaven, he was going to take her! \u201cMaris,\u201d he managed to push from a dry, swollen throat.</p><p>Faintly, he heard Henry laugh, though the concern still ringed his eyes. \u201cThe man\u2019s worried that he won\u2019t be able to do his wife justice this night...he must be well.\u201d Nevertheless, the king himself bent toward Dirick. \u201cCan you stand, man?\u201d</p> <p>Dirick gathered all of his wits and strength and nodded his head, reaching for the hand that was proffered to him. It was a beringed hand, and it belonged to Henry...but Dirick disregarded that fact as he lunged for the offered grip and pulled himself to his feet.</p><p>He was in the forest. The members of the hunt had gathered around with their mounts, and the hounds, and even the carcass of the boar. \u201cI must go,\u201d was all he could say once he found Nick with his gaze.</p><p>\u201cLudingdon, what ails you? You must come back to the castle and be tended to!\u201d Henry boomed the order. \u201cRichard! Marcus! Take him and bring him back to the physicians, and do not listen to his arguments! He has delayed my hunt long enough!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE</p><p>\u201cHow much farther are they?\u201d asked Maris, looking about the forest for some sign of the hunting party. She\u2019d ridden quite far out of London with Michael and Victor and expected to find the hunting party at any time.</p><p>Neither man replied to her question, nor did they seem to acknowledge it.</p> <p>\u201cI do not see them anywhere,\u201d she said more forcefully. \u201cSurely the hunt did not take the party this far from the castle.\u201d An uncomfortable twinge started in the base of her spine and she reined Hickory up. \u201cAre you certain we are going in the right direction?\u201d</p><p>Michael stopped his horse and turned back to her. \u201cCome, Maris, do not question me.\u201d He grabbed the reins from her hands and began to propel Hickory behind his own mount.</p><p>The twinge blossomed into a full foreboding and Maris felt fear curdle in her middle. \u201cI must return to the castle for my wedding,\u201d she said, squinting up at the sun that was beginning to climb down the sky. Panic started to blossom in her belly. Something was very wrong.</p><p>Victor laughed and the sound sent a chill up her spine. \u201cYour bridegroom is in no condition to attend the ceremony. There is no need for you to return.\u201d</p><p>Those words held a finality that did not sit well with Maris. It had occurred to her earlier that she\u2019d disobeyed Dirick\u2019s orders to go nowhere without him or Raymond...but her fear for his safety had been the overriding factor in her decision. And, in sooth, she\u2019d forgotten her promise in the terror that he\u2019d been injured.</p><p>Michael urged his horse into a canter, and Maris was forced to lean forward and grab Hickory\u2019s mane. Just as she had done when Bon abducted her, she forced herself to examine the situation. She swallowed the fear in her throat. She could not escape on foot, and Michael was in control of her horse. Victor rode so close to her that his mount\u2019s tail brushed against Hickory\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis not far from here,\u201d he told his father, moving up so that their horses were neck and neck.</p><p>Maris was now just behind them, but out of their easy sight as she was towed along on Hickory. She used the opportunity to slip a hand under her skirt and pull forth her dagger. She sent up a prayer of thanks that her mother had warned her never to be without the knife and set to cutting away at the reins. If she were quick, and lucky, she could cut herself free and be off. Mayhap, she and Hickory could outrun her kidnappers. If not\u2014</p> <p>She stopped her thoughts right there. That possibility was not worth thinking on.</p><p>Once again, Maris considered the facts and the situation. Dirick should have learned of her absence by now, and of course he would search for her. That thought eased her a bit.</p><p>But as she continued to saw through the thick leather, another thought turned her cold. Michael and Victor talked so certainly of Dirick\u2019s injury...mayhap there was a truth to it and he would not be able to come after her. Mayhap he was dead!</p><p>Angry, frustrated tears welled in her eyes and she pushed the thought away. She\u2019d think only of one thing now: escaping from Michael and Victor.</p><p>When the reins were nearly cut through, Maris gathered herself and readied her courage, gripping Hickory with her thighs and tightening her fistful of mane. With a final slice, she cut the last bit of leather and kicked her horse to veer suddenly away.</p><p>The shout of surprise erupted too close behind her and she leaned forward, urging Hickory as they raced for their freedom. The trampling of hooves in their trail was loud and gaining proximity and she felt tears sting her eyes. \u201cGo, Hickory, go!\u201d she cried into the mare\u2019s ear, kicking her again.</p><p>\u2019Twas of no use. One of them galloped up next to her and with a swift jerk, pulled her from her saddle across his own. She landed on her stomach with the air knocked out of her and saw the ground race by at a dizzying speed. She\u2019d failed.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d Michael\u2019s voice was tight with fury as he slowed his horse to a walk. \u201cFoolish woman!\u201d</p><p>Victor barreled up to them. \u201cI\u2019ll take her, Father. \u2019Tis my right to enjoy what little time we\u2019ve left together.\u201d</p><p>Maris struggled as she was shoved over to the younger man\u2019s mount and placed in front of him on the saddle. Michael gave her a hard slap to the face, stunning her, as Victor\u2019s arms tightened around her waist.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she demanded, trying to ignore the pounding in her temple from the blow.</p><p>Victor laughed harshly. \u201cYou seem so concerned about your wedding, my dear, that I should hate to disappoint you and have you forego your wedding night.\u201d One of his hands slipped to close over her breast as he pushed his arousal into her bottom. \u201cI would expect that to occupy us for some time, and then...well, my love, I do not see any purpose in returning damaged goods to your bridegroom...if indeed he still lives.\u201d His fingers pinched cruelly at her breast, closing over her nipple so that she could not suppress a soft gasp of pain. \u201cAnd I have no use for damaged goods myself. After all, \u2019twould do no good for me to beget a child upon my sister, now would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped from pain as much as shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Father, you did not tell her that we are blood?\u201d Victor asked, his hand moving to cup the full weight of her breast, fondling it roughly.</p><p>Michael looked at Maris. \u201cYour mother, whore that she is, begat my child before she married Merle of Langumont and birthed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my father?\u201d The pain from Victor\u2019s seeking fingers faded in light of this revelation. \u201cNay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I assure you, \u2019tis true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I was to marry...your son...my brother.\u201d</p><p>Michael shrugged. \u201cI did not know you were my daughter at that time. I didn\u2019t learn of it until your stupid mother told me as we set out for Breakston to save you. In truth, it didn\u2019t matter to me or to Victor...but your papa\u2014Merle\u2014must have learned this, for he told me he\u2019d changed his mind over the betrothal.\u201d A cold smile of such evil spread his features that Maris felt nauseated. \u201cI could not accept that decision.\u201d</p><p>The nausea turned to cold anger. \u201cYou killed my father,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, nay, he did not,\u201d said Victor, leaning forward to thrust a tongue wet with slime into her ear. He murmured, \u201cNay, \u2019twas I who loosed the arrow into his back.\u201d</p><p>Maris jerked away from his cold mouth and was just as harshly jolted back onto a solid chest. \u201cNay, lady, you\u2019ll not escape me this time. Long have I waited for the opportunity to break your arrogance and impudence, and I\u2019ll have no more delays.\u201d He sank his fingers into the mass of braids at the back of her scalp, pulling her head backward at an impossible angle, and kissed her forcefully.</p><p>Just then, the sound of galloping reached their ears. All three turned to see a single man on horseback careening through the trees.</p><p>Maris\u2019s heart leapt until the man drew closer and she recognized him. Bon de Savrille. How could he be involved in this mess?</p><p>\u201cHalt!\u201d Bon cried as Michael and Victor started to wheel their horses about, ready to make their escape. \u201cUnhand her!\u201d Bon did not slow, and his momentum brought him to their sides. Maris saw that he brandished a sword that glittered in the afternoon light and she took the opportunity to pull loose of Victor\u2019s hands.</p><p>With a quick elbow into his abdomen, Maris launched herself off the saddle, stumbled, then started running through the woods as fast as she could. There were shouts of anger behind her, and she heard a scream of pain from one of the horses, but she kept running.</p><p>There was no sound of horse\u2019s hooves following her, but she knew in her numb mind that when they finished their battle\u2014whoever was left\u2014would chase her down.</p><p>Swallowing back nausea, Dirick leaned forward over Nick\u2019s neck. His head still pounded and his entire body throbbed with pain...but his intent was single: to find Maris.</p><p>He refused to allow himself to think of what could be happening, what she might be going through, as he led the party of men through the forest. Fortunately, several people had spotted Michael and Victor with Maris and Dirick had had to waste little time in discovering their trail. The odd part, he reflected, happy to focus on some other puzzle so that he wouldn\u2019t go crazy with worry, was the third man who had followed in their wake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sun was lowering and soon the forest would be dark. \u2019Twould be next to impossible to follow the trail in the dark, and this realization was the impetus that drove him on.</p><p>He could not lose her.</p><p>Dirick swallowed back the unmanly urge to cry in frustration. She was his, she was to be his...tonight, he was to wed with the only woman he\u2019d ever wanted with such deep, certain need. He drove his heels into Nick\u2019s middle, pushing the destrier even harder than he did in battle. This was the most important battle he\u2019d ever fought, he realized numbly. He could not lose it.</p> <p>He almost missed seeing the shadow that rushed out from a deep thicket, until it was nearly beneath Nick\u2019s hooves.</p><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d it cried.</p><p>\u201cMaris?\u201d Dirick pulled back on the reins, wheeling Nick aside on his hind legs, landing just next to her. He was out of his saddle in an instant, aware of the rest of his men gathering around them in the forest.</p><p>\u201cDirick?\u201d she cried. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms in one fluid motion. She was shaking, and her face was suspiciously wet. She was running her hands all over his face and shoulders as if to ensure that it was really he.</p> <p>\u201cMy God, I thought I\u2019d lost you,\u201d he murmured, burying his face in her neck, smelling the rosemary and lemon and touching the tangles of her hair. \u201cMaris, Maris,\u201d he said her name over and over. \u201cBeloved, have they hurt you? How did you escape?\u201d</p><p>She sniffled in the first show of womanly weakness he\u2019d ever witnessed. \u201cI am not hurt,\u201d she told him, looking up with wide golden green eyes. \u201cBut \u2019twas Bon de Savrille who saved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dirick guided her back to his horse as the others gathered around, listening and yet remaining at a distance.</p><p>\u201cAye, he came after us and in the confusion, I managed to get away. It wasn\u2019t far from here.\u201d She looked over her shoulder, gesturing in that direction, \u201cand no one came after me. I do not know what happened.\u201d</p><p>With a curt nod, Dirick sent several of the men scattering to see what they could find. \u201cAre you truly not hurt?\u201d he asked, drawing them away from the rest of the party and angling Nick so that he stood between them and the gawking men. \u201cMy beloved, I cannot tell you what fears I had for you!\u201d</p><p>She reached up and smoothed a cool hand over his face, touching a scrape from his fall. \u201cThey told me you\u2019d been hurt, that you\u2019d fallen from a horse. I was afraid you were dead.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cAye. And I suspect it was Michael or Victor who slit the girth of my saddle, nearly causing me to be trampled among Nick\u2019s hooves. I am fine, now that you are safe.\u201d</p><p>She pulled him down, covering his lips with her own. He felt the dampness of her tear moisten his cheek. When she pulled back after a sweet, tender kiss, Maris was looking up at him with those green-gold eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, some new tension tightening his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I nearly didn\u2019t have the chance to tell you...but you must know. I am well pleased to be your wife. I\u2018ve come to love you, Dirick, and I am sure you will make a find husband, and a good Lord of Langumont.\u201d</p><p>When he would have spoken, she pressed a finger to his lips, shaking her head. \u201cNay, do not speak. \u2019Tis enough for me that you came after me...I do not expect that you should feel the same. And, in sooth, Dirick\u2014I do not care.\u201d</p><p>He would have spoken, but a shout drew his attention. Gathering her into his arms, he gave her a well placed kiss on her lips and lifted her into his saddle. Vaulting gracefully up, he settled behind her and they started off toward the shout.</p><p>A group of men gathered in a small clearing, and when they drew near, Raymond of Vermille caught Dirick\u2019s eye, shaking his head slightly. Maris should not see, was the message in his gaze. But it was too late.</p><p>She slid from the saddle and pushed her way through the gawking crowd of men, ignoring Dirick\u2019s shout. The scene that greeted her was one that would surely leave nightmares, but nevertheless, she moved forward. She had to see it.</p> <p>Victor d\u2019Arcy lay on his stomach, head turned to one side, and his back soaked with blood. Bon de Savrille was arranged so that he lay in a similar position, with his hands reaching eerily for Victor\u2019s. His beard was wet with the blood that oozed from the spot where his nose had been, and his neck was bent at an awkward angle so that, although he lay on one cheek, his face was tilted back and his eyes looked at nothingness.</p><p>Nausea gathered in the back of her throat, but Maris was able to keep it at bay until she saw the horse. Then, she could control it no longer, and she turned to empty her belly into the bushes.</p><p>Dirick caught her in the middle of her wild retreat and held her while she vomited in a thicket. The violence left her shaking and trembling, and in the wake of her experience, Maris felt unaccountably weak.</p><p>Coughing and spitting, she raised her face and he offered her a corner of his tunic. There was gentleness in his eyes and tenderness in his touch. Placing a comforting arm around her waist, he walked her back to Nick.</p><p>\u201cCome, let me take you back to the castle.\u201d Despite the grimness in his face, his words were solicitous and he placed a gentle kiss on her forehead. Once again, he lifted her onto Nick.</p><p>\u201cOur wedding day is ruined,\u201d she told him tearfully, suddenly overwhelmed with emotion.</p><p>\u201cNay, my lady, our wedding day is saved.\u201d He pulled her back against his broad chest, pulling his cloak about them to ward off the spring evening, and turned Nick back toward Westminster.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Dirick said clearly, looking straight into Maris\u2019s eyes.</p><p>The bishop joined their hands, intoning, \u201cI pronounce you man and wife. Let no man tear asunder what God has thus joined.\u201d</p><p>Dirick\u2019s hands closed tightly over Maris\u2019s smaller, rough ones, and she could not help but smile up at him.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Ludingdon,\u201d the king boomed from his stance off to the side of the chapel.</p><p>\u201cMy thanks, your majesty,\u201d Dirick did not release Maris\u2019s hand as they walked over to bow to their king.</p><p>Though their return to Westminster had been late in the day, and the other two wedding ceremonies had already been performed, Dirick had refused to wait any longer to finalize his marriage to Maris, despite the fact that he now had an excuse. His mother would likely be furious that he had not waited for the family\u2014and for Thomas to say the ceremony\u2014but she would be pleased that at the least the deed had been done.</p><p>Henry, when told of the events of the day, had agreed to witness the wedding and rousted the bishop from his prayers in order to say yet another marriage. Thus, the guests and witnesses to the joining of the Lord of Ludingdon and the Lady of Langumont had been limited to Henry and Eleanor, several men-at-arms from Langumont, Madelyne and Gavin of Mal Verne, and Gavin\u2019s cousin Judith. Maris\u2019s mother, Allegra, had not been found in time for the ceremony.</p><p>Maris pressed close to her new husband after she curtsied to the royal couple, enjoying his warmth and solidness. Though she\u2019d had time to bathe and dress for the ceremony while Dirick was making the arrangements, she\u2019d been unable to shake off the horror of the scene in the wood...and the knowledge that Michael d\u2019Arcy had not been found. There, she realized, lay the reasoning behind Dirick\u2019s insistence that they wed immediately.</p><p>She remained in a happy daze throughout the quick meal of cold pheasant, cheese, and bread that they ate in the great hall, and she imbibed a more generous amount of wine than usual. It made her warm and trembly, especially when she thought about being with Dirick in the marriage bed. Though she\u2019d expected this wedding between two of the more powerful nobility to be a grand affair, with feasting, dancing, and entertainment, Maris was not altogether displeased at the outcome.</p><p>Taking another sip of the rich Bordeaux from Aquitaine, she reflected that \u2019twas just as well that she did not have to make merry among a throng of guests and well wishers until it was such a time as to go abovestairs, else she would surely go mad from the wait.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat every time Dirick looked at her with the hooded grey eyes that bespoke of his own impatience for the evening to end. He offered her a small bit of cheese and lightly caressed the center of her bottom lip as she opened her mouth to accept it. The lids of his eyes swept down, and he looked at them from under them. The flare of desire was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cLet us go abovestairs,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she breathed, nervous heat rushing through her body.</p><p>They stood and the chatter of their companions stilled. \u201cWhither are you off to, Lord Dirick?\u201d grinned the king.</p><p>\u201cI am certain you are wise enough to divine my destination, your majesty,\u201d growled Dirick.</p><p>\u201cAye, then, be off with you.\u201d Henry waved them away.</p><p>Maris looked at Dirick in surprise as they backed away from the king and the other well wishers. There was to be no bedding ceremony?</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Dirick hissed, taking her hand and pulling her quickly from the hall, \u201cbefore they decide to follow us!\u201d</p><p>She stumbled along as quickly as her long skirts would allow, thankful that she was not to be disrobed in front of a gaggle of women and gawking men before being urged into bed with her husband.</p><p>They reached the chamber that had been set aside for them, safely and without escort.</p><p>Dirick ushered Maris within, closing the door firmly behind him. Agnes had stoked the fire into a low blaze to keep the night chill from the damp room, and now she dozed on the floor near their bed.</p><p>Maris shook her maid awake and dismissed her. \u201cThere is no need to attend me this night,\u201d she told Agnes, watching as Dirick sat to remove his boots. \u201cMy husband will assist me.\u201d She found those words\u2014my husband\u2014to be both exciting and welcome, coming from her lips.</p><p>She barred the heavy door behind Agnes, then turned slowly to face her husband. He\u2019d pulled off his surcoat and tunic, and was naked from the waist up: a golden statue of muscle and glittering eyes and coarse dark hair in the firelight. He sat on a stool near the blaze, watching her as he had done the night she treated his stab wound. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maris shivered in anticipation. This night would end much differently.</p><p>\u201cMaris, my love, come to me.\u201d His voice was low and smooth, and his eyes never wavered.</p><p>Nervous, excited, anticipatory, she moved quickly to him and allowed him to pull her onto his lap. He drew the transparent veil from her head and thrust his fingers into the long thickness of her hair, gently combing through the braids and untangling the mass of waves and curls. \u201cYour hair is so beautiful,\u201d he told her, pressing a kiss to the end of a thick lock.</p> <p>He stroked the edge of her chin, his touch leaving tiny sensations of pleasure, then closed his lips over her mouth in a sleek, sensual kiss that left her breathless. His long, tan fingers unfastened the golden girdle that rested on her hips and eased the heavy overtunic above her head, then flung it into a heap on the floor. And when he bent to kiss her once more, it was a long, thorough, and easy one, as if to remind her that they had all the night to taste each other.</p><p>Closing his hands over her breasts, still covered by the gossamer undertunic, he stroked his thumbs over her nipples. They tightened into miniature erections, and then he shifted the fabric across them, the soft cloth rasping over their sensitive points, Maris felt a delicious dart of pleasure shimmy down to her core.</p><p>A sort of heaviness grew low in her belly, and she felt as if she were filling and swelling in her private areas. Damp heat rushed and centered there, and Maris realized she was beginning to feel a sort of itchy, needy sensation in the pit of her belly.</p><p>Dirick\u2019s muscles tightened and shivered as she smoothed the flats of her hands over the muscular slabs of his chest, down the sides of his ribs and abdomen. Lightly, lightly, she ran the raggedness of her fingernails over the back of his shoulders, then down and around to the ridges of his belly. Tiny bumps followed their paths and he shivered, his breathing becoming rough and unsteady.</p><p>Abruptly, Dirick stood and directed her toward the large bed where the curtains had been pulled back. Sprigs of rosemary and violets lay on their pillows, and he swept them to the side before easing Maris onto the plush bed. She watched, unafraid, as he slid his breeches down over lean hips and well defined, muscular thighs. A sigh culled the back of her throat when he came to lie next to her, pulling her to the long, warm length of his body.</p> <p>Her chest rose and fell, and he placed his hand over the swell of one breast, allowing it to rise and fall with it.</p><p>\u201cMaris,\u201d he spoke, looking at her directly. \u201cDo you know what is to happen?\u201d The gentleness in his grey eyes stirred her and she reached up to smack a playful kiss onto his lips.</p><p>\u201cAye, Dirick, \u2019tis no secret to me what a man and woman do when they mate. And, I am not afraid,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you. I welcome you.\u201d Her fingers twisted in the thick hair that fell over his forehead, then trailed her hands lower, drifting down his chest and boldly to the hardness between his legs. When she brushed against that hot, tumescent skin, he stiffened, catching his breath in a sharp, pained groan. Maris couldn\u2019t help a self-satisfied smile, and, with delight at his obvious pleasure, she closed her fingers over hard, velvet-skinned erection. This time, the groan that came from the back of his throat was primal and needy.</p><p>She began to explore its warm reach, not at all certain she knew what she was doing...but sliding up and down along it seemed like a good idea.</p><p>\u201cYou are bold, my lady,\u201d Dirick said, flashing a tense grin at her. He shifted out of her greedy reach with a quick, precise movement. \u201cAnd I find myself at an unfair advantage\u2014for I am at your mercy, and you are still armored by some manner of cloth. Allow me to rid you of your protection.\u201d</p><p>With a quick movement, he yanked the fragile cloth, rending it down the center of her body, leaving its ivory curves bare to his gaze. Maris gasped in surprise and with a faint twinge of annoyance. \u201cDirick,\u201d she admonished laughingly, \u201cyou\u2019ve just ruined the dearest piece of cloth I\u2019ve ever purchased.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he murmured, filling his hands with her breasts. \u201cI shall buy you another to replace it. Two if I must.\u201d</p><p>Then his hand smoothed over her belly, down to that warm, moist place where all of her senses seemed to have collected. She throbbed and moistened at his touch as he fingered the swollen little knob there, teasing and massaging it gently. Maris felt the most inexplicable sensation, rising and swelling inside her, blossoming into something hot and needy and all the world fell away but for the sensation of his fingers, stroking and sliding in her wetness.</p><p>\u201cBeloved, I would not hurt you, but I cannot prevent it...and I must have you...now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, hardly aware of what she was saying. With a smooth motion, Dirick moved between her legs, anchoring up on one elbow while he guided himself to her opening. And then, suddenly, she felt him fill her, full, oh...full...and then a sharp pain surprised her and she gasped softly</p><p>\u201cBeloved,\u201d he whispered, holding himself poised and still over her, filling her so deeply. \u201cForgive me.\u201d His breathing was the only sound in the chamber, and she could feel him waiting, uncertain and desperate.</p><p>The pain had ebbed and all at once, Maris was aware\u2014very aware\u2014of being filled, of the anticipation, the need, beginning once again. She gave a little twitch, a little shift, and with the gust of released breath, Dirick began to move inside her.</p><p>Any lingering discomfort melted away as he shifted, sliding in and out in a long, slow rhythm that made her tighten and reach, lifting and gathering until something exploded inside her. A storm of shivers and fluttering filled her, blossoming from her middle to the end of every limb and digit in a sharp snap of heat.</p><p>Maris might have gasped, she might even have dug her nails into her husband\u2019s skin, but she wasn\u2019t certain, for he was moving faster now, faster and with more urgency. His muscles bunched beneath her fingers, his skin was hot and damp against hers.</p> <p>She knew, hazily, that he reached his fulfillment when he threw his head back and slammed inside her with a low groan. He froze like a beautiful god above her in an instant of vulnerability and ecstasy.</p><p>Then he smiled and opened his eyes to look down at her. \u201cBeloved,\u201d he murmured, rolling to the side, gathering her damp body close. \u201cHow blessed I am.\u201d</p><p>And then his eyes slid closed and he settled against her.</p><p>When Dirick awoke much later that night...or mayhap \u2019twas near the morning...the first thing he saw was the unruly mass of thick, lemony smelling hair that belonged to his wife.</p><p>Joy welled inside him and he smoothed a wrist thick wave away from her face, baring the fair skin and rosy lips of Maris. His wife.</p><p>She stirred and sleepily rolled over toward him. Her eyes fluttered, then opened wide as if surprised to see him. Then, they shuttered and a smile curved her mouth before she opened them again, now fully awake.</p><p>\u201cGood morrow, Dirick,\u201d she told him, reaching to touch his face.</p><p>\u201cGood morrow, beloved.\u201d His voice was raspy with desire and sleep. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d she told him, stretching like a cat. \u201cAnd \u2019tis all you to blame.\u201d</p><p>He grinned down at her. \u201cThat is one blame I shall not shirk, my lady.\u201d Squinting at the sunlight filtering through a light tapestry, he said, \u201c\u2019Tis morn. They\u2019ll arrive anon to check that the sheets are blooded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Maris eagerly drew the blankets away from their naked bodies to show the white sheet and its dark red drops of blood.</p><p>Dirick rose from the bed to use the chamberpot, and Maris followed. They embraced in passing, one long, lean, haired body pressing to a smaller, softer, rounder one.</p><p>Though he felt himself harden in response to her proximity, Dirick pulled reluctantly away. Their chamber would soon be invaded by a delegate to ascertain whether the marriage had indeed been consummated, and that the lady had indeed been a virgin...and he did not relish the thought of being interrupted thus.</p><p>\u201cWe will leave London today,\u201d he told her as he settled back on the bed. He felt her gaze caress his nakedness and felt a rush of delight and victory at the realization that she was well and truly his. \u201cMichael d\u2019Arcy has not been found, and you will not be truly safe until he is.\u201d</p><p>Maris wrapped a light cloth around her shoulders and curled on the edge of the bed. \u201cHe is my father,\u201d she told him unsteadily.</p><p>Dirick pulled her to rest her head on his chest. \u201cI learned that only yesterday. I\u2019m sorry that I did not know sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed my father\u2014Merle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, or suspected that, as well. He is the man who killed my father\u2014the one that I spoke of to you.\u201d Dirick tightened his lips. \u201cI will not rest until he is found.\u201d</p><p>Maris pulled away, sitting up to look down at him. \u201cYou will have a care, Dirick. You will not put yourself in danger. Michael has killed so many\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot let him go unpunished.\u201d He searched her face with his gaze, seeing the love and respect that shone in her green and gold eyes. \u201cYou must know by now that I love you, Maris. I never thought to feel this way about any one woman, but you have driven me so mad that I realized I could not live without you...and I must ensure that the one who would see you dead is also gone. And then I can have no fear that you will be taken from me by a crazed madman.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers smoothed the hair back from his forehead. \u201cHow lucky I am that my papa chose to repudiate my betrothal to Victor...else I would surely be a murderess on this morn.\u201d</p><p>Dirick smiled. \u201cHad that happened, I would have spirited you away before the ceremony that bound you to him...or after you had done the deed, I\u2019d have been your escape route.\u201d He frowned. \u201cBut even if I did that, there was no certainty you would have accepted my help\u2014as you refused it once before. I must know, now\u2014why would you think I could have been party to your kidnapping by Bon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else was I to think when I tumbled onto the floor and looked up to see you staring down upon me?\u201d Maris asked indignantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut...I thought you\u2019d known me better than that...and, Maris, how could I have stolen you for someone else when I wanted you for myself? Did you not know that I wanted you? That was why I had to leave Langumont so suddenly\u2014I could not bear to see you given to another.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with wondering eyes. \u201cI did not know, truly. At the time, I could only think you had wooed me to your side so as to make your abduction of me easier. I thought \u2019twas you who wrapped me in that cloth and carried me to Breakston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nay, Maris. On the night we first met, I wanted you...and that desire grew, and so did the despair that I could never have you. I couldn\u2019t believe my good fortune when Henry betrothed us...and then he showed me the missive from your father.</p> <p>\u201cIn that missive, not only did he repudiate your betrothal with Victor,\u201d Dirick said, unable to hold back a grin, \u201cbut he also requested that, if the king agreed, I should be your husband and Lord of Langumont.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cIt was my papa\u2019s wish that we should wed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady, and \u2019twas also the wish of my father that one of his sons should wed with you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I certainly remember that incident. I met your brother Bernard, and although he was very kind...\u201d Maris seemed to be considering her thoughts. \u201c...I do not think we would have suited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank fortune you did not,\u201d Dirick said vehemently. Then he smiled. \u201cHe and Joanna are like moon-faces about each other all of the time. Completely besotted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d she replied, with just as much spirit. \u201cBut of course, neither of us will ever look at the other in such a foolish way.\u201d</p><p>Dirick couldn\u2019t hold back a rueful laugh. \u201cMayhap that is true for you, my beloved, but I fear \u2019tis too late for me. The queen has already seen my moon-face, and it is because of her meddling, I think, that we are in this bed together.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks pinkened and she looked up at him almost bashfully. Then her eyes glinted with determination. \u201cOur fathers have exacted a sort of revenge upon Michael d\u2019Arcy, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, they have. Yet, I still must see this through to its end,\u201d he told her firmly.</p><p>\u201cDirick, you must take care...please,\u201d she looked up at him so earnestly and sweetly, with tears pooling in her eyes, that he felt his heart jerk at the emotion there.</p><p>\u201cAye, my love, I will take care. After all,\u201d he pulled her fingers to his lips, \u201cI have everything to live for. I have everything I could ever want. It is a miracle to me. And I have no intention of letting it go.\u201d</p> <p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Two days later</p><p>Langumont Keep</p><p>\u201cCome, my love.\u201d Michael grasped Allegra\u2019s hand and drew her up the tall, curving stairwell.</p><p>She followed him willingly\u2014as she had ever done, and always would, until the end of time.</p><p>The tower was cool and damp. It was a part of the keep that she rarely accessed, and which normally sent chills down her spine...but today, it didn\u2019t matter. Today, she was with Michael.</p><p>Her skirt trailed in the dust as they clambered up more steps and more steps, holding hands, silent.</p><p>When they reached the top, he opened the door and allowed her to step out onto the balcony of the tower ahead of him. She felt his strong, sturdy body behind her, solid and fearless in its warmth. The wind was stronger at this height, and the view of the blue sea sparkling to the west was expansive. The sound of the surf was lost in the breeze, lending a hollow, windy sound and giving the impression that they were separated from the rest of the world.</p> <p>They were.</p><p>She looked over the lands of Langumont, seeing the village, the bailey of the keep below, noticing the thickness of the forest to the east and the varying shades of green meadow to the north and south.</p><p>She\u2019d been happy here.</p><p>Though her heart had always been with Michael, she\u2019d been happy. Merle had been a good husband to her. She had betrayed him in so many ways, and now he was dead...by the hand of the man she loved.</p><p>Michael had told her of his part in Merle\u2019s death...yet, she still loved him. \u2019Twas her great sin, her great weakness that she would follow him willingly, anywhere, until the end of time.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened?\u201d he asked suddenly, his voice rumbling in her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhen I am with you\u2014nay, never,\u201d she told him, turning to face him. They could not be together here, she knew. This was their only chance.</p><p>\u201cCome, Allegra, let us go.\u201d</p><p>He took her hands in his, facing her fully, and looking down at her with those blue eyes lit with an odd, unsettling light.</p><p>She moved willingly with him to the edge of the tower\u2019s railing, stepping up on it in tandem with him. \u201cI love you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>And then it was over. </p> </body></html>"]
