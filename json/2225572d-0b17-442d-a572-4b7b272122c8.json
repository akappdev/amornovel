The man with her saw her shiver and gently put his arm around her, sending an electric jolt of anticipation through her.</p><p>She laughed softly, slightly giddy from the dirty martinis he had bought for her all night. He\u2019d actually taken her to Bemelmans Bar in the Carlyle Hotel; it was possibly the most romantic place she had ever been, complete with live piano music and a sophisticated, old-fashioned ambiance that had seduced her just as completely as he had.</p><p>He was witty and charming, and he was good-looking and chivalrous almost to a fault. He hadn\u2019t even stolen a kiss yet.</p> <p>Allison smiled as she remembered how he\u2019d taken her up to the murals that lined the walls of Bemelmans and told her about them; how some writer who had lived in the hotel had painted them and they\u2019d been part of some children\u2019s books. She had tried to listen, but she had only been able to concentrate on his hand, resting just a little lower on her back than it had been earlier in the evening, and his lips moving next to her cheek as he spoke. She only remembered that the paintings were of animals in Central Park. There had been an elephant skating. And he had pointed out an armed rabbit stalking its fellow bunnies with an automatic weapon in one of the cartoon-like murals.</p><p>They\u2019d both laughed at the morbid humor of it, and Allison loved the way he laughed.</p><p>Now, he was walking her home, like a true gentleman. He had asked the cab driver to stop several blocks away from her building to have the privilege of doing so. It was only their first date, and Allison couldn\u2019t believe that she was going to do what she was planning.</p><p>\u201cDo you ... would you ... I mean, would you like to come up? For coffee, or ....\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and Allison was lost in the way it made his eyes warmer.</p> <p>He reached up and ran his hands through her hair, watching the way the blond strands glimmered in the artificial light of the street lamps.</p><p>\u201cIs your roommate home?\u201d he asked her softly, his intimate voice cutting through the chilly wind and right into her.</p><p>She licked her lips and nodded. \u201cBut she won\u2019t bother us,\u201d she insisted quickly, her words almost breathless as she reached out and smoothed her hand over his lapel, feeling his badge under the material.</p><p>\u201cThen lead the way,\u201d he murmured with a smile.</p><p>It would have been the perfect time for him to kiss her, she thought, as she took his hand and led him into the building. It would have been just as ridiculously romantic as the rest of the night. But, she supposed, nothing could be perfect.</p><p>Hours later, as Allison struggled for her last breath, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019d never kissed her because it would leave his DNA behind.</p> <p>THE phone call could not have come at a worse time. FBI Special Agent Ty Grady was still pissed off and cursing about its unfortunate timing two days later as he sat alone in his living room.</p><p>Four weeks of undercover work\u2014round-the-clock surveillance, phone taps, wires, bribing informants, and some high-speed tailing\u2014all shot to shit because some rookie hotshot forgot to leave his cell phone at home.</p><p>Bums begging on the street do not ring to the tune of a Mozart orchestra, and unfortunately for the team of tired undercover FBI agents tailing Antonio de la Vega, their target was aware of that particular bit of random information.</p><p>He\u2019d disappeared just as quickly as the rats on the New York sidewalks as Ty and his team had scrambled.</p><p>The operation had been blown, their target was now in some other country where they had no jurisdiction, and all their evidence would be bagged, tagged, and stuffed in a box in a basement, never to be seen again.</p><p>The fact that most of what they\u2019d done had been under Ty\u2019s direction and slightly irregular, depending on a high-profile collar in order to keep them from getting their asses fired and thrown in jail, was not helping Ty\u2019s mental state.</p><p>He sprawled on his sofa, still covered in sweat from his attempts to work out his frustration at the Bureau\u2019s Baltimore gym, and stared out at the city through the large windows on either side of the television. He could see his own reflection in the black screen of the plasma TV on the opposite wall, and he looked even more exhausted than he felt. He needed a shave; most of his handsome face was covered in three days\u2019 worth of beard, and his dark hair could probably use a trim. He was a large man, nearly three inches over six feet, and he usually carried his frame like a large cat, lithe and easy.</p><p>Tonight, though, there was a slump to his broad shoulders as he sprawled. He had no intention of moving any time soon.</p> <p>Not until his cell phone began to trill demandingly. With a heavy sigh, he snapped it off his waistband and flipped it open. \u201cGrady,\u201d he answered curtly, his West Virginia drawl still pronounced after all the years he\u2019d spent away from home.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Grady, Assistant Director Burns would like to see you,\u201d a clipped, professional voice informed him.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Ty asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Grady, the Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigations Branch does not call to make appointments. He expects you in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes!\u201d Ty blurted. \u201cDo you have any idea where I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dirty underwear, no doubt. Be here in thirty,\u201d the voice answered in the same flat, businesslike tone before hanging up.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and mentally kicked something. Thirty minutes to get into DC was going to require the flashy blue lights. Ty fucking hated the flashy blue lights.</p><p>\u201cGREAT job, Special Agent Garrett. You are a credit to the Bureau,\u201d the Division Director said as he shook the man\u2019s hand. \u201cA commendation will go in your file for your work, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d FBI Special Agent Zane Garrett answered curtly as the other agents murmured quiet, slightly reluctant congratulations.</p><p>\u201cAnd I get to reward you for your work well-done,\u201d the Director continued smoothly. \u201cYou\u2019re being promoted out of the division. I\u2019m very sad to see you go,\u201d he said smoothly, still pumping Zane\u2019s hand vigorously.</p><p>Zane shook his hand somberly, his face a mask of pure professionalism that covered the brutally honest thoughts he harbored beneath it. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed working for you, sir. But you know me; always looking to be where I can do the most for the Bureau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good man. Say goodbye and get yourself upstairs. Assistant Director Burns wants to see you in ten.\u201d</p><p>Showing no hint of a smile\u2014or the disdain for the praise over doing his boring-ass desk job\u2014Zane turned and walked through the other agents he\u2019d worked with in the division that pursued cybercrimes. He\u2019d gotten along with them fairly well, considering he did his job, and sometimes theirs as well, with complete and utter focus. Zane knew many of his co-workers were just as happy to see him go as stay; his strict adherence to the rules and logical, single-minded work to achieve his goals were often tiring to those around him. He had goals, several of them, and they were all that mattered.</p><p>None of them included working with this division any longer than necessary.</p><p>Looking around the open office, Zane knew with complete certainty he wouldn\u2019t miss it. While his obsessive attention to detail had steered him perfectly while on these assignments, he knew he was worth far more to the Bureau than serving on this mind-numbing, numbers-crunching detail. Now he would get his chance to prove it.</p><p>Shaking some hands and enduring a few \u201cso sorry to see you go\u201d</p><p>back slaps, he waved off his soon-to-be-former co-workers, told the office administrator he would be back later to clear out his desk, and walked out the door. He looked forward to seeing what the Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Branch had in store for him. He had worked damn hard for this promotion. It had to be good, since the man wanted to see him immediately.</p><p>Zane stopped into the bathroom to straighten his tie and check to make sure his close-cropped brown hair lay down neatly. The suit he wore was sharply tailored to his 6\u20195\u201d frame, but it didn\u2019t hide the bulky muscles that moved under the fabric. His was not a body you\u2019d expect to see riding a desk, a fact he was reminded of daily looking at the slightly pudgy agents who worked around him. He frowned slightly, surveying the crow\u2019s-feet at the corners of his eyes and the ridges of his twice-broken nose. With a displeased twitch, he ran his hands over his close-shaven cheeks and dismissed his image before buttoning his suit jacket and heading upstairs.</p><p>THE secretary gave Ty Grady a look over her glasses that clearly said she disapproved of the air he breathed. She lifted her chin and looked him up and down, wrinkling her nose at his appearance. \u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d she announced with a touch of surprise to her voice.</p><p>Ty looked her up and down in return and cocked his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cI used the flashy blue lights,\u201d he told her with a helicopter motion of his finger.</p><p>She sniffed as she glanced over his unshaven face, scuffed leather jacket, jeans, and dirty cowboy boots. His T-shirt seemed to be particularly appalling to her sensibilities, even though it was clean. It was black and had the words Cocke County FBI in large white print on the front. Upon closer inspection, there were smaller words between the larger ones, and when she squinted she was able to read the entire shirt: \u201cI was probed in Cocke County by the FBI.\u201d She made a small, insulted noise as she looked back up at him.</p><p>Ty ignored her, leaving her looking slightly scandalized as he headed for the Assistant Director\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cYou can't go in there yet!\u201d she hissed as she stood from her desk and pointed at him.</p><p>He stopped at the door and turned around to look at her, blatantly putting his hand on the door handle and pushing it down with a smirk. Her mouth worked soundlessly, and she turned and scrambled for her intercom to announce him before he could get inside.</p><p>Assistant Director Richard Burns looked up at him in surprise and annoyance as Ty stepped into the office and closed the door behind him. \u201cYou wanted to see me, sir,\u201d Ty greeted, the words perfectly professional, but the tone somehow just as insolent as it always was.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d the man ordered with a jab of his pen at one of the seats across from his desk. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for one more person.\u201d</p><p>Ty moved to the seat and sat, his leather jacket sending up a tiny little cloud of dust as he flopped into the seat. He did a fairly good job of concealing his surprise. \u201cSomeone else?\u201d he inquired evenly. \u201cAm I being lynched?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you keep your mouth shut for the next thirty minutes, you may not spend the night in jail. How about that?\u201d Burns answered seriously without looking up from the papers he was signing.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and shifted uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>ZANE Garrett entered the wide outer office to see the Assistant Director\u2019s secretary scurrying around her desk, obviously flustered. He paused, folding his hands behind his back. \u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d he asked politely when she didn\u2019t notice his entrance.</p><p>She looked up at him in surprise. \u201cSpecial Agent Garrett, thank you for being prompt,\u201d she said, looking him up and down and nodding in approval of the tailored blue suit and silk tie. \u201cYou may go in now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said evenly, proceeding to the door as she announced him through the intercom.</p><p>Burns looked up from the papers he was shuffling and gestured him in. \u201cCome in, Special Agent Garrett. We\u2019ve got some things to thrash out,\u201d he said to Zane, with a narrow-eyed look at the man sitting slumped in a chair in front of the desk.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Zane answered, moving to sit as the Director gestured. His eyes followed Burns\u2019 gaze. Only a blink betrayed Zane\u2019s surprise. The unkempt man sitting opposite Burns was a complete mess. Zane barely restrained the urge to sneer at him. Maybe he was an informant of some sort.</p><p>He had that burnt-out, fidgety look to him.</p><p>Focusing on Burns again, Zane waited, composed and attentive, ready to start jumping through the next set of hoops.</p><p>Ty shifted in his seat, slouching further down and glancing over at the new man. God, the guy looked like he had just come off a printing press or something. \u201cWhat are you doing, a how-to manual?\u201d Ty asked the Assistant Director sarcastically. \u201cBefore and after?\u201d he suggested wryly with a gesture at himself and then at the other man.</p><p>\u201cYes. You are sitting here before you get fired,\u201d Burns answered studiously. \u201cAnd he is taking your job after you leave.\u201d</p><p>Ty pressed his lips tightly together and looked down at the shiny desktop sedately. Zane shifted his eyes between the man and Burns before narrowing them. He wondered why he had been asked to sit in on this meeting when the guy was obviously being fired. It seemed overly cruel. He clamped down hard on any further reaction and waited to see what would happen.</p><p>Ty licked his lips and looked up again to meet his superior\u2019s eyes almost defiantly.</p><p>\u201cFortunately for you, Grady, you have more lives than a cat,\u201d the man said to him with a small frown. \u201cAnd you\u2019re getting another chance to prove to us that you can do this job without blowing shit up. I won\u2019t say one more, because God knows I\u2019ll just keep giving you more until you get yourself killed. Meet your new partner, Special Agent Zane Z. Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t have been more appalled, and it showed clearly in his reaction. This wreck of an agent was his new partner? \u201cDirector Burns,\u201d he started impulsively, but he caught his tongue and tightened his grip on the chair. What kind of reward was this?</p><p>\u201cThe hell he is!\u201d Ty interrupted as he sat up straight. \u201cI can\u2019t do my job with a ... a ... poster-boy partner,\u201d he practically stuttered angrily as he flopped his hand toward the squeaky-clean man next to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t do it without a partner, either, Special Agent Grady,\u201d</p><p>Burns responded with a hard glare.</p><p>\u201cSir, it seems obvious,\u201d Zane said, not bothering to keep any edge of disapproval out of his voice, \u201cthat this agent needs more than I can possibly provide to help him. Frankly, it will take a miracle to make him even remotely professional. No one will take him seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake me seriously?\u201d Ty echoed in disbelief. \u201cChrist, have those shoes ever even seen pavement? Shit,\u201d he exclaimed in a sudden panic as he gripped the arms of his chair and leaned forward. \u201cAre you sending me to Cyber?\u201d he asked Burns, who was sitting behind the desk and grinning like a small child at Christmas.</p><p>\u201cYour tone of voice implies that investigating technological crime and terrorism might be below you,\u201d Zane said to him coldly as he leveled an even gaze on the other agent. \u201cPerhaps you should consider requesting a transfer to professional staff. Or submitting your resignation altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, fuck you, candy ass,\u201d Ty snarled without looking over at him.</p><p>\u201cQuiet, both of you!\u201d Burns barked suddenly. \u201cGrady, you\u2019re staying in Criminal until you get your ass killed or do something so illegal even I can\u2019t cover for you, understand? Garrett, you\u2019re to make certain he doesn\u2019t do either of those things. Is that clear? And you will both like it.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes widened as he realized he was being assigned a bookkeeping babysitter, and there wasn\u2019t a damned thing he could do about it.</p> <p>His stomach turned at the thought, but he supposed it was better than being fired. Or being in jail.</p><p>The thought of being attached to this troublemaking loose cannon was nearly enough to make Zane lose his composure. After all he\u2019d done, all he\u2019d worked for, this was all he was going to get. Despair threatened for a moment, and he had to take a deep breath to push it aside. He wanted to rail at Burns, but it wasn\u2019t his place to object. He\u2019d make the best of this clusterfuck, and then leave this agent behind, just as he had the Cyber Division. That or go down in spectacular flames.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he acknowledged through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cI expect you to learn from each other,\u201d Burns instructed, his heart going out to Zane Garrett. It was a shitty thing to do to him, sticking him with a man like Ty Grady after he\u2019d worked his way back up from hell to be Cyber\u2019s top performing agent. But for this particular case, these two men were unusually qualified. \u201cAnd the Bureau expects you to perform efficiently on your next assignment,\u201d he added as he tossed a file across the desk at Ty.</p><p>\u201cRespectfully, sir, I understand you need someone riding herd on this</p><p>... agent,\u201d Zane gritted out. \u201cBut what am I supposed to learn from him?\u201d he asked, slanting a disbelieving look Grady\u2019s way.</p> <p>Burns gave Ty a dubious glance and then shrugged apologetically in answer to Zane\u2019s query. He was well-acquainted with Garrett\u2019s past, but the man was resourceful. He\u2019d had to be. He\u2019d find a way to make this work.</p><p>\u201cYou can learn to kiss my ass,\u201d Ty shot back as he fumbled with the file his boss had chucked at him. \u201cJust like you do everyone else\u2019s,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Zane\u2019s temper lightened in the face of Grady\u2019s ridiculous assertions, leaving behind more than a trace of resentment. He would have rolled his eyes if he weren\u2019t aware of how it might be construed. The man\u2019s language was complete and purposeful insubordination. It looked like his new partner was a real prize, one that had somehow gained the favor of the Assistant Director of his new division\u2014just as he himself was the focus of Burns\u2019 ire.</p><p>\u201cSir, if I may ask, who is this delightful new person I'll be calling my partner?\u201d he asked, the sarcasm thinly veiled.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent B. Tyler Grady,\u201d Burns answered as Ty scanned the file he had flipped open, ignoring them both as he looked through it. \u201cDespite his appearance, he is unfortunately very good at his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting us on the Tri-State case?\u201d Ty asked suddenly, utter disbelief coloring his words as he looked up at Burns.</p><p>Zane stiffened and inhaled sharply. He knew all about the Tri-State case. Hell, everyone in the Bureau knew all about the Tri-State case, even though they had only been working it for a few weeks. A really messy, really conniving, really frightening serial killer kept popping up and going to ground every few weeks\u2014for almost two months now\u2014in New York City. Two bodies were found just across state lines, near the Tri-State marker, and most involved seemed to think the killer deliberately left them there to involve the FBI. Most recently, just days ago, the man took out two of their own agents, so the Bureau was now more personally invested.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes shifted back to Grady. Very good at his job, Burns had said. Zane decided it must have been undercover work. Drugs or organized crime, maybe import/export. Somewhere that rough-and-tumble image would fit in. His mind started to buzz, calculating how their skill sets might complement each other. Or not.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Burns answered with a tap of his pen on his desk.</p><p>\u201cAnd you will report to the New York field office\u2014appropriately attired, Grady\u2014at eleven-hundred Monday. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Recognizing the dismissal and standing, Zane nodded. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said curtly. Zane\u2019s most recent tour may have been spent in a high-tech computer lab, but that wasn\u2019t all he could do. He was a damn good agent, and he knew it. But he couldn\u2019t help thinking of Tyler Grady as a snake that might strike at a critical moment and poison his fragile job security. He could already tell this wasn\u2019t going to be easy. Actually, he could already tell it was going to be beyond hard as hell. But while there was the chance that one whiff of the bat could collapse his carefully reconstructed career like a house of cards, he also had a prime opportunity here. If he could make this work it would send him a long way. And he wouldn\u2019t let any scruffy agent who fancied himself a badass get in his way.</p><p>Ty sat and stared at Burns for a long moment before standing and stepping toward the desk. He put two hands on the desk and leaned over, crumpling the file in his hand as he glared down at his boss. \u201cYou know me better than this, Dick,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMy partners don\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one had better,\u201d Burns responded without blinking at the insubordinate tone.</p><p>\u201cYou promised me,\u201d Ty murmured accusingly.</p><p>\u201cConsider it recanted,\u201d Burns replied unapologetically. \u201cGo home and shower, Ty. You fucking stink.\u201d</p><p>The voices were low, but Zane heard enough. Burns\u2019 parting shot was clear, and Zane\u2019s lips twitched as he turned to lead the way. This Ty Grady must be some kind of special superstar for the Assistant Director to put up with that behavior. That or he was blowing someone further up the chain, Zane thought uncharitably. He allowed himself a slight grimace when he stopped in the outer office. He\u2019d heard the same rumors about himself at one time. More than a few times.</p><p>Ty followed him and glared at Zane for a long moment as the secretary sniffed disapprovingly at him. \u201cSooner we get this over with, sooner we can go back to how it was. Got it?\u201d he finally said to his new partner.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t dignify the utterance with a reply. \u201cMay I see the case file, please?\u201d he asked civilly.</p><p>\u201cGet your own,\u201d Ty answered as he turned and stalked out of the office.</p><p>Zane stood there for a moment, mouth slightly agape. Ty Grady was a rude, insufferable, egotistical, stinking son of a bitch, and Zane was going to need to figure out how to tune him out. Otherwise, he just might give in to the pressure and kill the bastard, for the good of humanity.</p><p>TY sat at the all-night diner near his apartment and read the file for the fourteenth time as he poked at his bacon and eggs. The papers had greasy fingerprints on them, and a few smudges that weren\u2019t identifiable, but Ty didn\u2019t notice. What he was seeing were the facts of the case. It was one of the most fascinating cases he\u2019d ever read about, much less been involved in. The killer seemed to pick his targets at random; there was no victim type at all. He had no MO to speak of, and he left little to no evidence behind. The current belief was that the little evidence that had been collected was left intentionally, and the scenes where the bodies were found were certainly staged.</p><p>Eight murders and counting. The only two that hadn\u2019t been positioned after death (or killed creatively, as Ty thought of it) were the two FBI agents who had been investigating the murders. Two trained agents, both with military backgrounds, shot point-blank in their hotel room before either man could even fire a weapon. And the only reason the Bureau attributed their deaths to the killer was because they were working on his case, and the FBI didn\u2019t believe in coincidences.</p><p>Ty shook his head and sighed, glancing at his watch with a blink.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groaned, digging in his pocket for money to leave on the table as he gathered his highly classified information and unceremoniously stuffed it under his jacket. He had things to do tomorrow\u2014 today, really\u2014before he had to fly out early Monday morning.</p><p>ZANE sat at his dining room table, a whole stack of copied files spread out in front of him. Case details, reports, autopsy recalls, scene photographs, forensic evidence ... there was so much to read through, so many details.</p><p>Details that caught and filtered through Zane\u2019s analytical mind. He\u2019d been sifting through notes for hours trying to identify patterns, not in the case itself, but in the standard structure of investigation: where it was followed precisely, where it differed, where there were gaps in the investigation, where there was too much useless information. There\u2019d been so many people on this job that it was already a mess.</p><p>All of that, he thought, as he shifted to take a bite of a late Sunday dinner of chicken and grape salad, was easy enough to track. He\u2019d already decided to give a few specialty agents a call to ask questions; maybe Serena Scott in New York\u2019s Behavior Analysis Unit could help. She looked at murders all the time, and although this case was driving them crazy, she could explain some things for Zane. Murder wasn\u2019t exactly his forte. Plus, she owed him a favor.</p><p>A man didn\u2019t work at the FBI for nearly twenty years and not collect favors.</p><p>Sighing, he pushed away the coroner\u2019s reports comparison chart he\u2019d made and carried his bowl to the kitchen sink, washing it out carefully before wiping the counter down. He glanced at the clock on the wall, straightened his shoulders, and cracked his neck. He\u2019d have to leave extra early to get from Arlington to Dulles by 0530 to catch the plane. And he\u2019d need every bit of patience and fortitude he could scrape up to get through what he knew was coming.</p><p>IT was a commercial flight, and the tickets were waiting for them at the airline\u2019s front desk. Ty rolled his head from side to side and loosened his tie, grumbling unhappily as he walked in the hazy predawn through the parking 12</p><p>lot. He had his suit jacket over one arm and two duffel bags of clothing and gear slung over his shoulder. He carried a beaten and scarred leather satchel by a strap across his chest as he walked. He was running just a little late, but he wasn\u2019t exactly worried about it. When he got inside, his tie askew and his suit coat wrinkled, he finally pulled the satchel over his head and plunked everything down to shrug into the jacket. He then hefted everything again, repositioned the bags, and made his way to the check-in desk.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be late,\u201d Zane commented as Ty walked past him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I knew you\u2019d still have that stick up your ass,\u201d Ty responded with a shake of his head, not slowing as Zane spoke to him.</p><p>Ty\u2019s smart-ass response didn\u2019t rate a reply. Zane waited for him to get his ticket and check his bags before falling in beside him to walk to security.</p><p>They\u2019d met a total of two times now, and Zane had the same fleeting impression: Ty was an asshole who\u2019d been lucky enough in the red zone to make it this far. And the Bureau wanted him to be lucky some more, but they didn\u2019t want to risk anything going wrong (because Ty was so very obviously insane), and that was why the very efficient Zane Garrett was charged with holding his leash.</p><p>It made Zane tired just thinking about it.</p><p>They showed their identification and were waved through security after a brief check. Still thinking about Ty\u2019s shit-for-attitude, Zane amused himself by thinking about what Ty must have had to do to pass muster. All agents went through the academy\u2019s sixteen-week New Agents Training Unit, and then they were farmed out and specialized. Because of his background, Zane excelled in the finer points of the law. Layers of information. Patterns.</p><p>Details. Puzzles. It surprised people that Zane had a brain to go with his brawn, and he\u2019d used it to his benefit many times.</p><p>Way back when, the Bureau assigned him to the Criminal Investigation Division of the Criminal Investigations Branch, working on financial crime. As he got more cases under his belt, he shifted to organized crime and informant matters, which put him into a brief stint in undercover work. Several personal and professional swerves and wild dives later, he was moved out of the CID and into the Cyber Division, digging up and dusting off those old pattern and detail skills to reestablish himself and hopefully polish his very tarnished reputation. He tried not to think about that tarnish often.</p><p>He was starting to suspect Ty Grady possessed a completely different set of specializations, and Zane was absolutely sure that they wouldn\u2019t mesh with his own. Looking over his new partner, Zane decided immediately that Ty obviously wouldn\u2019t have any trouble with the physical side of the job. He was an inch or two shorter than Zane, but his muscle weight probably equaled Zane\u2019s own. He was physically impressive, no doubt, and together they were clearly intimidating as they walked through the terminal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was the mental aspects of Ty\u2019s abilities that Zane pondered almost gleefully as they moved. Zane wondered if Ty would even be able to handle any of it, or if that was why Zane had been partnered with the guy; to be the brains of the operation, so to speak.</p><p>\u201cListen up, \u2019cause I'm only gonna say this once,\u201d Ty muttered as they walked to their gate. \u201cI don\u2019t talk when I fly. I sleep. And I don\u2019t listen when I eat, understand? I don\u2019t wanna be buddies. I don\u2019t wanna chat,\u201d he said with a sarcastic lilt to the word. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna know about your childhood or how your momma whipped you with a rubber glove or how much therapy you had to go through \u2019cause you flunked out of preschool. I don\u2019t wanna hear about how you want to be Director someday or how many collars you got chasin\u2019</p><p>those Internet freaks or how proud you are of your bowel movements. I don\u2019t wanna go shopping at Barney\u2019s with you, and I\u2019m not gonna help you pick out your ties to match your socks and, I swear to God, if you get me shot, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p> <p>As he followed the other agent onto the plane and found his seat, stoic demeanor in place, Zane couldn\u2019t decide whether to be offended, upset, or just sad. Punching his new partner would likely not be condoned, and he wasn\u2019t sure Grady wouldn\u2019t give as good as he got just to cause a scene. But what a miserable life the man must have. Well, he wasn\u2019t the only one who had had it hard. Zane tried hard to sublimate the anger that line of thought caused, but so far, Ty just made him want to reach out and throttle the shit out of him.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t the Bureau just love that?</p><p>He decided it was best\u2014for all parties involved\u2014to ignore the man beside him. He went ahead and pulled out the comparative chart he\u2019d made of the coroner\u2019s information with notes all over it in his tiny, crablike handwriting. At least some of the time could be well-spent.</p><p>Ty sighed heavily as he flopped into his seat and shook his head as he dug out the seat belt. His brand new partner had failed the first test. Anyone who would quietly take the vitriol he had just spewed without so much as a</p><p>\u201cfuck you\u201d in return was nothing but a brown-nosing ladder-climber who should have been riding a desk or working in the civilian market. At least his last partner had given as good as he got, he thought with a wince.</p> <p>Zane heard the annoyed exhalation and ignored it. He gritted his teeth and wished there was some way to get out of this assignment. It was going to 14</p><p>be an utter debacle, and he likely wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it. He wondered what ninth level of clerking hell he would be demoted to if this went wrong, or what type of civilian job he could get after he was kicked out of the Bureau. That upset him more than anything, thinking of all the years going to waste.</p><p>The flight was only about an hour long, and Ty planned to sit there and sleep the entire fucking way. The kid kicking the seat behind him was the only thing keeping him awake as the plane taxied down the runway. He turned around and peered through the coach seats, his hazel eyes piercing the kid as he narrowed them.</p><p>\u201cKick it one more time, and I\u2019ll rip your toes off and eat \u2019em,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cHave some decency,\u201d Zane chastised as his head turned to the side to check the situation. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta be three. He doesn\u2019t know any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does now,\u201d Ty countered as he turned back around and settled into his seat contentedly. Behind him a horrified young mother was holding her son\u2019s toes and gaping, wide-eyed and speechless.</p> <p>\u201cYou have absolutely no people skills,\u201d Zane muttered, shaking his head. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re sinking fast in the Bureau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a real anchor,\u201d Ty drawled as he leaned his head back and smiled. \u201cI hear no one else will work with you.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips pressed together slightly and he didn\u2019t look up from his paperwork. \u201cYou should have your hearing checked,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cMy hearing\u2019s just fine, Skippy. You were \u2018promoted,\u2019 right?\u201d Ty asked sarcastically, giving the word quotations with his fingers without opening his eyes. \u201cHate to tell you, Sport, but being transferred to another division in the same level ain\u2019t a promotion. It\u2019s called shuffling the unwanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReliable information, I\u2019m sure, from someone on a landslide down the ladder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both seem to be on the slip \u2018n\u2019 slide to the gutter, Shuffleboard,\u201d</p><p>Ty observed happily. \u201cDifference is, I don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d he offered as he reached up and turned off the overhead light and adjusted the cool air blowing down on him.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t reply, instead closing his eyes for a moment to swallow down on the flare of annoyance. It was true. Ty didn\u2019t give a shit. But Zane did, which meant they were destined to be at each other\u2019s throats the whole time they were forced to work together.</p> <p>Ty merely snickered quietly, knowing he had hit a chord. This could provide some amusement after all, he decided, even if they did end up killing each other.</p><p>Zane focused again on the notes. The rest of the flight passed in silence. Details about the deaths bounced around in his head, not really settling into any sort of pattern yet. He would dig the photos out and study them once they got settled. Maybe he could get a feeling for each victim.</p><p>He glanced up when the seat-belt light went on, and he looked over at Ty unhappily. The other man had dozed lightly in expectation of the long day ahead, and Zane decided that Ty sleeping was him at his most charming. But now he had to wake him up.</p><p>\u201cGrady,\u201d he muttered, voice clipped.</p><p>\u201cNot again, sugar, m\u2019tired,\u201d Ty muttered as he flopped onto his side and jostled them both in the cramped seats.</p><p>Unamused, Zane pushed against the other man. \u201cGrady,\u201d he said more insistently. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>Ty huffed and opened his eyes slowly, looking around sleepily.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>Zane looked down at him, mildly surprised by the momentary drop in the rough attitude. \u201cWe\u2019re getting ready to land,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Ty groaned softly and rolled onto his back again. He stretched his arms high over his head, yawning as he turned his body slightly and reached one arm way out into the aisle. The air hostess who was making her last check down the aisle walked right into his hand and gasped as he grabbed her. Ty dropped his arms and twisted to look up at her. \u201cSorry, sweetheart,\u201d he offered with a small, unrepentant smile.</p><p>She huffed slightly and gave him a wry smile as she turned in the aisle. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse,\u201d she murmured in response as she bent and slowly buckled his seat belt for him. \u201cPut yourself in the upright position, please,\u201d</p><p>she said to him softly before moving away. Ty raised his seat obediently and grinned, watching her with a contented smirk as she turned and continued on down the aisle.</p><p>While Zane silently envied Ty\u2019s free attitude and behavior, in the end, he just couldn\u2019t believe the man\u2019s gall. \u201cHow did you become such a total ass?\u201d he asked, morbidly curious.</p><p>Ty cocked his head and watched the woman until she took her seat, then turned to look at Zane. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d he insisted innocently. \u201cC</p><p>cups can get in the way.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s look was patently disbelieving. \u201cI think you decide what a perfectly polite person would do and then do the absolute opposite. It\u2019s like it\u2019s your life\u2019s goal to be the Antichrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Antichrist,\u201d Ty echoed, laughing as he shook his head. \u201cYeah. I bet you were head of the Drama Club in school, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lord knows I mean everything I say,\u201d Ty responded with mock sincerity, pressing his hand to his heart and leaning closer to Zane earnestly.</p><p>\u201cYou just have that look,\u201d Zane confirmed, face stilled to passivity.</p><p>Ty chuckled and turned to look back at the front of the plane as the wheels squealed on the tarmac and the plane decelerated rapidly. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to dislodge that stick up your ass pretty damn quick if we\u2019re going to be working together,\u201d he added as the plane taxied to their gate. He unbuckled before the seat-belt light went off and rolled his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Afraid it\u2019s catching?\u201d Zane asked. His patience was already wearing thin. He didn\u2019t have the time or the luxury to deal with Ty\u2019s antics.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not afraid of turning into you,\u201d Ty answered wryly, laughing softly as he shook his head. He leaned closer to Zane, almost close enough to touch his cheek with his nose. \u201cYou smell like Feeb,\u201d he explained in a low, serious voice. He was probably one of the only FBI agents who would actually utter the derogatory term other agencies used when talking about them.</p><p>When Zane turned his gaze on the other agent, his eyes glinted dangerously. His voice was frigid. \u201cI bet you get off on it.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled slowly, his eyes glittering mischievously. \u201cIf I did, would you change?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Zane merely shook his head as if he felt sorry for the other man, deciding not to comment as he stood. The words on his tongue were certainly ungracious and unbecoming, and he couldn\u2019t afford it being reported. Not that his would rival Ty\u2019s behavior.</p><p>Ty shrugged and stretched to retrieve his satchel from the overhead bin. He didn\u2019t say another word as he followed the short line to the front of the plane and the exit. The stewardess stood there, smiling and saying goodbye to each passenger, and when Ty came up to her he grinned widely and nodded at her cheekily.</p><p>\u201cYou have a nice stay in New York, sir,\u201d she said to him as she reached out and took his hand, discreetly pressing a piece of paper into his palm.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s getting nicer already,\u201d Ty responded brightly as he lingered there for a moment, looking her over rakishly, and then moved on to the exit.</p><p>\u201cAnd just how is your image supposed to represent the Bureau better than mine?\u201d Zane asked under his breath as they walked toward the concourse.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Ty answered over his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole damn point, Shuffleboard.\u201d</p><p>With his long legs, Zane easily caught up to walk alongside him. \u201cSo why the hell work for the Bureau at all if you don\u2019t give a damn?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I ain\u2019t in it for the status,\u201d Ty answered blithely.</p><p>Zane stopped in his tracks, looking at Ty\u2019s back with real hatred. The implication that the glory was Zane\u2019s reason for working at the Bureau was way the hell over the line. He watched him walk away and seriously, seriously considered calling Burns and accepting whatever fucking demotion it would take to not have to deal with this bastard. His temper was already roiling, and that was not good. Not good at all. His hand clenched on his briefcase for a long moment as he stamped down on the anger, watching Ty walk toward the exit.</p><p>Ty knew Zane had fallen away, but he didn\u2019t stop walking. If the dickhead wanted to sulk his way into being late for their meeting, that was his business. Ty was looking out for Number One. As always.</p><p>He also had a slightly more personal interest in this particular case.</p><p>Zane finally exited the main terminal and stepped out into the cool air as Ty was climbing into a black government Tahoe. Within a minute, he was seated inside as well, and the truck left the curb and pulled out into the airport traffic.</p><p>Ty slumped in the backseat, trying to shake off the grogginess and think up new ways to annoy his new partner. He looked at the driver in the rearview mirror, seeing brown eyes and high cheekbones and short, curly hair.</p><p>This guy was too pretty to be an agent. And he looked like he was about fifteen. The light-haired man in the passenger seat looked even younger.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two, the Hardy Boys?\u201d he asked them with a huff.</p><p>Eyes flickering forward, Zane took in the two agents in front of them and frowned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very clever of you, sir,\u201d the driver responded dryly without taking his eyes off the road. \u201cI could point out that we\u2019re too young to know who the Hardy Boys are and make you feel very old,\u201d he added as his brown eyes glanced to the rearview mirror and looked back at Ty. \u201cBut I would never do that, sir.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched, but he didn\u2019t comment. His eyes displayed his amusement as he glanced a little more carefully over the two young men.</p><p>They were both very young, but Zane knew that experienced agents were practically being churned out of preschools these days.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to New York, Special Agent Garrett, Special Agent Grady,\u201d the passenger greeted as he turned slightly in his seat. \u201cI\u2019m Agent Mark Morrison, this is Agent Tim Henninger,\u201d he went on. His voice changed slightly to add a hint of sarcasm. \u201cWe\u2019re the lollipop boys sent to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes and examined Morrison and then Henninger slowly. He turned his head and glanced at Zane critically. \u201cI think that was supposed to be a cultural reference of some sort,\u201d he explained to his partner.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d he huffed.</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cBig surprise,\u201d he murmured, almost under his breath.</p><p>Morrison leaned around the seat to look back at them. \u201cWe\u2019ll be your escorts and New York Field Office contacts while you\u2019re here. We\u2019re on the way to the office now to meet the Special Agent in Charge. Can we stop anywhere on the way? Food? Drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you didn\u2019t pack your lunch?\u201d Ty asked sarcastically as he shifted around in the seat and wedged himself against the door. He kicked a foot up and propped it on the console between the two front seats.</p><p>\u201cSure, in my SpongeBob SquarePants lunch box. I have the thermos, too,\u201d Morrison shot right back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane kept his mouth shut, eyes moving between the two men, and occasionally back to the driver, who was casually paying attention.</p><p>Ty stared at the kid and narrowed his eyes further. \u201cSpongewhat?\u201d he asked flatly.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t even try to hold back the chuckle when Morrison looked at Ty like he\u2019d lost his mind.</p> <p>\u201cSpongewha ... you\u2019re yanking my chain, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Morrison said. \u201cHenny, he\u2019s yanking my chain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s what you getting for waving it in his face,\u201d the driver answered reasonably.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is a SpongeBob?\u201d Ty asked Zane quietly in the backseat.</p><p>Zane turned his chin, taking a moment to gauge if Ty was serious and if he\u2019d slam Zane for answering. \u201cIt\u2019s a cartoon character popular recently,\u201d</p><p>he answered, voice low. He could see the driver\u2019s eyes in the rearview mirror again, watching them. Examining them.</p> <p>Ty stared at Zane incredulously for a moment and then looked away with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you prefer Scooby Doo?\u201d Henninger offered politely.</p><p>\u201cMore like the Dark Knight,\u201d Zane muttered without thinking first.</p><p>Ty smirked and glanced over at the man. \u201cDoes that mean I can call you Robin from now on?\u201d he asked with an amused glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Boy Wonder to you,\u201d Zane answered flatly, turning to look out the window as Morrison stared at them both.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Ty grunted as he looked away again and propped his other foot up on the center console. \u201cYou\u2019re too easy,\u201d he grumbled disconsolately.</p> <p>Zane barely restrained a snicker as Morrison blinked. The young agent looked at his partner. \u201cWell, we got the right two guys,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>He turned to look back at the two older men suspiciously. \u201cThey told us this was your first time working together, and that you\u2019d probably not be too fond of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were right,\u201d Ty and Zane both answered, practically in unison.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty huffed at him.</p><p>\u201cGENTLEMEN, so glad you made it. Special Agent in Charge George McCarty. Nice to meet you both. Let\u2019s get on with this, shall we?\u201d the head of the New York Field Office greeted hurriedly without giving either of them a chance to respond in kind. He dropped a few files onto the table and adjusted his tie. \u201cI trust you\u2019re both familiar with the case? Good, then we can get on to your arrangements and right into it.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow at the whirlwind tour and glanced at Zane. Not noticing, Zane flipped open his file where he had a list of notes and questions, waiting for McCarty to continue.</p><p>\u201cAs we all know, this case has claimed two of our own,\u201d McCarty continued as he bent over the table and looked down at his file. \u201cWhich has made it of the highest priority. You\u2019ll be working alongside the other leads, Special Agents Sears and Ross. They couldn\u2019t be here this morning; they\u2019re still in the process of interviewing the staff from the hotel where Special Agents Sanchez and Reilly were found,\u201d he said tightly. He sighed briefly, as if the little speech were taking a lot out of him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be given a car and a driver, if you want one. We have booked you two adjoining rooms at the Tribeca Grand. It\u2019s within walking distance of the office here and has the highest security. All our records and resources are open to you, although I will tell you right now cooperation from your new teammates will likely be at a minimum despite my orders to work with you,\u201d he told them candidly, making no secret of the field office\u2019s bitter feelings toward anyone from outside being sent in to handle their cases. \u201cAny questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou provided the contact list, right?\u201d Zane asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in the file,\u201d McCarty answered with a nod. \u201cAnything you need during the course of your investigation is at your disposal, including the team Special Agents Reilly and Sanchez were using. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you found out how the killer knew where the agents were staying?\u201d Ty asked as he turned in his seat and propped his feet up on the chair next to him.</p><p>The Special Agent in Charge turned to one of the men at his side.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Morrison answered as if obeying the silent cue. He was the shorter of the Hardy Boys, but wiry, with spiked blond hair and bright blue eyes. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe it was an inside thing, though. We speculate he may have tailed them from one of the scenes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Serena Scott in town? I\u2019d like her opinions on the crime scenes,\u201d</p><p>Zane asked in reference to New York\u2019s head profiler.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve not brought her in on this one. Yet,\u201d Henninger answered.</p><p>Out of the truck, Zane could see the young agent was tall and lanky, and his short haircut couldn\u2019t restrain the dark curls that had to be natural. \u201cDid you want to meet with her personally?\u201d he asked with an indiscernible look at Ty.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Zane answered firmly. \u201cHer insight is invaluable, and some things just don\u2019t translate from paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll arrange the meeting ASAP,\u201d the man assured him, looking again at Ty almost questioningly.</p><p>Zane glanced at Ty to see if he had anything to add. His new partner was kicked back in his chair and staring up at the ceiling idly, a slight curl of distaste on his lip.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t need the driver. Thank you, sir,\u201d Zane said as he closed his file and stood.</p><p>\u201cYou need anything else, you just go through Agents Henninger or Morrison, here,\u201d McCarty said with a gesture of his thumb over his shoulder at no one in particular. \u201cThey\u2019ll get you anything you need,\u201d he assured them as the Hardy Boys nodded.</p><p>There was a discreet knock on the boardroom door, and McCarty straightened up and called out a curt \u201cEnter!\u201d</p><p>The receptionist stuck her head through the door. \u201cSir, the Assistant Director on line four for you and Special Agents Grady and Garrett. He says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Denise,\u201d McCarty grunted, and she withdrew silently.</p><p>McCarty watched the door until it clicked closed, and then he leaned forward and pressed a button on one of the units in the middle of the large boardroom table. \u201cRichard,\u201d he greeted.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, George,\u201d Dick Burns\u2019 voice said clearly over the speakerphone. \u201cI trust Grady and Garrett are there and already causing problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always did take the safe bet,\u201d McCarty responded wryly. \u201cI must repeat my disapproval of this little operation, Richard. I just don\u2019t believe one of my staff here is responsible for this madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand how difficult your position is, George,\u201d Burns responded easily. \u201cBut unfortunately, Director Radshaw and I disagree.\u201d</p><p>Behind McCarty, Henninger and Morrison both shifted uneasily and shared an indiscernible glance. Ty cocked his head, frowning slightly at the speakerphone. He wasn\u2019t liking the sound of this conversation, but he thought maybe he understood why they were here now. His sharp hazel eyes traveled up to observe McCarty curiously as the two men spoke over the phone.</p><p>McCarty sighed and looked up at Ty and Zane with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey look slightly confused, Dick,\u201d he told Burns with a hint of amusement.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Burns said loudly over the phone. \u201cI do apologize for not filling you in more completely while you were here, but the finer points were still being ironed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiner points?\u201d Zane asked, a bit peevish at being left out of the loop.</p><p>Ty rubbed his nose and squeezed his eyes closed. \u201cWhy do you always do this to me?\u201d he asked plaintively.</p><p>\u201cBecause I dislike you quite a lot,\u201d Burns told him in amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou will be working the Tri-State case,\u201d he went on without waiting for a response. \u201cYou will appear, to the members of the New York team, to be inexperienced, inept, and lackadaisical. If you happen to stumble across any leads, then good for you.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced over at Zane and smirked, restraining himself from commenting. Zane was hard-pressed not to sneer back at him.</p><p>\u201cOn the periphery, and more importantly to your own assignment, you will be concentrating not on the serial murders, but on the deaths of Special Agents Reilly and Sanchez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you suspect an inside job?\u201d Zane inquired quietly.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. We believe if we can uncover how the killer got to them, we\u2019ll have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd our parameters for operating?\u201d Ty asked eagerly as he sat forward, closer to the speakerphone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill each other,\u201d Burns ordered with a smile in his voice. \u201cAny future questions, you come directly to me. George is to be left out of the loop on the off chance he needs to deny knowledge of your operations,\u201d he added.</p><p>Ty and Zane both looked up at McCarty. The man did not look pleased, but it was obvious that he\u2019d already had words with Burns regarding the plan.</p><p>\u201cThat will be all, gentlemen. Good luck,\u201d Burns told them. \u201cGeorge, give my love to your girls,\u201d he added before the line went dead.</p><p>McCarty looked at the two agents sitting across from him and snorted. \u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked them with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Zane answered with a shake of his head.</p><p>McCarty merely nodded. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a meeting with the mayor.\u201d He grunted unhappily and swept out of the office, leaving Morrison and Henninger behind.</p><p>Ty sat twirling his pen idly, unmoving as he looked at the two younger men in amusement. \u201cHow\u2019d you get stuck with this shit?\u201d he asked them finally.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just errand boys, sir,\u201d Henninger answered in a low voice, a hint of amusement in his dark eyes as he looked at Ty.</p><p>Ty grinned crookedly and nodded. \u201cSo are we,\u201d he responded wryly.</p><p>Henninger fought hard not to smile.</p><p>Zane glanced at the two agents and back to Ty. \u201cAny miraculous sparks of insight, Grady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty answered as he stood and removed his suit jacket. He yanked off his tie and threw it onto the table. \u201cI need to find me a Batgirl,\u201d he drawled thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the bat signal\u2019s upstairs,\u201d Zane answered absently as he paged through the folder, checking to see if there were materials he wanted to request. Morrison and Henninger exchanged dubious looks.</p><p>\u201cYou have way too many of these comments stored up,\u201d Ty told Zane disapprovingly. He turned to Morrison and Henninger and gave them a sweeping gesture of his hand. \u201cTake us to the Bat Cave!\u201d he ordered with a straight face.</p><p>Morrison\u2019s jaw dropped as he stared at Ty, obviously thinking he was insane. His partner looked at him and rolled his eyes. \u201cC\u2019mon, Mark,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s still yanking your chain.\u201d The two younger agents led the way out, muttering to each other.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s more likely they\u2019re taking us to Wayne Manor,\u201d Zane said as they followed along, both to make his point and to get a jab in at Ty while he could. \u201cHide in plain sight and spare no expense account.\u201d Sad, but true. It was a good thing they weren\u2019t supposed to be completely undercover, or they\u2019d already be spoiled.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make any sense. Shut it, Sidekick,\u201d Ty muttered to him.</p><p>Zane allowed himself a small smile before he remembered how much he actively disliked this man.</p><p>\u201cYou two want breakfast before the hotel?\u201d Morrison asked. He seemed to be the talker of the matched set.</p><p>\u201cThe Bat Cave isn\u2019t the hotel,\u201d Ty protested in annoyance with a few snaps of his fingers. \u201cGet on board the metaphor, kiddies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is the Bat Cave, then?\u201d Henninger asked with a long-suffering sigh.</p><p>\u201cThe lab, man. Take us down to the lab,\u201d Ty ordered in exasperation.</p><p>Zane glanced over the Hardy Boys, struck again by how young they seemed. Surely, they\u2019d seen some version of Batman. This was making him feel old.</p><p>\u201cWell, how the hell are we supposed to know that? You old guys saw all that original crap. The new stuff\u2019s a lot better, and the Bat Cave is not a lab,\u201d Morrison blustered.</p><p>Zane blinked. Old guys? He glanced to Ty, wondering what sort of fireworks that little comment would set off.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I saw the original anything, SpongeBob?\u201d Ty asked with a smirk and a point to his own chest. \u201cWhat are you doing reading comics anyway? When I was your age I was in the Gulf, man,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cThe Gulf of what?\u201d Morrison responded, a blank look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe Persian Gulf,\u201d Zane answered sharply, not at all amused. He noticed Henninger closing his eyes in exasperation and shaking his head.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t know whether to be more shocked at Morrison\u2019s idiocy or at Zane\u2019s sudden apparent support. He just stared at Morrison for a minute, all joking aside, then glanced at Zane, who met his eyes for a moment, and sighed. \u201cKids these days,\u201d he muttered as he stepped between the two younger agents and punched the button on the elevator.</p><p>The elevator ride was a short one, and when the car jerked to a stop Henninger led the way out. \u201cThe team has been a little scattered since the deaths of Special Agents Reilly and Sanchez,\u201d he said quietly as they walked down the hall. \u201cWe all knew them. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re not really organized right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas the team had any off time?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Henninger glanced at him defensively as if expecting a jeer. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered curtly as he opened the door to the main laboratory.</p><p>\u201cGive it to them while we get ourselves acquainted with the case,\u201d Ty ordered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane frowned. He had no problem with giving the overworked team a day or two off, but how were they supposed to do any of the things Burns ordered if none of the team was around to observe? \u201cWe should have access to all the subsidiary case material,\u201d he said slowly, not arguing openly. \u201cI\u2019d like to spend some time with the photos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have them pulled,\u201d Morrison responded diligently, obviously knowing he\u2019d insulted the two older agents and hoping to make up for it.</p><p>\u201cAre any of the crime scenes still intact?\u201d Ty asked.</p> <p>\u201cUh ... I believe the most recent one is,\u201d Morrison answered uncertainly. \u201cMay I ask why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to visit it,\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Zane added. He wondered if Serena Scott would mind going along and seeing the site in person. He\u2019d have to ask her\u2014unless Ty got it into his head to go right this minute.</p><p>That thought made him realize that he really had no idea what Ty was trained to do or how he would behave on an actual case. The other man at least knew what department Zane came from, although that certainly didn\u2019t expose his training. Some research to learn a little more about his asshole of a partner might not be a bad idea. It was obvious from the fact that he had been stationed in the Gulf that he had been military of some sort, and when Zane pondered that it didn\u2019t really come as much of a surprise. It wouldn\u2019t take long to request a file on Grady.</p><p>\u201cWhen would you like to go?\u201d Morrison asked.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as we\u2019re done down here,\u201d Ty answered with a nod to the lab doors as they approached.</p><p>\u201cThat may be a bit of a problem,\u201d Morrison answered nervously as Henninger slid his key card through the security slot.</p><p>\u201cThen fix the problem,\u201d Ty said to him coldly.</p><p>\u201cThe NYPD detectives assigned to the case haven\u2019t returned our calls for two days. They don\u2019t know you\u2019re here,\u201d Morrison told him.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Zane asked, stopping at the security desk.</p><p>\u201cTechnically it\u2019s still a joint case. The site was left in NYPD</p> <p>custody,\u201d Morrison answered with a grateful look at Zane as Ty sighed in exasperation. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to notify them of the changes to the case and give them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get on it,\u201d Ty interrupted before stalking through the security door Henninger held open for him.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Zane said quietly. \u201cLet us know when it\u2019s set up.\u201d</p><p>Morrison fled, followed by his quieter partner, and Zane turned and followed Ty, wondering if this would be the pattern for the job: Hurricane Grady sweeps in, tosses everything askew, and sweeps right back out, leaving Zane to clean up the mess.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t worked his ass off the past two years to be a goddamn janitor.</p><p>FOUR hours after entering the lab, Ty sat amid a flurry of papers and untidy stacks of reports. He leaned his elbows on the table, scowling heavily and staring at the shiny stainless-steel top.</p><p>On the other side of the table, Zane was busily working on his charts.</p><p>He just happened to glance up, the look on Ty\u2019s face giving him pause.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t look up. His eyes were slightly glazed and his brow furrowed. \u201cThere\u2019s no pattern,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe only things connecting these cases are the little tokens the dude leaves with the bodies and the fact they all end up dead. Other than that, there\u2019s no common victim type, there\u2019s no common MO. Weapon, cause of death, even the way he stages them. All different.\u201d</p><p>He finally focused his eyes and glared at the files accusingly as if it was their fault.</p><p>\u201cVictim Number One; Kyle Walters,\u201d he recited suddenly. \u201cWealthy Wall Street type, found in his bedroom, still alive, half-insane, suffering from severe hypersensitivity to light, sound, smell, you name it. Dies in the hospital without ever saying a coherent word. Cause of death is ruled a meth overdose.</p><p>Hell, the only reason we even know this guy was a victim was the maid finding the token from the killer a week later. Serial killers tend to get their kicks from watching their victims die or from the power to kill. Why would he leave him alive and risk being identified?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they get their kicks just as much from watching the suffering,\u201d Zane suggested quietly, not looking up from his paper. His fingers moved over the charts, still making notes from the case files. \u201cThe best developing pattern is the fact that the victims are so different. Like he\u2019s choosing specifically based on some reasoning. A majority of serial killers fixate on a particular style of victim\u2014young blonde women or rich gay men, for instance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, I\u2019m aware of that. That\u2019s my point. We have a thirty-seven-year-old male stockbroker; overdosed with shitty-quality meth,\u201d Ty said as he closed his eyes and rested his head back against his chair. He shook his head, reciting everything from memory. \u201cNext, Susan Harris, a twenty-something hooker found in nothing but a six hundred-count white sheet in the most exclusive cemetery in the state, all her teeth gone and no apparent cause of death. Then a double murder. Two young women: Allison McFadden and Theresa Escobar. Roommates, both suffocated, positioned in their beds as if they were sleeping. The only notable thing about them is that their hair had been dyed postmortem. Then we have the infamous set of twins who got the Bureau involved, Ryan and Russell Stevens. Killed at the Tri-State marker, one man in each of the bordering states, shot dead. Late fifties, an apparent double-suicide, if not for the token left by the killer.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his neck and shook his head, trying to make sense of it.</p><p>\u201cThe first guy was a brunet, the hooker was a bottle blonde but a natural brunette, the second and third were blonde and black-haired, then dyed the opposite, and the twins were both redheads. Both sexes, no common body type. Brown eyes, green eyes, blue eyes ... hell, he doesn\u2019t even leave the same tokens! Fuck it!\u201d he spat. \u201cAll serials have patterns. It\u2019s got to be there,\u201d</p><p>he muttered to himself.</p><p>\u201cNot having a pattern can be a pattern.\u201d The patient distraction was clear in Zane\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s intelligent and not quite insane, he may be deliberately toying with us. It\u2019s a game to him.\u201d While Ty was getting frustrated, Zane kept himself removed, focusing on the numbers and the data. \u201cI want to plot the locations of the bodies to get an idea of the territory we\u2019re looking at.\u201d He looked up to see Ty frowning, and Zane\u2019s curiosity got the best of him. \u201cTell me, Grady, why the hell are you here? Why did Burns put you on this case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that there is a pattern,\u201d Ty responded slowly, ignoring the question momentarily. \u201cI want to know what the fuck it is,\u201d he ground out patiently. He leaned back and rolled his neck. \u201cAnd he put me on it because he knows me. I\u2019m good at sneaking around and I\u2019m good at mind games,\u201d he said curtly, not choosing to elaborate.</p><p>Zane nodded slowly. He was starting to see why they\u2019d been paired up for this freak show. Ty was good at mind games, Zane was good at details and patterns. And they so obviously didn\u2019t work well together that they didn\u2019t even need to make a show of it for the New York team.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got enough here,\u201d he announced, closing his file and notebook.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll talk with the NYPD detectives, and Serena Scott should return my call. Henninger and Morrison will either get us access to the scene, or we\u2019ll get access on our own.\u201d He pushed back from the table. \u201cYou have anything else?\u201d His voice was neutral.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty muttered without moving. He was still staring at the files and frowning.</p><p>Zane watched him silently for a long moment before saying, \u201cReady to head over to the hotel? I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m ready for dinner and a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drink on duty?\u201d Ty asked incredulously as he finally tore his eyes away from the files.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d Zane headed for the hall. \u201cI have a new smartass partner to deal with, so certainly I can\u2019t be blamed,\u201d he muttered under his breath while he walked to the door and out of the lab. A few beers with dinner wouldn\u2019t even register on a Breathalyzer with his body mass and would go a long way to new brainstorms, but he didn\u2019t dare. That didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t dream otherwise, though.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been a field agent before, have you?\u201d Ty asked with disdain, calling out the question as he remained at the table, staring at the files and crime-scene photos.</p><p>Zane stopped at the door, taking a moment to order his thoughts and push away the ghosts of his constant nightmares. \u201cA drink now and then is not going to end the world. I\u2019m guessing that you came from deep cover, which means you were always looking over your shoulder, living the part every minute, knowing one mistake would send you to the morgue.\u201d Zane knew the situation very well. \u201cWhile it\u2019s admirable, and arguably the most difficult job the Bureau does, you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to downshift, or the people we work with are going to strangle you. You can\u2019t work around the clock and stay sharp enough to crunch this much data and get inside a madman\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>Ty tore his eyes away from the papers again and looked up at Zane seriously. \u201cYou think those boys down in the morgue downshifted before he killed \u2019em?\u201d he asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cI think they were locked down as securely as they could get, with no reason to think they\u2019d be found, much less attacked. Which means one of two things,\u201d Zane responded, brown eyes hard and unflinching. \u201cThey\u2019d either already screwed up and exposed themselves or someone who knew where they were gave them up, either by mistake or not. Either way, letting down their guard made no difference. They were already dead.\u201d</p><p>Ty just shook his head and snorted derisively. He knew he was damned if he was going to let himself be shot in the chest as he slept. You never thought you were safe. Feeling safe got you killed.</p><p>Zane could almost see the tension pouring off Ty in waves. \u201cAre you going to the hotel or are you planning on staying here all day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to a hotel,\u201d Ty answered as he stood and gathered his coat and satchel. \u201cA different hotel. And you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>Zane simply leveled a gaze at him, waiting for explanation. It was the first time the other man had even remotely indicated that he wanted Zane anywhere around him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on losing another agent to this shit, got it?\u201d Ty responded sharply as he stuffed several of the files in his bag and glared back at Zane. \u201cEven if it is you.\u201d</p><p>Zane supposed he should feel all warm and fuzzy about Ty at least not wanting him gruesomely murdered and left to bleed out in his shower or something. Somehow, the sentiment didn\u2019t really inspire much camaraderie, though. \u201cSo where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoliday Inn, man,\u201d Ty answered. \u201cIf I\u2019m footin\u2019 the bill, I ain\u2019t paying no damn five hundred bucks a night.\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. A room was a room. He\u2019d stayed in better and he\u2019d stayed in worse. He followed Ty out of the lab and back down the hall to the elevator. \u201cAnd then?\u201d He wanted to know if Ty\u2019s sudden concern for his well-being included staying in close proximity; he\u2019d planned to come back after dinner to study the maps and evidence notes.</p><p>Ty shrugged as he punched the elevator button. \u201cThen we see what\u2019s brewing,\u201d he answered carelessly.</p><p>Zane looked over at his partner in exasperation. First, complete and total focus on the case, a case that wasn\u2019t even their main focus, and now, this. \u201cDo you do anything like a normal person?\u201d he asked, although the question was wholly rhetorical. And not at all complimentary.</p><p>Ty turned around and looked at him in slight surprise once they were in the elevator. \u201cOnly the fun things,\u201d he answered finally after a moment of looking at him thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cFun things,\u201d Zane echoed, not looking away from Ty once he was pinned by the man\u2019s hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou remember those, don\u2019t you?\u201d Ty questioned with a smirk as he let his eyes travel up and down Zane thoughtfully. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t,\u201d he decided with a sigh.</p><p>Zane knew with absolute certainty that he did not want this conversation to continue. \u201cHow many strikes have I got left?\u201d he asked abruptly. He knew Ty had been taking his measure, in more ways than one.</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Ty answered immediately, though he was somewhat surprised Zane even knew to ask the question.</p><p>A ghost of a self-deprecating smile crossed Zane\u2019s lips. He knew Ty had no respect for him. Frankly, Zane didn\u2019t care. He didn\u2019t plan for this joke of a partnership to last long. He just wondered who higher up in the Bureau had decided to take him out along with Ty. \u201cSo why hasn\u2019t the ump thrown me out of the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause there ain\u2019t no umps in this particular game,\u201d Ty answered seriously as the doors whooshed open on the ground floor. \u201cAnd there ain\u2019t no rules.\u201d</p><p>Zane walked out ahead of the other man. \u201cSo we do without.\u201d He could live with that. Better than working under someone else\u2019s thumb like the past two years. \u201cOr we make up our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you seem the type to need rules,\u201d Ty responded with a derogatory sneer.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t answer as they walked through the parking garage. He drew back into his stony silence, focusing on thinking about the next steps of the investigation instead of the insolence of his jackass of a partner.</p><p>After checking in to a hotel just a block or two from the swanky establishment where they were supposed to be staying, Ty Grady Aimmediately fell into the shower and went about washing the frustration of the day away. He had been a little surprised when his new partner had paid for his own room, but it suited him just fine. He didn\u2019t want to be within ten feet of the fucker if he didn\u2019t have to be. Arrogant priss. God, the man probably slept in his tie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Having separate rooms would work well if Ty intended to start into this the way he usually did. He wasn\u2019t used to the normal channels and he did far better working a case from the underbelly rather than in conventional ways. He doubted Zane would go with him tonight, and he\u2019d just as soon go on his own, anyway. He\u2019d always been more comfortable slinking around in the shadows than waving his authority around.</p><p>In a room down the hall, Zane Garrett sighed as he threw down his duffel bags and briefcase. He ran his hands through his hair and then stretched. He and Ty ended up several doors down from each other, but it wasn\u2019t far enough as far as Zane was concerned.</p><p>A hot shower sounded good, so he started stripping down. Next order of business was food, and then he\u2019d go back to the office. He reminded himself that he\u2019d at least need to call Ty and tell him where he was going. If they were real partners, they\u2019d have stayed in the same room, but Zane sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to suggest it. He wasn\u2019t that masochistic.</p> <p>Pulling on comfortable worn jeans and a rust-red V-neck sweater after cleaning up, Zane picked up his holster, checking it all over before settling it comfortably on his shoulders and buckling it down. He checked the thin sheaths he wore just inside his wrists, then knelt down and strapped another sheath around his ankle. Completely armed, he felt better than he had all day. He hated airplanes. The security tended to get a little strident when you tried to take knives through checkpoints, even if you were a federal agent who always carried a gun.</p><p>His canvas jacket went over that, and with a look in the mirror, he rolled his eyes. Ty would probably think he was trying to copy him, looking less stuffy and more street-worthy. Zane sighed at the mirror, then grabbed his wallet, cigarettes, lighter, and key card and headed down the hall to the other agent\u2019s door for a quick check-in.</p><p>Ty answered the curt knock in a towel, body still dripping wet and steam roiling out of the bathroom door behind him.</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow as his stomach flip-flopped in reaction.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s real safe,\u201d he commented, forcing his voice to sound wry.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked with a tilt of his head.</p><p>Zane looked significantly up and down Ty\u2019s barely covered body.</p><p>Ty looked down at himself and then back up at Zane with a sniff as he realized what Zane was blathering about. \u201cI\u2019m a lethal weapon, man,\u201d he grunted. He turned and gave a wave over his shoulder, gesturing for him to come in.</p><p>Zane would have snorted except he figured Ty wasn\u2019t overstating all that much. There was no telling what Ty\u2019s background was (although Zane had already discerned he was military of some sort) but he did indeed look capable. And fit. Very fit. Zane swallowed as he stepped inside and pushed the door shut behind him, leaving the odd feelings in the hall and withdrawing back into his professional persona for safety.</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d want to know if I wasn\u2019t going to be home by curfew,\u201d he said, sliding a hand into his jacket pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your fucking keeper,\u201d Ty grunted as he shucked the towel and reached for his briefs. He glanced back to see Zane\u2019s hand in his pocket and tensed instinctively.</p> <p>Zane\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he slowly pulled his hand free to let it fall limp at his side. His partner was obviously tenser than he let on. \u201cI remind you of the \u2018You\u2019re coming with me, I don\u2019t plan on losing another agent\u2019</p><p>comment,\u201d he said mildly, once more strongly scolding himself inside for wanting to ogle\u2014and grope\u2014when he got a free show. He sighed inwardly.</p><p>He always behaved these days. Maybe he was a pansy-ass now, just like Ty said. The thought made him slightly ill.</p><p>\u201cWhat you do in your free time is none of my concern,\u201d Ty was saying as he pulled up the briefs and then toweled off his wet shoulders and arms. The towel passed over a tattoo on Ty\u2019s right bicep, but Zane was too far away to discern the details other than the fact that it was a face of something.</p><p>He fought back the urge to squint in order to make it out.</p><p>\u201cAre we even going to attempt to work together, or shall we just agree to meet every few days to compare notes?\u201d Zane asked, voice cool. \u201cI\u2019d rather know now than waste more of our precious time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think this case is gonna be easy for one man?\u201d Ty asked in response as he grabbed his jeans. He turned around to look at Zane again as he stepped into them. \u201cAwful big leap, thinking you\u2019re smarter\u2019n the killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve yet to act like you want me around, Grady. Don\u2019t start now,\u201d</p> <p>Zane snapped.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t act. And I didn\u2019t say I wanted you around,\u201d Ty responded calmly. \u201cI implied that I needed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, mark my lucky stars, I\u2019m flattered,\u201d Zane drawled in annoyance. Ty didn\u2019t seem to care if he was unprofessional, so Zane took the opportunity to be just that. Too bad Ty was so determined to be a bastard. Off the clock, they might have gotten along. Over a bottle of whiskey. Zane gritted his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou look a little tense,\u201d Ty observed wryly.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t mention his line of thought. \u201cYou implied, so what do you need?\u201d he asked instead of responding to Ty\u2019s comment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be tense. I\u2019m tense,\u201d Ty told him with a careless shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou going back to Federal Plaza?\u201d he asked in answer to Zane\u2019s question as he pulled on a black T-shirt that had writing in white block letters that said</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M UNDERCOVER.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at the shirt before shaking his head slowly. \u201cYes.</p><p>Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you get back, will you come check on me?\u201d Ty asked, unembarrassed by the request as he sat on the edge of the bed and pulled his socks on.</p><p>\u201cYou going to do something that may make you not be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully not,\u201d Ty answered wryly as he stomped his foot down into one beat-up cowboy boot. \u201cA few blocks from here is pretty close to where that hooker reportedly worked. I\u2019m going to go talk to the ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral responses come to mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure all of them are wildly clever,\u201d Ty responded sarcastically as he stomped into his second boot and then stood and stretched.</p><p>Zane deliberately looked away from the wiry body stretching out in front of him. \u201cA couple,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cYou want me to come along?\u201d</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow and gave Zane a slow once-over. He cleared his throat and licked his lips as he stretched his arms over his head, then flopped them back down to his sides. \u201cHave you ever, umm ... picked up a hooker?\u201d</p><p>he asked with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Both on and off the job, but that wasn\u2019t necessarily germane to the discussion. Zane tilted his head as Ty\u2019s eyebrows climbed in surprise. \u201cSo, yes or no? Either way, I\u2019m eating first.\u201d</p><p>Ty tilted his head, thinking it over. This could be a good chance to see how Zane would handle himself on an investigation without hurting much of anything as far as their current one went. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he agreed finally as he reached for his military surplus green canvas jacket. He picked it up and looked at it, then cut his gaze to look Zane over with narrowed eyes, taking in the way he was dressed. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he grumbled again as he threw the jacket down and went to rummage through his things for his other jacket to wear. He didn\u2019t want them looking like fucking twins.</p><p>He stripped his T-shirt back off as Zane waited, picking up a clean white dress shirt instead. He was very conscious, as he changed, of the fact that the little round scar on his lower back was probably visible, still new and pink on his tanned skin. He glanced over at Zane and cleared his throat self-consciously, turning toward him again as he slid into the shirt. He wasn\u2019t sure why it bothered him that Zane could see the scar, but it did. Perhaps because he hadn\u2019t been the only one that particular bullet had gone through.</p><p>The other agent just caught sight of the scar, recognizing it for what it most likely was. While Zane had been lucky enough to avoid being shot, he had plenty of other scars, inside and out. He made no comment and pretended not to have noticed.</p><p>\u201cSo where we going for dinner, gar\u00e7on?\u201d Ty asked as he grabbed his wallet and stuck it in his back pocket.</p><p>Dragging his eyes away from Ty\u2019s body again, Zane ignored yet another new nickname and answered, \u201cMorrison told me about a barbecue place down several blocks. Family-owned, original recipes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, New York barbeque,\u201d Ty responded sarcastically with a wrinkle of his nose. \u201cNo go. I need ... fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFish.\u201d Zane shrugged. \u201cOkay, we can find a place. Unless you already have something in mind?\u201d He really didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d eat anything. It was just the cocktails that got him in trouble.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll walk,\u201d Ty suggested as he attached an ankle holster and checked that his backup was loaded. He dragged out his shoulder holster and did the same, then slipped his beaten leather jacket on and flexed his shoulders experimentally with a frown.</p><p>\u201cStrap\u2019s twisted,\u201d Zane offered. He walked over and reached up under the jacket to flip the buckle so the strap laid flat along the back of Ty\u2019s shoulder. Ty turned his head wordlessly and raised his eyebrows as Zane stepped into his space and fucked around with his weaponry.</p><p>Now, Zane wasn\u2019t a stupid man. He\u2019d seen Ty tense earlier at a slightly perceived threat. It wasn\u2019t ignorance on Zane's part, getting so close without being invited. But he wanted his new partner to know that he wasn\u2019t afraid of him. That he wasn\u2019t quite the paper-pusher he made himself out to be.</p><p>Zane straightened the length of strap and pulled Ty\u2019s jacket back down to cover it. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I could eat a whale,\u201d he said absently, already warring within himself. Had he truly wanted to telegraph a message? Or had he simply taken advantage of the chance to touch the hard muscles he\u2019d been seeing? Danger zone, Garrett.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and followed silently. Not many people had the nerve to step into his reach and touch him without his permission or some sort of forewarning. Either Zane really didn\u2019t give a shit\u2014which was contrary to his demeanor and actions\u2014or he had no clue how dangerous Ty really was.</p><p>The third option was the most frightening; that he knew what Ty could do to him and he wasn\u2019t concerned. Either way, it left Ty slightly unsettled as they went in search of food.</p><p>THEIR hotel was located just a block or two from Little Italy, and they had no trouble finding a restaurant there, which seemed to suit Ty just fine. Zane followed along as they were led to the table, eyeing the bar across the room with an internal sigh. He sat down at the table and immediately opened the menu.</p><p>Ty, however, left the menu in front of him and turned to the waitress with a grin. He went about ordering his Guinness and dinner with a series of well-honed innuendo and rakish grins that had the girl giggling at him as she moved away.</p><p>Zane ignored what was becoming his partner\u2019s customary behavior.</p><p>Sitting back, he reflected that maybe they should have kept looking for a different restaurant. One with televisions. Here, there was nothing to do but look at each other.</p><p>As he sat, Ty was observing the other patrons in the restaurant idly, noticing things about them that most people didn\u2019t notice. His training forced him to take in who looked anxious, who seemed to be waiting for someone, who was wearing a coat too large for them that might conceal a weapon, who looked out of place. The list went on and on. \u201cSo,\u201d he huffed as he looked back at Zane. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to what then?\u201d Zane said, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cYou had the plan, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hijacked it with dinner,\u201d Ty pointed out as the little waitress came back and slid Ty\u2019s drink onto the table. \u201cThank you, darlin\u2019,\u201d he drawled as she passed by. He took one long draw from the bottle, then glanced around and placed his palm flat on the opening of the bottle before turning it upside down. He patted himself down with the beer like someone would have done with a bottle of cologne, taking another gulp every now and then as he smeared some on his neck and chest and finally rubbed his hands together and patted down his scruffy face.</p><p>Zane just watched, stirring lemon into his tea, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a waste of good beer. You should have ordered some shit like Bud Light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I drink Bud Light?\u201d Ty sneered before downing what was left of the beer. He raised his hand and called over the waitress again.</p><p>\u201cYou think the girls are going to be able to tell the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou underestimate their prowess,\u201d Ty laughed as he leaned back and stretched his hands over his head. The waitress sidled over and Ty smiled at her. \u201cBring my irritating friend here a Bud Light, would you, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She repressed a snort and gave Zane a nod before turning away again.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said sharply, voice quite firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and raised her eyebrows in question. Ty pursed his lips and then smiled, shaking his head and gesturing for her to bring it anyway.</p><p>\u201cYour irritating friend has no interest in a beer, Grady,\u201d Zane ground out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not to drink,\u201d Ty responded with an easy smile.</p><p>Zane relaxed slightly, though he was still frowning. \u201cThen what do you plan to do with it?\u201d he asked suspiciously. Ty merely waved a hand at himself in answer. Zane rolled his eyes before he could stop himself and really wished Ty had waited until after dinner to \u201cfreshen up.\u201d It would be bad enough walking around with him without smelling it all through dinner, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The waitress brought the ordered beer and smiled at Ty flirtatiously as she passed by. Zane watched her thoughtfully and wondered if Ty really was charming or if he was just good-looking enough to pull it off. Either way, it irritated Zane already.</p><p>Ty slid the bottle across the table and waved a hand. \u201cYou can wait</p><p>\u2019til after we eat, if you like,\u201d he offered charitably.</p> <p>Eyes narrowing, Zane looked at Ty, then the bottle, then back at Ty.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no. One of us smelling like a drunk is plenty.\u201d</p><p>Ty merely shrugged. The man wasn\u2019t going with him without playing the part. Whether he did it voluntarily was not Ty\u2019s concern. It might even be fun to douse him down, Ty pondered with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he leered as he leaned his elbows on the table again. \u201cTell me about your hookers. You don\u2019t seem the type,\u201d he said with a pointed look at the wedding band on Zane\u2019s finger.</p><p>Zane willfully ignored the beer bottle. \u201cAnd what is my type?\u201d he asked in a clipped voice, his left hand curling into a loose fist before he pulled it off the table and settled it out of sight, hiding the ring. He wondered how many new insults Ty could come up with. It really was a game to him, apparently, and it made it more difficult for Zane to maintain his stony reserve.</p> <p>Ty snorted in response. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he responded in amusement. \u201cI guess you would need to pay someone to tolerate you.\u201d</p><p>Letting the insult pass, for more reasons than the truth of it, Zane prodded back instead. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have a very well-formed and detailed profile ready to throw out there, proving how lacking I am.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyebrow rose and he leaned forward. \u201cHave you read my file?\u201d</p><p>he inquired curiously.</p><p>\u201cIn what time, since we\u2019ve been together practically the entire past thirty-six hours?\u201d Zane asked sarcastically. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t think about having it pulled.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes, then let it go as a coincidence. \u201cProfile of you, huh?\u201d he drawled with a smirk instead.</p> <p>\u201cDespite your insistence on being an utter asshole, you are undeniably educated and highly trained,\u201d Zane said, drawing on the minute clues and data he\u2019d been gathering about Ty to make a strong guess. Number-crunching, as it were. \u201cSo, I\u2019m betting you\u2019ve assessed for threat, judged for education, gauged strengths and weaknesses ... yes. A profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour logic is irrefutable,\u201d Ty complimented, still grinning. \u201cI do have one,\u201d he answered with a matter-of-fact nod. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for you to change it.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s interest in the line of conversation dissipated, as did any life or spark in his dark eyes as his expression went hard again. People were always expecting him to change. \u201cVery charitable of you,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cYou want me continuing to think you\u2019re a candy-ass content to ride a desk, that\u2019s fine with me. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t give you a chance, though,\u201d he warned as he leaned back in his seat again and glanced to his right as someone moved too quickly in his peripheral vision. He watched them suspiciously for a moment in silence, the sudden tenseness filtering through his entire body.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do to change your opinion,\u201d Zane said sourly, not even noticing the change in Ty\u2019s demeanor. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not too far off.\u201d</p><p>His tone had turned decidedly bitter, and Zane took a long drink of his iced tea to get the annoyance back under control.</p><p>\u201cAh, I hear a past bubbling forth,\u201d Ty responded with a point at Zane as he pulled his attention away from their fellow diners. \u201cThere\u2019s another thing I don\u2019t wanna talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no desire to hear violins wailing, anyway,\u201d Zane snapped.</p> <p>Ty laughed joyously and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said approvingly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s nose wrinkled as he reined in his temper yet again. Something about Ty brought out the parts of him he tried to hide from the light of day.</p><p>Surely, this was headed for disaster. \u201cThere were four,\u201d he muttered before thinking better of it.</p><p>\u201cFour what?\u201d Ty asked in apparent confusion.</p><p>Zane cleared his throat in annoyance and glanced around them.</p><p>\u201cHookers,\u201d he said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cAll at once?\u201d Ty asked with a mocking sort of wide-eyed innocence.</p><p>\u201cNot all four, no,\u201d Zane said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cShame,\u201d Ty drawled with a smirk. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed inwardly. \u201cOne of them was busy with a john in the other bed,\u201d he said as he lifted his glass to call for a refill. That had been one hell of a night\u2014what he remembered of it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fascinatingly kinky,\u201d Ty drawled flatly. \u201cBut I meant why hookers,\u201d he corrected with an impish grin. \u201cPaying for it usually means you\u2019re doing it to get out frustrations, not enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr being too drunk off your ass to know otherwise,\u201d Zane pointed out, taking another sip of tea.</p><p>Ty raised his eyebrows and inclined his head in interest. \u201cAre you a drunk?\u201d he asked directly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twisted in wry amusement, and he took a drink of tea rather than answering.</p><p>\u201cWell, that should make any firefights we get into interesting,\u201d Ty drawled sarcastically. \u201cSorry, boss, I aimed for the middle one!\u201d he cried softly as he squinted and raised his hand and waved it in front of him, mimicking a man who was seeing double as he tried to aim.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes were flat and emotionless. \u201cI don\u2019t drink anymore,\u201d he said after a long pause.</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d Ty prodded slowly. \u201cWhat, you\u2019re a recovering alcoholic?\u201d he asked with sarcasm lacing the words.</p><p>Trying very hard to push down a sudden desire to commit homicide, Zane\u2019s eyes narrowed and began to glitter with anger. He should have known Ty would disrespect even this. \u201cAlcoholics don\u2019t recover,\u201d he said sharply as he pushed out of his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he muttered, heading to the front door.</p><p>\u201cI know they don\u2019t,\u201d Ty called after him without getting up. \u201cThey must not have a sarcasm translator in Cyber,\u201d he muttered to himself with a roll of his eyes.</p><p>Zane heard him but was too angry to turn around. He had to calm down or he\u2019d lose his grip on his well-practiced control. He pushed out the doors and onto the sidewalk, walked a few yards away, pulled out a pack of cigarettes, and lit up, watching the foot traffic go by as he cooled off.</p><p>Left behind in the restaurant with several patrons glancing at him curiously, Ty simply shrugged and reached for a breadstick to gnaw on. The alcoholism thing didn\u2019t mesh with the mental profile he\u2019d created of his new partner. He\u2019d have to reconsider after his task tonight.</p><p>Taking his time with the cigarette, Zane jammed the butt out when he was done and tossed it in a trash can outside the restaurant before heading back in. The salads were on the table, and he sat down and started eating without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cBit of a temper, huh?\u201d Ty greeted as he chewed. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d commented the man who was notorious for losing his temper in explosive ways. \u201cTo walk away like that.\u201d</p><p>Zane grunted in answer as he ate a few bites of salad, deciding if he wanted to answer. \u201cHad to learn,\u201d he finally said as he nabbed a breadstick.</p><p>\u201cWere you a cop?\u201d Ty asked him in return, his mind making leaps and bounds of logic as he continued to chew.</p><p>\u201cAre we playing twenty questions now?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cNo. I was never a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask \u2019cause big city cops are usually plagued by drinking and anger problems,\u201d Ty informed him. \u201cAnd I assume they started and were taken care of before you were in the Bureau because you wouldn\u2019t have stayed in after developing them. Military?\u201d he asked dubiously.</p><p>Zane had to smile a little as he looked up and saw the wheels turning.</p><p>\u201cNot military. You get two more guesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, I had you pegged for Air Force,\u201d Ty drawled with a shake of his head and a smirk.</p><p>A sharp bark of laughter escaped Zane before he could repress it.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, my candy-ass image is only recently cultivated. I\u2019m pleased that it\u2019s so convincing,\u201d he said, not at all brightly. He still wanted a drink, and his itchy hands and parched throat were getting worse. \u201cYou\u2019re military, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarines,\u201d Ty offered as he looked up at Zane without moving his head, his fork stopping as he smiled slowly. \u201cForce Recon.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s shoulders stiffened. So Ty was a highly specialized warrior, trained to take the worst of a hostile environment. To be there and be invisible. To be there and be deadly. The knowledge made something inside Zane go cold. \u201cMakes sense,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cAnyone who could be so insubordinate could only have been the total opposite at some point in time,\u201d</p><p>he observed. Zane pushed the salad bowl away and strongly contemplated another cigarette.</p><p>Ty snorted and shook his head in amusement. \u201cInsubordinate,\u201d he echoed with a little snicker.</p><p>Glancing up, Zane was already resigned to being insulted. Modus operandi for Ty. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were really all that much of a liability, do you think I\u2019d still be around?\u201d Ty inquired curiously. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m good, but I ain\u2019t that good.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t even have to think up his answer. \u201cIncorrect. It means you\u2019re so good that you can be as insubordinate as you like and get away with it. We both know there\u2019s a difference between being a liability in the field and an asshole in the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe certainly do,\u201d Ty agreed with a shit-eating grin. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing from you, I\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>Ty merely shrugged and went about eating his salad happily. Zane seemed to have a higher opinion of his abilities than he did of Zane\u2019s. Which was how it should be, as far as Ty could tell. Soon, the main dishes were brought out and Ty gave the waitress a wink for her trouble. \u201cSo, what\u2019d you do?\u201d he asked Zane finally.</p><p>Zane knew what Ty was asking. His lips lifted into a small smile.</p><p>\u201cThe hookers were informants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Ty asked, his tone of voice that of a patient parent entertaining a child.</p><p>The anger flared again, and tamping it down took serious effort. \u201cI don\u2019t need another goddamn priest. You want to know or not? Because if you\u2019re just going to humor me, then I\u2019m shutting up,\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>\u201cTemper, temper,\u201d Ty tutted with a wave of his fork in Zane\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of cybercrimes informants are hookers?\u201d he asked, completely changing the direction.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t always work in the Cyber Division,\u201d Zane told Ty tightly.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Ty commented disinterestedly. \u201cAnd you were fucking your informants, too?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged one shoulder. What was it about Ty that made him want to fly off the handle?</p><p>Ty gave a low whistle, shaking his head. \u201cNo fucking wonder you got busted down.\u201d</p><p>Zane gave him a hateful look. \u201cDidn\u2019t think when they put you on a leash it would be to a damn anchor, did you?\u201d he asked testily.</p><p>\u201cI was expecting an anvil with a little pink slip attached,\u201d Ty admitted. \u201cCall me Wile E. Coyote.\u201d</p><p>Surprised by the candor, Zane leaned back when the waitress refilled his tea pitcher, waiting until she was gone. \u201cSo what\u2019d you do to piss them off?\u201d</p><p>Ty actually winced as he took a sip of his water and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s still classified,\u201d he answered honestly.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d \u2018Still classified\u2019 usually meant the shit hit the fan, and then some. \u201cSo the bricks, the anvil, and the ACME explosives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got ACME written on your forehead,\u201d Ty muttered. He leaned back and cocked his head with an audible sigh. \u201cI was in charge of the op,\u201d he explained, completely unashamed of what he knew probably should have gotten him fired ... and possibly arrested. \u201cWe skirted some corners and whited out some of the rule book; then it all went to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what little I know of you, it should have worked, though, huh?\u201d Zane said as their dinners were delivered. \u201cIt would have been worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty answered succinctly. \u201cIt would have been worth it.\u201d</p><p>Zane raised his eyes to study the other man. \u201cSo what went wrong?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up and met his eyes seriously, hazel eyes glinting angrily at just the memory. \u201cThat\u2019s classified,\u201d he murmured finally before looking back down.</p><p>The clipped heat of Ty\u2019s voice and the snap in his eyes gave him away. \u201cSounds like you\u2019ve got your own anger issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m pissed off,\u201d Ty answered with a forced smirk.</p><p>Snorting, Zane shook his head. \u201cAnd that's what ... only seventy-five percent of the time?\u201d he asked seriously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very easygoing,\u201d Ty huffed with a pious inclination of his head.</p><p>\u201cMm hmm,\u201d he hummed contentedly as he picked at his food.</p><p>Zane shook his head, stifling something nearly resembling a snicker.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not right in the head, Grady. And I mean that in the most respectful way possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Ty responded with a gesture of his hands.</p><p>\u201cEasygoing, my ass. You go out of your way to make people\u2019s lives hell. But now, I wonder if it\u2019s because you enjoy it or if it\u2019s because you honestly don\u2019t care about anything but the job anymore.\u201d He\u2019d seen it before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hell, Zane had lived it before.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>Zane lowered his fork and looked across the table, eyes focusing on something over Ty\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t use to think so,\u201d he admitted.</p> <p>Ty watched him with one expressive eyebrow raised. \u201cAnd?\u201d he invited with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Dark eyes refocused and zeroed in on Ty\u2019s face. \u201cThe threat of castration, unemployment, and hard jail time made me rethink things,\u201d Zane supplied.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, hang out with hookers and you get into some kinky shit,\u201d Ty offered with a straight face.</p><p>The corners of Zane\u2019s mouth turned up slightly. \u201cEveryone has their hobbies,\u201d he replied smoothly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever floats your boat, man,\u201d Ty shrugged dismissively, obviously having lost interest in the conversation.</p> <p>Zane went back to finishing his dinner. Ty wasn\u2019t just good at figuring out games, he was good at playing them. It was tiring trying to keep up with his banter, but it was also almost fun. Zane was reminded that this</p><p>\u201cpartnership\u201d might not last so long, and now he couldn\u2019t decide if he felt ambivalent about it, or worse, disappointed. There was the slight possibility that they could have been a formidable team. But it was clear that Ty\u2019s obvious disdain wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen.</p><p>They ate in silence for a while, and as soon as he was done with his dinner, Ty wiped his hands on the linen napkin and nodded at Zane. \u201cSo, tell me about the case,\u201d he said without preamble.</p><p>The other agent\u2019s brain snapped back to its gathered data without further prompting. \u201cEight murders, different locations, nothing to tie them together. No pattern of victim choice, cause of death, time of death, or other establishable MO. Just the tokens left at the scenes, none of them the same.</p><p>He\u2019s taunting us,\u201d Zane rattled off, pushing his empty plate away.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and nodded impatiently. \u201cDoes anything ring any bells?\u201d he asked pointedly.</p> <p>Zane slowly stirred his tea, eyes distant as he reviewed lists and lists of details in his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything concrete, but the state of the victims really catches my interest. He\u2019s being creative. That\u2019s unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from the tokens, the dye job is what\u2019s getting me,\u201d Ty returned with a nod. \u201cI feel like I should know why he did it. Why dye a natural blonde jet-black, then take her dark-haired roommate and bleach her blonde?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be he was trying to switch them before he killed them, but they weren\u2019t raped,\u201d Zane said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to give it some thought. Chew on the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re doing now, genius,\u201d Ty huffed.</p><p>\u201cNo, right now I\u2019m just tossing stuff out. Working the details requires more concentration and less distraction.\u201d Zane looked at him significantly.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and leaned back in his chair. \u201cYou wanted to work together,\u201d he reminded.</p><p>\u201cWhen did I say that?\u201d Zane asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the silent pleading in your eyes,\u201d Ty answered sarcastically.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be, Grady?\u201d Zane asked, feeling very tired.</p><p>\u201cDecide now, so we can get to work. Together or not?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at him thoughtfully and then smiled slowly. \u201cWell, I\u2019m quite enjoying you so far,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Zane studied that smile for a long moment before scooting his chair back. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>Ty reached for the empty bottle of Guinness and the flat Bud Light and tucked them under his jacket. \u201cReady,\u201d he said cheerfully.</p><p>Frowning at the concealed beer, Zane stood and flipped a large bill from his wallet onto the table. He figured the rest of the night would be interesting. Ty was enjoying him so far. Well, whoop-dee-doo.</p><p>As soon as they hit the street, Ty extracted the beer and reached out and took hold of Zane\u2019s elbow, pulling him to a halt. The taller man stopped and looked back at him, eyebrow raised in question. Ty raised the full bottle and sloshed the beer around, the scent wafting on the cool night breeze.</p><p>Zane blinked, and then he raised his chin sharply. \u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do it or I will,\u201d Ty told him matter-of-factly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips pressed together firmly on the simmering anger. There was no doubt in his mind that Ty would follow through. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he muttered, snatching the bottle from Ty\u2019s hand. He knew why Ty wanted this; if they looked like cops they wouldn\u2019t get close enough to ask a question. But that didn\u2019t mean he liked it one little bit. Pouring the beer messily out into his left hand, he smeared the liquid on his shirt and throat, and up under his chin, like where a drunk would have dregs trailing. Wiping his hand off on his jeans, he stalked over to the nearest bin and threw the bottle into it so hard it shattered as it hit bottom. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Ty would never let the man know it, but the sacrifice earned him just a little bit of respect. He nodded and fell in beside Zane, beginning to whistle as he walked. As they got closer to the working girls, he began to sing softly, the words slightly slurred and off-key as he swung his empty beer bottle happily at his side.</p><p>After the fifth street corner, Zane and Ty found a girl who knew the second victim. It took a couple of C-notes to get her to talk in the alley where she usually worked, and they came out with nothing more than finding out that the victim had been from Oklahoma and had run from her abusive husband.</p><p>\u201cAny reason she\u2019d have some expensive sheets at home?\u201d Ty asked the girl as she glanced around nervously.</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t made the money to buy things like that,\u201d the girl answered as she kicked her platform heel against the pavement. \u201cShe ain\u2019t nearly made the money to feed herself,\u201d she added with a shrug.</p><p>Ty just nodded and looked her over carefully. She looked back at him defiantly, seeming to think he was contemplating taking her up on her services after all. Instead, he reached into his back pocket and took out three more bills and handed them to her. \u201cBuy yourself a couple days off, huh?</p><p>Safer,\u201d he grunted as he turned around and began making his way back down the alleyway.</p><p>Zane turned silently away as the girl stared at the money in her hands.</p><p>Stalking after Ty, he lit a cigarette and pulled the collar up on his jacket as the wind picked up. It just made him crankier, blowing the stale smell of the beer off his shirt into his face.</p><p>He nearly ran into Ty, who was standing and watching a couple walk slowly down the sidewalk, scowling impressively as they neared him.</p><p>\u201cLooking for a date, sugar?\u201d the woman asked Ty. The man with her snorted and shook his head, looking away and sighing.</p><p>\u201cYou look a little too official to be throwing out hooks,\u201d Ty responded wryly. The woman smirked and nodded, tossing her blonde hair over her shoulder. \u201cThey tailed us,\u201d Ty muttered as he turned to Zane and sneered.</p><p>Zane grimaced, his mood going even further south with yet more trampling on his nerves. He should have known the Bureau would go looking for them when they didn\u2019t show up at their prearranged hotel room. Annoyed, he turned to the side, watching the area around them, leaving Ty to talk to the newcomers.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Marian Sears,\u201d the woman introduced herself, showing her badge to them. Ty reached out and snagged it quickly, taking the woman\u2019s arm and none too gently escorting her away from the alley. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Special Agent Gary Ross,\u201d the woman continued, unfazed by the rude and slightly violent handling.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any concept of how much you stand out?\u201d Ty asked the woman conversationally, not even acknowledging the introductions. \u201cOr how very much I hate you both already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feelings are hurt, they really are,\" Ross muttered as he followed along.</p><p>Sears extricated herself from Ty\u2019s grip and stopped, turning to face him. \u201cWe understand the need for secrecy in certain circumstances, Special Agent Grady,\u201d she said in clipped tones. \u201cBut when the new detail on a case that just lost two agents to a serial killer doesn\u2019t show up when and where they\u2019re supposed to, we tend to get concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time I\u2019ll have Momma write a note,\u201d Ty drawled. She narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYou two are outside orders,\u201d Ross sneered in response to their rude welcome.</p><p>\u201cYour assignment does not include going undercover amongst the working girls,\u201d Sears added.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re even working the case out here,\u201d Ross muttered as he looked down the alley and shook his head in disgust.</p><p>Sears looked at her partner in apparent disapproval. Ross shrugged at her and then looked past Ty to glower at Zane.</p><p>\u201cPublic drunkenness, huh?\u201d Ross snapped at him. \u201cI can smell the beer on you from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo arrest me,\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>\u201cWiseass,\u201d Ross grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working this case beside you, not under you,\u201d Ty snarled to them both, losing the good-humored glint in his eyes as he interrupted the sniping. \u201cDon\u2019t go tailing us when you\u2019ve got more important shit to do. You want us, you fucking call us on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a card?\u201d Sears asked with a little smile, still completely unintimidated.</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips twitched in slight amusement again, and he reached out and took her hand. He reached under his jacket with the other, finding a pen in one of the inner pockets as Ross bristled angrily. Ty ignored him and held the woman\u2019s hand in his, writing a number on the palm of her hand and then sliding the pen back into place slowly without releasing her.</p><p>She smirked at him, looking him over in amusement and just a hint of interest, before she slid her hand out of his and took her partner\u2019s arm to pull him physically away as Ty smirked after them.</p><p>Zane took the few steps to stop beside Ty and watched them go, simmering. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be trouble,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not,\u201d Ty grinned as he watched them walk away. Ross\u2019s hand now gripped Sears\u2019 elbow rather than the other way around, preventing her from looking over her shoulder at them as he griped about sexual harassment. \u201cThey don\u2019t think much of us, which is just how we want it.</p><p>They\u2019ll want to work this case on their own, keep us out of the loop. Plus, see how possessive he is? He won\u2019t let her near us again,\u201d Ty chuckled darkly as he cocked his head to admire the sway of her hips.</p><p>Zane looked after her. \u201cHe won\u2019t, huh? What did you do? Cop a feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight need me a Sears catalog when we get home,\u201d Ty drawled out with a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Zane murmured. He dropped the cigarette butt to the concrete and ground it out under his heel.</p><p>Ty sighed and looked around at the empty street corners. \u201cLooks like our quarry has gone to ground.\u201d He growled in annoyance, beginning to walk slowly in the direction from which they\u2019d come. \u201cDid you happen to look at the report on that sheet the body was wrapped in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleached Egyptian cotton, six hundred-count king-size flat sheet, only sold at two places in New York; Bloomingdale\u2019s and Henri Bendel.</p><p>Retail cost four hundred-fifty dollars. No catches, no pulls, no tears, no stains besides blood, still smelled like plastic, thought to be fresh out of the package,\u201d Zane rattled off as he lit up another cigarette.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone follow that up?\u201d Ty asked before they crossed the street at a jog.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Morrison and ask him to have someone call the stores. All the report says is that neither had them in stock for a five-day span around the discovery of the body. Bendel\u2019s had a linen sale the weekend before,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they were flying off the shelves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Ty groaned. \u201cWe\u2019ll go by tomorrow and talk to whoever.</p><p>What else? Were the sheets changed with the two dye girls? Was it in the report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in the report said they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d Ty muttered. There had to be a connecting factor.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find the damn thing,\u201d he muttered to himself.</p><p>Zane stopped for traffic, working his way through the cigarette. \u201cI still want to go back to the office.\u201d</p><p>Ty exhaled heavily. \u201cDo you understand what we were doing tonight?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Zane looked at him, not sure if he should be offended, but still irritated merely on principle. Ty looked over at him and raised a questioning eyebrow. \u201cEnlighten me,\u201d Zane invited tightly.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s an insider that got Reilly and Sanchez, then he may already be tailing us,\u201d Ty explained quietly. \u201cI wanted to see if I could spot anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using yourself as bait?\u201d Zane asked disbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting hysterical?\u201d Ty asked eagerly. \u201cCan I smack you?\u201d</p><p>Zane merely sighed and looked away before he could give an acerbic response.</p><p>Ty grunted in mock disappointment. \u201cAnyway, if you do go back to Federal Plaza, make sure you\u2019re not alone, and keep an eye on your six. I\u2019m crashing,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d Zane said curtly. He ground his teeth as Ty snorted, and they each loped across the street to come to the front of their hotel. \u201cI usually get going about seven in the morning,\u201d Zane told Ty. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNights,\u201d Ty grunted as he headed toward the lobby doors. \u201cI\u2019ve been working nights. I\u2019m on hour thirty-something trying to right them, so I really couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, stubbing out the cigarette on the brick wall outside the doors and tossing it in an ashtray sitting outside the doors. \u201cJust come bang on the door when you\u2019re ready in the morning. I\u2019ve got plenty to keep me busy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He walked toward the parking garage, hands in his jacket pockets.</p><p>Ty just grunted in return as they parted ways.</p><p>Zane stopped and turned to watch Ty stalk the last several feet into the hotel. Pondering the puzzle of Ty Grady, Zane made his way to the car.</p> <p>He was infuriating at best. An absolute bastard at worst. And Zane had to grudgingly admit that he might just be good at his job.</p><p>ZANE sat at the table, feet propped on the air conditioner unit, notepad in hand as he looked through reams of reports. Paperwork was spread out all over the desk, the small round table, the floor, the second bed, the dresser ...</p><p>even on top of the television. He\u2019d taped maps to the wall and stuck up photos from the crime scenes. Right now, they were in dated order, but he\u2019d move them around as he formed ideas about how they fit together. Their concentration might be on the two agents who were killed, but the serial itself was just too fascinating and frustrating to leave alone.</p><p>He mulled over the ideas about the bodies, the idea Ty had prodded him about last night. He\u2019d made a simple list of how they were found, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel that the killer was following a script of some kind.</p><p>Dropping his heels, he reached over to the bed to snag the photos of the tokens left behind at each scene.</p> <p>There was a gilded mirror found with the twins. A pair of linked plastic rings like the type found in princess costume kits for little girls left with the dyed roommates. A pair of dog tags, complete with rabies licenses, were discovered by the first victim\u2019s maid after the man had died of the meth overdose. The hooker, left in her sheet in the middle of a graveyard, had been left with a small, empty wooden box.</p><p>Zane knew they all made sense somehow. He just wasn\u2019t seeing it yet.</p><p>The slow rapping on the door interrupted him and he glanced up, immediately on guard. In theory, he should be fine; if someone was there to kill him they likely wouldn\u2019t knock. Still ... he picked his gun up from the tabletop and held it slightly behind him as he walked to the door and checked the peephole.</p><p>Ty stood in the distorted little circle of Zane\u2019s view with his head tilted back and his eyes closed, swaying slightly on his feet as he waited. Zane pulled his head back and blinked, then removed the chain and opened the door, shoving his gun into his waistband at the small of his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d Ty muttered to him in greeting.</p><p>Zane tilted his head and pulled the door open further, amused by how out-of-it Ty looked. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty grumbled. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep for shit. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Too much reading before bed. My head\u2019s swimming.</p><p>You coming in? I\u2019ve got coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink coffee,\u201d Ty grunted as he remained in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cAny epiphanies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than thinking this guy may be some kind of creative freak show genius? No.\u201d Zane shook his head. \u201cGive me a minute to get myself together.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked back into the room, stopping at the dresser to grab his wallet and push it into the back pocket of his jeans. They weren\u2019t going with the usual suits and ties for this job in order to further the inept fa\u00e7ade, so he wore just a thin cotton Henley and jeans. It brought back memories of his assignments before he\u2019d been dumped in Cyber. He noticed with some amusement that Ty wore faded jeans that were losing the denim at their knees and a camouflage T-shirt that read, \u201cYou Can\u2019t See Me and I\u2019m Right in Front of You\u201d in small yellow print. Over it he wore the green canvas jacket he had passed over the night before. Zane wondered if he coordinated his outfits to look like a slob or if he just really was one.</p><p>\u201cI think until we figure out what the hell the connection is, we need to concentrate on the agents,\u201d Ty was saying as he stepped into the room and let the door fall shut. He looked around at Zane\u2019s piles of files with a sleepy frown and ran his hand through his short hair.</p> <p>Zane lifted his shoulder holster from the bed and shook it out. \u201cAt least with them we can backtrack. According to the notes, the team was having trouble ... building ....\u201d His words trailed off as his eyes unfocused in thought.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Ty asked flatly, still too tired to be confused yet.</p><p>Zane just stood there for another long moment, then raised a hand to make a wait motion. He turned slowly in a circle, looking at the paperwork, trying to nudge what caught his attention. Then his eyes fell upon the timelines he had tacked up next to the photos.</p><p>\u201cBacktracking. The team is having trouble figuring out where the victims were that night. That day. Even the day before,\u201d Zane mumbled. Then he turned sharply on his heel and looked down at a particular stack of papers.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s nabbing them and keeping them? There wasn\u2019t much evidence of restraining or struggle,\u201d Ty pointed out doubtfully.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow furrowed, and he pulled the straps of the holster through his fingers idly as he skimmed the reports. \u201cNo. But I think he\u2019s watching them. Studying their patterns, then taking them when they\u2019re detached from attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Ty nodded as he watched Zane with one eyebrow cocked. \u201cYou\u2019re not, like ... going into a trance, are you?\u201d he asked dubiously as he observed the distant look in Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Zane blinked out of it. \u201cYou try sifting through several thousand bits and pieces of data and see how aware you can be,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>Ty snorted in a derogatory manner and shook his head. \u201cWhatever, man. I\u2019m always aware,\u201d Ty drawled through a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Zane muttered, pulling his gun out of his waistband, checking it and sliding it home. \u201cWe\u2019re going out to the scene, right? Out on the street, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich scene?\u201d Ty asked as he leaned against the door.</p><p>\u201cThe last site. The one that\u2019s still intact,\u201d Zane answered as he moved his jacket to reach for two small black sheaths.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever hear from whatshisface about whether they were ready?\u201d Ty asked as he watched Zane with a small smirk. \u201cDid the terrorists attack while I was asleep?\u201d he asked sarcastically, nodding at the vast array of weaponry.</p><p>\u201cAlways be prepared, right?\u201d Zane prodded as he pushed up his sleeves, slid on the sheaths, then covered them and pulled on his jacket, sparing a silent thank-you to God that it was October and he didn\u2019t have to get creative to hide the armament. \u201cYes, Morrison set it up; we\u2019ll head over after we meet Detectives Holleman and Pierce at two. So we have three hours, and I\u2019m eating first. We'll probably miss lunch. And Scott\u2019s coming in to meet us at six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goody,\u201d Ty responded flatly, clapping his hands together in a mock display of excitement.</p><p>Zane picked up the keys and turned to face Ty, inclining his head. \u201cOf course, if you have a hot date lined up, feel free. It\u2019ll be dry, boring stuff, I\u2019m sure.\u201d He felt fairly sure his patronizing tone would get just as enthusiastic a response.</p><p>\u201cI dislike that woman,\u201d Ty returned easily. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? She\u2019s very good at her job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also a raging bitch,\u201d Ty answered flatly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cYeah, so?\u201d</p><p>Ty merely shrugged negligently. \u201cWe have history. Why do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be able to work with her, then you need to skip the meeting,\u201d Zane said. \u201cNo point in butting heads.\u201d He paused. \u201cOf course, you seem to enjoy that sort of thing ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself, man,\u201d Ty huffed.</p><p>Zane actually let a smile escape, and the light brightened his dark eyes. He studied Ty for a few moments, undeniably amused. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>He swung the keys on his fingers. \u201cIs the feeling mutual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope so,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>Zane\u2019s smile grew and he felt the urge to snicker. \u201cWell,\u201d he drew out, \u201cmaybe she\u2019s utterly charmed by you\u2014being that she\u2019s a raging bitch, and all. Like drawn to like, you know?\u201d he said as he walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cLogic doesn\u2019t mesh with the fact that you\u2019re a raging bitch, too, and you hate me,\u201d Ty pointed out drolly.</p><p>Zane glanced back at Ty, not fazed by anything Ty said anymore.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d your night go after you left me?\u201d Ty asked as he followed.</p><p>\u201cQuietly. Henninger was still in the office so he got me the maps I wanted, tracked down pictures of the tokens left at each scene,\u201d Zane said, pulling the door shut behind them. \u201cThen I got coffee and came back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the itinerary, man,\u201d Ty muttered sarcastically. \u201cI was referring more to the anyone following you, trying to kill you, getting laid aspect of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could have been so lucky for the latter,\u201d Zane said, his voice dry.</p><p>\u201cNo. No one followed me, no one tried to kill me, and no one propositioned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame,\u201d Ty sighed sadly. \u201cAnything bother you at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for Henninger around the office, no. He\u2019s so eager it even makes me wince. Morrison\u2019s even worse. I imagine you wanted to kill them right off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ty affirmed with a nod.</p><p>Zane snickered. \u201cAnd you accused me of being a candy-ass brown-noser.\u201d They walked across the lobby toward the parking garage elevator. \u201cI think Burns must have put us together figuring we\u2019d strangle each other and do his job for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really on the chopping block?\u201d Ty asked in some surprise.</p><p>Going quiet for a long minute as they entered the elevator and it started moving down, Zane finally shrugged, emotionless mask sliding back into place. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. Probably. I\u2019ve been told several times that I\u2019m on thin ice, no matter how stellar a job I do. I guess it depends on who\u2019s jonesing for an example that week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExample of what?\u201d</p><p>Zane looked over at him significantly. \u201cAn example of what not to do. How not to behave. Who not to be. To show others what happens when you fuck up royally. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with the feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly know what you mean,\u201d Ty sniffed daintily as the elevator doors opened. He stepped out and started toward the car.</p><p>Zane snorted, clicking the key fob and unlocking the car.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you\u2019re a reformed version of me?\u201d Ty asked with a derisive snort as he went around to the passenger side.</p><p>Zane got in the car and pulled on his seat belt, all the while wondering why he allowed this conversation to continue. \u201cI am not reformed. I just want to keep my job,\u201d he said curtly as he started the car. \u201cIf that means acting like a yes-man in the office, wearing a damn suit, keeping my opinions to myself, and kowtowing to the directors, that\u2019s what I'll do.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted again as he shook his head. \u201cForgive me if I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t buy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Ty answered bluntly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean, Grady?\u201d Zane asked as he started the car and put it in reverse. \u201cIt\u2019s not all that difficult to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have carefully created yourself,\u201d Ty told him candidly.</p><p>\u201cThis whole overly reformed bright and shiny image you want to project. It\u2019s all very bad cop movie. And I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of it?\u201d Why should he care what Ty thought about how he dealt with life now? There was nothing wrong with what he was doing to stay in the Bureau.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the fact that you want to project it,\u201d Ty answered with a soft laugh. He shook his head again in amusement. \u201cIf you were truly reformed from any state of less than perfect, you\u2019d keep your mouth shut about your past. You\u2019re doing a lot of telling and not enough showing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo help me God, I am going to thrash you to within an inch of your life someday,\u201d Zane gritted out, simmering. Possibly because Ty was right, in a way; Zane had reformed, but he wasn\u2019t proud of it. On some level maybe he did want people to know this wasn\u2019t the real him. \u201cYou drive me absolutely insane. And I\u2019m almost sure you do it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you better when you\u2019re angry,\" Ty responded absently as he looked out the window at the passing scenery. \u201cIt\u2019s more natural to you.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cYou like me better when you\u2019re making fun of me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never made fun of you,\u201d Ty responded instantly. \u201cMaking fun of you would imply that something about you is fun.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s hand shot out to smack Ty\u2019s chest with the backs of his knuckles. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Ty cried out in surprise, rubbing his chest and scowling.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d he muttered in protest. \u201cDon\u2019t you know you\u2019re supposed to wait at least a week before you physically assault your new partners?\u201d Ty asked plaintively as he rubbed his chest where Zane\u2019s class ring had thumped against his sternum.</p><p>\u201cI must be out of practice. You\u2019re the first partner I\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d Zane said, trying not to think about the last one. A real partner. Not an assigned one.</p><p>\u201cPft,\u201d Ty responded with a roll of his eyes and another yawn he tried and failed to repress.</p><p>Zane halted the car at a stoplight and turned his chin, eyes glancing over Ty. His eyes were sunken and dull, and he still looked exhausted. \u201cYou need some more rest?\u201d he asked. \u201cWon\u2019t be able to concentrate for shit if you\u2019re tired.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou worry about your own self,\u201d Ty griped.</p><p>He thought some of the sharpness hadn\u2019t returned to Ty\u2019s voice, so Zane didn\u2019t push. Seeing a sign for a diner, he turned the corner and parked in a Police Only space on the side of the street. \u201cFood,\u201d he said happily.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Ty muttered as he stared out at the diner. \u201cCan\u2019t you eat stale bagels and shit like normal people?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all have our vices. You want to eat a stale bagel and brighten your oh-so-lovely disposition with constipation, be my guest,\u201d Zane invited as he got out of the car.</p><p>\u201cKiss my ass,\u201d Ty shot back as he sat in the seat and huffed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe after breakfast,\u201d Zane answered with saccharine sweetness as he shut the door and walked toward the diner, lighting up and pausing just around the corner to smoke.</p><p>After a couple minutes, Ty got his holster redone correctly and his jacket collar straightened, and he trudged after Zane into the greasy spoon. \u201cI think I just got heartburn by osmosis,\u201d he grumbled as he sat down opposite Zane. He didn\u2019t trust New York eateries as far as he could fling one.</p><p>Zane ignored him, looking over the menu with a content expression.</p> <p>\u201cMmmmm. Waffles,\u201d he murmured, giving them proper consideration.</p><p>Ty just rolled his eyes and waved his hand at the waitress. \u201cEggs, bacon,\u201d he ordered. \u201cAnd my idiot friend here would like a stale bagel,\u201d he said with a wave of his hand at Zane.</p><p>The waitress raised her eyebrow and looked over at Zane questioningly, who just rolled his eyes. \u201cWaffles and sausage links. And orange juice.\u201d The waitress nodded, chewing her gum, and took off after making note of their orders.</p><p>\u201cI appear to be moving up in the world,\u201d Zane pointed out, deliberately prodding at Ty all he could while the man was tired and not as snappy with the comeback as yesterday.</p><p>\u201cBy being an idiot?\u201d Ty asked with a tilt of his head. \u201cYeah, I suppose that is a step up from your usual state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than a prickly ass,\u201d Zane commented, turning his head to look out the window.</p> <p>\u201cOther than the little bit of buckshot still left in it, my ass is perfectly smooth, I\u2019ll have you know,\u201d Ty replied easily.</p><p>\u201cI hope so, since I\u2019m supposed to kiss it after breakfast,\u201d Zane said facetiously as the waitress arrived with his drink.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do that before lunch,\u201d Ty cautioned. \u201cCan I have an orange juice, please?\u201d he asked the waitress with a brilliant smile that fell back into a tired frown immediately after she turned away.</p><p>Seeing the wide-spectrum mood shift on Ty\u2019s face, Zane let the odd moment of teasing die and instead watched MSNBC on the television over Ty\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSee? I can be nice,\u201d Ty pointed out as they sat there.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes shifted to Ty, and he nodded. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m only a little suspicious of what you\u2019re going to want, but nice is good. For a change.</p><p>Occasionally.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat there looking at him for a long moment, face expressionless.</p> <p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he finally muttered.</p><p>Lips twitching, Zane did, until the waitress came over with their food.</p><p>He thanked her politely.</p><p>\u201cSo, aside from being annoying and shaving every four hours, what is it you do, exactly?\u201d Ty asked Zane as he picked up a piece of bacon and crunched into it.</p><p>\u201cI just finished six months in a stock market brokerage\u2019s computers,\u201d</p><p>Zane answered evenly.</p><p>\u201cIs that a euphemism for Hell?\u201d Ty asked seriously.</p><p>\u201cVery nearly,\u201d Zane said, voice dark. \u201cI have new respect for the nice, plain insanity of terrorists after those cyber freak bastards.\u201d</p><p>Ty hummed noncommittally and crunched another piece of bacon, finally waking up some more and shaking off the last of the exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you come up with last night, anyway?\u201d he asked finally. \u201cDid I ask you that?\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled a little. \u201cYeah. And the answer was noth \u2014\u201d The smile fell off his face as his eyes focused totally over Ty\u2019s shoulder, and without warning he was up, tossing a twenty on the table. \u201cTime to go,\u201d he said sharply, pulling out his cell phone as he stalked past the television and out the door.</p><p>Ty cursed quietly and gathered his bacon in a napkin haphazardly as he got up to follow, glancing up at the lurid red letters scrolling across the television screen: \u201cNYPD reports Tri-State killer strikes again.\u201d</p><p>ird flu,\u201d Ty repeated in disbelief as the medical examiner gave them the autopsy report. He held a white mask to his face, \u201cBe refusing to put the little elastic bands over his ears. \"What the hell?\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded and shrugged as she handed Special Agent Ross the file. \u201c \u2018What the hell\u2019 is not my job,\u201d she answered with a small smile that showed in her eyes. The white mask she wore over her nose and face covered the rest of the expression.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t bird flu pretty rare?\u201d Ty asked her in a mystified voice. \u201cHow would he get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201dWell, more than two hundred confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A viruses have been reported since 2004,\u201d the ME answered, sounding to Ty as if she were reciting facts she\u2019d just recently looked up.</p><p>She flipped her hair over her shoulder and frowned. \u201cThe virus isn\u2019t easily sustained from human-to-human transmission, but it can mutate to be highly contagious. Still,\u201d she went on with a shake of her head, \u201cthe most likely source would have been from handling dead birds that were infected.</p><p>And, to my knowledge, there haven\u2019t been any reported cases in the Tri-State area in at least three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ...,\u201d Ty prodded as he leaned closer expectantly.</p><p>\u201cUnless he was traveling in east Asia or the Middle East, Special Agent Grady, I don\u2019t believe he would have been able to contract it by natural means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was intentionally infected,\u201d Ross concluded with a frown.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Zane demanded before the ME could even answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather wait to get the preliminary reports before speculating too much,\u201d she answered hesitantly. \u201cBut the easiest way to do it\u2014and safest for the person who did it\u2014would have been an injection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long would it take for an injection like that to infect someone?\u201d</p><p>Special Agent Sears asked, looking up from her notes. Sears and Ross hovered near the exam table. Ross merely held his mask to his face like Ty did and looked down at the body in distaste. He handed the file to Zane absently without looking up.</p><p>\u201cIncubation period would be about the same as if he were infected in more typical ways,\u201d the ME answered. \u201cI can tell you that bird flu does not have to be lethal. Most cases, in fact, if treated promptly, there\u2019s a full recovery. That\u2019s pretty much the extent of my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is, either he didn\u2019t know he was sick, didn\u2019t care that he was sick, or wasn\u2019t able to get to a doctor?\u201d Ty asked with a deeper frown.</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d the woman nodded.</p><p>\u201cFor two weeks?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cWere there any signs of restraint or struggle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d she answered with a shake of her head. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d she asked as Zane flipped open the folder and started reading. \u201cI've got more in the morgue.\u201d</p><p>Zane closed the file and looked back up at her. \u201cThank you, Karen. I hope we won\u2019t be seeing you again while we\u2019re still breathing,\u201d he said. She gave him a little laugh.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and looked away. She shook their hands and went back to work, and Zane turned to look at Ty. \u201cWe need to talk to the cops.</p><p>Number one, why didn\u2019t they call us first\u2014before the damn press got hold of it? And number two, see if they\u2019re having any luck connecting the victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s their job,\u201d Ty responded pointedly as he nodded his head at Sears and Ross. They both gave him disgusted looks as Zane glanced over at them and raised an expectant eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get right on that,\u201d Sears said to them in annoyance as she jerked her head at her partner and they both stalked out of the room.</p><p>Ty looked down at the body, still on the table and covered mostly by a sheet. \u201cBird flu,\u201d he murmured in a slightly mystified voice.</p><p>Sighing, Zane tapped the file against his hand. \u201cAnd another token.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d Ty asked dejectedly.</p><p>\u201cA black feather,\u201d Zane answered with a frown. \u201cIt\u2019s the first one that\u2019s made any sense when you consider the method of killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Ty responded distractedly, still frowning as they made their way out of the morgue. \u201cI need ... I need to go somewhere and just look,\u201d he finally said in frustration as he took his mask and tossed it into a nearby waste container.</p><p>Zane stopped and looked at his partner as he removed his own mask, tilting his head. \u201cWhere do you want to go? Crime scene?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cSomewhere empty,\u201d he answered with a wince.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they have a meeting room at the field office with a whiteboard we can use,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cThere are classrooms at Federal Plaza. Most times they\u2019re empty, if there\u2019s not a team in training,\u201d Zane offered. \u201cHenninger told me about them last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? What else did the kid tell you?\u201d Ty asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cHe suggested putting you out of your misery,\u201d Zane answered pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cYour gun ain\u2019t big enough, son,\u201d Ty drawled with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cAt the risk of sounding clich\u00e9d, I've never had that complaint before,\u201d Zane answered, turning to lead the way toward the car.</p><p>Ty remained where he was and tilted his head to watch Zane as he walked down the hall. \u201cI\u2019ll believe that when I see it,\u201d he scoffed finally, smirking as he followed.</p><p>\u201cSomehow I just don\u2019t believe you\u2019re remotely serious about that,\u201d</p><p>Zane replied without looking back or breaking stride.</p><p>\u201cYour loss, Brutus,\u201d Ty laughed as they came up to the elevators and he punched the button.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cBrutus?\u201d he asked. \u201cAs in Brutus and Cassius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, man, if you say so,\u201d Ty laughed.</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Zane got on the elevator once the door opened.</p><p>\u201cYou know, at first I was insulted by the way you treat me. Then I realized it\u2019s not personal; you treat everyone like shit. I find it doesn\u2019t bother me all too much anymore,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cUsually I only don\u2019t bother people I want to see naked,\u201d Ty told him seriously as the elevator rose. \u201cSo stop it. You\u2019re freaking me out.\u201d</p><p>Zane watched his partner curiously as several people filed into the elevator from the hallway. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind,\u201d he said under his breath as they walked out. The slightly suggestive tones of Ty\u2019s words freaked him out, too.</p><p>The walk and drive to the office were quiet, and his mind wandered back to the case. They made it into the office and secured one of the empty classrooms with a minimum of fuss, mainly because Ty didn\u2019t request one\u2014</p><p>he just took one over.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty grunted as soon as they had settled in. \u201cSo, what do we know about the latest victim?\u201d he asked as he thunked the stack of paperwork down on the table in the middle of the room and went to the wall where a whiteboard was bolted up. He grabbed the dry-erase marker and began scribbling the names of the victims. \u201cThe new victim,\u201d he started. \u201cPrison tat on his arm was pretty clear, so he\u2019s not squeaky clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFile says he was paroled two years ago. Clean record since then,\u201d</p><p>Zane said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Ty muttered as he began writing in the physical characteristics of each victim, excluding the two FBI agents. Age, race, height, weight, hair color, eye color. \u201cWell,\u201d he said as he stepped back and cocked his head. \u201cThey\u2019re all Caucasian?\u201d he offered weakly.</p><p>\u201cActually, no, the stock broker was biracial and the roommate was Latino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d Ty cussed as he made the corrections. \u201cThey\u2019re too random to be random,\u201d he muttered, neither noticing nor caring that the statement would make little sense outside of his own mind.</p><p>Zane raised his brow. \u201cDidn\u2019t I say that yesterday?\u201d he asked, forcing himself to be patient. Somehow.</p><p>\u201cYou say that like you think I listen to you,\u201d Ty responded instantly, a smile pulling at his lips.</p><p>Zane snorted in irritation, scooted his chair back, and crossed his legs restlessly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not the victims at all,\u201d Ty went on as he sat on the edge of the table. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re just wrong place, wrong time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Zane allowed. \u201cBut what\u2019s been done to them is very specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm hmm,\u201d Ty nodded. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we look for the trigger.</p><p>Either the way the scenes are staged or the method of killing.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded slowly. \u201cYes, I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a goddamned yes-man for a partner, damn it,\u201d Ty snapped.</p><p>\u201cStuff the attitude, asshole,\u201d Zane snarled.</p><p>Ty turned his head to look back at Zane and grinned. \u201cBetter,\u201d he said approvingly.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes for a moment and then looked up at the ceiling, shook his head, and forced himself to take a deep breath before looking back down at the papers.</p><p>Ty continued to watch him, narrowing his eyes as he did so. \u201cYou should do that more often,\u201d he told him. \u201cLet go and tell someone to fuck off, I mean. Makes you look less like you\u2019re about to have a coronary.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t look like I\u2019m going to have a coronary,\u201d Zane objected stiffly.</p><p>\u201cSure, you don\u2019t,\u201d Ty responded placatingly. \u201cHave you had your blood pressure checked lately?\u201d</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes. \u201cNot recently. Are you insinuating I ought to?\u201d</p> <p>Ty shrugged noncommittally and smiled crookedly. \u201cThat or unclench your ass a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d Zane muttered. \u201cAny other advice you want to bestow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some friendly counsel,\u201d Ty shrugged as he turned to look back at the white-board.</p><p>Zane watched his back, wondering why the conversation had turned semiserious. He didn\u2019t like it. \u201cWhat do you care?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked down and to the side slightly, not moving otherwise as he watched Zane in the periphery of his vision. \u201cWhat makes you think I do, Hot Shot?\u201d he countered in amusement.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking a \u2018fuck off\u2019 would fit really well about now, so, fuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it bother you so much?\u201d Ty asked in amusement as he turned slightly and looked at his partner. \u201cWhat do you care what I say or do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you, I don\u2019t do violins. So back to your whiteboard,\u201d</p><p>Zane said crankily. He wasn\u2019t going to open himself up for more criticism. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you insult me,\u201d he claimed, looking like he\u2019d bit into something sour.</p><p>Ty grinned widely and turned back around. He enjoyed irritating Zane more than he had others in the past. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but he did. \u201cThey never ran a check of the phone calls made to and from Sanchez\u2019s hotel room,\u201d</p><p>he said abruptly. \u201cWe should look into that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReilly and Sanchez\u2019s,\u201d Zane muttered, not feeling all that charitable.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Ty asked distractedly.</p><p>\u201cThey shared a room,\u201d Zane reminded. \u201cThey were partners. There were two of them?\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at the man for a moment and then curled his lip before looking back at the board. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he finally grunted. \u201cI\u2019d also like to look at their belongings,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cMaybe there was a token left and the investigators just didn\u2019t recognize it. Might give us something.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t recognize it, but you think you will?\u201d he inquired with a small sneer.</p><p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d Ty answered vaguely.</p><p>Zane shrugged and made a note. \u201cAs good as anything else we\u2019ve got.\u201d He slid his finger down another column of notes. He sighed quietly, trying to remember what he\u2019d been reading the night before. \u201cWhy am I not seeing lab reports for skin and nail scrapings?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up with a frown, then back down at the report in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said as he picked up another and paged through it. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re not in yet?\u201d he suggested doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost two weeks,\u201d Zane said as he continued to flip through sheets. \u201cThey should have been in with all the other lab work.\u201d He pushed out of the chair. \u201cI\u2019m going over to the lab. Maybe they\u2019re just stuck in with the ME\u2019s notes. You want to come?\u201d</p><p>Ty groaned slightly. \u201cNot really,\u201d he answered honestly as he looked back up at the board.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re taking this inept and lazy objective a little too far,\u201d</p><p>Zane complained.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Ty murmured with a serious glance up at Zane.</p><p>Zane met his gaze for a long moment before turning his back and walking out of the room. He\u2019d hit a nerve of some kind, and Zane wasn\u2019t about to go poking a Recon Marine. Not without at least two guns in hand.</p><p>Storing the tidbit away, he headed down the quiet corridor, and his footsteps echoed on the worn floor.</p><p>When he entered the records room off the lab there was no one at the desk, so he leaned over it, calling out a hello. He heard movement back in the stacks of files, but didn\u2019t see anyone. He skirted around the desk and peered into the well-lit recess, but there was no one there.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with something, Special Agent Garrett?\u201d Henninger asked from behind Zane with a tinge of amusement in his low voice. Zane glanced over his shoulder, concealing a small jolt of surprise. The young agent leaned against the desk Zane had just passed, seemingly having appeared out of nowhere. \u201cIt\u2019s lunch break. No one down here,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Zane recovered from his surprise quickly and gave the young agent a small smile. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my interrupting whatever you\u2019re doing for a bit, maybe you can help me find some records?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Henninger asked as he gestured for Zane to follow him.</p><p>\u201cSome of the medical examiner files from the third and fourth victims, about two weeks ago. There would have been routine skin and nail scrapings and hair clippings, that sort of thing. They\u2019re not in the resource file,\u201d Zane explained.</p><p>\u201cThird and fourth,\u201d Henninger replied with a nod. \u201cThose were the girls with the dyed hair, right?\u201d he asked Zane.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane answered as they walked between the stacks. \u201cWhere\u2019s your partner?\u201d he asked curiously. He hadn\u2019t seen Morrison since yesterday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cTaking a long lunch,\u201d Henninger answered haltingly. \u201cGirlfriend thing,\u201d he explained with a glance back at Zane.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips curled slightly. Henninger was obviously covering for his partner. That, at least, was admirable in a way. It made him wonder what it would be like to actually like his own partner enough to even consider covering his indiscretions. \u201cHere\u2019s the file number,\u201d he offered, politely leaving off the questions as he handed Henninger a piece of notepaper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already got the file, though, right? The hard copy?\u201d</p><p>Henninger asked. \u201cI\u2019ll look it up on the computer, see if the sheets got misplaced,\u201d he offered as he turned down a long row of shelves and toward a nook in the side of the room that housed three computers. The FBI logo turned lazily on two of the screens, while the third sat black and dormant.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I checked the hard copy out with the others last night,\u201d Zane said, flipping through the file of his own notes he\u2019d brought with him.</p><p>Henninger sat down at the computer on the far left and began tapping at the keys rapidly, entering his badge number and pass code and then steering through a number of pages as he tried to locate the correct file. They navigated the electronic stacks unsuccessfully for some time before there was a sudden pop and a hiss from the machine that was sitting dark.</p><p>Zane glanced over at it with a flinch as it popped again, and without any other warning the computer and monitor exploded in a blast of glass, metal, and singed plastic.</p><p>Henninger cried out and covered his face, ducking away from the mini-explosion and thumping to the ground to cover his head as the muted sound and crack of shattering glass bounced hollowly through the large room.</p><p>Zane was less fortunate. He only had time to turn his back and take half a step away, cursing a blue streak as glass, plastic, and heated air whooshed toward him to slam into his back, debris cutting through his jacket, shirt, and skin.</p><p>The heat made him stumble forward, and he fell roughly to his knees into the glass and metal shards that littered the floor as pain seared through him.</p><p>The computer\u2014or what was left of it\u2014sizzled angrily in the alcove.</p><p>There were no sprinklers in the stacks to put out the small fire the explosion caused. In the hallway there was shouting and running feet; agents coming to investigate and give aid.</p><p>Zane groaned and reached up to touch the back of his neck. It felt like it had been cut to pieces, and that feeling was pretty much confirmed as his hand came away bloody. \u201cGoddammit,\u201d he hissed. At least he still had on his thick canvas jacket. It had probably saved him from being seriously sliced up.</p><p>The crunch of heavy feet on glass warned Zane that someone was walking up behind him, slowly and calmly through the chaos.</p><p>\u201cYou touch my back and I will beat the fucking hell out of you,\u201d Zane growled to whoever it was. He could feel the glass moving with his jacket, some of it through the canvas and into him. Ouch. Ouch.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Ty murmured in his ear as a gentle hand came to rest on the back of Zane\u2019s head.</p><p>Zane hissed at even that light touch. The exposed skin was inlaid with glass fragments and starting to well with blood that trailed in rivulets down into his collar.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Ty asked as more footsteps pounded on the concrete floor. \u201cCall an ambulance!\u201d he barked at the first men who came in. They scrambled to do so.</p><p>\u201cComputer blew the fuck up. Where\u2019s Henninger? He was sitting here....\u201d Zane tried to push off his hands to sit back on his heels.</p><p>\u201cI said don\u2019t fucking move,\u201d Ty hissed angrily as he held Zane down and looked around. \u201cKid\u2019s moving; he\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Trying to stay in one spot, Zane set his hand back down on the floor littered with debris. \u201cMonitor was dark when we came in,\u201d he said. \u201cThe others had screensavers.\u201d He flinched as he felt the blood run from the back of his neck over and around to drip down the curve of his throat.</p><p>Ty frowned as he listened, reaching down and plucking bits of glass out of Zane\u2019s jacket. \u201cNo way whoever set it could have known when it\u2019d be used,\u201d he answered, picking bits of glass out of the jacket like a chimp grooming its mate. \u201cWe need to move.\u201d</p><p>Zane winced as Ty freed a particularly jagged chunk of glass. \u201cYou think someone did this on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think everyone likes to randomly blow shit up,\u201d Ty answered sarcastically. \u201cWhere else are you hurt? Anything internal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else? You don\u2019t see enough?\u201d Zane asked sharply. He took a slow, deep breath despite the prickling pain. \u201cNothing inside. My neck. Feels like I\u2019ve been hit with needles all over my back and down my legs, too. I\u2019m bleeding under the jacket.\u201d He could feel the warm ooze spreading and wending down to his waistline.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Ty asked as he lifted the jacket gently and peered under it. The jacket itself was ruined, but it looked like a lot of the smaller pieces had been stuck in it. It was just the large, mean pieces that had made it into skin. \u201cYou\u2019ll live,\u201d he declared in a careless voice.</p><p>Zane\u2019s language degenerated as he muttered to himself. \u201cDamn it, I want a cigarette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Ty chastised, trying to keep the concern out of his voice as he bent to help Zane to his feet.</p><p>Zane grimaced as his muscles flexed instinctively and pain shot through him. He hissed as an agent scooted past, jostling him and making him arch his back to keep his balance.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Ty muttered as he reached under Zane\u2019s arms to lift him.</p><p>He had assured himself that no arteries had been nicked, and now he wanted to get the hell out of there.</p><p>Zane climbed awkwardly to his feet, trying not to shift too quickly.</p><p>Once he stood, a good amount of the glass and plastic dropped to the floor, leaving only the pieces that were embedded too deeply to fall out. He kept his head bowed. Straightening his neck felt like it pushed the tiny glass bits in deeper.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Ty said with a pleased smile as he plucked one last larger glass fragment out of the back of Zane\u2019s neck. \u201cWalk it off, man,\u201d he suggested with a smirk as he began leading him by the elbow out of the chaos of the stacks and toward the hallway.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Zane hissed. He admitted, silently, that this was practically nothing compared to the last time he\u2019d been caught by an explosion. It was just the shock of it happening that had thrown him. And it hurt like a bitch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d probably say that if I lost a leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Ty scoffed as they got out into the hall. He looked left and right, then moved Zane to the far wall, out of the way of the people scurrying by, and stepped behind him, running his fingers gently through the back of his partner\u2019s hair and removing loose glass pieces. \u201cI\u2019d probably say hop it off,\u201d</p><p>he corrected with a barely restrained snicker.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t even try to hold back the snort, his eyes fluttering shut as he felt Ty\u2019s fingers brush his scalp gently. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one,\u201d he admitted wryly, moving his arm and dripping blood onto the carpet.</p><p>\u201cQuit it,\u201d Ty chastised with another brush through Zane\u2019s hair and another glass shard removed. \u201cYou wanna wait for the EMT crew to get here?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr do you want me back at the hotel with a pair of tweezers and some peroxide so we can avoid the possibility of being yanked off this case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow in a shower with the last bit and you\u2019ve got a deal. I hate EMTs. \u2018Breathe evenly, Special Agent Garrett.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t move, Special Agent Garrett.\u2019 \u2018Don't worry, Special Agent Garrett, it only feels like we\u2019re removing your arm with a dull hacksaw.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cShake a leg then, Special Agent Garrett, before they see you covered in blood and detain you,\u201d Ty said as he took Zane\u2019s elbow and began pulling him down the hallway toward the elevator. The sentiment gave Zane enough motivation to move, despite the painful prickling and sharp jabs, and they made it before any medical personnel made an appearance on the scene. As the elevator doors closed, Zane set his hand against the wall to lean against it and hissed instead, jerking back his hand to pick at a piece of twisted plastic embedded in his palm.</p><p>Ty merely watched silently, inwardly wincing in sympathy. \u201cAt least you had your back to it,\u201d he offered finally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReflex,\u201d Zane answered. \u201cI actually had my side to it.\u201d He lifted his hand to his mouth as a trickle of blood seeped from the abused skin just under the curve of his chin.</p><p>\u201cEh. Ass, face, same difference,\u201d Ty muttered with a shrug.</p><p>Zane\u2019s good hand flashed out and smacked Ty upside the back of the head.</p> <p>\u201cOw! What the hell?\u201d Ty cried as he rubbed his head and huffed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I repress the Instakill for you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Zane sniffed and pried at a piece of glass in the heel of his hand. \u201cMy lucky streak is about played out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a little cheese with that whine, maestro?\u201d Ty drawled.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Zane replied tightly, not even wanting to think about wine. The pain was worse moving, and he was not looking forward to sitting in the car. \u201cLet\u2019s just get to the hotel. I feel like a pincushion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook like one, too,\u201d Ty observed dryly as the elevator doors opened.</p><p>\u201cAfter you, Oh Injured One,\u201d Ty invited with a sweeping gesture of his hand.</p><p>\u201cWant me to commandeer a van?\u201d he asked with a bit of gleeful anticipation in his voice.</p><p>Zane looked at Ty sideways. \u201cWhy do you have that \u2018I\u2019m up to something ever-so-wrong\u2019 sound in your voice?\u201d he asked suspiciously as they got outside and approached the car.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Ty answered defensively. \u201cDon\u2019t bleed on the seats,\u201d he added with a huff as he slid into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cGod, I hate driving in the city,\u201d he muttered under his breath.</p><p>Closing his eyes as he sat carefully and felt glass chunks dig into the backs of his thighs, Zane\u2019s face went very still as he gritted his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m not wearing the damn seat belt,\u201d he said as he gripped the door handle to keep himself from leaning back.</p> <p>\u201cYou could try not sitting on the parts that got hit,\u201d Ty suggested.</p><p>\u201cJust get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Ty grinned as he tore out of the parking place and out of the parking deck in record time. He hit the lights as they got to the street. \u201cI love the flashy blue lights,\u201d he told Zane almost gleefully.</p><p>Groaning, Zane braced one hand on the seat behind him. Despite Ty\u2019s reckless driving, they got to the hotel quickly and in one piece without leaving carnage behind, so he didn\u2019t say a single word. By the time they got upstairs, Zane seriously wanted several stiff drinks. Hell. A bottle.</p><p>\u201cStrip,\u201d Ty ordered as soon as the door was closed. \u201cAnd face down on the bed,\u201d he added as he took off his jacket and tossed it onto the back of a chair, then began rolling up his sleeves.</p><p>Zane walked over to the corner of the room and carefully shrugged out of the jacket, seeing glass chunks scatter on the carpet as he dropped it.</p><p>Instead of trying to pull the holster off, he pulled at the straps to totally unfasten it, and he carefully set it and the gun on the stacks of files covering the small round table. It was followed by the sheaths, but for one knife that he pulled and used to handily slice open his Henley from collar to waist, not willing to try pulling it over his head. The back of the shirt was matted with blood, and he let it drop, too, hissing as the fabric pulled debris fragments loose as he peeled it off.</p><p>He unfastened his jeans and shoved them over his hips with another hiss, leaving his legs mostly free of glass. He toed out of his shoes and socks, leaving them under the jeans, and stepped free to the foot of the bed. He crawled onto the mattress in nothing but his boxer briefs and settled on his belly with several winces.</p> <p>Ty watched him with a furrowed brow, his face unreadable as his eyes followed the bits of bloody clothing to the floor. He snapped open his KA-BAR folding knife with a distinctive metallic clink as he stepped closer to the bed.</p><p>Pressing his lips together hard, Zane closed his eyes. It occurred to him that he just might need to be worried, but he made himself dismiss the thought. He wasn\u2019t all that sure he trusted Ty, but he did trust him enough to think he wouldn't maim or kill him, given the chance. Grady had already had those chances.</p><p>Ty knelt on the bed beside him, surprisingly gentle as he tried not to jostle Zane too much, and he leaned to his side, putting his head beside Zane\u2019s ear to get a better look at the glass fragments. \u201cGoing to have to dig for some of \u2019em,\u201d he told Zane with that same gleefully anticipatory tone of voice he had used earlier.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Zane murmured tightly, not moving. It would hurt like hell, but it all had to come out. At least the damage wouldn\u2019t require surgery this time. He would have sighed at Ty\u2019s seeming enjoyment, but it would have required him to move.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t touch him for several moments, just hovered next to him on the bed peering over the wounds quietly. Finally, he moved, the rustle of his clothing and the slight dip in the bed the only indication that he was even still there. A moment later cold steel touched the skin of Zane\u2019s nape. Once, twice, three times in rapid succession, merely brushing over the skin as if Ty were touching the side of the blade to his skin experimentally and then raising it again. The movement was repeated several more times, the only sound a swish of cotton and the tinkle of glass shards being deposited into Ty\u2019s hand after every three or four flicks of the knife.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes squeezed shut and his fingers curled in the bedspread, but otherwise he didn\u2019t move or make a sound. He was breathing shallowly to keep his back still, and he thought after this a good, angry fit was in order.</p><p>Some of the glass felt like pins being removed as Ty scraped, just little pricks.</p><p>Other times he felt the knife cut in, and his breathing stilled as he felt the glass pry loose, leaving a tiny gouge behind.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in the service they had us testing this stuff,\u201d Ty told him in a conversational manner as he saw the muscles in Zane\u2019s back bunch with tension. \u201cIt was called Dragon Skin Body Armor. They wanted us to see how far it could go, you know, before it would give in. Put it through the wringer.</p><p>And since we were these crazy-ass Recon boys with a bit of a reputation for destroying government property, they figured we\u2019d be perfect to do it. Well, we took that shit everywhere with us. Threw it out of planes, planted landmines under it, tossed grenades at it, ran over it with a Humvee. My buddy and I even set it up on this pole once and launched a ground-to-air missile at it. God, that was funny as hell,\u201d he mused with obvious fondness.</p><p>\u201cOnly damage we ever did to it was tear the cover fabric,\u201d he told Zane in a tone that could have been respect. \u201cBut the Bureau don\u2019t allow it. You tell me why that is, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they don\u2019t want us to turn into pansy-asses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatural selection, maybe,\u201d Ty responded with a snicker. \u201cYou ain\u2019t smart enough to run away from the grenade, you get weeded out.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled and winced. \u201cFuck, don\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d he practically begged.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d Ty warned with a hand pressed to the back of Zane\u2019s head. He laughed suddenly, nearly snorting as he said, \u201cI\u2019ve had dates like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. Now, he develops a sense of humor,\u201d Zane complained.</p><p>\u201cPlease leave some skin intact? I\u2019ll need it to match the other scars back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could just connect them all,\u201d Ty responded with a brush of his finger over the mess of thin white scars covered with blood. He didn\u2019t ask what had happened. For someone who had seen combat, wounds from a car bomb or something similar were fairly obvious. What he did want to ask was how Zane would come by such mementos. He refrained, though. Mainly because he didn\u2019t really care all that much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d look like a spider web,\u201d Zane said, muscles shifting under Ty\u2019s fingertips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just call you Spiderman,\u201d Ty offered with a smirk. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about him to make jokes,\u201d he added with sincere disappointment.</p><p>Zane snorted and the muscles in his back involuntarily clenched and shifted, catching against the knife. Ty jerked the knife back and immediately whapped Zane on the head for moving. \u201cShit,\u201d he huffed as blood welled where his knife had cut into Zane\u2019s skin. \u201cAsshole. That ain\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back to work,\u201d Zane ordered curtly. \u201cI need to bleed some more before I can have my afternoon bender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve definitely had dates like this,\u201d Ty responded with a small smirk.</p><p>\u201c\"You mean you actually date? You must pick some real winners. I need to meet one of them,\u201d Zane said with obvious snark in his voice.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Ty answered sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Zane muttered, setting his chin back on his crossed hands.</p><p>Then he shifted uncomfortably. \u201cThere\u2019s a chunk below my right shoulder blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ty responded testily. \u201cStop moving,\u201d he cautioned again as he pressed his hand down on the back of Zane\u2019s head. Zane stilled, but the smile still pulled at the corners of his mouth between grimaces. Ty had to lean closer, bracing his free hand on Zane\u2019s other side as he peered across the plane of Zane\u2019s back. \u201cThat might be metal,\u201d he observed in a detached sort of manner. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna hurt like a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Zane said drolly, curling his fingers into the bedspread and laying his forehead against his wrists. \u201cGlad I\u2019ve had my tetanus shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can\u2019t drink, but what about some painkillers?\u201d Ty offered.</p><p>Zane pressed his lips together. \u201cI don\u2019t take them,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty said with a nod. \u201cSo ... want a stick to bite?\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cIs it gonna be that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ty answered honestly. He shook his head and finally just gripped the piece of jagged plastic-covered metal and yanked it.</p><p>The pain was so sudden and sharp that Zane didn\u2019t even get to inhale before it streaked through him. His neck and back went rigid and his face went white, and by the time he gasped a breath in he was unable to do anything but just lie there, trembling. After several heartbeats he spoke, voice low, clipped and heartfelt. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s gonna hurt,\u201d Ty murmured as he put his hand on the back of Zane\u2019s head again and rested it there. \u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d he said with a little pat of his hand.</p><p>The muscles in Zane\u2019s back slowly started to flex as he cautiously moved to check for what he could feel. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said quietly, as he started to push himself up.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just stay down?\u201d Ty suggested seriously.</p><p>Zane turned his chin to look at Ty, studying his face and not seeing any sign of teasing or disgust. He sighed, letting his shoulders slump and his mask crack. The pain and exhaustion showed more fully upon his face as he lowered himself back down onto the bed, still moving very cautiously and stiffly. What a bitch of a day, and it was only half over. He shifted his eyes to Ty, but he didn\u2019t have anything else to say to the man. He didn\u2019t want to insult or tease right now, and that was about the extent of their relationship, besides having the same employer.</p><p>Ty nodded in satisfaction and hefted himself up from the bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to clean some of that off, okay? Got to go get some things from my room; I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here,\u201d Zane murmured, not droll at all. His patience, his energy, and his pain threshold were all tapped. If he\u2019d let himself joke about it, it might help, but he didn\u2019t want to let go of what little reserve and dignity he had left.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Ty ordered yet again as he headed for the door. He left the room with the latch pulled so he could get back in, and he jogged down to his room and moved as quickly as he could to gather his small medical kit, not even bothering with the lights. After a brief glance around the dark room he realized that something felt off. The curtains were drawn and there was barely any light for him to see. The stench of Zane\u2019s blood on his hands and shirt was beginning to hit him; he hadn\u2019t stopped to wash it off. The hair on the back of his neck began to rise, and he gathered his bags and left the room as quickly as possible, promising himself he\u2019d come back to investigate when he hadn\u2019t left his partner helpless and injured in an unlocked room.</p><p>When he got back to Zane\u2019s room, his pulse was a little higher than he would have liked. Zane hadn\u2019t moved. He still sprawled on the bed on his belly, cheek pillowed on one hand, the other curled in the bedspread as he breathed carefully. His eyes opened and looked right at the door when Ty entered, and then he relaxed again.</p><p>\u201cHow ya doin\u2019?\u201d Ty asked in a slightly tense voice. He wondered if it was something legitimate hat had caused his alarm or if he had just been on the edge for too long and was finally losing his grip. Finally he decided that he was just tense. And not willing to leave Zane alone in this state.</p><p>Zane tried to shift slightly, but stopped abruptly with a wince. \u201cFine,\u201d</p><p>he answered quietly, staring at the wall as he tried to pull together enough strength to get up and get in the shower as soon as Ty was done cleaning him up. \u201cOnce you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll hop in the shower so we can get back to it,\u201d he said. He figured Ty would be chomping at the bit soon, if he wasn\u2019t already, and Zane really, really didn\u2019t want to give the man another reason to razz him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019ve earned the day off,\u201d Ty replied as he came closer.</p><p>\u201cDay off?\u201d Zane echoed in surprise, craning his head to look at Ty and flinching as his neck pinched.</p><p>\u201cSomeone tried to maim you today, Zane,\u201d Ty responded evenly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProbably me, too, but they didn\u2019t know how lazy I am. That someone, in case it\u2019s gone under your radar, has access to restricted Bureau areas in a federal building and was close enough to know when to detonate that bomb.</p><p>We pretty much confirmed Burnsie\u2019s suspicions. I\u2019m thinking spontaneously exploding federal property is a long way toward proof that this guy is a Fed.\u201d</p><p>Zane set his forehead back against the pillow, straightening his neck to relieve the slicing ache. He\u2019d noticed Ty had called him by his first name.</p> <p>It sounded odd coming from his new partner. He sighed softly. \u201cSo it really is one of us,\u201d he said sadly.</p><p>\u201cAt least he isn\u2019t trying to kill us, yet,\u201d Ty muttered and frowned as he glanced over Zane\u2019s nearly nude, bloody body worriedly. \u201cUnless you\u2019d been sitting on the damn thing, a blast that small wouldn\u2019t kill you. It was just enough to take you off the case.\u201d He continued to stare at the man for a long, thoughtful moment. With a sigh, he decided to go all out and treat Zane like the partner he was going to have to be. For a minute, at least. \u201cMy room made me nervous,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Zane shifted his chin, and his slightly narrowed eyes tracked over to Ty. \u201cThink someone was in there?\u201d he asked. Zane knew Ty wouldn\u2019t say something like that unless it was for real. One good thing about all that trash he talked was that you knew when he was serious.</p><p>\u201cCould have been Housekeeping,\u201d Ty hedged with a shrug. \u201cCould have been me being paranoid \u2019cause I\u2019m fucking covered in your blood. I didn\u2019t see anything out of place. Just ... felt it. Probably nothing. But I\u2019m going to sleep here tonight, if you have no objections.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t reply immediately. After a short pause he spoke quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll warn you, I\u2019m going to be grouchy as my back really starts hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be on the lookout for that major change of attitude,\u201d Ty responded sarcastically.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes and quashed the impulse to respond in kind.</p><p>\u201cYou probably ought to put stuff on my back after the shower instead of before,\u201d he said regretfully instead, shifting slowly to climb to his knees.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d Ty asked as he watched without moving.</p><p>Stopping once he was on his knees, Zane drew a shaky breath as the abused skin shifted and stretched. He cursed under his breath. \u201cIs there glass on the floor?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019d really rather not walk in it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay there, and I\u2019ll clean you off?\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to have to get up. The bed\u2019s already bloody.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned his head to study Ty, wondering where this solicitous side had come from. Did he just bury it under so much attitude that you couldn\u2019t normally notice? \u201cI\u2019m going to take you up on that offer,\u201d he murmured, slowly shifting to stretch out sideways.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ty nodded with a slight smirk. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress.</p><p>Now you know I\u2019m always right,\u201d he said over his shoulder as he headed into the bathroom to spread out the contents of his medical kit.</p><p>Zane sighed. He should have known Ty would have some kind of angle, the bastard. Zane reached for one of the pillows and pulled it over, stuffing it under his chest to lie on, his arms wrapped around it as he waited.</p><p>In his medical kit, Ty had iodine and gauze, a tin of Rawleigh\u2019s salve, some tape and bandages, and in keeping with his always prepared mantra, a flask of peach-flavored moonshine all the way from home. None of it was worthy of being called a proper medical kit, but it got the job done. He extracted most of it and laid it out on the long counter. He filled the ice bucket with water, grabbed the stack of hand towels, and headed back out into the outer room. Zane was draped over the pillow, long, bare legs extended out over the bed.</p><p>Ty licked his lips and for the first time took a moment to really look at his new partner. It had been hidden under the suit, but there was no denying that he was impressively muscled, at least. And kind of hot, in a stuffed-shirt, stick-up-his-ass sort of way. When he wasn\u2019t covered in blood.</p> <p>He shrugged that thought off and moved closer, kneeling beside the bed and setting the water down next to him. \u201cAll I\u2019ve got to disinfect with is iodine,\u201d he told him as he looked up and examined the wounds. \u201cGonna burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, what\u2019s a little more pain?\u201d Zane bit off tightly, squeezing the pillow tighter.</p><p>Ty was silent as he carefully wedged several towels under Zane\u2019s body to catch the mess the water was going to make. \u201cTakes a lot of strength to say no when you don\u2019t have to,\u201d he finally murmured as he began cleaning the blood with a moistened cloth. \u201cI respect that, if that matters to you.\u201d</p><p>Zane was quiet for a long minute as the cool rag wiped carefully over his back. \u201cThank you,\u201d he finally said quietly. Wouldn\u2019t a glass of whiskey or a handful of Vicodin be great right about now? Hell, even some ibuprofen.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d think a little more seriously about taking the ibuprofen. There were other things he said no to, as well ... most of the time. Things he\u2019d do better not to think about at all. Like the man behind him. Zane could feel the heat coming off him.</p><p>He fell silent for a bit before speaking again. His voice wasn\u2019t self-deprecating or self-sympathetic; if anything it was a little cold and clinical.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I say no to,\u201d Zane murmured without thinking about Ty\u2019s reaction. \u201cBut there\u2019s certainly no one to care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saying you don\u2019t care?\u201d Ty asked curiously.</p><p>Sighing, Zane pressed his cheek to the pillow. \u201cI do care. But it\u2019s the bare minimum of motivation. Like I won\u2019t pick up a bottle because I want to keep a job I love. That doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to caring if I pickle my brains or not. I guess I\u2019ve gotten a bit self-concerned since my youth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with self-concern,\u201d Ty said as he wiped one last time at Zane\u2019s back, then set the cloth aside and reached for the iodine. \u201cI could just do salve,\u201d he offered as he looked at the iodine doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cCompromise,\u201d Zane said. \u201cPut iodine on the worst ones so they won\u2019t get infected. Salve on the rest ought to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll righty,\u201d Ty rumbled, then he quickly spread iodine on the deeper gashes. \u201cWhy\u2019d you drink?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s shoulders tightened in response.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to answer,\u201d Ty went on with a careless shrug. \u201cJust curious.\u201d</p><p>Zane pressed his lips together tightly. \u201cMy wife was killed in a car accident,\u201d he said tonelessly. \u201cI was across the country at the time. Had been for a month.\u201d</p><p>Ty pursed his lips and continued with the iodine, his eyes drifting to the ring on Zane\u2019s finger. \u201cMy condolences.\u201d</p><p>Zane let out a pent-up breath. \u201cI kind of got ... a little out of control.</p><p>Clich\u00e9d, I know, but there it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappens,\u201d Ty responded with another emotionless shrug.</p><p>\u201cSo here I am; widower, alcoholic, addict, all-around asshole turned squeaky clean by force of will, threat of jail, and sheer terror. I suppose it\u2019s no wonder your \u2018pansy-ass\u2019 comments get in my craw,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think much of you if they didn\u2019t,\u201d Ty answered, frankly a little surprised at Zane\u2019s self-description. \u201cAnd we all have our sob stories.</p><p>Nothing to be ashamed over. Being a pansy-ass, that\u2019s something to be ashamed over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a real pansy-ass,\u201d Zane objected. \u201cI just act like one sometimes.\u201d</p><p>That caused Ty to laugh. Hard. \u201cIf you say so, man,\u201d he practically giggled after he\u2019d gotten control of himself.</p><p>Zane thwapped his knuckles back against Ty\u2019s ribs. Hard. \u201cAsshole,\u201d</p><p>he said, in a vaguely fond fashion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an asshole,\u201d Ty objected officiously. \u201cI just act like one sometimes,\u201d he added slyly.</p><p>Zane chuckled tiredly and laid his head back down. \u201cI can live with that,\u201d he murmured after a short pause.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Ty asked in slight surprise.</p><p>Zane wondered why Ty sounded like he didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cYeah,\u201d</p><p>he said simply as he lay still under Ty\u2019s hand, which was spreading some sort of awful-smelling salve over the myriad nicks and cuts. Now that he knew what to expect\u2014mostly\u2014from Ty, he could ignore the worst of it. \u201cYou got a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ty drawled with a smirk as he dipped more of the salve out onto Zane\u2019s back.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute, I\u2019ll think of something,\u201d Ty answered as he finished up with the Rawleigh\u2019s.</p><p>Zane\u2019s expression was torn between a slight frown and an amused smile, and something glittered in his eyes for a change.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Ty huffed finally as he stood up and looked Zane\u2019s back over. \u201cDon\u2019t roll over; you\u2019ll never stop. That shit\u2019s worse than Astroglide,\u201d</p><p>he warned. \u201cI might take a shower,\u201d he added musingly as he looked down at his hands, still covered in blood and now salve that wouldn\u2019t come off without serious scrubbing.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself. My clothes should fit you if you don\u2019t want to go back to your room,\u201d Zane murmured, eyes tracking the other man.</p><p>Ty merely nodded, not admitting that he was hesitant to leave Zane alone. \u201cYour clothes would fit me like a burlap sack. I brought my bag,\u201d he muttered as he wiped his hands off on the towel at Zane\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get you some ice first. I\u2019ll be back,\u201d he added as he picked up the key card to Zane\u2019s room. He\u2019d rather not leave the door open again.</p><p>\u201cHey, give me my gun, would you?\u201d Zane asked as he shifted, only to wince as the skin pulled.</p><p>\u201cWhy, you planning on shooting me in the ass when I turn around?\u201d</p><p>Ty asked sarcastically as he reached for the holster.</p><p>\u201cTempting, but you\u2019d probably get off on it,\u201d Zane said, holding out his hand.</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Ty drawled again, grinning widely as he placed the gun in Zane\u2019s hand.</p><p>Zane\u2019s palm covered the gun, and his fingers curled firmly around Ty\u2019s hand. His eyes had gone serious when he looked up at the other agent.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you help me?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked down at their hands and then up at Zane with open confusion. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>That certainly wasn\u2019t the answer Zane expected. He figured he\u2019d get yet another smartass remark. His face softened slightly, and he nodded slowly, letting go of Ty\u2019s hand. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d Ty responded with a smirk. \u201cJust don\u2019t get your prissy ass hurt again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter watch it, Grady, I might get to thinking you\u2019re taking a liking to my prissy ass,\u201d Zane said, sliding the gun under the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019d like parts of it,\u201d Ty shot back as he headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned and pushed his face into the pillow to muffle his chuckle. Maybe Ty wasn\u2019t quite so bad as he\u2019d thought. Still an asshole, though.</p><p>Ty was gone for perhaps five minutes, quickly filling the ice bucket and grabbing himself a drink from one of the machines. He couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of being watched, no matter how many times he assured himself that he was alone. When he returned to the room, his entire body was tense again.</p><p>Zane slid the gun in his hand back under the pillow once he saw Ty.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Ty answered succinctly as he set the ice down and reached for his bags. \u201cHow\u2019s it feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnoying as hell,\u201d Zane said frankly. \u201cIt\u2019s not killing me, but I\u2019m certainly feeling it. It\u2019s not too bad if I don\u2019t move a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I would suggest not moving, then,\u201d Ty drawled as he set his bags on the other bed and began stripping off his clothing.</p><p>Zane just raised an eyebrow in wry acknowledgment, watching idly.</p><p>Ty yanked off his shirt and tossed it to the floor. He toed off his boots and kicked out of his jeans, sighing with the realization that they\u2019d have to frequent a laundromat if they expected to stay smelling decent.</p><p>He bent and began rummaging through his bag for clean clothing. His body bore the evidence of a life lived in the trenches, and it was easier to see now in the afternoon light streaming through the sheer curtains. Zane got a closer look at the tattoo and realized that it was a drawing of a bulldog wearing the distinctive white cover of a Marine. Two guns crossed behind the dog, the smoke from their barrels forming the letters \u201cUSMC.\u201d It wasn\u2019t possible to make out the finer details. Zane would need to get closer to appreciate the artwork. A lot closer.</p><p>The rest of Ty\u2019s body was covered with battle scars. There were wounds that Zane recognized as gunshots and knife gashes, and several older, more interesting patterns along his side that might have been caused by barbed wire. The one that was most recent was the one he had noticed before, low on Ty\u2019s belly. Zane knew it went all the way through to the back.</p><p>None of it detracted from his physique. Not in Zane\u2019s eyes. Zane had his share of \u201cmementos\u201d from the job. But to him, the Bureau was just a job, albeit one he loved. Ty lived it. Ty did the job because he believed in it, though Zane suspected Ty would never admit it. It was a stark difference, and Zane lowered his chin to the pillow to mull silently over his own choices. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty pulled out a new T-shirt from his seemingly endless supply, one with \u201cExFed\u201d written across the front in purple and green letters, and he slid into it as he turned around and looked over Zane. \u201cSure you\u2019re all right?\u201d he asked, sounding almost self-conscious as he covered up.</p><p>Zane refocused on the man in front of him, blinking a few times. Ty looked uncomfortable suddenly. Worried his partner wouldn\u2019t be up to the task? He spent a short minute thinking of what he wanted to say. This slightly different side of Ty\u2014the man who\u2019d tended his wounds\u2014made Zane feel like he could be a little more open. But the man now in front of him looked uneasy.</p><p>\u201cI will be,\u201d he answered quietly.</p> <p>Ty raised an eyebrow dubiously and pursed his lips. He finally nodded and then looked back down at himself. \u201cI was going to shower,\u201d he muttered, almost talking to himself as he pulled the clean T-shirt off again and flushed slightly in embarrassment. He wasn\u2019t used to being flustered.</p><p>Raising an eyebrow, Zane watched the slight blush cross Ty\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>Seeing such a soft look on the other man stirred something inside Zane, something warm he had to swallow on. \u201cOkay,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll hold down the fort.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and picked up a battered leather toiletry bag on his way to the bathroom. He couldn\u2019t even produce a snappy response. Zane watched him disappear into the bathroom, still a little mystified. He certainly hadn\u2019t said anything he thought could be construed as embarrassing. Sighing, he shook his head just slightly, winced as the back of his neck screamed, and tried to relax, eyes shuttering.</p><p>Taking the minimum amount of time in the shower, Ty washed the blood off and made sure he was reasonably clean. He stepped out of the steamy bathroom with nothing but a towel around his waist, and he peered at Zane closely, trying to determine if he\u2019d gone to sleep. He moved closer and knelt beside the bed, resting his chin on the mattress and looking into Zane\u2019s face.</p> <p>Dimly, Zane sensed his partner close. \u201cWhat?\u201d he murmured softly.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d Ty answered in the same soft tone. \u201cJust making sure you weren\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Zane\u2019s mouth curled up. \u201cWould you miss me?\u201d he asked sleepily, the drowsiness lulling him into the odd question.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Ty answered in a gently placating tone as he reached up and petted Zane on the head to humor him.</p><p>Zane\u2019s soft chuckle was mostly muffled by the pillow. \u201cSure you would,\u201d he said as he went to sleep, trusting Ty to keep watch.</p><p>Ty squatted by the side of the bed for a long time, frowning at Zane\u2019s sleeping face. Thinking hard about it, he realized that he just might miss the guy. Even if it was just because he was so fun to annoy. \u201cDamn you,\u201d he muttered softly.</p> <p>\u201cHEY, Henny,\u201d Mark Morrison greeted from the opening in the curtain around the emergency room cubicle. \u201cAre you maimed for life?\u201d He smirked at his fellow agent.</p><p>Tim Henninger glared up at him and curled his lip into a sneer as the nurse finished his stitches. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for humor right now,\u201d he warned seriously. \u201cI almost lost my fucking eyes, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww. Those puppy-dog eyes you blink at the girls to get your way,\u201d</p><p>Morrison teased.</p><p>Henninger glared at him balefully, wincing with the last of the stitches.</p><p>Morrison rolled his eyes. \u201cGeez.\u201d He glanced around. \u201cSo where\u2019s Garrett?\u201d</p><p>Henninger blinked at him and stiffened. \u201cWhat, he\u2019s not here?\u201d he asked in concern.</p><p>The other agent\u2019s eyes shifted from side to side before he stepped out of the small curtained area. A couple minutes later he rejoined Henninger. \u201cI don\u2019t see him. Could he have been released already?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo fucking way; he was hit harder than I was,\u201d Henninger answered, trying not to frown because it pulled at the stitches. \u201cWas he killed?\u201d he asked in a near whisper.</p><p>Morrison stared at him for a moment, and his lips tightened. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything. The coroner wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he offered flatly. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he come to the hospital if he was hurt?\u201d His eyes narrowed as he thought it over.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s got something to hide? I remember Grady being there awfully fast,\u201d Henninger told Morrison in a hushed voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing Grady at all,\u201d Morrison murmured. \u201cBut I got there after the medics. Was that before or after the thing blew up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter,\u201d Henninger answered with a scowl. His eyes glazed over slightly as he tried to remember the events in sequence. He and Garrett had approached the computers, and he had sat down and typed in the pass code.</p><p>Then he\u2019d had time to do several short searches before the bomb inside the computer had gone off. He remembered he was still wallowing on the ground and bleeding, yelling for help, when Garrett\u2019s asshole partner appeared out of nowhere and started barking orders. He\u2019d been forced to sit through hours of doctoring and interviews while Garrett got away, damn him. Quietly Henninger related what he remembered to his partner.</p><p>Morrison frowned as well. \u201cIf Grady got Garrett out, he couldn\u2019t have been hurt that bad,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe was,\u201d Henninger murmured. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are they hiding? Something\u2019s off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you think they\u2019re dirty?\u201d Henninger asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said anything,\u201d Morrison objected sharply. He looked around them again. \u201cBut it looks bad, you know? Oversight is coming in to interview us. We\u2019ll have to tell them what we saw.\u201d</p><p>Henninger pursed his lips and glanced at the dividing curtain with a sigh. \u201cI fucking hate Oversight,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cShit, Henny. You about got your face taken off. Don\u2019t you want to know who did it?\u201d Morrison asked, crossing his arms.</p><p>Henninger looked up and narrowed his eyes. \u201cOversight is highly unlikely to make that discovery, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cBesides, that\u2019s supposed to be what Grady and Garrett are looking into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saying we should keep our mouths shut?\u201d Morrison asked quietly.</p><p>Henninger stared up at him for a long, silent moment, mulling over the decision. \u201cYeah,\u201d he finally said with a slow nod. \u201cIf they find out Garrett was there, it won\u2019t have come from us, got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Morrison agreed softly. He stared at him for a long moment before turning his eyes away and shifting uncomfortably. \u201cI hate Oversight, too,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAlways picking around in your personal business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should,\u201d Henninger spat. \u201cI swear to God, Mark, if I have to cover for you when you go missing one more time, I\u2019m going to shoot you.</p><p>In a fun place. One that bleeds a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Henny, fine. I\u2019ll be more careful with my fucking lunch dates. That work for you?\u201d Morrison asked, looking a little put out.</p><p>Henninger rolled his eyes and shook his head. \u201cYou could wait \u2019til you\u2019re off the clock like normal people,\u201d he grumbled in annoyance. \u201cIt\u2019s so unprofessional, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough! Jesus! You\u2019re on your damn soapbox again. How come you have to be such a goody two-shoes?\u201d Morrison muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called doing your job, man,\u201d Henninger snapped. \u201cWhere the hell did that doctor go?\u201d he asked with a near growl as he resisted the urge to poke at the stitches. \u201cI want to get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>Ty wasn\u2019t sure when he\u2019d fallen asleep, but he woke with a little gasp and a flail of his arms, still sitting in the chair he\u2019d dragged in front of T Zane\u2019s map of the crime scenes that was pinned to the wall. When he glanced around the room, he saw that Zane was still asleep, having shifted only slightly, perhaps stopped from moving by any pain when his back flexed.</p><p>Ty looked around the room with a frown. He\u2019d been dreaming, but he couldn\u2019t remember anything save for the waking. Had he heard a sound? He grunted and pushed himself out of the chair, walking over silently to kneel next to Zane again.</p><p>The agent\u2019s face was softened as he slept, a little flushed, despite being totally uncovered in the room\u2019s cool air. He slept silently, one arm curled around the pillow against his chest, the other under the pillow that was under his head\u2014most likely wrapped around his gun, Ty figured. His short brown hair was mussed, and he was scruffy, a day\u2019s and night\u2019s worth of whiskers growing out. He looked like a different man.</p><p>Ty reached up to feel the side of his face with the backs of his fingers.</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel fevered, at least.</p><p>He had just pulled his hand back when the vibration at his hip caused him to jump guiltily, and he stood quickly and paced away from the bed as he answered his phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Grady? What is your status?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy status?\u201d Ty asked, feigning confusion.</p><p>\u201cThere was an explosion at Federal Plaza today. Several witnesses claim you and Special Agent Garrett were present and possibly injured in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re both fine,\u201d Ty answered, cutting the voice off. He resisted the urge to ask how Henninger was doing. \u201cSpecial Agent Garrett and I were in the reading room when the explosion occurred,\u201d he said firmly instead.</p><p>\u201cWe left to follow a lead and get out of the way of the EMTs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the information we were given, sir. We were told by several bystanders that Special Agent Garrett was present with an Agent Tim Henninger at the time of the incident, and that he sustained serious injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour information is wrong,\u201d Ty answered matter-of-factly.</p><p>There was a short silence and a rustling in the background. Ty assumed this desk jockey wasn\u2019t accustomed to bald-faced lies, and she didn\u2019t quite know what to do with it. \u201cVery well, Special Agent Grady,\u201d she finally said curtly. \u201cWe request that you submit observation reports as soon as possible, as we are, of course, investigating the incident. May we speak with Special Agent Garrett, please?\u201d</p><p>Ty turned to look down at Zane and raised an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019ll have him call you as soon as he\u2019s out of the bathroom,\u201d he answered before hanging up.</p><p>Zane woke while Ty was talking, and he\u2019d figured out what it was about pretty quickly. When Ty ended the call, he opened his eyes to see the other man watching him. \u201cBathroom?\u201d he asked, amusement in his sleep-laden rasp.</p><p>\u201cI could have said a number of other things that came to mind,\u201d Ty pointed out. \u201cIf they know you were hurt, they\u2019ll yank you.\u201d</p><p>Zane scrunched up his nose as he slowly pushed himself up, only wincing a little. \u201cYeah, probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you didn\u2019t want that,\u201d Ty added pointedly.</p><p>\u201cYou figured right,\u201d Zane answered, sliding to sit on the end of the bed, carefully shifting his shoulder and back, checking his range of motion.</p><p>He was stiff at first, but soon was moving fairly fluidly, the pain a mere annoyance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving better, anyway,\u201d Ty observed. \u201cGuess that stick up your ass helps posture, huh?\u201d</p><p>Reaching his arms up behind him to stretch, Zane yawned, still mostly asleep. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised what that stick up my ass helps with.\u201d He stood up, twisted a little and flinched, then started toward the bathroom, rubbing at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo I even want to know?\u201d Ty called after him.</p><p>Zane laughed as he shut the door behind him, but it died off quickly, and he leaned on the sink looking at himself. \u201cProbably not,\u201d he murmured before turning on the water. He stretched again carefully, grimacing, and looked over his shoulder at his back. While most of it looked okay, a couple of the deeper chunks were red and swollen-looking. He pulled open the door and stepped halfway out. \u201cHey, would you put some more of that stuff on my back? There\u2019s a few....\u201d Zane let the words trail off as he realized Ty was looking at the wall intently like he had heard something. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Ty answered with a shrug, his expression unreadable as he turned his head to look at Zane. He sat on the end of the bed, one eyebrow cocked curiously as he waited for Zane to continue what he had been saying.</p><p>Zane tilted his head, frowning a little. \u201cHelp me out?\u201d he asked, pointing his thumb over his own shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Ty muttered as he stood and strolled over to grab the ointment. \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I move too quick or twist side to side, it\u2019s sharp. Otherwise just a dull ache, a few spikes here and there,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cPansy,\u201d Ty offered with a smirk.</p><p>Zane sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to lose a limb before I get any respect from you, won\u2019t I?\u201d he said, deadpan.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not a whole limb,\u201d Ty answered thoughtfully as he made a dainty little \u201cturn around\u201d gesture with his finger.</p><p>Shaking his head, Zane spun slowly in place, presenting Ty with his back. He closed his eyes at the first touch of Ty\u2019s fingers, telling himself to ignore the yank in his gut.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Ty muttered as he placed his hands on Zane\u2019s tight muscles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn tense, no wonder you still hurt.\u201d He huffed as he prodded at some of the tender spots gently. He dipped his fingers into the tin of salve and began dabbing it onto the open wounds, then massaging it into the areas around them carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou try taking a sheet of glass in the back and not be tense,\u201d Zane objected, though he had to admit to himself it was more than that. Something about Ty was digging at him; the attitude, the bullshit, the hard-ass style\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>none of it fit with the gentle touches of his fingers. Zane\u2019s body was noticing.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Ty responded wryly. \u201cI prefer not to be a moron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered. I\u2019ve moved up from idiot to moron,\u201d Zane said. \u201cAnd you have moved up from utterly reprehensible asshole to only moderately annoying asshole.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly?\u201d Ty repeated with a huff. \u201cIt takes effort to be this abrasive, I hope you realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so. But you just make it look so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make everything look easy,\u201d Ty responded with a smirk that Zane couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t judge that \u2019til I see it,\u201d Zane said with an apologetic shake of his head as he rolled his shoulders under Ty\u2019s fingers.</p><p>\u201cSee what, everything?\u201d Ty asked in amusement.</p> <p>Zane bit his lip on a smile. \u201cYou. Being easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am easy,\u201d Ty replied with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cNow see here, you\u2019ve already proven the opposite. You\u2019re not easy to get along with, you\u2019re not easy to understand, you\u2019re not easy to keep from getting under my skin,\u201d Zane ticked off on his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI think the glass is what got under your skin. And I am perfectly understandable,\u201d Ty said as he let his heavy Appalachian accent take over. \u201cI enunciate,\u201d he replied with special drawling emphasis on the last word.</p><p>Zane chuckled, almost against his will. \u201cI was thinking of you more as a thorn, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Ty objected with false sincerity.</p> <p>Zane sighed and tilted his neck to each side as he felt the texture of Ty\u2019s rubbing fingers change. The salve was sinking in and the skin was catching on skin. \u201cWe should get back to work,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe have the rest of the day off,\u201d Ty replied firmly as he continued to doctor.</p><p>Looking over his shoulder, Zane raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat are you and I going to do with a day off?\u201d he asked. Was the other agent saying they were going to spend time together? Off the clock?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but a few hours\u2019 real sleep would do me wonders. And we can get plenty done right here in the room. Quite frankly, I\u2019d prefer to stay away from Federal Plaza \u2019til I can figure out more about who and how.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded slowly. \u201cAll right. I agree with all that.\u201d Suddenly, he felt awkward, standing there with Ty still touching his back, especially because Zane didn\u2019t want to move. Not at all. He found that a bit frightening.</p><p>He could be partners with Ty. He could, someday, maybe, be friends with Ty.</p><p>But anything beyond that was simply dangerous. Zane raised a hand and swiped it over his face, noticing the prickles. \u201cI should shave,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ty asked, genuinely curious as he finished smoothing the salve over the bloody spots.</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Why shave?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cUh.\u201d He blinked, trying to think.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I have a reason,\u201d he answered with a slight shrug. \u201cHabit.</p><p>Have to be clean-cut, you know. Don\u2019t want to attract negative attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man, that negative attention, pffft,\u201d Ty responded sarcastically as he stepped away, then pushed Zane slightly to the side so he could step through the bathroom door and to the sink to wash his hands. \u201cYou have to sleep in the bloody bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the spread that\u2019s bloody,\u201d Zane said mildly, still rubbing his chin as he walked out of the bathroom and toward the bed. \u201cFood later?\u201d he asked hopefully as he yanked the spread and sheets down.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re fasting \u2019til we catch the guy,\u201d Ty answered with a curl of his lip as he came out of the bathroom with a hand towel in his hands.</p><p>With an annoyed grunt, Zane snagged one of his pillows and whacked Ty upside the head with it.</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Ty barked as he swatted at the pillow with the damp towel.</p><p>Zane laughed and bapped him again. \u201cNow who\u2019s got a stick up his ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShove it,\u201d Ty huffed as he pulled back the sheets on his own bed.</p><p>Collapsing onto his bed, Zane was careful to stay on his side and keep an eye on Ty just in case he launched a counterattack. \u201cYou\u2019re just a big softy,\u201d he taunted.</p><p>\u201cThe last person said that to me got Viagra in his coffee next morning,\u201d Ty warned seriously.</p><p>Zane buried his face in the pillow to try to muffle the sounds of his laughter. \u201cOh, God. You would, too.\u201d His eyes were wide and dancing when he looked back up.</p><p>\u201cOf course I would. He had to question a guy,\u201d Ty told him with the beginnings of a laugh in his voice. \u201cThree hours he was in there, trying to hide this raging hard-on. I\u2019ve never seen a suspect more terrified in my life.\u201d He snickered with the memory.</p><p>Zane pulled the pillow over his face, stifling the continuing laughter as he tried to get himself under control. Finally he sighed and looked back at Ty, shaking his head. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m warned.\u201d He kept a straight face for a long moment, but ruined it when his lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Ty groaned as he flopped onto his side, turning away from Zane, and pulled the covers up over his head.</p><p>Chuckling, Zane shifted the pillow back under his chest and lay against it, settling where he could gaze at Ty\u2019s figure under the sheets. As he watched, Ty lifted his head up again and reached for his pillow, then burrowed his head under it. Zane couldn\u2019t help but smile at how innocent and almost childish the action seemed. He recognized it as a habit of someone who was accustomed to sleeping in the daylight hours, and the thought charmed him.</p><p>Who would have thought they\u2019d play off each other like this? He\u2019d not wanted a drink or a cigarette all afternoon. Being in pain and keeping up with Ty was absorbing. One minute Zane hated him. The next, he thought he just might be able to like him. Conflicted, he sighed, closed his eyes, and let sleep overtake him.</p><p>TY had barely managed to find the state of unawareness that came just before sleep when Zane\u2019s phone began to trill demandingly. He jerked and hopped from the bed, still half-asleep and tangled in his sheets when his feet hit the floor.</p><p>Zane lifted his head and squinted at the bedside table where his phone almost bounced around. \u201cGreat,\u201d he muttered. He sat up carefully, reached for the phone, picked it up, and looked at the number. He glanced at Ty, who was still standing and blinking blearily at him as he flipped open the phone.</p><p>\u201cHello, Serena.\u201d</p><p>Ty opened his eyes wide and shook his head, reaching up to rub at his eyes like a tired toddler as he looked around the room. He had been out of the service for almost seven years, and he still got out of bed before he woke up.</p><p>At Zane\u2019s mention of the caller\u2019s name he growled wordlessly and thumped down on the side of the bed with a grunt. They\u2019d forgotten about their dinner appointment with the profiler.</p><p>Watching Ty carefully, Zane made agreeable noises as Serena talked.</p><p>Then she said something that got his attention. \u201cYeah?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cYou heard that?\u201d Ty merely glared at him as he listened. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d</p><p>Zane finally answered as the profiler on the phone kept talking. \u201cSo, dinner?\u201d</p><p>He listened again and nodded. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d Another pause, and Zane\u2019s eyes flicked to Ty.</p><p>Ty practically snarled at him, but gestured to him that he would be included in the meeting.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s coming,\u201d Zane said quietly. Then after listening for another few seconds, a soft smile curled his lips.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Ty muttered under his breath as he pushed to his feet and padded over to his bag to begin rifling through his clothing.</p><p>\u201cYes, Serena. Okay. See you in a bit.\u201d Zane thumbed off the call. He watched Ty silently as the other man moved. He was rummaging through his duffel bag and apparently trying to find something he wasn\u2019t able to get his hands on.</p><p>When the silence stretched on, he looked over his shoulder at Zane.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she have to say?\u201d he asked flatly.</p><p>Zane watched him, the mask in place. \u201cShe\u2019s glad you\u2019re coming to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Ty asked, feigning interest. \u201cWhy, could you hear her loading her gun?\u201d he asked as he pulled free a flat, folded bag and frowned at it.</p><p>\u201cSharpening a knife, actually,\u201d Zane said lowly as he got out of bed.</p><p>Ty grumbled disconsolately as he unzipped the bag in his hand and extracted a perfectly pressed black dress shirt. \u201cWhat did she really have to say?\u201d he questioned as he laid it carefully on the bed and then reached behind him to yank his T-shirt over his head.</p><p>Zane blinked at the shirt as he walked over to his own bag. He pressed his lips together, trying to decide how or if to answer. \u201cShe said you\u2019re dangerous,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>Ty pulled the shirt over his head and peered over at Zane with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>Zane looked over his shoulder to see Ty\u2019s reaction. \u201cSo? You\u2019re dangerous.\u201d It would be interesting to hear Ty\u2019s reply.</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d Ty protested in an insulted voice.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Zane said, pulling a clean dark red shirt out of his bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with Serena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a raging bitch,\u201d Ty answered as if that should be obvious.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty huffed in annoyance as he picked up his shirt and slid into it fluidly. He shrugged his shoulders, flexing unconsciously against the soft, tight material to make certain he didn\u2019t pull at the seams, and then he glanced around for his boots.</p><p>Zane studied him closely. \u201cShe\u2019s good at her job. One of the best,\u201d he said, slowly and carefully pulling the shirt over his head, but his eyes returned immediately to Ty.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I have to like her,\u201d Ty grumbled as he flopped down on the end of the bed to pull his boots on.</p><p>\u201cApparently, she feels the same.\u201d Zane fell silent as they finished getting dressed. \u201cShe said I shouldn\u2019t trust you,\u201d he finally stated. \u201cThat you\u2019re trouble. That you only look out for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Ty agreed in a clipped voice as he finished buttoning his shirt and carefully smoothed it down. \u201cWhere are we meeting her?\u201d</p><p>Zane slid into his holster with a wince and a grimace. \u201cChinatown.</p><p>We should be able to hoof it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZANE Garrett,\u201d the tall, svelte woman said as she stood from the small table in the Chinese restaurant. \u201cAlmost a year is too long.\u201d</p><p>He easily accepted her embrace, barely keeping himself from flinching. \u201cGorgeous as always, Serena,\u201d he greeted before kissing her cheek lightly. She was, too, with the face of an angel and blonde hair to match. Too bad it didn\u2019t fit her innate personality. Because Ty was right; she really was a raging bitch if you didn\u2019t live up to her standards.</p><p>Serena smiled brilliantly. \u201cFlatterer.\u201d She turned to sit back down.</p><p>\u201cGrady,\u201d she greeted curtly in the barest acknowledgment of Ty\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cMiss Scott,\u201d Ty responded as he pulled out the chair opposite her and slid into it. His tone was surprisingly more civil than it usually was.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes flickered between them as he sat down, wondering about the past between them Ty had mentioned. \u201cI wish we could have met under better circumstances, Serena,\u201d he said to the woman.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, if you\u2019d come to New York more often, it wouldn\u2019t be such a problem,\u201d she said, propping her elegant chin on one palm. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long without a visit.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips quirked into a smile. \u201cWhat can you tell me about the murders?\u201d</p><p>Serena sighed. \u201cStraight to business, huh? I miss the old you, Zane,\u201d</p><p>she said, glancing at Ty. \u201cDid you read up on the serial?\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and glanced around for a server. He raised his hand and got the attention of a woman passing by as the other two talked. She came over, smiling at him, and he gestured for her to come closer. When she bent over next to him he turned his head and whispered into her ear, \u201cI\u2019m going to need something highly alcoholic that looks like water.\u201d</p><p>She remained motionless for a moment, then she straightened back up and smiled at him again. \u201cWednesday Night Special, yes, sir,\u201d she said to him softly before turning away. Ty watched her walk away, smiling in appreciation of her discretion and then returned his attention to the table.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve formed some opinions of our own,\u201d Zane was telling Serena, though he watched Ty\u2019s exchange with the waitress distractedly. \u201cWe\u2019d like to hear yours, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou show me yours,\u201d Serena invited with a flirtatious smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou first, dear,\u201d Zane responded in the same tone.</p><p>Serena smiled warmly at Zane before giving Ty another unsavory glance.</p><p>\u201cLook, we\u2019ll get business out of the way then I\u2019ll leave you two to it.</p><p>Deal?\u201d Ty offered as he met her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy Special Agent Grady, I didn\u2019t realize you had the ability to be reasonable and gracious,\u201d Serena observed sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Ty grunted. \u201cCall it self-preservation,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Serena said in her liquid-honey voice as she favored Zane with another look. \u201cWhat is it exactly that you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, first of all, why is the NYPD being such a pain in the ass?\u201d</p><p>Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cTurf wars, of course,\u201d Serena said, rolling her eyes. \u201cYou know all about that ... don\u2019t you, Ty?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty looked up from the empty water glass he had been examining and stared at her, not responding otherwise.</p><p>Zane looked between them and wondered if this had been such a good idea after all. \u201cSerena, behave,\u201d he said lowly. She turned light, calculating eyes on him for a long moment, and Zane knew what she was doing. A day ago he would have almost looked forward to Serena and Ty going at it like he knew they were about to do.</p><p>She waited another long moment and then smiled. \u201cSince you asked nicely,\u201d she said finally.</p> <p>\u201cGive us a basic profile on the serial, please,\u201d Zane requested, noting that Ty was still holding his tongue.</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane and narrowed his eyes. He didn\u2019t know why they were here, and he didn\u2019t think they needed to be dealing with this woman. She couldn\u2019t tell them anything they didn\u2019t already know, and she was a pain in the ass to be around. Ty and Serena could go back and forth at each other all night, twisting knives in old wounds and making new ones until they were both curled up in their respective corners and crying. They\u2019d done it before.</p><p>The part she enjoyed most was watching Ty losing his temper and shouting at her. And the only way he could avoid doing that was to keep biting his tongue or drink. Or both. He preferred both.</p><p>\u201cI believe he\u2019s sane and sending a message of some kind. He\u2019s an organized killer, probably plans the murders far in advance. Likely follows the victim for days, maybe weeks before he takes them,\u201d Serena shared.</p><p>\u201cOdds are he\u2019s got his next victim, or possibly next two, already picked out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s watching the investigations?\u201d Ty asked in a low voice, curious to see if she agreed with them in that respect as well.</p><p>\u201cClosely,\u201d she answered with a smug look at Ty, as if gloating about the fact that he had asked her opinion.</p><p>\u201cAnd not just in the media,\u201d Ty murmured, letting her know what they had been thinking.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d she responded easily, still looking at Ty and seeming to measure him.</p><p>Zane got the very distinct feeling that Serena knew a lot about Ty and his past that Zane didn\u2019t, and he wondered if he could learn anything about his new partner from what was obviously a biased source. He might have to get Serena alone later just to pump her for information. He couldn\u2019t force himself to stoop to reading Ty\u2019s file yet. It just didn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible he has a peripheral role in the investigation that allows him access,\u201d she went on as Ty nodded silently. \u201cYou think it\u2019s someone internal,\u201d she said to him with a small smile. \u201cIs that why they brought you two in?\u201d she asked as she turned her calculating gaze back to Zane. \u201cTo run around in the dark and cause internal trouble? Tyler here is very good at that sort of thing.\u201d</p> <p>Zane cleared his throat and sat back as the waitress returned with Ty\u2019s drink and took their orders. Once that was taken care of, he blatantly ignored her last comment and continued on. \u201cIt is possible that it\u2019s someone in the Bureau or NYPD,\u201d he acquiesced. \u201cI\u2019ve flagged a list of items missing from the reports. Different pieces, all small and somewhat inconsequential. It may all be chance ... but I doubt it. So I went looking.\u201d</p><p>Serena glanced between the two men, eyes lingering on Ty suspiciously. \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d she asked Zane.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Zane answered with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll need to talk to the handling agents in each case, and frankly, the details are so minor they don\u2019t rank being worried over, other than the fact they\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded. \u201cIf you need assistance with the ME, let me know. Karen and I go way back.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s face transformed as he smiled openly, eyes bright. \u201cI love it when you\u2019re so helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019ll pay for it later,\u201d Serena cooed as she glanced at Ty again, almost as if the continuing flirtation were a challenge to him. \u201cSo. Ty,\u201d</p><p>she said suddenly. \u201cI won\u2019t say it\u2019s nice to see you. But at least you\u2019ve got a good man to work with on this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a real Boy Scout,\u201d Ty answered flatly as he met her eyes unerringly.</p> <p>Though she smiled at him, her eyes were utterly frigid. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck him over like you did your last partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerena,\u201d Zane said sharply.</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn her chin to look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Zane? Surely you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll hurt his feelings. He doesn\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re still spending more time on your colleagues than your cases,\u201d Ty responded calmly. \u201cHow\u2019s that workin\u2019 out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve still got the highest successful profiling record in the region, so it\u2019s working out pretty well, thanks,\u201d the woman answered.</p><p>\u201cEasy to be a success when you hand off the hard ones,\u201d Ty drawled.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t figure it out, so you hand it off on an overworked Feeb, let him take the fall if he fails.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, but continued to smile. \u201cSometimes the white flag is all you can do for a case. You didn\u2019t fail, though, did you, Tyler? Made quite the case out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter four more people died, sure,\u201d Ty answered without flinching.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Serena,\u201d Zane broke in, voice low and serious. \u201cI called you for information, not so you could pick a fight with my partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut picking fights with your partner is so entertaining, Zane,\u201d Serena drawled. \u201cSurely you\u2019ve found that out by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Zane responded coldly.</p><p>Serena sniffed and turned a disappointed moue on Zane. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun anymore, you know? I liked you a lot better when you still drank.\u201d She reached over and picked up Ty\u2019s glass, taking a dainty sip and nodding in approval.</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes slightly, experiencing an odd feeling of possessiveness as the woman spoke. It seemed that he could bitch at Zane about his problems all he wanted, but no one else could without ruffling his feathers. \u201cSee?\u201d he asked Zane conversationally. \u201cRaging bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA raging bitch who used to care more about solving murders than picking fights,\u201d Zane said pointedly, and Serena shifted her eyes to him.</p><p>The woman went totally still, and her cold gaze would have struck many men dead on the spot. \u201cDon\u2019t cross me, Zane,\u201d she warned suddenly.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your husband?\u201d Zane asked pleasantly. \u201cStill no pre-nup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucker,\u201d she hissed in response. \u201cDon\u2019t call for my help again; you can figure this shit out all by yourselves,\u201d she snapped as she stood abruptly and looked between the two men. \u201cYou know, Zane, I would never have thought to say this, but you\u2019ve turned into a real bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Ty responded in gleeful surprise. He looked from the offended woman to Zane in amusement and then threw his head back and laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not officially on the case, but I know you have notes,\u201d Zane responded seriously. \u201cSend them to us,\u201d he said in a tone that brooked no argument. \u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p><p>She was so angry that high spots of red peaked on her cheeks and the hand on her purse was curled tightly like a claw. \u201cThis makes us even, Garrett,\u201d she spit out. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I won\u2019t remember this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat to see you again, Serena. Let\u2019s not make it so long next time,\u201d</p><p>Zane drew out as sincerely as possible.</p><p>She gave him another dark stare and turned her back on them, flouncing out the door. Once the glass shut behind her, Zane leaned back and scowled. Ty was still laughing heartily, possibly the first time he had truly done so since their partnership had begun, and he was beginning to have trouble catching his breath. Patrons were turning to look at them, some smiling and giggling as Ty laughed contagiously.</p><p>Zane shook his head as he watched Ty. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re amused,\u201d he muttered. \u201cShe could have helped us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her huff off like that!\u201d Ty laughed breathlessly. \u201cOh, my God, I think I can die happy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a spitfire, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d As long as she didn\u2019t turn on them, Zane figured they\u2019d be okay. He wouldn\u2019t put it past her to cause them trouble just to spite him, though. \u201cThat\u2019s one good contact I ruined for you, partner,\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s laughter trailed off, and he shook his head, still smiling slightly.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I owe you a thank-you for putting up the Big Blue Shield,\u201d he said to Zane sarcastically. \u201cThanks,\u201d he offered sincerely.</p><p>Zane nodded slowly and sighed, finally relaxing again. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to pay her off anyway,\u201d he murmured. His back hurt enough without more scratches.</p><p>\u201cEh. We don\u2019t need her,\u201d Ty responded dismissively as he took another sip of his drink.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that, All-Knowing One?\u201d Zane asked as the waitress came by with drinks for Zane and the now-departed Serena. After a quick explanation, the waitress headed off to cancel the meals and get the check.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell us anything we didn\u2019t already know,\u201d Ty pointed out logically. \u201cBesides. We already got a profiler,\u201d he added with a small smile as soon as the waitress had left.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Ty raised one eyebrow mockingly and then raised one finger with a little smirk.</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re trained to profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, indeed,\u201d Ty answered with another small sip. \u201cHow did you think I knew her?\u201d he asked with a cock of his head as he gestured toward the door. \u201cI was put here in New York my first year out. Any case she couldn\u2019t handle got shuffled over to me,\u201d he said with a sniff. \u201cWe certainly never fucked,\u201d he continued pointedly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cYou missed a hell of a ride, then.\u201d</p><p>Ty groaned with feeling and actually shivered in distaste. \u201cI\u2019d rather fuck you than her,\u201d he muttered thoughtlessly as he looked over at the door she had stomped through.</p><p>Snorting, Zane lifted his glass for a drink. But his eyes stayed on Ty, and his gut cramped uncomfortably as he watched him.</p><p>ZANE\u2019S stomach woke him a couple hours after they crashed in the hotel room. It was dark outside, and he was contemplating getting up and yanking Ty out of bed to go and find food since they had skipped dinner. When he heard Ty shift and mumble, Zane sat up with a wince and turned on the lamp between the two beds. He tilted his chin to look at the other man.</p><p>Ty rolled onto his back, body tangling in the sheets around him, and he stretched and growled and grumbled noisily. He looked different asleep; softer, somehow, which Zane supposed made sense. Younger, too. He wouldn\u2019t have thought it before, but it was pretty clear now that Ty was younger than he was, and not by just a little.</p><p>Ty made a few more sleepy growling noises and stretched until his muscles shook with the tension. Then he flopped back down into the bed and rolled onto his side, snuggling his head against the pillow and finally cracking one eye open. \u201cHmm?\u201d he hummed questioningly when he found Zane looking at him.</p><p>\u201cEvening,\u201d Zane greeted quietly, voice still dark with sleep. He yawned and ran his hand through his hair. The short curls were riotous. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Ty groaned sleepily. \u201cGod, you\u2019re worse than a date,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI have to feed you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, we sleep together, and you won\u2019t spring for dinner? What kind of guy are you?\u201d Zane climbed gingerly out of the bed and flopped his pillow over Ty\u2019s face as he walked by to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cThe kind who slept through the getting laid part!\u201d Ty called after him as he grabbed the pillow and immediately confiscated it, tucking it under the covers and wrapping around it like a child with a teddy bear.</p><p>Zane leaned out the door after turning on the light. \u201cBad planning on your part,\u201d he chastised before ducking back inside and pushing the door shut.</p><p>Ty gave a loud, slightly squeaky huff and snuggled back down into the bed. The mattress was hard as a rock, but he\u2019d had worse. \u201cYou want room service?\u201d he called.</p><p>Stretching carefully, Zane looked over his shoulder at his back in the mirror. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he answered, raising his voice. \u201cI\u2019ll eat pretty much anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will,\u201d Ty muttered grumpily from his warm cocoon of pillows.</p><p>Zane turned on the shower, ready to risk washing down his back. The hot water would feel good, at least. He pushed his briefs to the floor and climbed in, standing facing the shower head (which was actually tall enough for him for once) before turning slightly to see how it would feel on his damaged skin.</p><p>Ty climbed out of bed when he heard the water turn on and hopped to the bathroom door, sticking his head inside the bathroom with wide, disbelieving eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna wet it?\u201d he asked incredulously without even giving a thought to Zane\u2019s privacy.</p><p>Jerking his shoulder out of the water and stepping back as the door pushed open, Zane swallowed against the surprise and tried to calm his pulse.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? I\u2019m in the damn shower; it\u2019s wet by default.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna hurt,\u201d Ty protested almost childishly.</p><p>Zane leaned back and pulled the curtain aside just enough to look at Ty. \u201cWell, yeah?\u201d he said, face displaying patent disbelief at Ty\u2019s objections.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t hurt worse than the getting hurt in the first place,\u201d he said as he pointed at Ty, catching the curtain just in time as it fell away and yanking it shut, blocking the flow of cool air. He felt like a fucking idiot, standing naked in the shower while he held the curtain between the two of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taking an even breath, he turned in place immediately, standing far enough away that the hot water just sprayed on his ass and thighs. Then he took small steps backward, and as the hot water started raining on his lower back he let out a low, unconscious moan of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna hurt,\u201d Ty crooned as he leaned against the door, waiting almost gleefully for the howl.</p><p>Ignoring him, Zane stepped backward again, inhaling sharply as the hot water splattered across the cuts and slices and gouges. It did hurt, but it was all a heated flush that tingled and buzzed rather than actually causing blinding pain. He sighed and relaxed and moved further back so the water sluiced over his shoulders, and he groaned at how good it felt, the m\u00e9lange of little prickles and bites of hurt mixing with the hot raps that jarred and soothed his tensed muscles.</p> <p>\u201cLike pain, huh?\u201d Ty laughed as he listened. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it, then,\u201d he snickered as he turned to go.</p><p>\u201cPansy-ass,\u201d Zane murmured with a smile, just loud enough to be heard.</p><p>\u201cMasochist,\u201d Ty shot back.</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cLightweight.\u201d</p><p>Ty stepped outside the bathroom again without bothering to respond.</p> <p>The groan from Zane had sent an odd jolt through his body, and he wasn\u2019t sure he liked it. He needed ... to shoot something, maybe.</p><p>He stalked out into the room to pick up the phone.</p><p>Zane took his time showering, staying in the hot water until the steam in the room was making it difficult to breathe. With a sigh, he bent over and turned off the water, pleased by how much easier he could move now. He stepped out of the tub, grabbing a towel to wipe his face, and he flicked on the fan.</p><p>If he could get Ty to put more of that salve on the wounds, he might just be ready for action again.</p><p>In the outer room, Ty was on hold, desperately trying not to think as he waited. He didn\u2019t need to be thinking about Zane Garrett in any form other than as an annoying partner. He glanced up at Zane when the man came out of the bathroom and snorted heavily through his nose in annoyance. \u201cWhat do 100</p><p>you want to eat?\u201d he asked him, letting his eyes take in Zane\u2019s toned muscles and then turning off that instinctive reaction willfully.</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t ordered yet?\u201d Zane asked as he came out from under the towel he had been using to dry his hair. Another was wrapped around his lean hips.</p><p>Ty growled at him.</p><p>Zane ignored him. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Burger, steak, chicken, pizza.</p><p>Whatever.\u201d He shrugged and walked over to his duffel bag and started digging through it. Ty seemed to be back to his normal twitchy self, he thought, as he dug out clean briefs and a pair of jeans.</p><p>\u201cMake a damn decision,\u201d Ty huffed just before someone finally answered his call.</p><p>\u201cBacon cheeseburger, dressed, and fries. And a couple cans of Coke.\u201d</p><p>Zane walked back toward the bathroom with his clothes and kit.</p><p>Ty repeated the order into the phone and then added his own order to it. The man on the other end took the order and politely ended the call, and Ty replaced the receiver slowly as he listened to Zane\u2019s movements. After a moment he let out a long, slow breath and flopped back into his bed. \u201cHow\u2019s it feeling?\u201d he asked as he squeezed his eyes shut.</p> <p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Zane called out before making quick use of his toothbrush and then looking unsuccessfully for his comb. He slid into his clean briefs and pulled on the jeans, but he was still distractedly fastening them up as he padded back out into the main room and over to his duffel bag. \u201cWill you put more of that shit on my back?\u201d he asked as he searched.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to smell like a racehorse,\u201d Ty observed from inside his cocoon.</p><p>Zane looked up from digging in his duffel, brow furrowed in confusion.</p><p>Ty laughed softly and buried his head under the pillow again, burrowing tiredly. Zane smiled at him as he looked him over, letting his eyes slide up and down the lean body just once before shaking his head and pushing the thoughts away. \u201cHave you seen my damn comb?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been keeping close tabs on all your personal items, Special Agent Garrett,\u201d Ty answered officiously, his voice comically muffled by the pillow.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Special Agent Grady, I appreciate that,\u201d Zane answered before pushing away the duffel and running his fingers through his hair instead. He glanced back at Ty and tilted his head. \u201cHow can you breathe like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Ty asked from under the pillow. \u201cBreathing and thinking at the same time, while difficult to master, comes pretty natural after you\u2019ve practiced for a while. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get the hang of it soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes. \u201cAt least I think with my head and not my ass,\u201d</p><p>he muttered as he buttoned his jeans and zipped up.</p><p>\u201cYour ass is more fun to look at,\u201d Ty shot back from under the pillow.</p><p>Stopping in place, Zane boggled at the pillow. \u201cYou did not just say you\u2019ve looked at my ass.\u201d Dear God. The tease of that was fucking inflammatory. He didn\u2019t need this kind of torture.</p><p>\u201cYou show it often enough,\u201d Ty countered in a sly tone, still muffled.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that literally,\u201d Zane muttered as he started stacking folders on the table, trying to make room for food.</p><p>Ty finally pulled his head out from under the pillow and rose up onto his elbows to look over his shoulder at Zane. \u201cI mean everything I say literally. Literally,\u201d he said with wry emphasis.</p><p>Zane sighed and rubbed his eyes with one hand. \u201cI think you do it deliberately,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cSay whatever you can think of to drive me up the fucking wall.\u201d And Lord, his imagination was now in overdrive. Zane moved his hand, turned, and looked at Ty with narrowed eyes. \u201cAnd how am I showing off my ass, pray tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breathing,\u201d Ty said as he laid his head back down.</p><p>Zane sighed, whether in relief or exasperation, he didn\u2019t want to have to figure out. Ty was just razzing him. A cigarette was starting to sound appealing, and the knock at the door was a godsend.</p><p>Ty peered out from under his pillow and watched Zane go to answer the door. \u201cNow you\u2019re wondering if I\u2019m looking at your ass, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he teased.</p><p>Zane flipped him the bird as he passed by, gun in the other hand.</p><p>\u201cMm hmm,\u201d Ty murmured with a self-satisfied grin.</p><p>After a minimum of fuss, Zane carried the room service tray back into the room, his gun shoved into the back of his jeans. And damn it, if Ty wasn\u2019t right, the smug bastard. As soon as he walked past him, he wondered if he was feeling Ty\u2019s eyes on his back or his ass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s the food,\u201d Ty offered as if he was reading Zane\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cYou keep telling yourself that,\u201d Zane drawled, uncovering the plates.</p><p>\u201cYou know it,\u201d Ty drawled as he stretched again. \u201cGive me food, bitch,\u201d he ordered with relish.</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cI ought to make you get off your lazy ass and get it yourself. But you were kind enough to help me out, so....\u201d He carried Ty\u2019s plate and drink over and set them on the nightstand between the beds.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ty said primly as he sat up and placed a pillow in his lap to serve as a tray.</p><p>Zane sketched a bow. \u201cI hope it\u2019s to your satisfaction, your majesty,\u201d</p><p>he drawled before going back to his own food and sitting at the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re so easy to train,\u201d Ty responded happily.</p><p>Raising a brow, Zane chucked a fry at him, hitting him in the chest.</p><p>\u201cHey! A little respect for the cleaning ladies, huh?\u201d Ty chided.</p><p>Zane grinned and threw another one, this time landing it on Ty\u2019s plate. He held up both arms in a touchdown sign. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m starting to get this whole bug-the-hell-out-of- somebody thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a natural,\u201d Ty responded flatly as he stared at the vagrant fry in distaste.</p><p>Zane sighed and shook his head, going back to his food. It seemed Ty would only tolerate so much of his own medicine. A moment later a fry hit him in the nose and bounced off into his lap. Zane\u2019s jaw dropped, but he grinned before plucking the fry up from his thigh and popping it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMm hmm,\u201d Ty hummed again with a smirk from his side of the room.</p><p>Considering the other man as he took a bite of his burger, Zane wondered if this Ty was more like his normal self. He seemed younger right now, not as jaded. \u201cWhat\u2019s your story?\u201d he asked impulsively.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Ty asked between bites, with a cock of his head.</p><p>\u201cThe one about why you have a chip on your shoulder the size of Manhattan?\u201d Zane asked mildly. \u201cAbout why when you sleep you look about five years younger than me, and when you\u2019re awake and pissed off you look five older.\u201d</p><p>Ty cocked an eyebrow. \u201cYou were watching me while I slept?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYou watched me,\u201d Zane pointed out. \u201cAnd don\u2019t avoid the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Ty protested in amusement. \u201cThat\u2019s just ... really fucking weird, man,\u201d he observed with a snicker. \u201cAnd I told you my story. I was Marine Force Recon. After the last mission we were supposed to run went tits up, they deemed all of us stricken with PTSD. We were all discharged with big-ass pensions before we could get upset. Full honors. It was all complete bullshit, and everyone knew it, but we were all tired and slightly traumatized from the bureaucracy of it all,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cThey needed to plant us all somewhere nice and safe and keep us from Idle Hands Syndrome, know what I mean? Me, I got sent to Quantico as a \u2018civilian aid\u2019 sort of thing until Burns found me and convinced me the Bureau might be entertaining. I was a Marine, in it for the long haul, and I miss it. But that\u2019s life and here I am. No chip,\u201d he insisted with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cSo why be such a bullshit artist? Amusement factor? Mask to avoid questions? You\u2019re just a prick at heart?\u201d Zane asked after another bite.</p><p>\u201cAll of the above,\u201d Ty answered readily through a mouthful of food, grinning and chewing as he watched Zane.</p><p>Nodding, Zane took a few more bites. \u201cYou know, when I was fucked up, I got real familiar with medical regulations and treatment regimens. Did you know they won\u2019t clear agents for field work if they\u2019re being treated for depression or mood disorders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Ty answered succinctly.</p><p>\u201cPost-traumatic stress disorder falls into that category. If it was in your file as a reason for discharge, you\u2019d have been parked at a desk and never let out into public,\u201d Zane commented neutrally.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Ty responded again as he looked up at Zane and smiled crookedly.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re lying to me,\u201d Zane said, just as neutrally as before. \u201cAny particular reason you don\u2019t care to share? Other than the fact that I\u2019m just your partner who might have to bail your ass out of something someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy file is classified for a reason,\u201d Ty responded readily, as if he had known the cover story wouldn\u2019t pass muster with Zane. \u201cParts of that story are true, though,\u201d he assured Zane seriously. \u201cAnd nothing in my past is going to come up and bite you or me on the ass,\u201d he added with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no mysteries. Only thing I\u2019ve got back there is some broken hearts and a whole lot of red tape.\u201d</p><p>Zane studied him for a long moment. \u201cAll right,\u201d he murmured, going back to his fries.</p><p>Ty watched him, narrowing his eyes. Finally, he sighed loudly and looked around the room, then back at Zane in annoyance. \u201cSpecial Agent Sanchez,\u201d he announced with a huff. \u201cHe was on my Recon team.\u201d</p><p>Raising his eyes to look at Ty again, Zane thought he was beginning to understand. Understand why Ty was so determined to stay on this case no matter what exploded. And why he was such an ass to keep people from getting too close. It was a similar defense mechanism to what he himself had, albeit for a different reason. Ty and his companions had lived a dangerous life. They expected to lose one another. Just not to serial killers. \u201cThat\u2019s hard,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s hard is figuring out how some punk serial killed him. He slept with an arsenal under his pillow and one eye open,\u201d Ty told him seriously. \u201cAnd if anyone looked at the files close enough and saw that we were colleagues before the Bureau, they\u2019d yank me off the case,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you were surprised when Burns handed you this case\u2014</p><p>and why you\u2019re so keen to solve it. Beyond keen,\u201d Zane said as it all clicked.</p><p>\u201cBurns knows me,\u201d Ty said as a form of answering. \u201cAnd he knew Sanchez. He recruited us out of the dregs of desk work we were being forced to do at Quantico, personally pushed us both into the Academy. He knows I\u2019m not supposed to be here. Meaning he wanted me here for a reason. I just can\u2019t figure out what the fuck it is, other than to be sneaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then why stick you with me? I\u2019d been up in Cybercrimes over two years, mostly off field work. I\u2019ve not been out like this in nearly four years. Why would he try to weight you down?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up at him thoughtfully and tilted his head inquisitively.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to weigh me down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I won\u2019t. But Burns, he\u2019s the one that threw my ass out of action, sent me into detox on threat of jail. He\u2019s not liked me since. Why give me this chance?\u201d Zane asked rhetorically.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he care enough to put you in detox and then reinstate you if he didn\u2019t like you?\u201d Ty countered quietly.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t have an answer for that. It was a question he\u2019d asked himself over and over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty just shrugged as he watched Zane think it over. \u201cWe got one thing in common, though, Garrett,\u201d he finally pointed out. \u201cNeither one of us belongs here. And they don\u2019t expect us to play by no rules anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever play by the rules, Special Agent Grady?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t think of a for-instance,\u201d Ty answered with a flippant shrug.</p> <p>Zane peered at him for a long moment. \u201cHow old are you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Ty raised his head and looked over at the other man. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cJust wondering. Thought you were about my age or older until I saw you sleeping,\u201d Zane answered.</p><p>Ty frowned at that. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-four,\u201d he answered grudgingly.</p><p>Zane nodded slowly and went back to eating his now lukewarm fries with no comment. He would never have guessed that Ty was that young.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ty prodded.</p><p>Shrugging slightly, Zane looked up at him. \u201cSometimes you look older than that. You sure as hell act older than that. Jaded.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at him, slightly nonplussed, and looked back down at his food with a purse of his lips. Zane watched him, observed him, seeing a glimpse of the more ordered and disciplined man Ty hid under the brash asshole. He wore a mask, just like Zane did. It was somehow reassuring. It was beginning to become clear that Ty actually expended energy to be as abrasive as he was. The calmer former Marine that was beginning to show through seemed much more natural to him.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Ty finally asked in return.</p><p>Zane smiled slowly, still watching. Ty hadn\u2019t looked up at him. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ve not checked up on me yet?\u201d</p><p>Ty slid his eyes sideways to look at Zane seriously, the rest of his body unmoving.</p> <p>Zane shook his head, smile pulling at his lips. \u201cI\u2019m forty-two,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you look it,\u201d Ty drawled with a grin that was slightly more teasing than his usual smirk.</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ve been ridden hard and put away wet a few too many times.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and poked at his food. \u201cWhere you from?\u201d he asked without looking up. \u201cI mean, since we\u2019re bonding and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexas. Austin, to be specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ty offered sympathetically, the smirk playing at his lips again.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from, asshole?\u201d Zane retorted.</p><p>\u201cBluefield, West Virginia,\u201d Ty answered, letting his words roll with his pronounced accent.</p> <p>Zane grinned. \u201cWest by-God Virginia,\u201d he said. \u201cFits you.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced up and smirked again, jabbing at his ketchup with a fry.</p><p>\u201cWild and Wonderful,\u201d he quoted with a barely restrained snicker.</p><p>\u201cWild and Wonderful,\u201d Zane echoed with a short chuckle. \u201cAll that mountain climbing got you in shape for the Marine Corps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like spelunking, but it\u2019s all about rocks in the end.\u201d Ty shrugged with a smile. \u201cSon of a miner ain\u2019t got much in the way of career options,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was either the Marines or going into the family business.\u201d</p><p>Zane tilted his head. \u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t see you as a coal miner.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced back up at him and narrowed his eyes. The urge to take exception to the statement was clearly written on his face, but finally he gave his head a shake and bit the tip off his fry. \u201cJust add dirt,\u201d he finally responded with a gesture to himself, even though the industry of coal mining had left Bluefield in the 1960s.</p><p>Zane saw the look on Ty\u2019s face before the other man shook it off.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to be a coal miner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNobody wants to be a coal miner,\u201d Ty answered evenly. He looked up at Zane and studied him, pondering the rest of the answer. \u201cBut then, nobody wants to get shot at, neither,\u201d he added thoughtfully. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been a coal miner. They don\u2019t mine coal in Bluefield anymore. But my daddy minded the abandoned mines. He was a caretaker after they were shut down.</p><p>Meant he was still in those damn mines all the time, making sure no one got down there and lost or trapped. Monitoring collapses. And I would have been doing it, too. Or off in another town doing the real thing. I had to choose between a fear of bullets and a fear of small spaces,\u201d he admitted. \u201cTurns out bullets ain\u2019t that scary, after all.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Zane finished off his burger. He studied the other man as he chewed, putting together the details he\u2019d crow barred out. The little bit of his history made Ty much more human.</p><p>Ty returned his attention to his food, feeling eyes on him and just letting Zane stare for a while. \u201cSo what else was there, Serpico?\u201d he finally asked after a tense moment of silence. \u201cNeed my blood type? SAT scores?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cDid you go to college or just join the Marines?\u201d</p><p>That question did rankle, but Ty visibly repressed his initial reaction.</p><p>He exhaled loudly and pushed his plate away.</p><p>\u201cYou did say SAT scores,\u201d Zane reminded.</p><p>\u201cI went to college,\u201d Ty gritted, acknowledging that he had indeed opened up that door. \u201cGovernment paid for it.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded slowly, feeling as well as seeing the tension back in the other man. \u201cNothing wrong with that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou earned it.\"\u201d</p><p>Ty cut his gaze up to look at Zane from under lowered brows. \u201cYou humoring me, Lone Star?\u201d</p><p>Zane set his plate on the table with a clunk. \u201cIf you served our country in the armed forces, you deserve it.\u201d He was dead serious; it showed clearly in his eyes.</p><p>Ty glared at the man for a brief moment longer and then looked back down. \u201cThirteen-ten,\u201d he finally answered with a nod.</p><p>Raising a brow, Zane sat back with a nod. \u201cWell-done,\u201d he complimented.</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d Ty muttered as he poked at his chicken and frowned.</p><p>\u201cNational average is eleven-fifty,\u201d Zane said, a small smile curling his lips. Tough guy obviously didn\u2019t take compliments well. It was almost endearing.</p><p>\u201cI find it disturbing that you know that offhand,\u201d Ty informed his partner flatly.</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cNumbers stick with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that disturbing, too,\u201d Ty deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cDisturbing, huh? Maybe I\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever helps your ego,\u201d Ty muttered with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you fall into this, anyway?\u201d he asked, ready to change the subject.</p><p>Zane considered what to share, figuring Ty would rag him about anything he gave up. \u201cI jumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then the rope broke?\u201d Ty supplied.</p><p>\u201cMore like they cut it and let me fall,\u201d Zane muttered, turning back to the files and starting to shift them. \u201cI was totally unprepared for the academy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait wait, let me guess,\u201d Ty said as he held out his hand toward Zane. \u201cPsychology major with a...,\u201d he narrowed his eyes and cocked his head, \u201cpolitical science minor,\u201d he guessed.</p><p>\u201cStatistics and Spanish. Before law school,\u201d Zane admitted, not looking over at the other man.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re a lawyer,\u201d Ty groaned in response. \u201cI was starting to almost not hate you.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted and glanced up. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a lawyer. I was saved from that gruesome fate by an academy recruiter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend that man flowers,\u201d Ty ordered.</p><p>Zane actually laughed. \u201cI agree ... now. Then? I wanted to skin him.</p><p>Slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Were you the mascot being tortured in your academy class?\u201d</p><p>Ty asked.</p><p>Eyes narrowing, Zane\u2019s good humor faded. Bad memories did that. \u201cI bet you were top of the class at climbing that damn rope,\u201d he muttered crankily. \u201cFor me, it was only four months of utter hell. Then I got to go through it again. How lucky is that?\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned and cocked his head, looking Zane over critically. \u201cYou got recycled?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>Zane looked over at him and could tell right away why Ty was asking. \u201cOut of grad school I was six-five and one-seventy. Not a scrap of muscle on me.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyebrows climbed in surprise, but he shook his head and shrugged. \u201cMust have been hell on wheels with the mental parts of it,\u201d he ventured.</p><p>The answer was a wry smile. \u201cFifteen-eighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with the other twenty, spell your name wrong?\u201d Ty asked with a teasing smile.</p><p>The smile warmed a little. \u201cThanks,\u201d Zane said deadpan.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Z stand for?\u201d Ty asked abruptly. \u201cZane Z. Garrett,\u201d he mused with a slight wince. \u201cMomma didn\u2019t like you much, huh?\u201d he inquired in amusement.</p><p>\u201cFamily name,\u201d Zane said with a shrug. \u201cZachary. Nothing really scary. And in Texas, Zane is fairly common.\u201d He squinted at Ty. \u201cI remember Burns said your name. Something Tyler Grady. An initial for your first name.</p><p>I was too busy being horrified about being paired up with you to catch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably better for it,\u201d Ty told him with a shrug, obviously having no intention of answering or meeting Zane\u2019s eyes while he had his mind on it.</p><p>Zane raised one eyebrow and considered pushing, but since they were finally actually talking, he didn\u2019t want to ruin it. So he opted for humor. \u201cYou were right about the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I was,\u201d Ty responded almost immediately. He looked up and narrowed his eyes. \u201cRight about what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Zane sighed. \u201cAbout my name. And the other twenty points?\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him blankly for several long moments. Finally, he closed his eyes and shook his head. \u201cYou spelled your name wrong on the SATs?\u201d</p><p>he asked in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said, smiling slightly. \u201cI left out my middle initial.\u201d His eyes sparkled and he was hard put not to smile.</p><p>\u201cJackass,\u201d Ty muttered under his breath.</p><p>The grin broke free and Zane chuckled before leaning back and looking up at the ceiling, drawing in an even breath and relaxing. \u201cIt was embarrassing,\u201d he tacked on, just for effect.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re used to that,\u201d Ty muttered. \u201cWhat the hell,\u201d he added with a sigh. \u201cWe can\u2019t all be perfect,\u201d he offered as he looked back down at his uneaten food in distaste. His foot was bouncing slightly as 110</p><p>he sat cross-legged on the bed. He was beginning to get edgy again. All the training in the world couldn\u2019t rectify a natural nervous twitch.</p><p>Zane sighed quietly and turned back to the files. \u201cLong way from perfect,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and banged his head back against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t jar loose the few you\u2019ve got,\u201d Zane advised, eyes on the papers he\u2019d pulled out.</p><p>\u201cWell, get done with your little pity party, then,\u201d Ty huffed.</p><p>\u201cParty, great, where\u2019s the drinks?\u201d Zane sniped.</p><p>\u201cAnd I was almost starting to like you,\u201d Ty sighed under his breath as he twisted and swung his legs over the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cGod forbid.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and glanced back down at his food. He had lost his appetite along with the desire to spend any more time with his self-pitying partner. \u201cI need a break from this fucking room,\u201d he muttered as he pushed to stand and stretch.</p><p>Zane glanced up from where he\u2019d been staring blankly at the reports.</p><p>Ty was patting down his jeans as he searched for his wallet. Finally, he located it and pulled it out, retrieving a little piece of paper and unfolding it with a frown.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t say a word. He just made himself keep his eyes on the paperwork. He remembered when Ty had been handed that piece of paper, and he knew the implications. He fought hard not to be slightly jealous.</p><p>Ty reached for the phone and dialed, eyes straying to Zane and glinting in the low light. \u201cWant me to see if she has a friend?\u201d he asked with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass, thanks,\u201d Zane murmured, not even looking up.</p><p>Ty nodded, watching his partner as the pretty little stewardess answered her phone. Ty didn\u2019t take his eyes off Zane as he set up the illicit rendezvous that he knew would rid him of some of the frustration his new partner had been creating.</p><p>The hair on the back of Zane\u2019s neck rose. Ty was watching him.</p><p>Waiting another minute, Zane turned his chin to look toward him, a brow rising lazily. Hmm. Ty shouldn\u2019t be the only one to vent his frustrations.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d go find someone to pass the time with, too, now that he thought about it.</p><p>Ty smirked as he watched Zane look up at him, grinning at the slightly breathless voice of the woman as she said goodbye. He hung up and looked at Zane. \u201cGoing to be okay on your own for an hour or two?\u201d he asked rakishly.</p><p>\u201cMe and my right hand will be just peachy, thanks,\u201d Zane said down at the papers.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t get no sympathy from me, Lone Star,\u201d Ty told him as he slid into his boots. \u201cI served my time with you,\u201d he said with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you if I spot a tail,\u201d he added as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cHave a good time,\u201d Zane offered sincerely, finally looking up.</p><p>Ty just laughed as he walked out the door, waving his cell phone over his shoulder to let Zane know how to contact him as he went.</p><p>The other agent watched the door for a bit before shifting in the chair.</p><p>He stood up and paced a little before making a decision. He walked over to the desk and uncovered the area directory the hotel provided in each room.</p><p>Laying it open on the papers, he found a list of bars and nightclubs in the area. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was even a little map of the ten-block area. Zane decided he might as well take a break while he could. He walked over to his duffel and pulled out a change of clothes. After getting dressed, he stuck his wallet into his back pocket and strapped on his holster, though he winced a few times. Then he pulled on his boots and a heavy button-up shirt to cover the gun, and he was ready.</p><p>Before he walked out, he shoved a couple condoms in his hip pocket, and the door shut behind him.</p><p>HE stood on the busy street corner outside the hotel Special Agents Grady and Garrett had moved their operations to. He had, of course, been keeping tabs on their location from the moment they\u2019d stepped off the plane. When they\u2019d declined the Bureau accommodations and moved to another hotel without telling anyone, he\u2019d known he was in trouble. It meant they either suspected someone with inside resources or they were overly paranoid. Either scenario meant more work for him. It had taken a while to find their hotel, but they hadn\u2019t been paranoid enough to check in under false names and he had finally tracked them down.</p> <p>The new FBI team was a nuisance, but so far they weren\u2019t proving to be as much of a threat as he had expected. When he\u2019d gotten word that Washington was sending a crack team, it had very nearly scared him. So much so that he\u2019d set up the computer in the FBI archives for them and removed vital bits of the files as bait before they even landed. These two, however, had turned out to be anything but a threat.</p><p>Still, it was better to be rid of them sooner rather than later.</p><p>The exploding rig he had set up in the computer of the archives had worked perfectly. Exactly to plan. The only problem with his plans to this point was the fact that Special Agents Grady and Garrett didn\u2019t seem to give a shit about each other or about working with each other. They were both supposed to have been in that room. Even if Garrett was maimed to the point they had replace him, it still left Grady for him to deal with, and Grady was the real threat. He didn\u2019t follow any rules, and that made him hard to keep ahead of. He had specialized training, too. Garrett just seemed to be a pushover trailing along behind him.</p><p>He took a deep drag of his cigarette as he waited. They had to come up for air soon, and when they did, he would take care of things.</p><p>y slid the room key into the electronic lock and winced as the lights blinked red. He tried it again, looking up at the door number to make T certain it was the right room as the lights blinked red again. He sighed and banged on the door with his fist. Waiting a few moments and hearing no movement inside, he banged again, harder.</p> <p>\u201cGarrett!\u201d he called out, trying to keep his voice down. It was late, after all, and they didn\u2019t want to attract any undue attention to themselves. He glanced up and down the hallway and grumbled to himself.</p><p>He looked at his card in annoyance, realizing that he\u2019d put it in his wallet with his credit cards and probably demagnetized the damn thing. He muttered to himself as he tried it one last time to no avail. He turned on his heel, intending on going to his own room, but before he got even a step he remembered that his own room key was inside Zane\u2019s room with the rest of his stuff.</p><p>He growled to himself and glanced down the hall at his own room, frowning at the Do Not Disturb sign on it. What if someone had been in there earlier? What if someone knew where they were? With that thought, a sudden cold swelled in his chest. What if his erstwhile partner was hurt? What if Ty had gone to get laid and someone attacked Zane? He had very little confidence in his new partner\u2019s ability to protect himself when he was healthy, much less injured and relatively defenseless.</p><p>Ty hurried toward the elevators and jabbed the button for the lobby, but when it took too long he headed for the stairwell and began jogging down the eight flights of stairs. He muttered to himself impatiently, dread rising as he thought about the myriad of things that could have gone wrong. He tried to tell himself he was merely being paranoid and feeling guilty. No one knew where they were, right?</p><p>Except for Sears and Ross, who had been tailing them earlier, and probably every other agent in the New York office, including whoever they 114</p><p>were after. He pushed through the stairwell doors and stalked across the lobby, trying to get a hold on his irrational panic.</p> <p>Moments later, he stood at the lobby desk. He had some difficulty at the front desk in getting Zane\u2019s spare key reprogrammed, mainly because he wasn\u2019t exactly Zane. Finally, he had to flash his FBI identification and growl at the woman to get it done. By the time he got back to Zane\u2019s room, he was tense and almost shaking with dread.</p><p>\u201cYou better be fucking taking a bubble bath or something,\u201d he muttered as he swiped the card and the lights blinked green.</p><p>He was further dismayed to find the hotel room empty. He stood in the entryway, calming himself before walking around the room in search of some clue as to where Zane had gone. There were no signs of struggle or a hasty departure. Everything was ordered and in its place, insofar as order went amidst the chaos of their files.</p><p>Finally, he spotted the hotel directory, open and sitting on the dresser.</p><p>He stepped over to it and placed his hand gently on the laminated pages, peering down at the small map and the list of nightclubs and bars.</p><p>With a groan, Ty realized that Zane had merely gone out to get his drink on.</p><p>\u201cFucker,\u201d he snarled to the empty room.</p><p>ZANE walked along the busy street, looking idly in shop and restaurant windows, just letting his mind wander. Thinking about anything but the case was a relief. He stopped on a corner, waiting for the light to change, and lit up. He rolled his shoulders, winced just a little, and sighed. He felt pretty decent after relieving some of the tension that sparked between him and Ty. A hot grapple in the dark bathroom of a club would do that.</p> <p>He glanced at his watch. 10:10. He figured Ty would take every bit of his mentioned two hours and then some, not that Zane really cared. He\u2019d needed this break more than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>Ty sat on one of the beds, reading a faxed list he had received earlier while he waited for the telltale slide of a key card in the door lock. When it came he lowered the fax and looked toward the door, eyes hard and angry as Zane came strolling in. The other agent glanced up and stopped short when he spotted Ty. He was obviously surprised that Ty had come back early.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Zane said. \u201cHave a good time?\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t answer immediately, instead trying desperately to gain control of his temper. \u201cDid you?\u201d he finally asked curtly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d Zane shrugged out of the thin shirt and looked over Ty again. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you three guesses what went through my head when I found you gone,\u201d Ty replied calmly, simmering just beneath the surface.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes narrowed. Some of the tension started rebuilding between his shoulder blades again. \u201cYou\u2019re not my keeper. I didn\u2019t ask where the hell you were going, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew I wasn\u2019t off getting drunk off my fucking ass,\u201d Ty snarled as he held up the hotel directory accusingly and tossed it to the end of the bed.</p><p>It took some willpower to swallow on the flare of anger. \u201cI told you,\u201d</p><p>Zane said sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t drink anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Garrett. And I don\u2019t fuck strangers \u2019cause I\u2019m bored,\u201d Ty replied sarcastically.</p><p>Quite a bit more willpower was required as Zane stared at him. \u201cI can take care of myself, Grady. I\u2019m not fresh out of the academy, and I don\u2019t need my hand held,\u201d he bit off.</p><p>Ty practically trembled with anger, the kind of anger that could only stem from a bad scare and quite a bit of guilt. He glared at Zane and then looked away, taking a long, calming breath as he stared at the map of crime scenes on the wall. \u201cJust ... leave a damn note next time, okay?\u201d he finally requested softly.</p><p>Zane studied him for a long moment. Ty was truly upset, though Zane had no clue why. It was also clear that Ty was exerting quite a lot of effort trying to remain calm. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Zane agreed, not wanting to rock the boat any further. He took off his gun, grabbed the television remote, and sat on the end of Ty\u2019s bed since there was paperwork all over his.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna sit there, go take a fucking shower first,\u201d Ty griped.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like smoke.\u201d</p><p>Looking over his shoulder in annoyance, Zane wrinkled his nose.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like perfume and spunk. What\u2019s a little smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmoke is unpleasant,\u201d Ty retorted. He gave a sniff and realized that, yeah, he probably did smell like sex. He found himself wondering if Zane had 116</p><p>enjoyed the same sort of distraction that he had, then shook that thought off immediately.</p><p>Zane raised a questioning eyebrow at the look on Ty\u2019s face, earning a defensive \u201cWhat?\u201d from the man.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cSorry to have ruined your relaxing fuck,\u201d he drawled out.</p><p>Ty gave a derogatory snort and stretched his arms over his head.</p><p>\u201cYou should be,\u201d he declared haughtily.</p><p>Zane shook his head, but he was smiling. \u201cAt least I\u2019m not stressed anymore,\u201d he said as he turned back to flip through the channels.</p><p>\u201cWell, praise be,\u201d Ty muttered as he stood and headed for the shower.</p><p>He was tired of smelling like a woman he\u2019d never see again.</p><p>ISABELLE St. Claire had just gotten out of the shower. Her next flight didn\u2019t leave for another four hours, a cross-country to Los Angeles that would no doubt be full of drunk businessmen who would enjoy grabbing her ass as she passed by them. At least she would have some good memories to get her through this particular flight.</p><p>She ran the towel through her long hair again, biting her lip against the guilty smile that tried to bubble up as she looked at the tussled sheets of the bed and her clothing strewn across the hotel room floor. It all belonged to her. He hadn\u2019t left a thing behind.</p><p>An FBI agent, he had said. His badge had looked awfully official, anyway, and Ty Grady hadn\u2019t struck her as the type to lie just to impress her.</p><p>Get her into bed and never call again, yes. But lie? No.</p><p>Isabelle knew the man would never call her again. It was just as well, because he was the type that girls like her fell hard and fast for, and he was definitely not the type she could take home to meet Daddy.</p><p>She allowed herself another little smile and wrapped the towel around her damp hair. It had been fun, anyway. She didn\u2019t bother dealing with the mess they had made of the bed, instead beginning to bundle up her clothing into neat little rolls, the kind that you could stuff in a small suitcase easily and wouldn\u2019t leave fold or wrinkle marks.</p><p>Finished packing and already wearing her uniform skirt, she was shrugging into her white blouse when the knock at the door came. She looked over at it in surprise. Not many people would be knocking on her door. It was either Tina or Sylvia, her fellow air hostesses on the LA flight, wanting to get a bite to eat before they caught a cab, probably. Or it could be him again.</p><p>She bit her lip, unable to restrain a hopeful grin as she padded over to the door and peered out the little peephole.</p><p>An FBI badge was all she could see, held up so close that it was obscured other than the big blue letters on the card.</p><p>She laughed quietly and shook her head as she stepped back. She could really fall for this guy if he let her. She looked down and unbuttoned the one button she had managed on her blouse, biting her tongue in anticipation.</p><p>When he had showed up before he\u2019d merely grabbed her, dipped her backward like they had been waltzing, and kissed her. She wondered how he would greet her now that they actually knew each other\u2019s names.</p><p>\u201cBack for another round so soon?\u201d she called as she unlatched the door and swung it open to let him in.</p><p>She gave a little gasp of surprise when she realized that the agent in the hallway wasn\u2019t Ty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I thought you were someone else,\u201d she stuttered as she blushed furiously and began buttoning her blouse hastily.</p><p>\u201cI get that a lot, ma\u2019am,\u201d the man said before he produced a small white handkerchief and grabbed her roughly, pressing it over her mouth and nose and pushing her back into her hotel room. She flailed and tried to scream, but his hand covered the noise she made and her attempts at hitting and kicking him seemed to go unnoticed. He kicked the door shut behind him, and Isabelle struggled as her world faded to black.</p><p>ZANE worked deep into the files, sifting through details, muttering about the missing reports he\u2019d been looking for when the monitor exploded. He\u2019d also found other smaller bits and pieces missing, likely the result of overworked agents and the number of departments information filtered through in the Bureau. But it didn\u2019t make him happy, not one bit.</p><p>Ty sat cross-legged on his own bed and stared at the map on the wall.</p><p>He\u2019d tacked crime-scene photos near each location where bodies were found, 118</p><p>and beside them pictures of the accompanying tokens, trying to make sense of them. At first, he\u2019d hummed slightly every now and then and murmured to himself, and he\u2019d been perfectly still as he looked over the wall and took notes. But now, he rocked slightly back and forth and seemed to merely be staring mindlessly. If there was brain activity going on, his eyes didn\u2019t betray it.</p><p>Disgusted, Zane tossed down the files. \u201cI need a cigarette,\u201d he muttered, standing up. \u201cYou game for a walk?\u201d he asked as he reached for his holster.</p><p>Ty turned his head slowly, pulling at his ear with a frown. \u201cIs my brain leaking out my ears yet?\u201d he asked grumpily in return.</p><p>\u201cIs that what that gray stuff is?\u201d Zane asked, poking at the side of Ty\u2019s head. Ty growled and flopped onto his back to stare blankly up at the ceiling. Zane grinned down at him. The past several hours of work had successfully cooled their tempers, and they were almost getting along again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon. Stretch of the legs will do you good since we\u2019re short on other forms of entertainment. I think we exhausted those options earlier this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never short on entertainment,\u201d Ty grumbled.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not particularly entertaining. So come on. Maybe we can find an ice cream place or something.\u201d Zane nudged Ty\u2019s arm with his knee from where he stood next to the bed.</p> <p>\u201cIce cream?\u201d Ty repeated flatly as he sat up. \u201cSeriously?\u201d he asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane drew out. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d Ty grumbled. \u201cHurts my teeth,\u201d he added with a slight blush as he sat back up, his head lowered.</p><p>Zane frowned. \u201cYou can stay here, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cI just figured you might want a break, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d Ty muttered. \u201cI hate this feeling,\u201d he told his partner as he sat on the end of the bed and pushed his feet into his boots. \u201cI hate knowing I\u2019m missing something and not being able to place it.\u201d</p> <p>That, Zane could identify with. He nodded and adjusted the straps of his holster once it was over his shoulders, grimacing as it rubbed over sore spots.</p><p>\u201cBefore we get you ice cream, let\u2019s go over to the hotel room,\u201d Ty suggested suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat hotel room?\u201d Zane asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cThe last crime scene, where Sanchez and Reilly were staying,\u201d Ty answered as he picked up the fax he had been studying earlier. \u201cThis is the list of phone calls made from their room the last few days they were alive. I highlighted everything that\u2019s not delivery,\u201d he said wryly as he waved it in the air.</p><p>Zane took the fax and looked it over with a slight grimace. There weren\u2019t many calls at all, and there were only two lines highlighted.</p><p>\u201cThe first is Tim Henninger,\u201d Ty said with a nod at the paper. \u201cHe was their liaison, just like us. The second is somewhere at Federal Plaza, but we\u2019ll need to go there to figure out the specifics of the routing. My guess is they used their cells most of the time, so really the whole list is a big waste of paper,\u201d he went on bitterly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about cell phone records?\u201d Zane asked as he handed the fax back to Ty.</p><p>\u201cAnother day out, they tell me,\u201d Ty grumbled unhappily. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019d like to go to the room, poke around,\u201d he went on.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause you think something was missed,\u201d Zane inferred.</p><p>Ty shrugged uncomfortably and sighed, not looking up at Zane as he stared at the paper. \u201cI\u2019d just like to see it,\u201d he answered distantly, his voice suddenly softer and almost sad.</p><p>Zane watched him carefully, remembering that Ty and Special Agent Elias Sanchez must have been pretty close once upon a time. He nodded silently and turned away to pull on his jacket, leaving the other man to his thoughts.</p><p>Ty looked up and flushed slightly, letting the fax flutter to the end of his bed as he reached for his holster.</p><p>\u201cSo, crime scene, then ice cream,\u201d Zane said in a voice that was slightly louder than necessary.</p><p>Ty merely nodded and went about arming himself slowly, and then they headed out without another word.</p> <p>When they got to the hotel room in the Tribeca Grand that had been provided for the two dead agents, they found crime-scene tape still plastered over the door, sealing it. Ty flipped open his KA-BAR and sliced neatly through the tape, and both men pulled on gloves as they entered. It wasn\u2019t really an active scene any longer; it had been kept open simply at their 120</p><p>request. Ty knew the manager would appreciate being able to take down the garish yellow tape that caused murmurs and furtive glances when anyone passed by.</p><p>The room was dark and almost uncomfortably warm, the curtains drawn tightly and the air vents all closed up. Dry blood still caked one of the beds, and there was another spot on the carpet near the table, where the second agent had fallen. Ty stood in the center of the room, looking around and getting a feel for the scene. He looked back at Zane, where his partner stood near the entry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the killer,\u201d he told the man with a point of his finger. \u201cOkay?</p><p>Stand right there where the tag is,\u201d he requested, pointing to where the ballistics forensics personnel had pinpointed the killer fired from.</p><p>Zane gave Ty a measuring look, but moved to stand just over the little yellow placard that marked the spot. Ty moved to stand near the dried blood on the floor, turning to face Zane.</p><p>He cocked his head at him. \u201cReilly\u2019s in bed,\u201d he said with a gesture to the bed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m standing here, talking with you about what the fuck ever.</p><p>Who do you kill first to minimize chances of being maimed in the process?\u201d</p><p>Zane gave the bed a cursory examination, noting the belt holster that still rested on the table beside it. He glanced back at Ty, then around the room briefly. \u201cSanchez was wearing his gun,\u201d he answered, not seeing the man\u2019s weapon in the room, which meant when they wheeled him out of the room, it had still been on him.</p><p>Ty nodded but remained silent.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019d take you out first,\u201d Zane answered without hesitation. He held his finger up like it was a gun and mimicked shooting Ty with it. Then he turned and fired another fake shot at the bed.</p><p>\u201cFour shots were heard,\u201d Ty murmured as he turned and looked down at the floor behind him. The blood on the floor wasn\u2019t just a pool, it was a smear. One shot hadn\u2019t killed Sanchez. He had moved, possibly drawing his weapon to return fire as he tried to find cover on the floor. But there were two more bullet holes in the carpet amidst the blood. \u201cHe never got off a round,\u201d</p><p>Ty murmured to himself.</p><p>He closed his eyes, feeling slightly ill. He could see the action as if he had been there. He could see Sanchez, knowing he was going to die even as he pulled his gun and tried to save his partner.</p><p>He shook his head and jerked himself away from the visual before he could fall further into it, and he moved around the room restlessly, flipping through the things on the desk, going through drawers, even heading into the bathroom to look at the toiletries the agents had left behind.</p><p>Zane still stood waiting patiently when he returned and grunted unhappily.</p><p>\u201cThey went over this room with a fine-toothed comb, Grady,\u201d Zane said to him gently. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re looking for; maybe I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Ty answered in frustration. He looked around the room and sighed. \u201cI was sure there\u2019d be a token, or....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe no token is a clue to the killer in itself,\u201d Zane suggested thoughtfully.</p><p>Ty glanced at him with narrowed eyes, obviously not following.</p><p>\u201cI mean, the tokens have meaning to the murders, we know that. But we also know he killed these two men, and didn\u2019t find the deed worthy of leaving a token,\u201d Zane explained slowly, thinking it through even as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t fit into his pattern, and so they didn\u2019t get special treatment like the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Ty agreed grudgingly. \u201cBut where does that get us?\u201d</p><p>he asked.</p><p>Zane shrugged and shook his head. \u201cNowhere, really.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded in agreement, looking around the room in disappointment.</p><p>Rarely did a crime scene not speak to him in some way. This room, though, was telling him nothing.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty muttered finally as he jerked his thumb at the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go get your freaking ice cream,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Half an hour, two cigarettes, and some walking later, Zane had his ice cream as they sat in the restaurant. Running his spoon through the classic hot fudge sundae, he looked up at Ty. \u201cNow, this is the way to convalesce,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ty gave him a disgusted sneer and a roll of his eyes. Zane sat back with a shrug, dropping the attempt at conversation. A soft chuckle caught his attention, and he looked discreetly to the side to see two men sitting in another booth with a sundae, sharing it.</p><p>Zane smiled slightly before turning back to his treat. While it was great to see that, it just made him feel lonelier, just like any happy couple did.</p><p>The smile faded and he stabbed at the ice cream. Two co-eds walked by, whispering as they looked at the two men. They shifted their attention to Ty and Zane as they passed by. \u201cGod, why are all the hot ones gay?\u201d one asked her friend plaintively, and then they were out of earshot.</p><p>Wincing, Zane sighed, finished the sundae, and scooted away from the table without another word, walking to throw away the plastic bowl and spoon. Ty was sure to be pissed off about that, and Zane didn\u2019t want to be in the line of fire. Time for a strategic retreat. Besides, any thoughts combining Ty Grady and the prickling attraction he felt toward him were doomed from the start. It was bad enough being attracted to the asshole, and indulging the idea would just make it worse.</p><p>Ty\u2019s shoulders began to tense again as he sat alone at the little table, and he forced himself not to watch Zane move away. When he was younger, Ty had allowed himself to enjoy the company of both men and women, whichever struck his fancy at the time. But all his time in the don\u2019t-ask-don\u2019t-tell environment of the Marine Corps had forced him to suppress many of those feelings. It had left him confused and angry at the world in general for quite a while, but he\u2019d managed to set that aside in order to concentrate on his job. Now, though, the job was easier and so was hiding something like that.</p><p>After getting out of the service, he\u2019d tried to convince himself that he was free again, but he\u2019d spent too long pretending to be a person he wasn\u2019t in order to blend into his environment, and he couldn\u2019t shake the habit easily.</p><p>The fact that he found himself slightly attracted to Zane Garrett added to the frustration of the situation. It was confusing him again and making him seriously cranky. He hunched his shoulders a little more and crossed his arms over his chest, scowling at anything that moved as he waited for Zane to return.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Zane murmured when he got back to the table, still chewing on his own emotions.</p><p>\u201cThank Christ,\u201d Ty muttered grumpily as he stood. Zane didn\u2019t answer, just leading the way out the door and heading back to the hotel silently, long legs eating up the concrete.</p><p>After several episodes of having to actually jog to keep up, Ty finally huffed loudly and asked, \u201cWhat the hell, man? You get your hot fudge and suddenly it\u2019s all hurry up and wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got work to do,\u201d Zane answered shortly. He knew he was overreacting, but he needed to get back to who he was supposed to be and forget about who he used to be\u2014who he wanted to be. A man who wouldn\u2019t be afraid to do something about the flickering attraction. That man couldn\u2019t exist anymore. He needed to go back to being the straitlaced paper-pusher Ty first met and insulted. That was safe, and it would get the job done. Christ, was he ever fucked up. Zane wondered if he ought to go see that damn lady headshrinker again. Ty had thrown him for a goddamn loop.</p><p>Ty grumbled and jogged again to catch up. \u201cYou\u2019re never getting ice cream again,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t object. He needed something to get his mind back on track. Immediately. \u201cOne of us needs to go back to the office and find those files I was looking for,\u201d he said as they walked. \u201cI never did call the investigators back about the explosion, and I should check on Henninger and tell him to keep his mouth shut.\" His voice was back to the monotone he used in the office.</p><p>Ty sighed as he listened. It had been brief and pleasant, but the tolerable partner stint appeared to be over. \u201cYou know what?\u201d he hissed finally as he grabbed at Zane\u2019s arm to halt him. \u201cI\u2019m getting pretty fucking tired of the Jekyll and Hyde deal you have going.\u201d He narrowed his eyes and leaned closer to Zane, looking at him intently. \u201cYou\u2019re not still using, are you?\u201d</p><p>Face tightening, Zane jerked his arm away. \u201cYou have any idea what deep shit I would get in if I was still using? Fuck, no. Although you may drive me to it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really care what kind of deep shit you get into?\u201d Ty asked as he bristled instinctively.</p><p>\u201cMost of the time, yeah, I do. So get off my back,\u201d Zane retorted, trying really hard to keep angry from sliding into livid. He turned into a narrow service alley and pulled out his pack of cigarettes in agitation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay on your fucking back until I\u2019m convinced you\u2019re not going to get me killed,\u201d Ty growled as he stalked after him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who fucked over my last partner, now am I?\u201d Zane snapped back as he crushed the unlit cigarette between his fingers and swung around to face Ty.</p><p>Ty\u2019s entire fa\u00e7ade changed, as if someone had flipped a switch inside him. His body tensed and his eyes grew hard and dark. \u201cThat\u2019s got nothin\u2019 to do with you,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Zane advanced on him, having already lost too much of his cool to be careful. He got into Ty\u2019s face, both insulted and outraged that the man who 124</p><p>was supposed to be his partner could really care less about being so. \u201cYes, it does, because unfortunately, I am your partner now because the last one apparently couldn\u2019t stand you. And you\u2019re not exactly inspiring any trust,\u201d</p><p>Zane snarled.</p><p>Ty\u2019s impressive control over his volatile temper snapped, and he moved automatically, catching Zane on the chin with a quick left hook.</p><p>Unprepared, Zane was only able to turn his face away from the impact to lessen the blow, and he stumbled back. He dropped his ruined cigarette as Ty came at him again, and finally reacting, he managed to spin with the next swing and awkwardly jab his elbow against Ty\u2019s side. He connected with the gun Ty had in the holster under his arm and both men grunted in pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty staggered to the side, but moved again so quickly that Zane wasn\u2019t ready before he was on him. He took hold of Zane\u2019s shoulder, pulled him closer, rammed his knee up into Zane\u2019s midsection, and shoved him toward the ground.</p><p>Zane whuffed and stumbled back, but he managed to keep his feet as his hard-won reflexes kicked in. He took a deep breath and rushed the few feet into the other man, plowing into him before Ty could dance out of his reach. Zane used his own weight to shove the former Marine and send him hard into the brick wall of the alley, and then he backed away, fists up and ready, gasping as adrenaline pumped through him.</p><p>Ty hit the wall hard with his shoulder, and pain shot through him like lightning as something crunched in the joint, but he neither registered it nor reacted to it. Instead, he reached out to the dumpster a couple feet away and grabbed the neck of an old beer bottle. He smashed it against the wall and turned to face Zane with something almost like enjoyment in his eyes. He never gave a thought to the guns under his arms, or to the number of ways he knew how to kill a man with merely his hand. His goal now was to maim and humiliate, not to kill.</p> <p>Eyes narrowing on the new weapon, Zane focused his attention solely on Ty as they started to circle each other. He could feel the nerves cramping in his gut, and he struggled to keep his breathing even and his face blank.</p><p>He would not be drawn out. His hardest lesson when learning to fight had been to wait, although his first lesson had been to run. He realized in a sudden moment of clarity as they sized each other up that if he had any sense of self-preservation he would run now, because Ty was obviously way out of his league. But his pride just wouldn\u2019t let him do it. If he buckled under now, Ty would never have an ounce of respect for him. And Zane just couldn\u2019t live with that.</p><p>He felt his knives heavy at his wrists as he kept his fists curled. Those knives had been another lesson, one suited to his fighting style once the academy instructors had whipped some muscle onto his tall frame. Zane hoped to God he wouldn\u2019t have to draw one, because it was far too likely that Ty would take it away and use it against him.</p><p>With no warning, Ty lunged at him, feinting with the broken glass in his right hand and swiping at Zane with his left. Zane got his arm up to block the swipe of the bottle, using the metal bulk of the knife against his wrist to jar the other man\u2019s hold and send the bottle sailing and crashing into the dumpster. But the left hook caught him in the temple and he went reeling backward, seeing stars even as he grabbed hold of Ty\u2019s wrist and used the other man\u2019s body to hold himself upright.</p><p>Ty latched onto Zane\u2019s wrist in return and spun, pulling Zane\u2019s arm over his shoulder and jamming his body into the bigger man to send him head over heels to the ground. Zane went crashing down, but Ty lost his balance under the weight and the pain in his shoulder and collapsed to one knee beside him.</p> <p>Despite the painful impact on the concrete and the spots dancing in his vision, Zane pulled his knees to his chest and used the momentum to spring into a modified kip, getting himself to his feet, albeit shakily. He immediately shifted and kicked out at Ty\u2019s side, the bottom of his boot aimed at the other man\u2019s ribs. He wasn\u2019t a classically trained fighter by any stretch of the imagination. Zane was a street fighter, a scrapper, accustomed to using his greater weight and reach to defend himself. Unfortunately, Ty was too close to him in size for those options to do Zane any good.</p><p>Ty rolled in the muck of the alley and the ever-present puddle of dirty water just in time to miss the brunt of the kick. Instead, Zane\u2019s toe landed at the tender spot under his rib cage as he moved, narrowly missing the gun in his holster again. Ty rolled up into a crouch and then spun out with a retaliatory kick to Zane\u2019s ankles.</p><p>Zane\u2019s feet slid out from under him before he even knew what had happened, and he found himself once more on his back. He managed to get himself up pretty quickly, just to have Ty aim another spinning kick at his ankles as soon as he was upright.</p><p>He tried to jump out of the way but hissed in anger as Ty\u2019s boot caught his calf and sent him staggering. \u201cGoddammit!\u201d he shouted as he righted himself.</p><p>Ty was still on his knees, doubled over and laughing at him as he held his bruised ribs. This was just a game to him, apparently, and the thought made Zane see red. Too mad to back away, Zane lunged forward to haul Ty to his feet by the back of his jacket. Ty threw his arms behind him as if he were doing a backstroke and slid out of the jacket easily, leaving it in Zane\u2019s hands as he spun away, slightly off balance and still laughing breathlessly.</p><p>Throwing the jacket aside, Zane pushed Ty against the bricks of the nearby wall, face first, grabbing for his arm to try to pull it behind him and restrain him. He realized that Ty wasn\u2019t laughing anymore just a moment too late.</p> <p>He gripped Zane\u2019s wrist with practiced ease, squeezing the pressure point there that would send blinding pain shooting up Zane\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit!\u201d Zane howled again as he lost feeling in his arm. He retaliated by pulling Ty back with the other hand and slamming him against the wall again, this time with his forearm across the back of Ty\u2019s neck as his other arm hung limp and useless. \u201cStop it,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cGot no idea what you\u2019re doing, son,\u201d Ty murmured calmly, though his body was tense and coiled as he gave Zane one last chance to stop this before he really hurt him.</p><p>The hair on the back of Zane\u2019s neck stood up, and he shoved himself off the other man and began backing out of reach. He sure as hell didn\u2019t trust Ty not to turn around and take another swing. Not now.</p><p>Ty turned around slowly and glared at him, but he didn\u2019t strike out.</p><p>He pointed to the ground and snarled, \u201cGive me my damn jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who came out of it, asshole,\u201d Zane spat back harshly.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t backing down; not now. This was one fight he\u2019d see through to the finish. It would probably end up with him face-down in the alley, but at least he could still look himself in the mirror afterward.</p> <p>Ty stepped away from the wall angrily and shoved him. Having expected some sort of physical answer, Zane immediately lashed out his right fist, hitting Ty square in the jaw. It hurt like hell and echoed up through his elbow, but he knew he\u2019d made solid contact. Ty staggered back a step but came right back at him with blinding speed, lashing out with two hard cuts to Zane\u2019s midsection and then kicking at the inside of his knee as he reached up to find a hold on Zane\u2019s shoulder or neck. The speed and ferocity of the motions made it very clear that Ty had merely been toying with him before.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t have even the slightest chance of protecting himself now, much less retaliating.</p><p>Grunting heavily, Zane bent over as he took the two shots in the gut.</p><p>When his knee went out, he felt Ty\u2019s hand close tightly on the back of his neck, and he knew what was coming. Ty was about to break his nose over his knee. Zane it had seen it too many times not to know what it would look or feel like. With another grunt, Zane grabbed Ty\u2019s calf and yanked the man\u2019s foot forward, trying desperately to disrupt his balance.</p><p>Ty pulled down on the back of Zane\u2019s neck and raised his knee into the man\u2019s face, fully intending to smash his nose and hopefully leave him bleeding and unconscious in the alley. But Zane upended him just enough, and as Ty fell, his knee didn\u2019t hit Zane\u2019s face with enough force to do anything but hurt like a son of a bitch.</p><p>Ty landed on his back with a gasp and lay momentarily stunned as the air rushed out of his lungs and the back of his head cracked against the pavement. Zane shuffled back hurriedly and fell on his ass, sprawled and panting as he tried to get a solid breath. He shook his head, trying to clear it, and pushed himself up, trying unsuccessfully to stand. He dabbed at something wet on his face and the back of his hand came away from his upper lip bloody. Holding his still tingling and nearly numb arm, he looked over at Ty warily, waiting for the man\u2019s next move as he tried to steady himself. Zane was sure he wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to help himself if Ty came at him again. But he\u2019d sure as hell try.</p><p>Ty was still on his back, motionless save for one slightly bent knee that was slowly flattening out as he remained where he had fallen in the shallow puddle of standing water. He was either stunned or plotting how next to attack.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d he finally groaned plaintively.</p><p>Zane grimaced and straightened, feeling his already abused back object loudly. He braced one hand on his knee and pushed himself to his feet.</p><p>He tried to even out his breathing as he stepped back a couple more times to put most of the tiny alley between them, just in case. He opened and closed his fist, fingers itching for a knife that he didn\u2019t want to draw, the knuckles screaming from the impact of his punch to Ty\u2019s jaw. His entire face felt like it was on fire and his arm was just then beginning to regain some of the feeling, sending painful little prickles all up and down the limb.</p><p>Ty began moving slowly, rolling to his side and pushing himself up carefully. He brushed himself off as he stood, then looked up at Zane coldly as he reached under his arm, shifting the gun at his ribs and wincing at the bruise already forming under it. \u201cYou done?\u201d he asked emotionlessly.</p><p>Zane rubbed his wrist and flexed his hand, wincing. His body was still taut with anger and tension. But what was really, truly pissing him off was that he had an incredible hard-on. He hadn\u2019t noticed until he\u2019d pushed Ty against the bricks and held him there, using his entire body. What the hell was wrong with him, to be turned on by a vicious fight with a man who could easily kill him?</p><p>\u201cStay off my back about the drugs,\u201d he warned in a rasp, shaking off his other thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019ll kick my ass up and down this alley in the end, but I won\u2019t give up without a hell of a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a legitimate fucking question,\u201d Ty spat out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already given you the fucking answer,\u201d Zane snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t lie about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you lie, cheat, steal, and fuck everything that moves!\u201d</p><p>Ty shouted angrily. \u201cYou stay out of the bars while we\u2019re working this fucking case! And stay out of my past!\u201d he shouted in a pained voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your fucking problem, Grady? You\u2019re jackassing around in my past. You know damn well Burns wouldn\u2019t have put me back on the streets if I wasn\u2019t clean,\u201d Zane grated. \u201cNo wonder your partner was reassigned, if you were this fucking suspicious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t reassigned,\u201d Ty ground out as he tried to calm himself.</p><p>The pain of the memories was taking over the anger, now, and he was deflating fast.</p><p>Zane flinched back, stared at Ty for a long moment, then closed his eyes as the heat drained out of him, leaving him cold. Fuck all. He should have known Serena Scott wouldn\u2019t consider the death of a partner sacred ground. It was just like her to poke that kind of wound. Zane would never have intentionally sunk that low. He turned sideways restlessly and ran a hand over his close-cropped hair before leaning back against the wall.</p><p>Ty took a few steps and bent to gingerly pick up his leather jacket and brush it off. \u201cYou bury a friend,\u201d he said to Zane as he did so, his voice hoarse and strained, \u201cand then tell his wife and baby girl you got him killed.</p><p>See how well you work with others after that,\u201d he challenged softly before folding the jacket over his arm and turning to head for the opening of the alleyway.</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d Zane\u2019s voice was low, no longer throbbing with anger.</p><p>Ty slowed and finally stopped, his head lowered and his shoulders tense as he waited.</p><p>Any arousal had drained away with Ty\u2019s clipped explanation, and now Zane just felt hollow and ill. He knew how much it hurt to lose someone and think it was your fault.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head slightly as if listening over his shoulder, then he returned his eyes forward, raising his chin and squaring his shoulders, not responding. Zane drew a slow breath and started walking, each step jarring something physically or emotionally painful, passing Ty after several steps.</p><p>Ty watched him, head down and eyes hard. Finally he closed his eyes, trying to regain his calm. \u201cYou still plan to go back to the office?\u201d he asked flatly.</p><p>Zane glanced at his watch and winced. \u201cIt\u2019s too late tonight. It\u2019ll have to wait until morning,\u201d he answered, not turning back to look at him.</p><p>Ty began walking again, gesturing to the alley\u2019s entrance. \u201cAfter you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cBetter we get some more rest and start early tomorrow,\u201d Zane told him as he moved toward the corner of the building. He wasn\u2019t sure what else to say.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Ty agreed moodily while they finished the length of the city block. \u201cMaybe something\u2019ll hit us in the night,\u201d he said pointedly as they rounded the corner of the hotel\u2019s building.</p><p>\u201cNot literally, I hope,\u201d Zane said under his breath, wiping away the blood from his nose and lip as they approached the front doors. They got several astonished glances from people inside the lobby. Both men were dirty and bleeding. Ty\u2019s back was wet and covered with tiny bits of gravel, and his guns were clearly visible as he held his jacket in his hand. Zane watched him flash his identification to a hotel employee who was hurriedly picking up a phone as they stalked through the lobby, and the woman slowly set down the receiver after seeing his badge. People whispered and watched as he passed, and Zane couldn\u2019t help but admire the way Ty could turn on that dreaded \u201cAir of Authority\u201d when he needed it. Zane, absolutely wrung out, kept his head down and followed quietly.</p><p>On the way upstairs, he wondered if Ty would go back to his own room. They weren\u2019t exactly getting along famously. In fact, they had basically just tried to kill each other, and Zane had no illusions as to who would have come out on top. He squeezed his eyes shut as they rode in the elevator, trying not to think at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Ty didn\u2019t even seem to hesitate as he led Zane to his room. Odd.</p><p>Maybe Ty just wanted him in the room to throttle him quietly. Or he wanted to get his things and then go back to his own room. Still, Zane\u2019s shoulders relaxed a little, and he let the death grip on his thoughts and actions ease just a bit as he opened up the room\u2019s door. Ty\u2019d had the chance to shoot him. More than once. He hadn\u2019t, but Zane still didn\u2019t trust the crazy bastard.</p><p>\u201cI think, tomorrow, we need to start with a fresh canvass,\u201d Ty was saying as he trudged to his bed and held his jacket up to examine it critically before tossing it down in disgust. He began unstrapping all his weaponry as he spoke, looking down at the bed and trying desperately to sink back into the case instead of the pain of old memories and new bruises. \u201cSo far, he\u2019s made only one mistake, and that was going after Sanchez and his partner. Why would he kill them if they had so little on him? Why would he tip his ace and let us know he was aware of the Bureau\u2019s movements?\u201d</p> <p>Zane watched Ty as he talked. Apparently he planned on staying.</p><p>Shaking his head, Zane wondered what the hell the whole point of the damn fight had been, and how the hell Grady was already getting his brain in gear.</p><p>The short fight had certainly shown him that Ty was more than a handful and more than capable of taking care of himself. It had also shown him that he himself could still scrap after some years of soft work.</p><p>Ty was anything but soft.</p><p>Sighing, Zane wiped one hand over his face, dropping a slightly bloody hand; he obviously had something other than work on his brain, and he consciously pushed it away. It was not the time to be unfocused.</p> <p>He shook himself and let his jacket slide off his shoulders. His back screamed all the way down, and Zane hissed as the weight caught on his sore wrist. \u201cIf I were undercover, I\u2019d kill them if they found out who I was.</p><p>Depending,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cRight. If they found out who you were,\u201d Ty responded as he stripped off his sodden shirt and tossed it at the corner. \u201cBut they obviously weren\u2019t close to finding that, or they would have let someone in on it. Sanchez wasn\u2019t the type to play without a net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they hadn\u2019t made the connection yet,\u201d Zane answered quietly, dropping his sheaths on the table and sitting down to pull off his boots. Damn, this was awkward. And everything hurt, no matter how gingerly he moved. He glanced up at Ty, trying to gauge if the other man had walked away with any damage.</p><p>\u201cSo, what connection did they make but not make that caused him to move on them?\u201d Ty asked wryly as he placed his hands on his hips and watched Zane idly. It bothered him that even now he couldn\u2019t quite find it in himself to despise the man or not be slightly attracted to him. It wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>Not even the recently earned aches and pains could make those things happen.</p> <p>Bent over to unlace the Timberlands, Zane\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cA lead on who had the missing files?\u201d he put out there, since that was something he wanted to pursue. \u201cMaybe someone was somewhere they didn\u2019t need to be.</p><p>Or shouldn\u2019t have been. Or couldn\u2019t have known about. And the agents thought it was odd. He got scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we know how long the files were missing, though?\u201d Ty countered doubtfully. \u201cMaybe they were removed to lure us to the records room and the spontaneous exploding computer.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up and sprawling back with his legs spread out, Zane frowned as he chewed on that idea, shrugging off the discomfort of the situation and the throbbing pain of nearly his entire body. \u201cThat means some sort of detonation, then. Something to make it go on purpose. So he either had to be there, or he was watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else was there? Did you see anyone else in the room?\u201d Ty asked with a frown as he sat opposite Zane.</p><p>\u201cJust Henninger,\u201d Zane answered, rolling his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cIt was lunch time. No clerks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was hurt almost as bad as you,\u201d Ty said dejectedly.</p><p>Grimacing, Zane shrugged again and winced as he moved his shoulders. He looked up at the photos stuck all over the walls. \u201cIt strikes me as unusual just how clean it all is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d Ty asked distractedly as he turned and looked up at the pictures. His immersion in the case was working, the lingering tension and the aftereffects of the fight cast aside for the moment.</p><p>\u201cNo scrapings. No DNA. No fibers. No fingerprints. No trace of foreign substances. No pattern of injuries. No rhyme or reason. No way to track him. Not at any of the scenes at all. Everything has come back totally clean of anything useful. He knows what we look for,\u201d Zane murmured as he became very aware of Ty\u2019s proximity.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But that\u2019s not hard in this day and age,\u201d Ty grumbled as he reached up to rub at his side. He didn\u2019t know if it was the kick he had caught or the gun pressing into him when he hit the wall and the ground, but his 132</p><p>fucking ribs hurt all the same. \u201cHe\u2019s an organized perp. They tend to be cleaner and smarter than disorganized ones. He may even stage the killing field before he takes the victim. Ten years ago the sterility might point to a cop or forensics expert,\u201d he sighed. \u201cNow, it could just point to someone who watches too much CSI or bought a Forensics for Dummies book.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed, dropping his jaw to work it a little. Ty had an incredible left jab. \u201cGod. Sometimes I hate modern technology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Ty offered with a small, slightly vacant smile. He cleared his throat and looked down at his scraped, slowly bruising knuckles, pursing his lips as he flexed his fingers. He felt the sudden urge to apologize to Zane for sucker-punching him, but he just couldn\u2019t find it in himself to do it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s got to be something.\u201d Zane carefully twisted in the chair and reached back behind him to the far edge of the table. It meant he had to stretch to put his hand on the bag of notes he wanted, and he hitched and flinched again along the way as his back complained. He frowned as he turned around and looked at his notes.</p><p>Ty found himself watching the movement thoughtfully. He sighed heavily when he suddenly realized what he was thinking\u2014again\u2014and he shook his head and looked away with a little snarl at himself. He would have thought the several instances of fighting and fucking recently would have soothed that particular urge.</p><p>He glanced back at Zane and cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hit you,\u201d</p><p>he offered grudgingly.</p><p>Zane looked up, surprised to hear it, and he nodded slowly, carefully considering what to say. \u201cI\u2019m thankful you didn\u2019t just snap my neck,\u201d he finally said, looking down at the bag in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Ty responded as he watched Zane, enjoying his discomfort with a small smirk. \u201cGot a bum shoulder; it would hurt like a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Zane made a face and looked back up at him. \u201cGee, thanks. Feeling the love. Really.\u201d Ty just raised an eyebrow at the response, and Zane shook his head. \u201cYou could have killed me, Grady. Probably with one hand. I know that. Just leave me my delusions of lasting a handful of minutes in a real fight with you, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, Hoss,\u201d Ty responded, leaning back in his chair and propping his booted feet up on the bed.</p><p>Zane glanced up at the former Marine, a little furrow between his eyes. Was Ty saying Zane had been a decent match? No way.</p><p>Ty looked him up and down slowly and cocked his head. \u201cYou got the size advantage.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Zane leaned over, elbows on his knees. \u201cNot that much.</p><p>You\u2019re close to the same size. I\u2019m just bulkier, is all. There have been times it\u2019s been more a hindrance than a help.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted and shook his head. \u201cWhatever, man,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat? You\u2019d rather be a beast like me?\u201d he asked, disbelief clear. While he knew there were disadvantages to his size and bulk, after years of training, he wouldn\u2019t give it up. He\u2019d gone through hell in the academy to develop it, and despite the desk jobs of years past he\u2019d kept himself up with weights and a workout regimen.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty laughed softly. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been thrown across rooms by brutes like you,\u201d he said as he unconsciously rubbed his side again and his brow furrowed. \u201cHurts,\u201d he added, as if he needed to clarify that being tossed over someone\u2019s shoulder in a dive in New Orleans and splatting against a dartboard like a bug hurt.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane muttered, rubbing at his jaw while he carefully rotated his wrist, thinking about what Ty did to him in such a short time with very little effort. The concept that his partner hadn\u2019t even been trying to hurt him was both impressive and frightening.</p><p>Ty noticed the movement and pursed his lips. \u201cMight want to put ice on that,\u201d he suggested with a gesture to Zane\u2019s wrist. \u201cIt\u2019ll hurt worse \u2019fore it gets better.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked down at his wrist where Ty had squeezed that pressure point. There was no mark, other than perhaps a reddening of the area where Zane rubbed. But it hurt like hell. He knew he\u2019d left bruises on Ty, although the man showed no signs of it bothering him. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, and he walked over to the low dresser where the ice bucket was buried, digging it out from under a few stacks of folders.</p><p>Ty smirked as he watched him. \u201cIf you lose feeling in it again, don\u2019t worry too much. I only know one guy who ever lost a limb from it.\u201d</p><p>Zane flipped him off before picking up the key card and heading to the door.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Ty called after him in slight alarm, moving his feet and letting the legs of his chair clunk down loudly.</p><p>Zane turned back, his hand on the door latch. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned and pressed his lips into a thin line. \u201cWatch yourself,\u201d he cautioned quietly. Zane looked at him for a long moment, then nodded once and left the room, pulling the door firmly shut behind him. Ty cursed disgustedly and slumped back into his chair, covering his eyes with a hand as he kicked his feet back up onto the bed and muttered to himself. He would not let that priss get to him. He wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Rubbing at his eyes as he walked down the hall to the ice machine, Zane thought about the roller-coaster of the last hour. More days like this, and he wouldn\u2019t need the drink or the drugs to drive him over the edge. Laughing wryly, he stuck the bucket into the machine. When he tripped the switch, it made a loud, grinding noise that tried to drown out his thoughts, and he looked over his shoulder instinctively as if someone might try to sneak up on him from behind while he couldn\u2019t hear them. But the only other thing in the little alcove was the ice machine, and it couldn\u2019t drown out what stuck with him the most; what he wanted to forget was the feel of Ty\u2019s body under his, if even just for a few seconds. He squeezed his eyes shut and told himself again to forget it. That was one territory that would have to remain unexplored.</p><p>Left alone in the room that wasn\u2019t actually his, Ty stood up quickly and decided to take the opportunity to change. He didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to stay in this room tonight, for several reasons, but he would be damned if he suggested they split up. He was getting more and more nervous about the man they were after, and neither of them needed to be alone. He thought about his new partner and frowned as he moved. Zane had lasted longer in a semi-fair almost-fight than Ty would have given him credit for. He had upended Ty not once, but twice. And that was damned hard to do, even when Ty was hurt and laughing uncontrollably.</p><p>As Ty slid his damp jeans down, he realized that for the first time since meeting his partner, he was genuinely curious about him. He was also beginning to grudgingly respect the man\u2019s abilities\u2014and the sheer nerve it took to stand up to a Marine in a dark alley. He cursed quietly to himself and tossed his jeans and briefs into the corner with the rest of his dirty clothing as the electronic lock clicked.</p><p>Zane walked in to see the absolute last thing that would help him forget what was on his mind: a lean, wiry, nude Ty Grady, muscles shifting under tanned and scarred skin as he shifted to grab his clean clothes off the bed. Zane blinked a couple times as the door shut behind him and changed direction to retreat into the bathroom, where he grabbed a hand towel for wrapping some ice. If he was breathing a little harder, who would know other than him?</p><p>Ty pulled up a fresh pair of briefs and reached for the thin white T-shirt he scrounged out of his bag. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he called out evenly.</p><p>Zane swallowed. \u201cYeah,\u201d he answered, voice amazingly steady as he looked at himself in the mirror. \u201cNo problem. Besides these goddamn bruises you gave me. And my hand fucking hurts.\u201d He tried to make himself focus on the ice. He pulled out the plastic bag, dumped half back into the bucket, and tied up the bag before covering his whole hand with the towel.</p><p>\u201cWhine about it some, it\u2019ll make it go away,\u201d Ty suggested.</p><p>\u201cBite me, asshole,\u201d Zane replied. But there was no heat in his voice.</p><p>He had worked any anger out in that alley, for the moment. He took a deep breath and walked out, free hand holding the ice, and he stopped to lean one shoulder against the wall.</p><p>Ty sat on the end of the bed, pulling on a new pair of socks, looking up at Zane expectantly. \u201cDid you bring me any?\u201d he asked finally as he held out his bruised and bloodied left hand. When he moved, the words on his T-shirt were more visible. It was a plain white shirt with brown print on it. It read, \u201cYou Have the Right to Remain Silent ... SO SHUT UP.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at Ty\u2019s hand and shifted his own jaw back and forth. He held out the ice he had prepared. He could make himself another if Ty accepted it.</p><p>Ty snorted and smiled slightly. \u201cFuck it,\u201d he sighed as he waved Zane off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to be able to use that hand later?\u201d Zane asked reasonably.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna make me hit you again?\u201d Ty countered.</p><p>\u201cBut you seemed to enjoy it so much,\u201d Zane answered sweetly.</p> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Ty allowed as he reached out and snagged the bag of ice.</p><p>Zane let Ty take the cold pack and turned on his heel without comment, returning to the bathroom to make another one. He glanced in the mirror and saw another black smudge coming up on the side of his jaw, extending up nearly to his cheekbone. \u201cMotherfucker,\u201d he muttered, prodding at it.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Ty called from the outer room.</p><p>\u201cYou got me good,\u201d Zane answered, thinking that not shaving another couple days wasn\u2019t a bad idea.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty sighed contentedly.</p> <p>Zane rolled his eyes and walked back out, hand wrapped up again. He felt the need to defend himself. \u201cI got in a few good hits, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty repeated with a frown as he pressed the ice in his hand to his ribs, icing both sore spots at the same time.</p><p>Holding his tongue, Zane decided to be content with that knowledge.</p><p>He slowly turned his chin to look at Ty, and he really looked at him. Looked at his heart-shaped face disguised by scruff, full lips, forehead between dark brows scrunched in concentration, sharp nose, all crowned by sparkling hazel eyes that seemed to change colors as he watched. Zane\u2019s mouth compressed ever so slightly, and he blinked slowly, breaking the moment before he turned his eyes away and headed back to the files. He would have shivered if he\u2019d let himself. As it was, his shoulders tensed as he tried to quash that damn itch.</p><p>\u201cYou really worried about the bruises?\u201d Ty asked as he looked up at Zane. \u201cWe can stick a needle in \u2019em and they\u2019ll fade,\u201d he offered seriously.</p><p>When Zane didn\u2019t respond, Ty cocked his head and watched him with a raised eyebrow and a small frown. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked neutrally.</p> <p>Zane\u2019s nostrils flared as he mulled over his thoughts, and he pushed away from the table again abruptly, suddenly antsy and needing some room.</p><p>He stalked over to the window, moving the drapes to look out on the city, keeping the ice on his wrist.</p><p>Ty watched him, still trying to figure out the sudden mood changes his new partner suffered. Maybe Zane didn\u2019t drink anymore, but he\u2019d definitely killed off some brain cells along the way. \u201cWant me to leave?\u201d Ty asked in the same neutral tone.</p><p>Forgetting about the dark window that would mirror his reflection, Zane closed his eyes as he grimaced like he was in pain. He cradled his wrist against the ice. If Ty left, he might be able to relax more. He just couldn\u2019t get the image of that lean, muscled body out of his head. He might be able to get some sleep, to think without the frustration gnawing at him...after he got off, probably. Damn it. His escapade earlier hadn\u2019t done anything but take the edge off. He shook his head in answer to Ty\u2019s question, regardless.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ty responded seriously. \u201c\u2019Cause all my shit\u2019s here now and I\u2019m too damn lazy to move it. Why don\u2019t you get some more sleep?\u201d he suggested softly. If he wasn\u2019t mistaken, he was witnessing the beginnings of a burnout. He\u2019d seen plenty of them. Even had a few himself.</p><p>Zane took a deep breath and forced himself to relax. \u201cYeah. Yeah, that sounds good,\u201d he said softly. He turned away from the window, closing the curtain before he crossed the room for the bathroom, intending to get rid of the ice. His hand was numb enough. He shut the door and sat down on the toilet, threw the towel and bag in the sink, and covered his face with both hands.</p><p>Fuck, Garrett, get hold of yourself, he thought morosely. His hard-as-nails partner was going to think he was falling apart. He craved the calm a cigarette would give him and briefly considered going out to get one and smoking it right there in the damn room.</p><p>Ty remained where he was, trying to decide on a course of action.</p> <p>Finally, he got up slowly, pulled a clean pair of jeans on, then walked silently on bare feet to the bathroom door and knocked softly. \u201cHey, Garrett?\u201d he called gently just before his voice turned sarcastic and teasing. \u201cDo you need a hug?\u201d</p><p>Stifling a laugh, Zane looked up at the door, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Leave it to Ty to snap him out of a funk with five simple words. \u201cFuck you, Grady,\u201d he answered, amusement clear in his voice. He pushed himself up and turned on the water at the sink to fill up a glass.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Ty continued in a mockingly sincere voice, plastered against the door like a parody of an overeager psychologist, trying to talk someone off a ledge. \u201cYou can cry if you need to!\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed the water and rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re an ass, you know that?\u201d But he had to admit; it was breaking the shitty mood and distracting him from the curl of arousal in his gut. Sort of.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t make you any less of a man!\u201d Ty insisted as he called through the door. \u201cMuch...well, it will, but....\u201d</p><p>Snorting, Zane set down the glass. \u201cWell, I guess I should feel honored you consider me a man to start with,\u201d he said wryly as he looked at himself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re definitely more like one now than you were in Burns\u2019</p><p>office,\u201d Ty offered, his voice serious once more as he leaned against the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take credit for that.\u201d</p><p>Zane raised a brow. Typical Grady ego. He looked in the mirror again. It had been a while since he\u2019d had two days of beard. He looked 138</p><p>slightly rakish, with the dark clothes and the whiskers ... and the growing bruise. \u201cDon\u2019t go for the clean-cut professional look, do you?\u201d he asked as he grabbed a washcloth.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t suit you,\u201d Ty responded carefully as he realized the territory he\u2019d stumbled into again. He didn\u2019t want to think about what did or didn\u2019t suit Zane. Ty had already crossed a mental line where his partner was concerned.</p><p>Turning on the water long enough to wet down the cloth, Zane sighed and ran it carefully over the back of his neck as he shut off the faucet, then wiped carefully on his upper lip to get the dried blood off. \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he said, a hint of resignation in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI could help, you know,\u201d Ty offered, hearing the water and guessing that Zane was probably messing with his wounds again. He leaned more against the door, forcibly relaxing himself. He desperately needed to change the subject, for his own sanity if nothing else.</p><p>It took Zane a long moment to decide what Ty was talking about.</p><p>With a sigh, he decided Ty probably wasn\u2019t offering to help him with his</p><p>\u201cmanhood.\u201d Tossing down the rag, he pulled his T-shirt over his head and turned to look at his back. Parts of it didn\u2019t look great. There were new scrapes and his wrist and chin were both killing him. He could certainly blame his crankiness on that; it was Ty\u2019s fault, after all. He leaned over and pulled the door open.</p><p>Ty nearly fell into the bathroom as the door collapsed beneath his shoulder without warning. Reacting instinctively, Zane slid his arms around Ty and caught him up against his chest, stopping his potential sideways pitch.</p><p>Ty tried not to grab him, knowing Zane\u2019s entire back was sore and tender, but it was either that or hit the marble floor. And he really didn\u2019t want to hit the floor again tonight. Considering he\u2019d been ready to kick the living shit out of the other man earlier, he didn\u2019t feel all too guilty about it.</p><p>He offered a grunted curse as he wrapped an arm around Zane\u2019s neck and flailed to try to stay upright. He thought he would have been able to keep his feet if Zane hadn\u2019t grabbed him and tried to help. As it was, he was pulled off balance and practically cuddled as he struggled to get away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Zane said as he pulled Ty against him, one arm encircling his waist and holding tight, easily supporting the other man\u2019s weight until Ty could find his feet.</p><p>Ty\u2019s only response was stunned silence. He looked up and met Zane\u2019s eyes as they stayed locked in the clumsy embrace. \u201cShit,\u201d he finally muttered.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes widened as his gut reacted to the proximity, and he stopped breathing when Ty didn\u2019t immediately pull back. It registered how Ty felt against him, somehow fitting perfectly against his slightly taller and broader frame\u2014just like before. And his body reacted again. Seconds passed, and he couldn\u2019t look away. Oh, he was so going to get the shit beat out of him for this. Again.</p><p>Ty\u2019s thoughts were running along a remarkably similar line. Beating the shit out of Zane sounded like the ticket. He could feel Zane\u2019s physical reaction to the close proximity and he cleared his throat and straightened, pushing gently against Zane\u2019s chest to back him away. \u201cUhh....\u201d</p><p>Slowly squaring his shoulders, Zane literally had to force himself to shift back, pulling away from Ty entirely. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he rasped. His pulse was elevated, among other things.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ty answered as he stepped back and cocked his head, looking away from Zane\u2019s dark eyes and frowning in confusion. He found himself uncharacteristically unable to think of anything else to say as he fought down his own reaction to the incident.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hands fell to his sides, and he shifted his stance. \u201cMaybe?\u201d he asked, brow furrowing. It wasn\u2019t like Ty not to have a snappy remark. Nerves began to bubble in his gut as he waited.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and lifted his head, turning it the other way like a dog trying to hear a distant sound. \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten what I was making fun of you for,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Confused, Zane just watched him. He seemed almost nervous.</p><p>Embarrassed, maybe? For being caught enough unawares to fall over when he opened the door? Or had he felt Zane\u2019s very inappropriate arousal? Jaw tightening, Zane swallowed and backed another step away. This wasn\u2019t a good thing. He should shut the door again and take a shower. Showers were always a good idea for relaxing. Shit shit shit.</p><p>\u201cI think you were calling me a pansy-ass again,\u201d he murmured, turning slightly away.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ty huffed as he turned on his heel and headed back out into the outer room. \u201c\u2018Cause you went and got yourself exploded,\u201d he called as casually as possible as he grabbed his pack and walked slowly back toward the bathroom, trying to calm himself.</p><p>Zane leaned over, bracing himself on the sink as his fingers curled against the porcelain. There was no way he\u2019d be sleeping well anytime soon.</p><p>Shower. That was the ticket. Cold shower, then sleep. He heard Ty coming back and cursed mentally. He couldn\u2019t take a shower after Ty tended those cuts. He hung his head and tried to breathe evenly. Every once in a while he met someone who did this to him, who made him crazy. God, why did it have to be Ty Grady? Why now?</p><p>Ty stood in the doorway and watched Zane for a moment. He licked his lips thoughtfully and frowned. He had noticed a lot of small things adding up about Zane\u2019s behavior, not the least of which was his being aroused by their close proximity. He didn\u2019t think Zane was fucking with him. Ty knew his own sexual preferences weren\u2019t so obvious that after four days a complete stranger would realize he went both ways. Maybe it was just a series of morbid coincidences that made it seem like Zane might do the same.</p><p>Yes, because coincidences were so much more likely than a trained FBI agent figuring something out....</p><p>He would simply have to tread lightly from now on, just in case Zane had sniffed him out and was planning on using it against him. Or he would have to find out for certain. He really didn\u2019t want Zane having any ammunition on him, but his curiosity had always been stronger than his sense of self-preservation.</p><p>A shift of weight warned Zane that Ty had returned, and he straightened, looking in the mirror. Without a word, he lowered his head again and pushed the wet washcloth on the counter toward Ty to use when he cleaned his back. Zane resolved that he would work on case details until he fell over exhausted. Or until he could get another night away. He half-wished he could say something, joke about it. The heat next to him was so damn intoxicating, he wished he had the nerve to do something about it. But his nerve was all tapped out after that fight.</p><p>Ty wiped his back clean with the washcloth and then covered the wounds on Zane\u2019s back liberally with salve, rubbing it in carefully, biting his lip the entire time and careful not to look up into the mirror to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. He was still battling with himself, trying to decide what to say. Because an incident like that couldn\u2019t be left with nothing said.</p><p>Maybe it was the heat and frustration riding him, but Zane thought Ty seemed almost skittish. Christ. At least he wasn\u2019t angry. Zane already knew Ty fought dirtier than he did.</p><p>Leaning on the counter again, Zane muttered to himself. \u201cThis case is going to be the death of me.\u201d If the work didn\u2019t get him, the attraction to his partner curling inside him certainly would. He shivered slightly as the salve cooled.</p><p>Ty removed his fingers from Zane\u2019s back as he saw the shiver run through him, and he pressed his lips tightly together, looking up and away in disgust as he resigned himself to what he was about to do. Broaching the subject could possibly cost him his job if Zane went tattling to the higher-ups about sexual harassment or some shit, but Ty was going to do it anyway.</p><p>\u201cAnything you need to say to me?\u201d</p><p>The other man being so calm when Zane was such a mental wreck went a long way toward cooling him down. Ty wasn\u2019t interested in working out their frustrations in any other way than a fistfight. Zane kept his eyes on his hands, his fingers clenching. What he would do to Ty, given the chance.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t thinking about kicks to the ribs.</p><p>The visual of Ty\u2019s nude body flashed behind Zane\u2019s eyelids, and he spoke before he thought better of it. \u201cNothing you want to hear,\u201d he murmured as he faced the mirror, hoping to diffuse the situation. \u201cThanks for the help,\u201d he added, wanting desperately to get away from this tension. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Ty asked as his stomach fluttered nervously.</p><p>His voice finally betrayed the nerves. \u201cTrying to be a real partner to you here, Zane. If you need to tell me something, then here\u2019s your chance.\u201d</p><p>The uncertainty in Ty\u2019s voice surprised Zane enough that he looked up at the other man\u2019s reflection in the mirror. Four days. It had only taken four days for Ty to get so far under his skin that Zane was losing his grip. It was time to do something about this attraction that had been building. Then, maybe he\u2019d be able to focus again. Another punch from Ty would do the trick.</p> <p>Zane slowly turned around to face the other man, eyes dark and serious. Ignoring the warning bells going off in his head, he leaned back against the counter and reached out to slide the ends of his fingers into the front of the waistband of Ty\u2019s jeans and tug him forward.</p><p>The color drained from Ty\u2019s face as Zane pulled him closer, and his stomach turned again in a pleasant somersault of nervous butterflies. It only took a moment for him to flush with heat, and he looked into Zane\u2019s eyes guardedly as his entire body tensed. If this was anything but completely on the level, Ty was going to knock the bastard on his ass.</p><p>The caution that crept back into Ty\u2019s gaze was a pretty clear warning.</p><p>Zane loosened his fingers and almost let go, but Ty didn\u2019t pull away. It was 142</p><p>now or never. Zane took a slow, deep breath and ducked his chin, tilted his head sideways, and slid his lips firmly against Ty\u2019s.</p> <p>Ty caught his breath, nearly gasping when Zane finally touched their lips together. He shivered and his lips parted tentatively, but his wary eyes never closed. Giving in, Zane pulled him closer and lifted one hand to cup Ty\u2019s cheek as he increased the pressure of his lips against Ty\u2019s.</p><p>Ty groaned softly and finally relaxed against the kiss, returning it tentatively. He knew he\u2019d regret this just as soon as they parted, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop it.</p><p>Tension cramped Zane\u2019s gut as Ty\u2019s lips moved, and he deepened the kiss, all the itch and urge heating inside him as his traced Ty\u2019s lips with his tongue. Oh, this was going to be an absolute fucking mess, he just knew it. He pulled his fingers out of the waistband and curled that arm around Ty\u2019s waist as he leaned into the dangerous kiss. His hand on Ty\u2019s cheek trembled.</p><p>Ty indulged himself in the deeper kiss for a long, horribly tantalizing moment before he pulled his head back just enough to break the contact and pushed gently at Zane\u2019s chest. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d he rasped as his breath gusted against Zane\u2019s lips.</p><p>Zane slowly opened his eyes as their lips hovered a mere breath apart, and he dropped his hand so both settled on Ty\u2019s hips. \u201cThought?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThis ... but I thought you were fucking with me,\u201d Ty gritted out almost angrily as he forced himself not to press their lips together once more.</p> <p>Zane just barely shook his head, pulling back from Ty\u2019s growing ire.</p><p>\u201cNot about this,\u201d he said seriously, already starting to tense and brace himself for a swing.</p><p>Ty did kiss him then, breathing in heavily through his nose as if he were about to dive under water as he pulled himself closer to Zane and growled a little. He figured if Zane was fucking with him now, then he seemed to be enjoying it quite a bit.</p><p>Tightening his arms, Zane closed them further around Ty as he met the kiss with more strength, dizzy with the surprise and desire blasting through him. This was beyond crazy. Beyond negligent. Just ... beyond. All the hate and anger was morphing into heat and passion and he had no idea what to think about it.</p><p>Suddenly, Ty yanked away from the increasingly heated kiss again, stepping back and giving Zane\u2019s chest a good hard smack with the back of his hand. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he gasped as he tried to get himself under control.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Zane yelped as Ty\u2019s hand stung against his bare skin. He gasped out a laugh as he leaned back. \u201cMe?\u201d he asked in disbelief, squirming in place where he practically sat against the counter.</p><p>Ty grabbed him and pulled him off the counter to kiss him again, forcing himself not to think about the consequences. If he thought about it, he\u2019d cut and run\u2014as far and as fast as he possibly could. Zane grunted as he landed against Ty\u2019s chest, his stance spread enough to lower him the couple of inches needed to be at the same height as Ty. Clutching at Ty\u2019s shoulders, Zane shifted his weight to push the other man back toward the door.</p><p>Ty hit the door with a rush of air from his lungs, his hip barely missing the doorknob as the impact slammed the door closed, but neither man noticed. They were far too distracted by the sudden turn of events. \u201cI had you pegged as trouble from minute one,\u201d Ty gasped accusingly between the hurried meetings of their lips.</p> <p>Zane bit Ty\u2019s bottom lip slightly and sucked it between his lips before letting it loose. \u201cYour middle name is trouble,\u201d he said as he ran a hand down Ty\u2019s side, feeling the hard muscles appreciatively.</p><p>Ty hissed with the bite and growled dangerously. He couldn\u2019t decide if he was angry or just really fucking turned on. Either way, it was all Zane fucking Garrett\u2019s fault....</p><p>Pulling in a deep breath when his body reacted to the harsh sound, Zane set his forearm against the door over Ty\u2019s shoulder, making their chests, hips, and groins rock together. \u201cNow what?\u201d he breathed. \u201cYou wanted to know. Now you know.\u201d</p><p>Ty banged his head back on the door and closed his eyes, huffing through his nose as he tried to regain some control. \u201cI lied,\u201d he groaned plaintively. \u201cI didn\u2019t wanna know.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but smile and snicker. \u201cToo late, hotshot,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing from you, that\u2019s pretty much an endearment.\u201d Still grinning, amazed at Ty\u2019s pliancy, Zane leaned forward to steal a firm kiss. Ty\u2019s lips parted almost against his will, and he groaned slightly. Zane couldn\u2019t resist that little sound, and he moved to capture it, sliding his mouth more slowly over Ty\u2019s, rubbing, tongue sliding between swollen lips. Ty seemed to melt against him, losing the tension that was always in him, losing the caustic shield he seemed to rarely drop. He merely managed a few incoherent murmurs as he slid a hand into Zane\u2019s hair.</p><p>Zane wrapped his arms around him when the other man relaxed, not tight, just enough to hold their bodies in constant contact. The tiny sounds and first real touch from the other man rocked Zane\u2019s world badly.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta stop,\u201d Ty groaned finally, pulling back as much as he dared. Their lips still touched when he spoke. \u201cNeither of us is up to this,\u201d he rasped, breathing still difficult as his body screamed for more contact.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the right excuse, Zane knew, but it would have to serve.</p><p>This could only lead to disaster. He slowly straightened, seeing the desire in Ty\u2019s hooded eyes. Somehow he made himself step back, hands sliding on each side of Ty\u2019s rib cage until they fell away.</p><p>Ty lowered his head, still looking at Zane from under lowered brows, and pressed his lips tightly together. \u201cFuck,\u201d he finally observed flatly.</p><p>Zane took another step back, slid one hand into his back pocket to keep it off Ty, and leaned against the counter again. Raising his other hand, he lightly ran a finger over his split lip, feeling the pain return as the tingle and thrill dissipated. He could echo Ty\u2019s sentiment, but the urge to touch and taste was still ravaging him, and it was taking all he had not to grab the other man and grind against him. He closed his eyes in a bid to regain some measure of control.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do we do now?\u201d Ty asked in frustration.</p><p>After squeezing his eyes shut for a long moment, Zane took another step back. \u201cYou\u2019re going back to your room, and I\u2019m taking a cold shower.\u201d</p><p>He turned to yank a towel off the rack.</p><p>\u201cHuh uh,\u201d Ty protested stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019d rather completely fuck us both over than separate,\u201d he added with a flush that was part embarrassment, part desire to do just what he\u2019d said.</p><p>Zane turned back to him, his lack of patience very clear. \u201cGet out of the bathroom or fucked over is what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Another thrill ran through Ty\u2019s body and he inclined his head slightly; part challenge, part invitation. Fuck it. He had never followed the rules anyway.</p><p>Eyes turning sparkling black, Zane reached out, grabbed Ty\u2019s arm and yanked him to the side, just enough to get his weight behind him to shove him against the sink, belly first. He was immediately on him, grinding against his ass, and he leaned over to bite the back of Ty\u2019s shoulder, hard, before he looked up to meet Ty\u2019s eyes in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you want?\u201d Zane ground out. \u201cHard and messy in a goddamn hotel bathroom?\u201d He pressed him harder into the sink counter.</p><p>Ty looked up to meet Zane\u2019s eyes in the reflection of the mirror, and he grinned slowly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s temper flared, and his stomach plummeted painfully as he realized that Ty was just messing with him. \u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he hissed. He pulled back, yanked open the bathroom door, and then shoved Ty straight out of the room with enough force that the man hit the mirrored closet door on the opposite wall with a rattle. Then he slammed the bathroom door shut between them.</p><p>Ty stayed where he\u2019d practically splatted for a long moment, breathing heavily and resting his forehead against the cool surface of the mirror to calm himself. Hard and messy in a hotel bathroom had sounded pretty damn fun, actually. Christ, Zane was a fucking Jekyll and Hyde case.</p><p>Reaching in the shower to turn the cold water on full blast, Zane kicked out of his jeans and briefs with a growl, the heat of his anger matching the roiling desire for the man he\u2019d just thrown out. \u201cFucking asshole,\u201d he hissed as he climbed full into the shower spray and yanked the curtain shut.</p><p>How could he have misjudged Ty\u2019s reactions? The bastard must have been putting on from the first moment their lips touched.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit all to hell,\u201d he growled. The cold water was barely having any effect. He slammed the side of his fist against the tile, only to cuss again colorfully and shake his hand as the pain reverberated through his fingers and up his arm again.</p><p>Ty heard the thud from within the bathroom and finally raised his head. He turned to look at the door and narrowed his eyes. So, Rule Number One, apparently, was that he wasn\u2019t allowed to crack a smile during foreplay.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he muttered to himself as he pulled his shirt over his head and tossed it to the side before stepping up to the door and throwing it open.</p><p>Zane\u2019s head shot up as the door hit the wall. What the hell? Then, and only then, it occurred to him that Ty just might have been serious with that smile. Fuck.</p><p>Ty was already half-undressed, so it wouldn\u2019t have taken him all that long to finish the job. But instead, he yanked the shower curtain back and stepped into the shower without removing his jeans, and he grabbed Zane and slammed him against the tile along the back side of the shower.</p><p>He\u2019d half-expected it, but Zane was still surprised by the other man\u2019s vehemence and he gasped and growled as his back hit the cool wall opposite the curtain painfully.</p><p>Ty reached over to the shower knobs and turned the temperature of the water up to something more tolerable, holding his forearm across Zane\u2019s chest. \u201cWe\u2019ve really got to work on that temper of yours,\u201d he drawled as he pressed himself against Zane\u2019s body.</p><p>A breath shuddered out of Zane as he spread both hands, palms flat against the tile. The warm water and the press of the other man\u2019s body were doing the trick to bring him fully hard again. \u201cTy,\u201d he said harshly.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty hissed in response as his entire body turned over into tackle mode and drove all other thoughts from his mind. He ducked his head to lick a trail of water running down Zane\u2019s collarbone and then bit him lightly.</p><p>Zane groaned and his eyes rolled back as his hands moved without thought to clutch at Ty\u2019s hips. \u201cYou make me absolutely fucking crazy,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>\u201cHate to break it to you, but I think you were there long before I came along,\u201d Ty murmured before he raised his head and kissed Zane slowly.</p><p>One hand shifted up to curl around the back of Ty\u2019s neck as they kissed, and Zane shifted his feet apart so Ty was right up against his body. His patience and good sense were blown. He didn\u2019t want to say no to this. It was so much better than any booze or drugs. His blood thrummed with it; his chest and belly were taut with it.</p><p>\u201cYou might find it a bit more difficult to toss me out next time,\u201d Ty hissed as one hand snaked down Zane\u2019s body and between them.</p><p>Zane\u2019s next breath nearly choked him as Ty\u2019s hand slid between their bodies, soft compared to the wet denim that scraped against his bare midsection. No, he didn\u2019t imagine he\u2019d be tossing Ty anywhere. His eyes opened. \u201cNext time?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hand closed around him, and he nipped at his chin in answer.</p><p>The back of Zane\u2019s head hit the tile, and he held Ty\u2019s shoulders tight as he reacted, swelling as a strangled gasp escaped him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Ty cooed to him with a smirk as he stroked him slowly. \u201cWhen was the last time you fucked someone you didn\u2019t pay, Zane?\u201d he asked in an almost conversational tone as the water pounded down on them both.</p><p>Dragging his eyes open, Zane met Ty\u2019s changeable eyes. His lashes were dotted with water drops. \u201cToo damn long,\u201d he said lowly. Ty kissed him again almost before he got the words out, and his hand sped up slightly as he pressed his body into Zane\u2019s.</p><p>Feeling like he was about to burn to a crisp, Zane shook all over as his hips shifted to move against Ty\u2019s hand. Oh, God. He groaned and laid his head back, eyes shut against the water splashing off his shoulder. It didn\u2019t matter that he\u2019d gotten off about six hours ago. He was hard and straining. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty\u2019s other hand slid behind his head to cushion his skull from hitting the tiles, and he kissed Zane again demandingly as he continued to stroke relentlessly.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to take much longer, not at all. The hard kiss, the catch and slide of Ty\u2019s hand, and the tension all spiraled tighter and tighter as Zane growled into Ty\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Ty urged, not at all concerned with land-speed records or propriety.</p><p>Zane gritted his teeth as the electricity of Ty\u2019s touch flashed through him. He growled and lowered his chin, then he opened his eyes and reached out to grab Ty for an animalistic kiss as his hips jerked and he slammed into orgasm. Ty pinned him against the wall and kissed him back, enjoying the result of his efforts almost as much as Zane did. Body twitching through the climax, Zane had to gasp against Ty\u2019s lips, crying out on an exhale as Ty\u2019s hand kept moving while he got more and more sensitive.</p><p>Ty finally took pity on him and slid his hand back up Zane\u2019s body, wrapping around him and kissing him more slowly as he gave him a chance to recover. Shaky and flushed, Zane relaxed fluidly into Ty\u2019s arms and the kiss, anger sloughing off him like the water on its way to the drain.</p><p>After a long, leisurely moment, Ty pushed away from the wall and grinned as he licked his lips. \u201cThere,\u201d he huffed, sounding very pleased with himself. \u201cNow you can stop being so fucking cranky for a while.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted and laughed weakly, raising both hands to rub over his face. \u201cChrist,\u201d he said with great feeling as he sagged back against the wall.</p><p>Ty smiled and gave his characteristic self-satisfied \u201cMm hmm\u201d before pulling the curtain back and stepping over the side of the bathtub carefully in his wet socks.</p><p>Zane watched him as the water misted over the tub\u2019s edge. Ty\u2019s jeans were totally soaked and clung to him like a second skin, and Zane had to 148</p><p>swallow hard. Jesus. \u201cGood luck getting out of those gracefully,\u201d he rasped with a slight smile, still leaning against the wall.</p><p>\u201cGood luck thinking for the next hour,\u201d Ty shot back with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Zane muttered, turning into the spray to wash before leaning and shutting the water off.</p><p>Ty stood, silent and dripping in the middle of the bathroom, and watched him intently. When Zane turned around, water still dripped down his neck and wound in rivulets down his shoulders and chest as he stepped out of the shower to stand not six inches from the other man. Ty licked his lips and tilted his head, waiting for Zane\u2019s next move. The other man stood there a long moment, then reached forward and unbuttoned Ty\u2019s jeans, pulling down the zipper slowly. Ty bit his lip and tilted his head back, his eyes never leaving Zane\u2019s even as his body thrummed with the contact.</p><p>\u201cGood luck getting me out of these gracefully,\u201d he echoed wryly, his voice low even though he was smiling. Zane actually smiled and chuckled as he ducked his chin and slid his hands into the wet denim over Ty\u2019s hips, peeling it down over the equally wet briefs underneath. Ty\u2019s eyes drifted closed, and he tilted his head into Zane\u2019s cheek, groaning softly.</p><p>The motion warmed Zane, and he turned his cheek to rub it against Ty\u2019s forehead while he slowly worked the wet denim down his hips. The whole thing was disconcertingly tender, but Ty didn\u2019t want to make Zane stop by observing this out loud. Without warning, Zane hefted Ty up and sat him on the counter, moving in between his awkwardly spread knees to claim another kiss.</p><p>Ty nearly flailed. Christ, he\u2019d never actually been picked up during sex before. He gripped Zane\u2019s arms tightly and returned the kiss, but broke it off to warn in a rasping voice, \u201cI don\u2019t bottom well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zane drawled uncaringly. \u201cShould I have taken that sultry grin of yours a while ago as an invitation?\u201d he asked, his manner turning more seductive.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ty answered in a voice that was more of an uncertain whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t make you any less of a man,\u201d Zane parroted, bumping Ty\u2019s forehead lightly with his own.</p><p>\u201cOh, you bastard,\u201d Ty growled, beginning to struggle out of the vulnerable position Zane had set him in.</p><p>Zane laughed and pushed further in between Ty\u2019s legs as he struggled, wrapping one arm around his waist, grasping the back of his neck with his other hand. \u201cYou\u2019re stunning when you\u2019re angry, you little fuck,\u201d he muttered before smashing their mouths together, the odd gentility of the last few minutes obliterated.</p><p>Ty did flail then, uttering a muffled exclamation of hatred against Zane\u2019s lips. Zane smiled into the kiss as he listened. He used to think he\u2019d be able to quit drinking once he\u2019d had his fill. He was already scared to death it wouldn\u2019t work with Ty, either. But the hunger was eating him up, so much so that he was very nearly hard again already.</p> <p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Ty finally muttered as they broke another heated kiss.</p><p>\u201cIs that a comment or a request?\u201d Zane asked breathlessly.</p><p>Ty lowered his head to press his lips to Zane\u2019s shoulder and closed his eyes. Jacking him off in the shower was one thing. Fucking would be entirely another. But hell, Ty wasn\u2019t ever one to stop when he was ahead.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d he answered hoarsely.</p><p>Zane slid his hands to Ty\u2019s hips, gripping them and pulling his body toward him to the edge of the counter.</p><p>\u201cLet me get my fucking socks off first,\u201d Ty growled as he tried to kick out of the soaking wet jeans that still clung to his ankles. Zane bent down and tugged them off one leg at a time, then yanked at Ty\u2019s socks impatiently before standing and wrapping his arms around him to kiss him again impulsively.</p><p>Ty mumbled and put up a token struggle as Zane began dragging him out of the bathroom and to the bed, but the slight resistance in Ty\u2019s actions fueled Zane\u2019s desire even more.</p><p>A handful of stumbling steps later they stood at the foot of the bed Ty had claimed. Ty pulled away and suffered through a brief moment of clarity.</p><p>\u201cDo you have supplies for this sort of endeavor?\u201d he asked Zane before he got far enough away to meet his eyes.</p><p>Zane stalked over to his duffel and dug in it to pull out a small black shaving kit, bringing it back and tossing it on the bed. He stopped a foot away, looking at Ty evenly. The desire ran rampant through him, and he felt like he was dying of thirst. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than the damn drink,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Ty raised his chin and licked his lips. He wasn\u2019t sure if that was good or not, but it sure as hell felt good. But then, that pretty much summed up how he felt about the whole situation.</p><p>Zane had already made his decision. He wasn\u2019t going to be able to concentrate on the case in this state, so he might as well do something about it. And the fact that Ty was ready, willing, and able went a long way toward making it a lot more pleasurable. He moved forward until their chests barely brushed. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Ty inclined his head even further and tilted it to the side, looking down at Zane\u2019s mouth and then up into his eyes. He smiled slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t bottom well,\u201d he warned again softly.</p><p>Heat flared in Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he said in a deceptively light voice just before he grabbed Ty\u2019s arm and swung him around, pulling his ass back against him while wrapping his arm around him. Zane knew full well Ty was letting him do it. It made it just that much more tantalizing. His voice was dark and throbbing when he purred, \u201cI\u2019m all for a good, hard fuck.\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and let his head rest back on Zane\u2019s shoulder, the words sending a dull throb straight to his groin. When he didn\u2019t struggle, Zane let his hands roam, getting to know the feel of Ty\u2019s skin, and he lowered his head to lick from his collarbone up to his ear. Ty huffed out a breath of air through his nose and shifted back against the hard muscles behind him.</p><p>Zane bit down lightly at the juncture of Ty\u2019s neck and shoulder as he groped his way down Ty\u2019s body.\u201dYou going to fight me?\u201d he asked, wanting to know what to expect before throwing Ty to the bed and literally pouncing on his ass.</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d Ty groaned, surprised by how much he really wanted to be overpowered, a sharp contrast to the painful fight in the alley.</p><p>Just like that, Zane was achingly erect, and he rubbed up against Ty\u2019s ass as he mouthed along the back of his shoulder. \u201cAnother time,\u201d he agreed before pushing Ty down onto the bed. He\u2019d enjoy that, too. But for now, he just wanted to sink into Ty and wallow there.</p><p>Ty hit the mattress on his hands and knees, but almost immediately lowered himself to his stomach. Zane just as quickly crawled over him. His extra height gave him the length he needed to press a heated kiss to the back of Ty\u2019s neck and press his groin against Ty\u2019s ass as he fumbled for the kit.</p><p>For some reason, Ty could no longer do anything but react. His body was reacting, his mind was reacting, and he was greeting each of Zane\u2019s actions with a needy, almost desperate reaction of his own. But if he had been needed to act on his own, to actually think, he would have never been able to get off the bed. He wasn\u2019t sure if he liked the submissive effect Zane was having on him, but his body certainly did.</p><p>On his knees over Ty\u2019s thighs, Zane slicked his fingers and trailed down, expecting a man like Ty to tense when he touched him. He actually wished Ty would fight him, although he was incredibly tempting like this. If he\u2019d fought Zane, just enough, Zane would have taken him and fucked him over hard, taking everything he could get out of his tight ass. But this, God, it was incredible and unexpected, feeling Ty writhing and pliable under him.</p><p>The intimate touch did make him jerk, but Ty rolled his shoulders and dug his fingers into the sheets, shaking off the tension. He hoped Zane realized just how much effort it took to not buck him off. Zane leaned over to murmur in his ear as he slid his fingers back and forth over where he hoped to soon bury himself. \u201cTy, for fuck\u2019s sake, move,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to throw me off so easily.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head to the side, brushing his cheek against Zane\u2019s lips.</p><p>He did move then, but only to push against the bed and raise his body up into Zane\u2019s. Groaning, Zane slid his aching cock back and forth against Ty\u2019s skin and pushed his lubricated finger inside the other man. It was hard to go slow.</p><p>Oh, so difficult. But if he did it right now, then soon he could fuck Ty through the damn mattress.</p><p>Ty groaned plaintively, tensing involuntarily and squirming.</p><p>Zane stilled. \u201cHurting?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up and keep going,\u201d Ty growled in a strained voice.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Zane breathed as he moved his hand again, another few pushes and another finger as he leaned over enough to press his forehead to Ty\u2019s shoulder blade while he tried to breathe evenly. Having come once, he\u2019d last awhile. Maybe. With Ty, all bets were off.</p><p>Beneath him, Ty arched his back, trying to push up into him and groaning encouragingly. He hurried, unwilling to wait much longer; Ty\u2019s body was giving him all the right signals, and he was worried Ty might suddenly change his mind and kick his ass instead. Zane grabbed up a condom and made short work of it, then lined up, one hand on Ty\u2019s right hip, the other on his left shoulder.</p><p>Ty lowered his head and raised his hips higher, closing his eyes and breathing out slowly in expectation of what he knew was going to hurt. He wanted it, though. He wanted it badly. His entire body shook with the desire.</p><p>Zane smoothed his hand over Ty\u2019s back and pushed in slowly. He wasn\u2019t small and, god damn, Ty was so tight. He pushed in just enough, and then he started rocking gently. Ty groaned and remained still for a brief moment, 152</p><p>letting himself deal with the burning pain before he pushed back against the intrusion in a silent demand for more.</p><p>Sucking in a shaky breath, Zane answered Ty\u2019s movement with a bit more force added to his rocking, sinking slightly deeper each time. He curled over Ty\u2019s back, his hand coasting from shoulder to hip and under Ty\u2019s belly to slide around the half-hard cock hanging there.</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Ty breathed pleadingly. He wasn\u2019t even sure what he was asking for. He just knew it felt so fucking good he could barely stand it.</p><p>Gasping softly as he turned his cheek against Ty\u2019s back, Zane pushed harder, sinking over half in before pulling out, the clamp of Ty\u2019s body an irresistible lure. He slid his fist back and forth, feeling Ty\u2019s reaction as well as hearing it. It thrilled him. It was so different from the sarcasm, anger, and cold dislike. It went straight to Zane\u2019s belly and he shuddered.</p><p>Ty trembled under him, and finally he sank back to his stomach, bringing Zane with him and taking the full weight of Zane\u2019s body on his to pin him to the mattress. \u201cCome on,\u201d he urged, the same words he\u2019d hissed in the shower. He needed this. Needed it.</p><p>Zane squeezed his eyes shut, the growl in Ty\u2019s voice draining some of his control. The smooth rocking paused as he pulled his hand out from under Ty, and then he snapped his hips forward, hard, burying himself deep with a groan of pleasure.</p><p>Ty responded with an involuntary cry. He pushed back again, physically begging for more as jolts of pleasure and hot pain ran through him.</p><p>Grunting, Zane shifted so he could thrust into Ty\u2019s body in a rough motion as he gripped his hips. Even when he pulled back, he was surrounded by the heat of Ty\u2019s body, and Zane was steadily losing his mind again as his knees slid on the sheets.</p><p>Each thrust was doing the same to Ty, though he tried desperately not to whimper. \u201cHarder,\u201d he begged in a hoarse, rasping voice.</p><p>Fingers gripping hard, Zane braced one knee and loosed what little control he had left. He truly fucked Ty and then some, jarring them both and the bed enough to shake the pillows to the floor. He grunted with each thrust, a low growl growing deep in his chest, able to let loose when Ty just took more and more, clearly wanting it. Fuck ... had it ever been this way? Zane couldn\u2019t remember a time he hadn\u2019t been afraid of hurting his bed partner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And it went on and on, both of them struggling for breaths as they strained against each other.</p><p>\u201cTy...,\u201d Zane finally managed hoarsely as he felt his body tighten in warning. But Ty couldn\u2019t answer, his breath coming in gasps and each thrust forcing a groan out of him as he took the pounding.</p><p>Zane gave a hissed curse as he went over the edge, hips losing rhythm and jerking erratically as the heat and press of Ty\u2019s body dragged the climax out of him.</p> <p>Ty moaned long and loud as Zane rode out his orgasm. He tightened every muscle in his already tense body and fisted his hands in the sheets, toes curling involuntarily in sympathy of the pleasure. Zane cried out\u2014a tortured rasp, really\u2014as he was caught by the pressure. The heat washed through him and he shivered, drawing a shaky breath before pulling out and heaving himself up on his knees. Ty remained where he was, face pressed into the mattress and eyes closed as his shoulders shook almost imperceptibly.</p><p>Zane shifted to sit heavily at the other man\u2019s side. \u201cTy,\u201d he breathed, looking at him, seeing him tremble. He leaned onto his side, tucked his head under Ty\u2019s chin and kissed him. \u201cLet me,\u201d he whispered against Ty\u2019s lips, one hand burrowing under him to reach the straining erection trapped against the bed.</p><p>Ty groaned and lifted up, then immediately pushed his hips against Zane\u2019s hand as he kissed him hungrily. Zane curled his fingers around Ty\u2019s cock and tightened his fist as his mouth gave way to Ty\u2019s demand. His sore wrist ached with the motion, but he didn\u2019t give a damn just then. Ty jerked into his hand and gave a muffled moan. He raised his arm to pin Zane under him like a large dog would do to capture a cat, and he rocked against him, never breaking the kiss. Several more slow thrusts, and the tight coil of pleasure in Ty\u2019s groin snapped. His fingers tightened in Zane\u2019s short hair and he groaned plaintively as he came in Zane\u2019s hand.</p><p>Zane sighed against Ty\u2019s lips as he relaxed; the heated slick of Ty\u2019s come dripping over his fingers assured him of Ty\u2019s pleasure taken. His back stung, his wrist ached, and his bruised fingers hurt like hell, adding a bit of an edge to the overwhelming satiation that threatened to send him to sleep right then and there.</p><p>Ty nearly collapsed against him, just barely managing the energy to flop to the side instead of just down on top of him. \u201cFuck,\u201d he offered weakly, eyes closing as he rolled to his back.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane agreed. His eyes were blurring, so he just closed them.</p><p>\u201cWe shoulda done that in your bed,\u201d Ty finally grumbled.</p><p>\u201cPriss,\u201d Zane murmured sleepily.</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Ty responded without moving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold,\u201d Zane strung together, voice thick.</p><p>\u201cLike I care,\u201d Ty grunted softly as he finally forced himself to move.</p> <p>He rolled off the edge of the bed and thumped loudly to the floor, then stood and slid liquidly under the covers all in one graceful motion.</p><p>Zane grumbled and turned to his hands and knees, backing off the side of the bed and standing up. He disposed of the used condom and cleaned up with one of the dirty towels in the corner. He ran both hands over his face and through his hair, and then looked down at Ty.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty questioned as he burrowed under the covers.</p><p>\u201cI want to sleep here with you,\u201d Zane admitted petulantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you?\u201d Ty challenged with a small smirk, curious as to what Zane would do.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d been afraid Ty would stop him. Zane pulled the sheets down on the side to Ty\u2019s left and slid into the warm cotton, his legs stretching out easily. He pulled the pillow under his head and rolled to his side, facing Ty. He opened his mouth to say \u201cthank you\u201d or \u201cgood night\u201d or \u201cplease touch me again,\u201d but instead there was nothing.</p><p>Ty lay there looking at him expressionlessly. Finally, his hand slid under the covers and onto Zane\u2019s hip, pulling him closer as he gently caressed the skin of his hip and waist. He scooted closer, until finally he had his arm draped around Zane and his other arm under Zane\u2019s neck to support his head.</p><p>He wedged his face between Zane\u2019s and the pillow. \u201cThis in no way means I don\u2019t still hate you,\u201d he muttered as he nuzzled his nose and mouth against Zane\u2019s temple and closed his eyes.</p> <p>Zane smiled, his lower arm shifted so he could place his palm over Ty\u2019s beating heart, and his top arm curled over his waist. He drifted to sleep, feeling amazingly comfortable, listening to Ty\u2019s steady breathing.</p><p>slim woman in uniform with her dark hair pulled back into a severe bun stopped next to Detective Steve Pierce\u2019s desk. \u201cGot some Amessages for you, Detective,\u201d she said, holding out a few pink pieces of paper.</p><p>Pierce glanced up. \u201cThanks, Branson. I\u2019m putting in another work order on that voice mail,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, sir. It\u2019s no problem, unless we\u2019re booking,\u201d she answered before taking herself back to the front counter across the large squad room.</p><p>Detective Steve Holleman glanced up at his partner from across their connected desks and raised an eyebrow at him. Pierce leaned back in the creaky chair and flipped through the pink slips. He scowled at one in particular and stared at it hatefully.</p><p>\u201cCare to share?\u201d Holleman finally prodded.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn Feebs again,\u201d Pierce muttered, tossing the pink slips on his desk. \u201cAbout the serial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else is new?\u201d Holleman muttered as he went back to the report he was filling out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from that Henninger guy. There\u2019s a new team here,\u201d Pierce said, picking up his coffee with one hand and spinning his computer mouse with the other to wake up the monitor.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Holleman huffed as if that should be obvious. \u201cThe last ones got themselves killed.\u201d</p><p>Pierce slanted a displeased look at his partner, but didn\u2019t tell him off.</p><p>\u201cI still think they need to check their own house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them that. Shit, one of those guys almost went nuclear when one of the uniforms mentioned that at the last crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. We\u2019d probably react the same way, though. I just hate that they can march in and do whatever the hell they want. That\u2019s why this 156</p><p>thing hasn\u2019t been solved yet. Too many fingers in the pot, screwing with the soup.\u201d</p><p>Holleman plunked his pen down and looked up at his partner with a frown. \u201cYou\u2019re not starting with the food analogies again, are you?\u201d he asked flatly.</p><p>Pierce rolled his eyes. \u201cThey got too many people dealing with the details, fucking up the evidence, and then they wonder why the case is so screwed. Then, of course, they call us and expect us to snap to. I\u2019m thinking this time, they can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that won\u2019t piss them off,\u201d Holleman muttered as he picked up his pen again. \u201cWhatever. I\u2019ve got too much shit to do as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call them tomorrow morning. You got that paperwork from Trenton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere,\u201d Holleman answered distractedly. \u201cYou got that statement from the chick who didn\u2019t like buttoning her shirt?\u201d he asked as he looked back up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, in that stack,\u201d Pierce pointed to the corner of his desk.</p><p>\u201cSingleton put a photo in there, too, of course.\u201d</p><p>Holleman rifled through the stack until he found the folder. He plucked it out of the stack and looked at it with a smirk. Turning it around to show Pierce, he laughed softly and said, \u201cThink we got any of her face?\u201d</p><p>Pierce glanced over and did a double take. \u201cAw, shit. Singleton\u2019s gonna get his ass in a sling.\u201d He rubbed his hands over his eyes. \u201cThe cases keep getting weirder, and then that damn serial pops up again.\u201d He sighed and looked up to gaze across the two desks at his partner.</p><p>Holleman\u2019s tongue was hanging out of his mouth again, stuck to the side like it always did when he was deep in thought. \u201cWanna go get food?\u201d he finally asked after pondering the universe for a time.</p><p>It took a moment for Pierce to blink himself out of his stare. \u201cAh, yeah. Sure. I could use more coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we can call back those clowns and get it over with,\u201d Holleman muttered as he stood and pushed away from the desk.</p><p>Pierce followed Holleman out of the office, grumbling to himself disconsolately the whole way.</p><p>TY slid carefully out of the bed and padded around the room, cleaning up and getting dressed almost silently. He risked a few glances at his bedmate and his frown deepened every time he did so. What the hell had they been thinking?</p><p>They hadn\u2019t stopped with just one try. Hours after falling asleep in each other\u2019s arms, they had awakened again and gone at it without any thought to the consequences. Ty had taken his turn, giving as good as he\u2019d gotten from Zane. At least they\u2019d both be sore as hell today.</p><p>Ty shook his head and went to the window, glancing out at the light rain. His entire body ached, and not altogether in good ways. He frowned even harder as he stood there, waiting for Zane to wake.</p><p>The bed growing cool pushed Zane from his sleep and he slowly shifted under the sheet. He made a soft sound deep in his throat when he rolled carefully onto his back. It wasn\u2019t just his back that hurt. He opened his eyes to focus on the ceiling before turning his eyes to the other bed. Empty.</p><p>He turned his chin and saw Ty standing at the window. He looked tired and tense. Zane stifled a sigh. He knew he should have expected something like that.</p><p>Ty glanced over his shoulder when he heard the rustling and he cleared his throat. \u201cHey,\u201d he offered lamely.</p><p>Zane raised his uninjured hand to rub at his eyes. \u201cWhat time is it?</p><p>How long did we sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nine-thirty,\u201d Ty answered without glancing at his watch or the clock. He looked away from Zane and back out the window. \u201cHow you feelin\u2019?\u201d he asked as he stared at the rain coming down.</p><p>\u201cGroggy,\u201d Zane said, his voice still thick and warm from sleep. He ran his hand over his hair and yawned, considering turning over and going back to sleep.</p><p>Ty lowered his head and considered the pros and cons of admitting how fucking sore he was. Everywhere. It might go to easing some of the awkwardness anyway. \u201cMy ass hurts,\u201d he finally admitted with a small, wry smile.</p><p>Zane reopened his eyes to look at the other man. He had no idea how to respond to that, so he just looked at him. Ty shrugged lopsidedly when Zane didn\u2019t respond. The cell phone at his hip began to sing, saving him from having to say anything further. He answered it with a clipped murmur after looking at the number.</p><p>Once Ty was distracted, Zane let his eyes slide down the wiry, half-clothed body. Ty\u2019s ass hurt. Zane\u2019s lips twitched. Not a good idea to laugh, he was sure. But damn ... what a boost to the ego. He pushed away the sheet and got out of the bed.</p><p>He lifted his arms slowly and started to lengthen his body in a long stretch. He bobbed his head from side to side, and bones popped. He relished the stretch for a moment before heading over to his duffel and digging for clothes.</p><p>Ty watched him, listening distractedly to the man on the phone as he did so. He realized with some annoyance that he was pondering the advantages of jumping his partner again. Finally, he looked away and shook his head. When he spoke into the phone after a long time of just listening, it wasn\u2019t in English.</p><p>Zane glanced over when the lyrical language poured out in Ty\u2019s raspy voice. He didn\u2019t know which language it was, but something Middle Eastern; it had that sound. Maybe Farsi. Much more melodic than Zane\u2019s own rapid-fire Spanish. The sound of it didn\u2019t seem to fit Ty\u2019s voice\u2014or him\u2014at all.</p><p>The conversation didn\u2019t last long, and Ty bid the man farewell softly before ending the call and clipping the phone back onto his belt. He turned around and looked at Zane thoughtfully. \u201cYou feel up to a little trekking today?\u201d he asked, not even pretending to try and explain who had been on the phone.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Zane answered, shrugging off any curiosity. \u201cMoving around will keep my back from getting too stiff.\u201d Before he thought better of it, Zane glanced to Ty, then down to Ty\u2019s ass, then back up to Ty\u2019s eyes. Ty raised an eyebrow and sneered at him. Zane bit back the smile and picked up his clothes. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d he asked as he walked toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI want to go see a body dump,\u201d Ty called in answer, telling himself to let it go. He had offered the information, after all. He knew he risked a little razzing for it. Perhaps he had been looking for a sincere response, something to build up a little trust, instead of what he had gotten. Oh, well.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to call Morrison or Henninger to set it up? Or are we still steering clear of the office for now?\u201d Zane got into the bathroom and couldn\u2019t hold back the grin any longer. Then he shook his head and started cleaning himself up to go.</p><p>\u201cNone of them are still cordoned off, so we can just go. I just need to see them,\u201d Ty answered as he turned back to the window and frowned at his watery reflection.</p><p>Zane stepped around the corner and watched Ty for a long moment.</p><p>When he spoke, his voice was lower and quieter. More serious. \u201cCrunching profiles?\u201d</p><p>Ty cocked his head to the side and cracked his neck with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI just need to see why he left them where he did.\u201d</p><p>Considering that response, Zane looked up at the photos tacked on the wall. He hadn\u2019t thought about why the bodies were left as they were. \u201cWell, get moving, Marine. We\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d His voice was still quiet, despite the words.</p><p>Ty turned around and huffed at him again. \u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d he informed the man as he picked up the T-shirt he had pulled out to wear. It was a white camp-style T-shirt with a brown teepee on the front, surrounded by the words </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCamp Runamuck.\u201d</p><p>Zane cocked his head to one side as Ty pulled it over his head.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you get these shirts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ty asked innocently.</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cA Marine at Camp Runamuck. Hysterical,\u201d he murmured as he started loading up his pockets.</p><p>Ty looked down at his chest and smiled slightly. \u201cMy former brothers-in-arms send them to me,\u201d he answered. \u201cI get a new one about every two or three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce a Marine, always a Marine,\u201d Zane quoted as he pulled on a light jacket.</p><p>\u201cI loved being a Marine,\u201d Ty responded defensively.</p> <p>Zane looked at him evenly, seeing the bottom of Ty\u2019s tattoo peeking out from under a shirtsleeve. \u201cYou still are a Marine,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ty stopped his movements and cocked his head at Zane, trying to decide whether he was serious or just humoring him.</p><p>\u201cMy brother-in-law\u2019s a Marine,\u201d Zane said. \u201cHe always said you\u2019re one for life.\u201d He waited for Ty\u2019s response.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes darted over Zane thoughtfully. \u201cHe was right,\u201d he murmured finally before looking away and grabbing his leather jacket.</p><p>Zane kept his eyes on him for a few moments longer before turning to pick up his gun, check it, and slide it into its holster. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Ty merely nodded as he slid his wallet into his back pocket and looked up. His oddly colored eyes met Zane\u2019s dark ones. A thousand things to say went through Ty\u2019s mind, and he even opened his mouth to speak. He licked his lips and lowered his head before he could, though, and he gestured to the door to cover his discomfort.</p> <p>Although Zane was fascinated by Ty\u2019s behavior, he made himself turn and walk. Maybe it was just that Ty had to work himself up to be such a bastard. Since he\u2019d just had a few rounds of stress relief and a night\u2019s sleep, he was calm. Zane sighed and opened the door for the other man, wishing he knew how to build a profile. He\u2019d bet good money Ty\u2019s would resemble a Rorschach.</p><p>Ty slid his hands into his pockets and kept his head down as they walked to the elevators. He\u2019d lost control with Zane, and he couldn\u2019t seem to come to terms with what he\u2019d let happen. Not only had they fucked, but Ty had let Zane fuck him. He\u2019d given up every ounce of control to a man he barely liked. And Ty had enjoyed it immensely.</p><p>Zane stabbed the elevator button and waited, Ty silent and nearly brooding alongside him. They both had plenty to think about. At least Zane did, and he resisted the urge to look over at Ty to try to read his face. He watched the elevator numbers change, approaching their floor. \u201cTy,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Ty glanced at him and frowned slightly.</p><p>\u201cMy ass hurts, too,\u201d Zane admitted quietly as the doors opened to other people.</p><p>Ty looked from Zane to the several people in the elevator and bit his lip against a smile. Whether they had heard him was hard to tell, but just the fact that Zane had said it lifted a little bit of weight from Ty\u2019s shoulders. He couldn\u2019t fuck someone without a sense of humor. It just didn\u2019t sit right with him. He cleared his throat, trying not to laugh as they entered the elevator.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d was all he managed to say in response.</p><p>They said nothing more as they rode down to the lobby and went outside to hail a cab. It wasn\u2019t necessarily a comfortable silence. More like a temporary truce.</p> <p>The taxi dropped them off at the massive Civil War-era gate that marked the main entrance to Green-Wood Cemetery. The rain had lessened some, but it had brought with it a chill that ate through their clothing and nipped at their bare skin. Ty shoved his hands into his pockets and peered up through the falling rain at the stonework with something like reverence. He could already see the appeal of the location as a drop spot.</p><p>Zane stood several feet away, looking around. The weather was perfect for the location\u2014cool and dreary, adding to the inherent quiet and sadness in the graveyard. But it didn\u2019t take away from the strange beauty of the place. He studied the huge archway with some interest and appreciation before looking to Ty.</p><p>Ty was still looking up when he spoke. \u201cHooker was found wrapped in her sheet at one of the tombs,\u201d he told Zane quietly. \u201cNo teeth, otherwise untouched.\u201d</p><p>The other agent\u2019s eyes turned toward the monuments that stood further into the graveyard, past the darkening grass and burnt amber leaves that contrasted sharply with the dirty marble stones. Something inside Zane began to ache a little, and he frowned slightly, shoving his hands into his pockets.</p><p>Ty glanced over at him when he didn\u2019t respond. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked with a frown.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes flickered, but he nodded right away. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said quietly. He could feel the weight of the place settling around him. He imagined Ty did, too. The ambiance was too majestic not to feel and feel deeply. \u201cLead on.\u201d</p><p>Ty watched him for a moment and then nodded, bowing his head in the rain as he headed for the gate. Burial grounds had always spoken to Ty in a way not many things did. This one in particular was a beautiful one. It was speaking to him, too, telling him about their killer as he walked over the sodden grass toward the older tombstones.</p><p>Zane followed along behind him, eyes down. They walked in silence as the rain continued to patter through the trees above them. The soaked ground was covered with yellow leaves, obscuring grave markers in places, highlighting them in others. Ty stopped under one of the trees and looked around at the aging stone in appreciation. He drew a sheet of paper from his pocket and studied it for a moment, then looked up into the distance, frowning.</p><p>When Ty paused, Zane almost ran into him. He was too busy taking in the yard around them; the wide variety of stones, the thoughts behind the monuments. It was very different here ... different from what he\u2019d expected.</p><p>The fall weather had turned the trees into brilliant colors, painting a normally dreary location with streaks of life. It was an odd dichotomy that made his chest ache even more.</p><p>Ty finally determined that they were in relatively the right spot, and he folded the paper and slid it back into his pocket. \u201cThis is it,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>They stood on the path that wound through the yard, near a set of family tombs, all lined up in neatly hewn squares. Zane didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Instead, he waited to see what insights Ty might have. This side of the search wasn\u2019t something Zane had much experience with; he was trained to follow paper trails and details, not pick other people\u2019s thoughts and motivations out of thin air.</p><p>Ty was silent as Zane waited, walking around the site slowly with his head down. It was an entirely different side of him; a calm, collected one that seemed totally at odds with his usual abrasiveness. Zane could no longer tell which side of him was the real one.</p><p>\u201cThis has a reverence to it,\u201d Ty finally murmured curiously after almost ten minutes of silence and pondering. \u201cAlmost ... romantic. There were no tire or machine marks anywhere, meaning he carried her here from the entrance.\u201d He looked back the way they had come. It was a long way to walk with a heavy burden in your arms. He looked back at Zane and frowned.</p><p>\u201cIt feels old. Antiquated,\u201d he went on in a voice that sounded slightly confused. \u201cLike something the killer saw in a movie or read in a book and wanted to reenact.\u201d</p><p>Zane had heard him, but it didn\u2019t really sink in at first. As he\u2019d looked around the setting, turning his back to the monuments to look back out at the yard, a grave covered with stacks of fresh flowers had snared his attention. It was impossible not to draw parallels to his last time in a graveyard. Several heartbeats after Ty\u2019s words, Zane shook himself. \u201cYeah, yeah it does,\u201d he agreed quietly.</p><p>\u201cNone of the others seemed to be like that. Left in their own beds, dumped in random places,\u201d Ty murmured, talking more to himself than to Zane. \u201cWhy was this one special? Was it even special at all or is that just another different element we have to add to this particular murder?\u201d</p><p>Blinking a few times, Zane pulled his attention back to his partner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d say it was special. We don\u2019t even know if she was killed here or if she was moved here.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced around the graveyard, trying to let the setting speak to him. \u201cNo,\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t killed here,\u201d he declared, though he didn\u2019t know what made him think that. \u201cBut she was left here for a reason, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would track then that all of them were left where they were...as they were ... for a reason,\u201d Zane added, shifting his weight and taking several steps along the path before turning to look around them again.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Ty argued stubbornly. \u201cYou yourself said that the pattern is in the method. What if part of the method is the placement of the body in one case, but not in another? What if it mattered more where this body was left than how she was killed, but it mattered more that another was killed in a certain way and not where they were left?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cYou know, I actually understood that,\u201d he said, shaking his head. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to figure it out both ways until we get a lead,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Ty sneered at him and looked away, pursing his lips thoughtfully as he stared through the rain. It was coming down harder, sliding down the collar of his jacket and making him shiver. He had definitely lived through worse, but it was still uncomfortable.</p><p>The start of the rain gave Zane a chill, and his attention was drawn back to the graves. He watched the raindrops plop onto a bare patch of dirt, darkening it drip by drip. Rivulets dappled the colored flowers that were placed along some of the gravestones, and Zane\u2019s gaze went soft and unfocused. Rain on flowers. Wet dirt. The ache swelled and he couldn\u2019t ignore the memories any longer.</p><p>Ty turned back to say more and caught the look on Zane\u2019s face. He snapped his mouth shut and frowned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked again with a hint of annoyance.</p><p>The other man didn\u2019t acknowledge him. He was standing in the same place. He hadn\u2019t turned his head; it didn\u2019t even look like he\u2019d taken a breath.</p><p>His eyes were lowered and looking out at something indefinable.</p><p>\u201cGarrett!\u201d Ty barked loudly.</p><p>A few more silent moments passed before Zane looked up at Ty deliberately. His face was now set in the emotionless mask he\u2019d not worn for a couple days, and his eyes were dry. But the light in them was gone, and his gaze was empty.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d Ty questioned in annoyance. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>he repeated.</p><p>\u201cHave you found what you were looking for?\u201d Zane asked. His voice was brittle, but he didn\u2019t look away from Ty.</p><p>Ty\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion and he cocked his head. He looked around the cemetery, knowing he could spend the entire dreary day there and still not find what he was looking for. But it was no use if Zane was going to go all wonky on him. \u201cSure,\u201d he finally answered. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned smartly on his heel and started walking.</p><p>Ty remained where he was for a moment and watched him in confusion. Finally, he bent and picked up one of the perfect yellow leaves and slid it into his pocket, then followed after his partner slowly.</p><p>The long, even strides didn\u2019t stop until Zane was through the gate and back out at the street, flagging down a cab. The first one kept going, and so he kept a sharp eye out. He still felt ill. It had come out of nowhere, the specter of memories five years old that he\u2019d thought were just as buried as his wife.</p><p>Ty jogged to catch up to him as a second cab stopped at Zane\u2019s summons. They climbed in and shook off the water, and Ty gave the driver the name of their hotel. He had hoped to see more of the scenes, but he would rather do it alone than like this.</p><p>Five minutes into the ride, Zane finally closed his eyes and relaxed a little. He propped his elbow against the window and rubbed his eyes. God, he hated memories sometimes. They brought back nightmares he didn\u2019t want.</p><p>Frankly, he didn\u2019t want the good or the bad, because the good were even worse. He knew Ty wanted to know what was going on, but Zane wasn\u2019t sure he could even spit out the words.</p><p>\u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, man,\u201d Ty prodded irritably.</p><p>Zane slanted an equally annoyed glance Ty\u2019s way. \u201cBad memories, okay?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Ty glared at him from his side of the cab for a moment and then looked away with a long sigh. Obviously there was more to it than that, and Ty found himself annoyed that he even gave a damn. He wouldn\u2019t ask again, though.</p><p>After another long silence, Zane gave a quiet sigh. \u201cBecky died this time of year,\u201d Zane said quietly. \u201cWeather\u2019s about the same. Fancy graveyard.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWho is Becky?\u201d Ty asked in exasperation.</p><p>Zane kept his eyes focused out the window. \u201cMy wife.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him for a long moment, eyes drifting down to the wedding ring Zane still wore but they\u2019d never talked about, then he looked away without commenting. He pressed his lips together tightly as they rode in silence. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he finally offered.</p><p>Nodding slowly, Zane finally said, \u201cThanks.\u201d It was almost inaudible.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t respond. His immediate reaction was to point out that if Zane had a fucking problem with graveyards he should have said something instead of wasting their time by zoning out in there. He would have been better off leaving Zane at the gate and taking his time. A day ago he would have said it out loud, but now he held his tongue. It was an action he wasn\u2019t accustomed to or comfortable with. Forcing himself not to say anything too harsh to the man fueled the resentment Ty felt building.</p><p>A few minutes passed. \u201cNeed to go back?\u201d Zane asked neutrally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty watched the architecture pass by and sighed inaudibly. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he finally answered curtly.</p><p>Zane turned off the portion of himself that felt bad that he\u2019d apparently messed with Ty\u2019s work. It just didn\u2019t compare to the thoughts and dreams and dying lights that swirled through his mind. He\u2019d need some time to clear those cobwebs away. Then he could get back to work.</p><p>The rest of the taxi ride passed in tense silence.</p> <p>y was undeniably pissed off, and he spent the rest of the day distracted by it. The more distracted he became with his and Zane\u2019s little T personal interactions, the angrier he found himself. They had a murderer to find and Ty had the death of a brother to avenge\u2019 he didn\u2019t need to be absorbed in this little fling they had started up. And he couldn\u2019t even shout at Zane to release the frustration anymore. It didn\u2019t seem right after what had happened between them. He wasn\u2019t used to being angry without an outlet, and it was wearing him down.</p><p>They had finally returned to Federal Plaza and given their accounts of what had happened with the exploding computer. They were questioned about the bruises both men displayed, and about why they had left the scene when they knew they would have to be questioned. Ty had been forced to put in a call to Dick Burns in order to get the disgruntled investigators off their backs, and they had been sent on their way.</p><p>The rest of the day had been spent at the hotel, combing over files and notes as they searched for a thread.</p><p>It was beginning to rain once more, the drops hitting the hotel window lazily when Ty finally put his work down and rested his elbows on the table. He rubbed his hands over his face and groaned plaintively. \u201cDid we eat lunch?\u201d he asked sulkily.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Zane answered distractedly. He\u2019d finally managed to sink himself in autopsy reports a couple hours ago, and that subject matter was more than enough to quash any physical urges; hunger, sex, or otherwise.</p> <p>\u201cCan we eat lunch now?\u201d Ty asked sarcastically.</p><p>Zane threw down his pen with a soft sigh. \u201cSure,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Ty leaned back in his chair, watching Zane studiously like he would a lion in the zoo. He was irritated with him, for more reasons than the fact that he had been made to leave his site early. Mostly, Ty was irritated because now when Zane did something, he found himself wondering why.</p><p>Pushing the file folders away before scooting back from the table, Zane stretched once he was standing, arms above his head, eyes closed as he rolled his neck. He\u2019d been tense all morning, and sitting hunched over case files all afternoon hadn\u2019t helped either.</p><p>\u201cWant to call it a day?\u201d Ty asked neutrally.</p><p>Zane arched his back and several vertebrae popped. He relaxed in relief before opening his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine after a break. All this shit is swimming around right now,\u201d he muttered with a wave of his hand at his head.</p> <p>Ty merely nodded, watching Zane impatiently.</p><p>Zane returned the look impassively. \u201cSo. Room service? Going out?\u201d</p><p>The thought of a cigarette was reassuring, since it didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d be having another fuck anytime soon. The fact that Ty was pissed was pretty easy to decipher.</p><p>Ty pressed his lips tightly together and cocked his head to the side thoughtfully. \u201cGoing out could be risky,\u201d he observed in a flat tone. \u201cI haven\u2019t spotted a tail yet, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded absently and walked over to the dresser where he\u2019d tossed the hotel book with the menu in it. He\u2019d thought Ty would want to get out and roam, as restless as the man obviously was. But he\u2019d learned yesterday that there was no telling what Ty would do. Trying to anticipate him was an effort in futility, one that often produced a headache. He paged through the book where it lay on the top of the piece of furniture. Ty\u2019s eyes stayed on him as he moved. He seemed to be waiting for something. The silence stretched thin as Zane did his best to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cShould I go back to my room tonight?\u201d Ty asked out of the blue. \u201cOr will we be able to work together and fuck each other senseless at the same time?\u201d</p><p>Zane jerked his chin around to stare at Ty with wide eyes for a long moment. He opened his mouth to say something and closed it right back before trying again. \u201cI can work with the fucking,\u201d he said. Jesus Christ, he sounded like an idiot!</p><p>Ty snorted. \u201cGood,\u201d he said flatly, the smile dropping again. \u201cAs long as we keep it at that, we\u2019re fine.\u201d</p> <p>Narrowing his eyes, Zane turned toward Ty, bringing the menu with him. \u201cKeep it at that?\u201d he asked curiously. Yeah, they seemed to have a hell of a lot of chemistry, and there had been a few scarily tender moments, but 168</p><p>Zane knew better than to read anything into it.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ty answered, either oblivious to the implied question or not caring to elaborate.</p><p>Rather than pushing for an answer, Zane held out the menu, but he kept his eyes on Ty, watching him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take what I had last night,\u201d Ty answered as he looked down at the menu and back up at Zane with a small smirk.</p><p>The other man raised an eyebrow, giving Ty a look of wry amusement as he yanked the menu back. \u201cI figured you\u2019d want what you had for breakfast,\u201d he tossed out as he walked over to the phone.</p><p>Ty chuckled darkly, the sound almost disturbing as he sat in the shadowed corner of the hotel room and rocked back in his chair. He watched Zane, tracking him like a predator tracks its prey as the bigger man moved.</p><p>Zane dialed room service and ordered a couple dinners and a dessert\u2014very aware of Ty\u2019s eyes following him. Murmuring a curt goodbye, he hung up the phone and sat back down at the table, pushing folders around and taking the opportunity to look at more autopsy photos before the food arrived. He studiously avoided looking at Ty. It was better for his mental health that way.</p><p>Ty cocked his head, idly wondering why Zane was so diligently ignoring him now. Finally he shrugged it off and pulled out a thick file from the package a courier had delivered from Washington earlier that day.</p><p>Ty had called on a buddy in the main office to search up any unexplained murders in the past ten years, and then had him fax a list. He had picked and chosen from the list of murders, requesting files that could possibly fit their case to try and track the man responsible.</p><p>He also had a stack of files on every agent that had worked in the New York office in the past ten years, including one on himself. He would go through them all after he finished with the old files, and he would make a list of the locations every agent had worked before being assigned to New York.</p><p>All he had to do was find a murder that fit their serial, which was more easily said than done, considering the guy had no MO to speak of, and then match up locations.</p><p>\u201cThis shit is easier with a computer nerd doing the work,\u201d he grumbled around the pencil in his teeth.</p><p>Zane glanced up at him and snorted softly, then went back to his notes.</p><p>Ty looked up at him, frowning unconsciously, then back to the file he had in his hand. It was an unsolved murder in Baltimore from roughly five years ago. As he read he began to frown harder and harder. \u201cI know this,\u201d he murmured as he flipped through the pages. \u201cJesus, I remember this,\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cJanuary nineteenth,\u201d he continued, not caring if Zane was paying attention to him or not.</p><p>The victim had been found on the campus of the University of Maryland\u2019s School of Law. He had died\u2014after being dragged through the streets behind what appeared to have been a small, slow-moving vehicle of some sort\u2014of alcohol poisoning. The really interesting thing that Ty had remembered from this case was the identity of the victim. He had been rumored to be Baltimore\u2019s infamous Poe Toaster, the man who had, since 1949, visited the grave of the author Edgar Allan Poe and toasted him with cognac. The visits, which had actually been observed by many in the city, had stopped after that year.</p><p>\u201cFind anything interesting?\u201d Zane asked as he watched.</p><p>Ty answered with a grunt. A piece of paper had joined the pencil in his mouth, the file spread on his knees, and each hand was holding several sheets of paper as he read over what he remembered. He waved at Zane and pointed down.</p><p>Zane smiled almost fondly before forcing it back, and he pulled the paper and pencil from between Ty\u2019s lips when he stopped at his side. He looked down at the file. \u201cMaryland School of Law, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember this,\u201d Ty said to him. \u201cIt has all the earmarks.</p><p>Unfortunately it\u2019s just as random as all the new ones. But there was a token left,\u201d he said almost excitedly as he pointed at the notes in the original file. \u201cA quill. We know he was in Baltimore,\u201d he declared in a voice that was almost surprised.</p><p>\u201cIf he was in Baltimore at the university, he could very well have applied to the Bureau straight out of school,\u201d Zane murmured. \u201cOr he went into forensics or law enforcement and got familiar with the Bureau just because of proximity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should cross-check all agents who were in Baltimore in \u201901,\u201d Ty suggested.</p><p>Zane nodded in agreement. \u201cSounds like it might be a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Ty grunted as he handed the file over. \u201cTake a gander.\u201d</p><p>Zane took the file and moved back to his seat as he began to read over it.</p><p>\u201cI remember that one happening,\u201d Ty told him as he stood up and began to pace. \u201cIt was labeled a hate crime kind of thing,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou see, the victim was this guy called the Poe Toaster. He was actually the grandson of the original Toaster, the man who would sneak into a graveyard every year on Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s birthday and toast him with cognac.</p><p>Sometimes he left notes. Well, in ninety-nine this new guy started it after his father died, and he left more elaborate notes. One year he said that French cognac wasn\u2019t good enough for Poe; that was right after 9/11, I think, and the French had refused to join the terrorist hunt. Then in two thousand four he left a note saying the Ravens were going to lose the Super Bowl. It pissed a lot of people off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, anything but NFL rivalries,\u201d Zane muttered. \u201cSo, alcohol poisoning\u2014that takes a hell of a lot if it\u2019s a one-time thing, especially if he wasn\u2019t an alcoholic. It\u2019d be more like drowning.\u201d He flipped through the pages, looking for the autopsy report.</p><p>\u201cHe was also dragged through the streets,\u201d Ty pointed out. \u201cLeft in the snow. But if it didn\u2019t matter who the victim was, like they initially thought, then the death itself is even more important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdd combination of methods,\u201d Zane murmured, reading the report.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t an alcoholic. His liver was fine.\u201d</p><p>Ty watched Zane without responding. There were things about this case that were flitting at his mind, like bats around the mouth of a cave. They were driving him crazy, and he couldn\u2019t catch a single one. \u201cThoughts?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cEither someone got him to drink a huge amount or he was injected,\u201d</p><p>Zane said with certainty. He read over the report again. \u201cBut no tracks found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he knew his attacker?\u201d Ty questioned softly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cNo signs of struggle, except the marks from the ropes used to drag him. No scrapings under fingernails. He was already unconscious when he was dragged.\u201d Shaking his head, he let his eyes go out of focus. \u201cI bet he did. I bet he knew him. Even trusted him. A friend or colleague. Someone to celebrate with, to drink more than usual with. Slip him a drug to make him pliable and apt to drink even more.\u201d</p><p>Ty was nodding in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s the epicenter,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll call Burns, tell him to have someone get on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him about the flagging we want done. Require Baltimore\u2014</p><p>hometown, school, even family,\u201d Zane said distractedly, still looking through the file.</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Ty responded as he unclipped his phone from his belt.</p><p>As Ty talked, Zane got deeper into the file and, squinting, got up to shift stacks of papers for other case files on the desk. Ty relayed what they had uncovered to Burns as soon as he was assured the line was secure. The man seemed dubious about the Baltimore connection at first, but it didn\u2019t take long for Ty to convince him, Zane noted. As much of a fuckup as Ty seemed to have been in the Bureau, Burns had always trusted him and treated him almost like a son. Zane couldn\u2019t help but wonder why.</p><p>Soon, Ty was off the phone and pacing again. Finally he stopped and glared at Zane. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm hmm,\u201d Zane answered faintly, three case files laid out in front of him. Ty frowned and watched him.</p><p>\u201cYou find something?\u201d he asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said, drawing it out since he was still reading. \u201cI didn\u2019t.</p><p>No struggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cNo struggle. No signs of struggle. Sometimes the victims were tied or wrapped up, but there were no bruises, no claw marks, no abrasions. No sign that they fought before they were murdered,\u201d Zane said, frown deepening as he grabbed for another file. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Ty asked softly. \u201cHe can\u2019t have known all his victims. You think he\u2019s using a badge to keep them cooperating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he have known them?\u201d Zane asked calmly as he looked up.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Cause it\u2019d be sorta obvious to his other acquaintances that they were slowly dwindling in gruesome ways,\u201d Ty snapped. \u201cUnless they\u2019re professional contacts,\u201d he corrected slowly.</p><p>\u201cOr a mix. Professional. Personal. Family. Past friends from school or college,\u201d Zane proposed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know how unlikely that is?\u201d Ty asked dubiously, unconsciously taking on the same tone Burns had with him. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t care how well I know someone, they start trying to chop me up I\u2019m going to fight back,\u201d he declared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not probable. But it\u2019s possible. New York is a hell of a big city.</p><p>You could have friends in all kinds of places and they\u2019d never know each other,\u201d Zane said, closing the files and stacking them together.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck you and your logic, Garrett,\u201d Ty sulked as he began to pace again.</p> <p>\u201cGive me geometry any day,\u201d Zane muttered. \u201cI hate algebra.\u201d</p><p>Ty stopped. \u201cWe should check the victims for priors,\u201d he stated. \u201cIf the killer\u2019s a Fed, he might be finding his victims through his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need their workups. Priors, work, church, family, school ... any one of those could be a connection. Hell, moonlighting. Boyfriend. Knitting circle,\u201d the other agent mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWe should also check witness files,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cThey may not have been perps if he was investigating. Could have been witnesses. But no one\u2019s going to convince me that a badge could keep someone from fighting for their life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloroform,\u201d Zane said suddenly, pointing to the paper in front of him. \u201cThe ME notes traces of chloroform in some of the autopsies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do it,\u201d Ty conceded with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane agreed, nodding. He jerked a little when there was a knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d Ty muttered as he stood and began to shuffle barefoot to the door. The hairs on the back of his neck suddenly stood on end, and the feeling that something was amiss assaulted him like it sometimes had back when he was in the service. He slowed as he neared the door, evaluating the gut reaction to the knock and licking his lips as he hesitated. Finally, he stepped up to the peephole and peered through, his hand on the gun at the small of his back.</p><p>Zane stiffened as he saw Ty reach for his gun, and he picked up his own from the dresser right next to him. He watched carefully, staying just out of a direct line of sight from the door.</p><p>But Ty relaxed as he saw the hotel server outside with the food, and he wondered why he was so edgy. He opened the door and greeted the server without further alarm, and after the food had been placed and the server left, Ty looked at Zane and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a little tense,\u201d he admitted abashedly. It wasn\u2019t the first time he had said the words to Zane.</p><p>\u201cMore than a little.\u201d Zane looked at him evenly. \u201cDon\u2019t ignore those instincts. Yours are sure to be better than mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty huffed immediately. He narrowed his eyes as he lifted the lid off his plate and he cut a glance at Zane and smiled. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m sleeping in here with you?\u201d he asked wryly. \u201c\u2019Cause I get skeered easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought it was for my scintillating conversation,\u201d Zane said drolly.</p><p>\u201cFor your scintillating something, anyway,\u201d Ty responded distractedly as he sat down and pulled his plate to him.</p><p>Zane chuckled and took up his plate, but not until he snitched a fry off Ty\u2019s. He had mozzarella sticks instead of fries. He\u2019d decided spur of the moment to pass on the onion rings. Just in case.</p><p>\u201cThief,\u201d Ty murmured sulkily.</p><p>Zane winked and held out a mozzarella stick to placate him.</p><p>Ty glared at it stubbornly and then snatched it out of Zane\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anyone tailing us?\u201d he asked before biting off the tip of the mozzarella stick and yipping as the hot cheese hit his tongue.</p> <p>\u201cSure; I just didn\u2019t say anything because I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Zane answered flippantly.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you didn\u2019t tell me these damn things were nuclear,\u201d Ty grunted as he pulled the cheese out of the breaded exterior and tried to no avail to shake it off his finger.</p><p>\u201cI figured the fact they were still steaming might be a clue,\u201d Zane drawled.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty muttered as he shifted in his seat, unconsciously betraying a bit of lingering soreness.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow furrowed as he watched Ty move uncomfortably, and he blinked when he realized why. He was really hard-pressed not to grin, but his lips still twitched.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Ty muttered at him as he tried to eat the cooling cheese off his finger.</p><p>Zane very carefully schooled his face, though his eyes were still bright and dancing. He got the better of Ty so rarely, he couldn\u2019t let it go just yet. \u201cJust let me know if you can\u2019t handle hot and spicy,\u201d he teased, taking another bite of the hot cheese stick. He was probably pushing his luck, but what the hell.</p><p>\u201cAnother bad pun, and I\u2019m going to hit you,\u201d Ty warned.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cHow do you know I wouldn\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>Ty glared at him, pondering that question with narrowed eyes, reviewing Zane\u2019s persistence in that fight. The cell phone at his hip began to ring demandingly, probably saving Zane from another left hook to the chin.</p><p>Ty snapped it off his belt and looked down at the readout. He cursed as he flipped the phone open. \u201cIt\u2019s about fucking time,\u201d he groused into the phone as he set his plate down. \u201cAre you Steve Number One or Steve Number Two?\u201d he asked the detective on the line sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the man on the other end of the call protested. \u201cWe were just told about you guys, shithead. Don\u2019t start with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been cooling our fucking heels for days!\u201d Ty shouted as Zane pushed his plate away and got up to head for the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fucking fault you government boys need someone to hold your dicks for you,\u201d Detective Steve Pierce chastised. \u201cHow soon can you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us thirty,\u201d Ty groaned as he pushed his own plate away and glanced toward the bathroom, hearing the water run. \u201cNo. Give us an hour,\u201d</p><p>he corrected as he tried to calculate the afternoon traffic. He got up and began pacing as Zane walked back into the room and began pulling his shoes on.</p><p>Ty exchanged a few more words with Detective Pierce and then ended the call, flopping back onto his bed with a long, heartfelt groan.</p><p>\u201cSo. Did they even know we were here?\u201d Zane asked knowingly.</p><p>\u201cSaid they found out this morning,\u201d Ty answered dubiously. \u201cI\u2019m really beginning to feel a little like a salmon here....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwimming upstream? Yeah, I get that feeling, too,\u201d Zane agreed as he pulled a plain gray dress shirt over his head and tucked it in. He stilled and looked Ty over. \u201cYou look exhausted,\u201d he said frankly. He hadn\u2019t noticed before, but Ty had the look of a man who had been burning both ends of the candle. \u201cHave you been sleeping at all?\u201d he asked worriedly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take my insomnia personally,\u201d Ty responded wryly. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced up. \u201cInsomnia.\u201d He frowned and went back to his boots.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty prodded as he saw the reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat what?\u201d Zane asked, not looking up from his lacing.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the look for?\u201d Ty asked defensively.</p><p>Zane pushed away the threatening nerves and clamped down on his emotional reaction, one that came to the surface far too quickly for his liking.</p><p>\u201cThere was no look,\u201d he said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Ty huffed as he sat back up and leaned back on his hands.</p><p>Zane finished tying off the shoe and started in on the second, deliberately not looking up at all. He wasn\u2019t getting back into all the screeching violins stuff. He\u2019d finally fucked Ty into a somewhat human condition. No way did he want to ruin that. Zane already felt totally off-kilter\u2014something he\u2019d very much like to blame the other man for\u2014and his handle on himself felt shaky. He hated feeling shaky. It reminded him too much of withdrawal.</p><p>Ty picked up a pillow and chucked it at him, hitting him on the top of the head as he bent over. Zane closed his eyes and growled dangerously deep in his throat. Okay, so maybe in human condition was a slight overstatement.</p><p>He kept on lacing. Next thing, he predicted, Ty would accuse him of clamming up again.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Ty sighed with a roll of his eyes as he pushed himself off the bed. \u201cYou wanna have an ulcer at forty, be my guest,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Zane muttered. He\u2019d missed out on the ulcers by some miracle, but he didn\u2019t remember his fortieth birthday. He wasn\u2019t sure he remembered any of that year, actually. He leaned on his knees and closed his eyes, head bowed. Zane wished he didn\u2019t remember the horrific and heart-wrenching dreams that had plagued him after Becky died. And he certainly didn\u2019t want to try to explain how he\u2019d wished and wished and pleaded for insomnia, time and time again.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ, not again, Garrett,\u201d Ty muttered in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cDo we need to get a shrink in here for you?\u201d</p><p>Anger flared, and Zane stood abruptly. \u201cThere\u2019s no goddamn shrink that can help me at this point, asshole. You want to know what I was thinking? I was thinking that there have been nights I would have taken insomnia for a blessing. Now, stick the fucking orchestra and get dressed so we can get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d Ty hissed derogatorily. \u201cYou\u2019re so used to running and hiding from your problems you can\u2019t get your head out of your ass. You\u2019re letting your past run your life, and I\u2019m getting fucking tired of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose you have all the answers, Dr. Grady? Got that headshrinking degree in your back pocket all nice and shiny? You have no idea what I\u2019ve got in my past to deal with,\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t wanna know,\u201d Ty stated with no compassion. \u201cPast is the past for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some of us had a good enough one at some point to want to remember it, despite all the nightmares,\u201d Zane snapped back. \u201cUntil you understand what it means to have your head put in a goddamn blender while you try to hang on to something precious, quit giving me this shit.\u201d</p><p>Ty gaped at the man, wondering if he even had the right to bring up all the nights of hell he and his Recon boys had gone through over the years.</p><p>If Zane knew the things he dreamed, he might not be complaining quite so much. Finally, he decided that this stupid argument wasn\u2019t worthy of bringing it up, and he waved his hand dismissively.</p><p>Zane blinked as Ty just blew him off. \u201cUn-fucking-believable,\u201d he muttered, turning to start shoving his things in his pockets. He was working with an emotionally stunted asshole. Come to think of it, it explained so much. Zane had to swallow as much on the residual anger as on the pity he didn\u2019t dare let the other man see.</p><p>Ty changed quickly into something that wouldn\u2019t get him kicked out of the federal building. He stood in front of the bathroom mirror and shook his head angrily, muttering to himself. Zane was starting to piss him off again.</p><p>Which was good, he supposed. It meant the urge to lick him all over was passing, at least. He took a deep breath and went stalking back out into the main room and grabbed for his leather jacket. Zane stood at the window, arms crossed, staring out at nothing while lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cBack to brooding, I see,\u201d Ty observed wryly as he patted his chest down, making certain his guns weren\u2019t overly obvious before he shrugged into his jacket. \u201cBetter than actively whining, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Zane was silent for a moment longer before grunting and moving to the table to start stacking folders. \u201cYeah, well, I guess you haven\u2019t fucked it out of me yet,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cGonna take more than I could ever do,\u201d Ty shot back as he gathered his badge and wallet.</p><p>Shaking his head, Zane fell quiet again. He couldn\u2019t keep up the argument if he had any intention of conducting himself properly on the job.</p><p>All it would take would be one good complaint back to Burns about his lack of professionalism. And as much as local cops hated Feds? Zane didn\u2019t want to take any chances. He shoved several files into a canvas briefcase and then reached for his gun.</p><p>It was going to be a long fucking day.</p><p>etective Steve Pierce\u2019s gaze slid from his partner back across the table to Zane. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on this case from the beginning. There isn\u2019t Danyone else who can give you more information, and we got none.</p><p>Talk to the coroner, maybe. Or that lady profiler of yours, Scott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to Scott,\u201d Ty told him with a curl of his lip. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be told what\u2019s happened. We want to be told what you think.</p><p>Here\u2019s your big chance to let us know you actually have synapses firing.\u201d</p><p>The detective leaned back in his chair, eyes flickering from Ty to Zane, sitting across the table from him. He crossed his arms stubbornly and regarded them silently.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, and he looked away from Pierce, instead addressing Holleman. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to all the scenes. Surely you have some sort of feeling worked out about all this.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and looked away, his attention wandering to the wanted posters on the walls. He despised these men. Cops he liked, on a whole. Sometimes, he thought he would have been better as a cop than a Fed.</p><p>But these two men in particular were complete dicks.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna hear my feeling?\u201d Holleman responded with hostility.</p><p>\u201cMy feeling is that you people are so concerned with your meetings and paperwork that you\u2019re wasting our time with them. We could be out there right now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve been doing a bang-up job so far, Steve,\u201d Ty drawled without looking away from the nearest poster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane would have laughed if he weren\u2019t already so annoyed. These two assholes had been jerking them around for almost an hour now, making snide remarks about the victims and even more insulting comments about the FBI\u2019s operation. \u201cThe only reason we\u2019re in this meeting is to try to get some help. Like Pierce said, you\u2019ve been here the whole time. No one else knows more about the case. The sooner you fill us in, the sooner all of us can be out there.\u201d</p><p>Pierce smiled smugly. \u201cAll right, then, I\u2019ll give you the rundown.</p><p>Some of these cases are a serial, sure. But not all of them. How\u2019s that for insight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich ones don\u2019t you think fit?\u201d Ty demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe drug addict, for one. The hooker, for sure. And the other two girls, the roommates. We did some digging; turns out they got around quite a bit,\u201d Pierce told them.</p><p>The hand Zane had on his thigh below the table clenched into a whitened fist. \u201cGot around, huh?\u201d he asked, voice deceptively quiet. Earlier comments about victim carelessness had been bad enough. This was enough to make Zane\u2019s blood boil.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Ty asked nonchalantly, not even registering his partner\u2019s annoyance. \u201cThey got around. So did your momma, but nobody dyed her hair purple and suffocated her.\u201d</p><p>Pierce\u2019s face twisted. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he snarled. \u201cThey got around a lot more than any self-respecting college girls ought to,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Ty laughed incredulously. \u201cHave you been to a college campus lately?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe figure they were out hooking casual,\u201d Pierce continued, undeterred, \u201cand just got the wrong guy to take home. Fits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think they were hooking?\u201d Ty asked as he leaned forward and cocked his head.</p><p>\u201cClient list,\u201d Pierce grunted.</p><p>\u201cOtherwise known as an address book?\u201d Ty asked wryly.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Grady,\u201d Pierce snarled.</p> <p>Zane could feel the fury just roiling in his stomach as his teeth ground together. He directed his question to Holleman. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to add something constructive to this conversation, to oh, I don\u2019t know, make it worth more than a waste of oxygen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike you two lovebirds, my partner and I tend to agree on these things,\u201d Holleman answered calmly.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Ty said loudly as he leaned forward in his seat. \u201cYou decided the two co-eds were hooking. That\u2019s wonderful. Did you write them off immediately or did you attempt to track their relatively small circle of \u2018casual clients,\u2019 as you call them, and include it in the cross-reference done on all the 180</p><p>acquaintances of the victims?\u201d he asked pointedly.</p><p>\u201cWaste of time,\u201d Pierce insisted. \u201cThose so-called serial tokens\u2014a real slim thread of shit holding these cases together, by the way\u2014the one found with the girls was obviously a rip-off. Little plastic trinket rings. I mean, come on. Probably the guy got his rocks off, did a copycat, and went jonesing for another whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA copycat?\u201d Ty repeated with a predatory smirk. \u201cYou mean you released that detail to the public? That he leaves meaningless tokens with his kills?\u201d he drawled knowingly.</p><p>Pierce stopped mid-breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cActually, yes, you did,\u201d Zane snapped, unable to keep quiet any longer. \u201cJust like you said you blew off common procedure for connecting murder cases.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck off, Garrett. You got no idea what NYPD procedures require,\u201d</p><p>Pierce snapped.</p><p>\u201cYeah, IQ over forty probably helps,\u201d Ty drawled in amusement.</p><p>Holleman held out a hand and glared at them. \u201cShut up, wiseass. The tokens have not been released to the general public, all right?\u201d he told them.</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019ve done something intelligent,\u201d Zane muttered. He knew he was quickly losing hold of his temper.</p><p>\u201cSomething better than you two assholes, trying to lord it up over here in this ivory tower,\u201d Pierce snarled at Ty. \u201cIf you and your little paper-pusher here even got out on the street to see a scene, I\u2019d probably have a heart attack and die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d Ty responded calmly. In contrast to the other men, Ty seemed to actually be enjoying the meeting, and that was just making the two detectives angrier. \u201cLook, despite the fact that you\u2019re idiots and I\u2019m bored, we\u2019re all working at the same thing here. You arrange for us to see some more scenes, we\u2019ll consider your theory about a copycat,\u201d he bargained. \u201cEven though it\u2019s fucking stupid,\u201d he added after a brief pause.</p><p>Pierce looked between the two men facing him before answering.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Grady? You\u2019re more annoying than I remember. You make Garrett here feel like a walk in the fucking park,\u201d he said, almost pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cThe Bureau had to dig real deep, I guess. You want to see the scenes? You go through the chief\u2019s office and request access like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>Holleman sighed slightly, shaking his head and closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook, even if we could personally grant you access, which we can\u2019t,\u201d he was careful to inform the FBI agents as Pierce grew more and more ornery, \u201call of the scenes have long been released. There\u2019s nothing to see anymore.\u201d</p><p>His stubborn partner sat back, looking like he was chewing on a lemon.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for you to see,\u201d Ty corrected with a pleasant smile.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me you think you\u2019ve got some special skills or something to let you recreate a goddamn murder scene weeks or months old,\u201d</p><p>Pierce scoffed, his skepticism clear.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got skills you couldn\u2019t learn even with a cattle prod up your ass,\u201d Zane said, temper boiling.</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane but remained silent. He was slightly surprised to hear Zane defending him, and not a little flattered, but he didn\u2019t want Zane snapping, not here.</p><p>\u201cOh, how touching,\u201d Pierce said with a goading laugh. \u201cI got no reason to like you, Garrett, much less trust you and your skilled partner. You two Feebs come riding in here like Hell\u2019s Angels expecting to pick up our cases and magically solve them. Well, I\u2019m calling your bluff. No access to scenes, no goodwill, and no sharing of information. You want to chase off and try to find whoever those girls were fucking, you do it without us.\u201d</p><p>His blood pressure rocketing, Zane stood up so fast his chair slammed back and hit the floor. \u201cI need some fresh air,\u201d he muttered as he stalked past the detectives to the door and walked out, letting it shut loudly behind him.</p><p>Holleman watched the man storm out and then turned to Ty with a raised eyebrow. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see the day when you were the calm part of the equation,\u201d he remarked in amusement.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. I\u2019m the calm one, you\u2019re the smart one,\u201d Ty sighed as he stood slowly. \u201cYes, Virginia, there is a Santa.\u201d</p><p>Pierce sat back with a satisfied chuckle. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do to get stuck with that fucking suit?\u201d he asked Ty.</p><p>Ty walked around the table slowly, hands in his pockets as if he were idly wandering the room. He stopped behind Pierce\u2019s chair and bent over him, placing a not-so-friendly hand on his shoulder. The man stiffened nervously, turning his head slightly as if he expected Ty to actually hurt him. \u201cBe seein\u2019</p><p>y\u2019all later,\u201d Ty drawled in a low, friendly voice before he straightened back up and left the room.</p><p>Pierce relaxed and gave a small sigh, shaking his head in annoyance.</p><p>As soon as Ty had closed the door behind him, Holleman turned in his chair and glared at Pierce. \u201cI know it\u2019s fun to poke them, but Christ, man, what the hell?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Pierce snorted and waved his partner off. \u201cThey needed to be knocked off those damn high horses they always ride in on. But hey, at least we don\u2019t have to worry about a serious Fed investigation.\u201d</p><p>Holleman frowned and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Grady doesn\u2019t seem to give a shit, but Garrett seemed pretty ... into it.\u201d</p><p>Pausing, Pierce turned to eye his partner. \u201cDon\u2019t let him fool you.</p><p>I\u2019ve had the rundown from Serena Scott on that one. Garrett used to be slightly useful, but now he\u2019s got a bad record and gets shuffled around. He\u2019s probably blowing somebody in DC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he fucked Serena and ran off so she\u2019s pissed,\u201d Holleman pointed out in amusement. \u201cLook, whatever. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m more than happy to hand this over to them. Let them chase their tails with this whackjob so we get back to our real jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re our cases in our backyard, and I don\u2019t want them out there screwing around,\u201d Pierce insisted.</p><p>Holleman frowned slightly. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>Pierce\u2019s shoulders stiffened, and his face darkened. \u201c\u2019Cause Feebs don\u2019t belong on the street. They make us all look bad, that\u2019s why. And Garrett\u2019s a prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d Holleman laughed fondly. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>Pierce muttered under his breath and followed his partner out.</p><p>ZANE pushed roughly through the reading room door, ramming it back against the wall as he stalked in, immediately pulling out his cigarettes and lighting up. No smoking policy be damned, he thought darkly. After such a piss-poor day, he figured he deserved something for not going totally postal up there.</p><p>After the first cigarette, he stopped long enough to light another and kicked a chair for good measure, sending it clattering across the room.</p><p>Ty took his time following, visibly irritated enough that people got out of the way as he walked through the halls. He opened the door to the reading room\u2014the only place he really knew to look\u2014and was just in time to watch the little tantrum silently.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d Zane growled as he flicked ashes onto the industrial-grade carpet. He didn\u2019t have to be polite to Ty. He didn\u2019t even have to be civil.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Ty asked calmly, sliding his hands into the pockets of his khaki pants and leaning against the doorway.</p><p>Zane turned his back to Ty to stare at the whiteboard. Some of their notes were still written on it from the day the computer exploded. He forcibly calmed himself and buttoned up the anger and frustration. \u201cThey\u2019re assholes.</p><p>That\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them to go play in another sandbox, then,\u201d Ty responded wryly.</p><p>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t even be in the one they\u2019ve got if they\u2019re so blas\u00e9 and uncaring as to suggest two young women deliberately lured the killer to their house for sex,\u201d Zane spit out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how they\u2019re programmed to think,\u201d Ty responded in a patient voice.</p><p>The unusually placid sound of Ty\u2019s voice did the trick. Against Zane\u2019s will\u2014because he really wanted to stay angry\u2014the heat drained out of him, replaced by a hollow chill. \u201cI just kept thinking,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cabout how scared those girls must have been. And here they are sitting and laughing and making light while that bastard is out there, probably picking out his next victim.\u201d He gave his head a tiny shake, taking another long drag on the cigarette.</p><p>\u201cWait \u2019til he kills a few men in blue. Then they\u2019ll be all over it,\u201d Ty responded in the same calm, almost uncaring tone.</p><p>Zane snorted and shook his head, taking another long drag. \u201cDid they say anything after I left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing about you, no,\u201d Ty answered shortly. Looking over his shoulder, Zane raised a brow in question. Ty simply shrugged negligently and half-turned as if he was going to leave. \u201cFood.\u201d</p><p>Grinding his teeth, Zane dropped the cigarette, ground it under his shoe on the carpet, and followed along, chewing on his annoyance and trying 184</p><p>to shove it where the sun didn\u2019t shine so he could be Mr. FBI again. He wasn\u2019t all too sure he would be successful.</p><p>Ty strolled easily down the hall and glanced over his shoulder finally as he felt Zane catch up to him. \u201cThey enjoy getting in your craw, y\u2019know,\u201d</p><p>he advised neutrally.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane muttered. \u201cI used to be better about shrugging it off.</p><p>Off my game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Ty responded wryly.</p><p>Zane suddenly grinned. \u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit on it and spin,\"\u201d Ty shot back as he pushed through a pair of security doors.</p><p>\u201cMore your style lately,\u201d Zane sniped.</p><p>Ty stopped short, then he snorted and smiled slightly. \u201cGot me,\u201d he snickered good-naturedly.</p><p>Zane chuckled, relief washing through him after the stressful day, and pulled out the car keys. \u201cHave to catch up; I\u2019m behind,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>He hit the key fob button as they approached from across the garage.</p><p>A few moments later and a few steps closer, the car exploded in front of them.</p><p>The bomb set off a chain of reactions that Ty observed in a detached sort of \u201cI think my arm is on fire\u201d manner after they both hit the concrete. Car alarms began to scream, sprinklers overhead kicked on as the flames from the wreck of the car licked at the cement ceiling, alarms blared inside the government building behind them, and bits of flaming plastic and bent metal rained down amidst the smoke. Soon, they heard running footsteps\u2014dress shoes smacking on cement\u2014and shouts from voices Ty didn\u2019t recognize as sirens began to wind up in the distance.</p><p>Zane shook his head as he sat up. \u201cFuck. This just got a hell of a lot worse,\u201d he muttered as he turned to his side to look at Ty, flat on his back.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All Ty could do to respond was close his eyes and let his head loll to the side. The thick leather of his jacket had saved his arm from a piece of smoldering shrapnel and it smelled like burning cow. He couldn\u2019t seem to form words or thoughts.</p><p>\u201cShit. Who decided we were taking turns?\u201d Zane plucked the leather at Ty\u2019s arm; it appeared to have survived, though it was scorched. He slid an arm under Ty\u2019s back and helped him sit up. \u201cI\u2019m thinking the same disappearing act as the other day is a good idea,\u201d he urged. \u201cThat was our car.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat staring at the flaming vehicle as blood began to trickle down his neck. He shivered and lowered his head. \u201cHelp me up,\u201d he requested hoarsely.</p> <p>Zane nodded and got to his feet before crouching to help Ty, and he caught sight of the blood. \u201cTy? You hit your head? Something hit you?\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head obediently for Zane to look and closed his eyes, shivering again. The blood already matted his hair and covered the entire back of his neck.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips compressed and he took Ty\u2019s arm. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, pulling Ty up and along toward the side stairwell, away from where anyone would appear as they came to investigate. The fact that Ty didn\u2019t protest being led anywhere should have caused Zane more worry. The injured man practically kept his eyes closed as they moved. It was obvious his head was swimming, and the blood flowing down his neck was working its way under his collar and down his back.</p><p>Getting them inside the stairwell, Zane held Ty up against the wall while looking back through the small window as agents swarmed into the garage, yelling and circling. Frowning, he got Ty\u2019s arm over his shoulder and walked him down the steps to the ground floor. He helped Ty sit on the bottom step and touched his cheek, trying to get his attention. \u201cTy? Stay here.</p><p>I\u2019m going to get us a car, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Ty cleared his throat and blinked up at Zane, narrowing his eyes. \u201cI think I might need a doctor, man,\u201d he rasped slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to an emergency room, without other agents around.</p><p>Stay here, okay?\u201d Zane said intently, holding Ty\u2019s chin.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty muttered, afraid to nod for fear of his head spinning faster.</p><p>Zane moved quickly and with a purpose, making no pretense at hiding. The clerk in the key cage was gone, so Zane grabbed the first keys he saw. Once in the motor pool, he hit the unlock button and saw the flashing headlights of a mid-size SUV. Soon, he brought it to a halt at the stairwell and climbed out to get Ty. When he got back into the stairwell, he found Ty on the stairs where he\u2019d left him, unconscious. Tim Henninger crouched next to him with his hand on his shoulder, supporting him. The younger agent was 186</p><p>still bandaged from the explosion in the records room, his face and arms cut and stitched in places. His head was lowered, trying to look into Ty\u2019s face as he slid his hand into his jacket, apparently reaching for a phone to call for help.</p> <p>Henninger turned and half-rose when the door opened, tensing, and then relaxed slightly when he saw Zane, who stopped in place, eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cHenninger. We\u2019re getting out of here,\u201d he said as he knelt in front of Ty and slid his arm under his partner\u2019s. The movement seemed to rouse Ty slightly, and his hand clutched in the material of Zane\u2019s jacket. \u201cKeep your mouth shut about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Henninger questioned. \u201cLook, he\u2019s hurt. Why don\u2019t we get the EMTs down here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s too risky. I\u2019ll take him to an emergency room. Now, are you going to help or not?\u201d Zane asked in a flat, no-nonsense tone as he helped Ty to his feet, worried when the other man didn\u2019t even look up at him.</p><p>\u201cToo risky?\u201d Henninger asked as he followed them through the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you two? Let them take care of him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said as he got Ty to the passenger side. \u201cYou\u2019re going up there and telling them we walked for coffee and were nowhere near that car, you got it?\u201d</p><p>Henninger opened the door, hand gripping the side of it until his knuckles turned white. \u201cBut why? They\u2019re going to know it\u2019s your car,\u201d he said logically.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, and by then, we\u2019ll be where no one can get at us,\u201d Zane said as he practically lifted Ty into the backseat of the SUV.</p><p>\u201cYou think someone in the Bureau is trying to kill you?\u201d Henninger asked incredulously, brows nearly up into his hairline.</p><p>\u201cIt might not be a bad idea for you to hide out for a while after this, too,\u201d Zane said without answering the question. \u201cYou were too close to that computer.\u201d</p><p>Henninger blanched and repeated himself. \u201cYou really think someone from inside\u2019s trying to kill you? But that means they\u2019d have to know why you were really sent here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you see the problem,\u201d Zane answered, shutting the door carefully. He turned to the other agent. \u201cBut right now, kid, you\u2019re the only person I trust besides him,\u201d he said with a jerk of his head at Ty, who had slumped in the backseat. \u201cLook, call my cell phone once they pick apart that car and let me know what they find, okay? There\u2019s obviously someone on the inside helping, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Henninger\u2019s face went hard as he followed Zane around the SUV.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he murmured in a low voice.</p><p>Zane nodded and climbed into the truck. Before closing the door, he stuck out his hand, which Henninger shook. \u201cTake care of yourself. Get Morrison to watch your back.\u201d</p><p>Henninger nodded. Zane shut the door and drove out of the garage, leaving Henninger behind to cover for them. By the time the SUV hit daylight, Ty was unconscious.</p><p>Carrying his bloody partner into the emergency room didn\u2019t even raise any eyebrows until Zane was able to flash his badge, and then everyone got busy, fast. Ty had a nice crack on the head; a long, thin gash that had bled badly but didn\u2019t even need more than a few stitches, and some minor burns and bad bruising down his arm. Aside from the unpredictable head wound, the worst injury was to his rib cage. Nothing was broken, but he had pulled muscles and suffered deep, painful bruises along the intercostals that would impede his movement for quite some time. Weeks, definitely. Possibly months, the doctor had told Zane.</p><p>Zane sat in a chair, leaning over with his elbows on his knees next to the bed where Ty sprawled, hooked up to an IV and all kinds of monitoring equipment. He needed to get them out of here soon. Since he\u2019d used his badge to get in, word would get back to the office sooner rather than later. The admitting doctor had insisted on keeping Ty overnight, to watch the concussion and make certain it didn\u2019t turn ugly. They had kept Ty awake most of the night, and it had made him very cranky, very sulky, and very difficult to deal with. Even more so than he usually was. Now he dozed as Zane waited impatiently for the doctor. He checked his watch yet again just as the doctor walked in.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a little internal damage, swelling in the skull that might bother him a few days, and a nice, big lump on the outside,\u201d the doctor offered before Zane could even question him. \u201cHe got his bell rung, but he seems to be doing okay, other than the pain. Take him home, put an ice pack on it. Keep an eye on him, keep him up for an hour or two before you give him pain meds, just in case. If he doesn\u2019t need the pills, don\u2019t give them to him. I\u2019m talking writhing in agony pain,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cAnd keep him in a nice quiet place for a few days until that swelling goes down. A head injury like this can turn bad quickly, though, so like I said, keep an eye on him. If 188</p><p>there\u2019s pronounced dizziness, blurring of vision, slurring, shakes, confusion, nausea and so on, call an ambulance. That swelling in his head is the worst problem, and it might cause some memory issues. Any questions?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Zane shook his head silently. \u201cI\u2019ll have an orderly in to help him out, then,\u201d</p><p>the doctor said.</p><p>Zane stood, shaking his head. \u201cNo, just clear the hall, and I\u2019ll get us out of here,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>The doctor scowled and inclined his head stubbornly. \u201cEither he leaves here in a wheelchair attended by an orderly,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cor he doesn\u2019t leave at all.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s nostrils flared angrily. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal,\u201d he grated. \u201cI\u2019ll push him, and your orderly can follow along behind.\u201d</p><p>The doctor narrowed his eyes and nodded, removed Ty\u2019s IV, and skirted around the curtain to start the paperwork.</p><p>Figuring he\u2019d try to make a quick escape, Zane shook Ty\u2019s shoulder lightly, bending over close to the other man\u2019s ear. \u201cTy? You want to wake up so we can get out of here?\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head slightly, his temple nudging Zane\u2019s chin as he groaned in answer. \u201cJust leave me here with the drugs.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled. He knew they hadn\u2019t given Ty anything for the pain because of the concussion, but Ty wouldn\u2019t know any different as out of it as he was. \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple pocketfuls of drugs to keep you happy,\u201d Zane crooned to him. \u201cLet\u2019s get you up, big boy.\u201d He slid his arm under Ty\u2019s shoulders and started to slowly lift him to a sitting position.</p><p>Ty swatted at him, shivering as his head throbbed. \u201cYou sure it\u2019s good to move me?\u201d he asked dubiously as he swung his legs off the bed. He wasn\u2019t typically too bothered with injuries, but getting conked on the head and losing time bothered him. He couldn\u2019t remember a thing from the time he\u2019d walked out of the doors of the Federal building until he woke in the hospital. \u201cQuit touching me,\u201d he muttered with a weak swat at Zane\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there supposed to be a pretty little nurse getting me out of bed? I think you scared the doctors into releasing me,\u201d he accused as an orderly wheeled in a wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cSure I did. \u2018\u2018Because I\u2019m a big, scary guy,\u201d Zane said with a note of pride.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not entirely a good thing,\u201d Ty grumbled as he stood carefully and shuffled over to the wheelchair. He had seen men try to refuse the wheelchair ride out of the hospital before. Most were macho idiots, and many of them wound up doing a face plant into the floor for their troubles. Ty had never seen the point. Even if he had been the type, though, he knew he couldn\u2019t walk a straight line right now anyway.</p><p>Zane chuckled as he walked out alongside the chair, his insistence on doing the pushing having dissolved as soon as Ty spoke again, though he kept a sharp eye on their surroundings, just in case. They walked out the entrance where he\u2019d had the hospital valet pull up the SUV in anticipation of loading Ty into it. \u201cIt\u2019s bed rest and an ice pack for you tonight,\u201d he said as the orderly helped Ty into his seat.</p><p>\u201cIce pack,\u201d Ty sneered. \u201cA fucking ice pack, that\u2019s all I get?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cThis is a serious head wound,\u201d he insisted with a gesture to the back of his head and an insulted look. \u201cIt needs at least a sponge bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou barely even got stitches, you big baby,\u201d Zane said as he reached over to help with the seat belt once the orderly shut the door.</p><p>\u201cFeels like my brains are leaking out my ears,\u201d Ty grumbled as he watched Zane\u2019s hands. \u201cDo I really have to be buckled in?\u201d he asked with some amusement.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Zane said doggedly. He buckled his own belt and drove away from the hospital, eventually bypassing their own hotel and moving into a slightly ritzier block.</p><p>\u201cNew digs?\u201d Ty asked distantly as he watched the scenery pass by.</p><p>He winced and turned his head away from the window.</p><p>\u201cSort of. I figure there\u2019s a couple real nice, upscale rooms already waiting with our names on them that no one would think to look in,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Ty nodded absently. \u201cGood thinking,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cNo new rooms with our names to give anyone a lead.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, almost disappointed that his forethought hadn\u2019t warranted more of a reaction from Ty. \u201cI\u2019ll go get our stuff after dark while you rest,\u201d he said as he pulled into a parking spot in the hotel\u2019s parking garage.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t go alone,\u201d Ty reminded, though his voice still had the slightly detached tone to it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Zane said after he parked and shut off the 190</p><p>engine. \u201cYou need to get horizontal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the best pickup line I\u2019ve ever heard, but it\u2019ll do for now,\u201d Ty responded, his voice lighter again, if not still slightly groggy.</p><p>Zane made sure he followed along as he went to the front desk at the Tribeca Grand and checked in. The slow, distracted way Ty was moving and looking around at his surroundings as he trailed along behind made him look slightly like Rainman, and Zane had to fight hard not to laugh at the image.</p><p>Soon he was leading Ty to the elevator. They zipped up several floors and moved down a richly appointed hallway, where Zane opened the door to an executive suite.</p><p>\u201cNice digs,\u201d Ty muttered as he stopped in the entryway of the minimalist guest room and narrowed his eyes. \u201cBureau went all out on us, huh?\u201d he asked as he looked at the bedroom longingly.</p><p>Zane dropped the key cards on the low wooden table in front of a swank white padded couch. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go lay down, and I\u2019ll get you some ice for that bump. And some codeine, if you want. Doc said you were okay to take painkillers after a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed as he looked around before finally meeting Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019d rather be aware when we go back to get our things.\u201d</p><p>Zane held his gaze for a long moment, and then nodded slowly. \u201cAll right. Go on,\u201d he nodded toward the bedroom and grabbed the ice bucket, heading out the door with key card in hand. He made sure the door shut behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as the door clicked, Ty carefully reached his hand up to the back of his head and gingerly prodded at the goose egg there. He winced as pain lanced through his head, and when he brought his hand back to his side it was trembling slightly from the pain. Slowly, he made his way to the bed, and he crawled into it and burrowed under the layers of soft chocolate-colored sheets as he admitted defeat for the day.</p><p>It was only a few minutes before Zane returned. He shut, locked, and latched the door before pulling off his jacket, knives, and gun. He filled the heavy plastic bag that came with the bucket half full of ice and carefully crunched the ice on the carpet, not making too much noise. He wrapped it in a towel and walked to the bedroom. Ty was obviously under the sheets and high-thread-count blankets. Setting the ice pack aside, Zane started peeling back layers. A soft groan met his efforts, and finally he uncovered Ty, who hadn\u2019t even bothered to take off his jacket.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane sighed under his breath. The other man looked miserable.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, sit up and get some of your clothes off. You\u2019ll be a hell of a lot more comfortable.\u201d He helped Ty sit up and started pulling off the ruined jacket first.</p><p>Ty huffed and whimpered softly as the jacket was removed, his sore arm and ribs protesting. \u201cWant out of the rest?\u201d Zane asked quietly as he sat back down at Ty\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Ty groaned. \u201cJust let me be miserable, okay?\u201d he requested grumpily.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zane said soothingly. \u201cLie back down and turn on your side\u2014bump up, of course,\u201d he said, smiling a little.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty huffed even as he obeyed the directive. Zane didn\u2019t answer the barb, instead lifting the ice pack and settling it carefully over the swollen area of the back of Ty\u2019s skull and holding it there. The hair was still matted with dried blood. Ty hissed in protest and closed his eyes, shivering hard.</p> <p>Zane rubbed his free hand along Ty\u2019s shoulder and side, just behind the bruises; he didn\u2019t want Ty jerking around in pain. \u201cWant anything to eat or drink? I\u2019m supposed to keep you awake at least a couple more hours,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Ty answered pitifully. All he wanted to do was sleep.</p><p>\u201cI know. Been there. How about you hang onto this ice, and I\u2019ll call out for some room service? Got any favorite foods that might keep your attention?\u201d Zane asked as he clasped Ty\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty murmured as he closed his eyes.</p><p>Sighing, Zane got to his feet. He snapped on both lamps and turned on the HD television, pumping up the volume on what looked to be a violent action movie. He tugged on the toes of Ty\u2019s boots as he walked by. \u201cNo sleeping,\u201d he reminded.</p><p>\u201cMmkay,\u201d Ty mumbled as he pushed his head under his pillow and promptly began to drift off.</p> <p>Zane looked down at him and yanked away the pillow and then all the covers. \u201cTy, I mean it. Do not go to sleep,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cNap Nazi,\u201d Ty accused miserably.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, hate me for wanting to make sure you don\u2019t go into a coma,\u201d Zane said as he nudged Ty\u2019s lower back. \u201cNow sit up, and don\u2019t 192</p><p>forget the ice pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Florence Nightingale, blasting the TV on a guy with a headache is just cruel,\u201d Ty pointed out grumpily.</p><p>Zane waved him off and walked into the front room to find the menu before returning to the bedroom. Ty sat cross-legged on the bed, but his head was lowered as he held the ice to the back of it, and his eyes were closed. His brow unconsciously furrowed in pain.</p><p>Zane sighed quietly and dropped the menu on the nightstand. He grabbed the remote and clicked off the TV, then sat on the edge of the bed slightly behind the other agent. \u201cHere, let me,\u201d Zane murmured, lifting his hand to touch Ty\u2019s on the ice pack. \u201cSure you don\u2019t want something to take the edge off?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Ty mumbled, the words barely audible, \u201cif you\u2019re going back there, so am I.\u201d</p> <p>Scooting back a little, Zane pulled Ty back against his chest, still holding the ice pack. \u201cIt\u2019ll wait,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Ty shuddered as he leaned back, but he was too hurt and tired to protest being coddled.</p><p>\u201cCome on, tough guy, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had worse than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head hurts, jackass,\u201d Ty muttered, his eyes staying closed as he rested back against Zane\u2019s chest.</p><p>Zane smiled, knowing Ty couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cDoes it hurt worse than your ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty whined, diving into a sulk like a pro. \u201cJesus, just stop fucking talking.\u201d</p><p>Zane chortled. \u201cYou can\u2019t win, heads or tails.\u201d He curled one arm around Ty\u2019s waist to hold him securely. \u201cBuck up, Marine; you\u2019re made of sterner stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me, Air Force,\u201d Ty groaned as he tried to turn onto his side and curl up.</p><p>Zane grinned and turned so Ty could lean sideways against him. \u201cTell me something, Ty. How much of this badass bastard is really you, how much is the Marine, and how much is a show?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ty was silent, the only sound his soft breathing as he lay unmoving.</p><p>Finally, he breathed in deeply and asked groggily, \u201cAre you taking advantage of a concussion to pump me for information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Zane said immediately.</p><p>After a long moment Ty simply gave an admiring, \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled a bit and lifted away the ice pack to look at the head wound. \u201cLearned it from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a complete loss, then,\u201d Ty murmured.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Zane said as he turned over the ice and reapplied it gently.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I would never have thought it, but there you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Ty asked drowsily as the ice started him shivering again.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said warningly, a little louder. He set down the ice pack, took the other man by the shoulders, and pulled him up into an upright position. He sat beside him as he turned his shoulders and ducked his head to try to catch Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you go to sleep on me. I mean it. I\u2019ll do evil and dastardly things to your body if you do.\u201d</p><p>Ty opened his eyes wide and blinked the sleep away, giving his head one little shake as he cleared his throat. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done that,\u201d he reminded Zane seriously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you remember,\u201d Zane said wryly. \u201cYou did recently take a knock to the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me fucking sleep, huh? They kept me awake all fucking night, you sadist,\u201d Ty groused sleepily as he closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Ty, don\u2019t make me shake you. Jesus. All right. Cold shower time,\u201d Zane said, practically dragging Ty with him off the bed and toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ty cried in alarm as he dug his heels in. \u201cHell, no!\u201d Zane ignored him, pulling him along into the large tiled bathroom. Ty kicked the back of his thigh and tugged at his arm, determined not to get a cold anything.</p><p>Shamelessly exploiting Ty\u2019s slight weakness, Zane wrapped both arms around him, pulling him against his chest. \u201cAre you awake now?\u201d he asked, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty whimpered pitifully. Zane grasped his chin and tilted it up to look at his eyes, looking at the pupils in the brighter light. Ty just blinked at him miserably, allowing the manhandling without so much as a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking a little better,\u201d Zane said. \u201cSo no cold shower. But you do get to sit over here and let me wash the blood off,\u201d he said, plucking at 194</p><p>the stained shirt.</p><p>\u201cPeroxide gets the blood out,\u201d Ty offered, not thinking that peroxide would be slightly difficult to come by right then.</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Zane said indulgently. \u201cBut warm water will be fine for your neck and back.\u201d Zane led him over to the cushioned chair at the stainless-steel counter and got him sitting before going to the sink to soak a washcloth. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever had a concussion before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ty finally cracked a slightly tired, mischievous smile and answered,</p><p>\u201cNot that I can remember.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned over his shoulder as he wrung out the rag. \u201cShirt off, please.\u201d</p><p>Ty groaned, smile faltering as he shrugged out of his bloody shirt with difficulty. He examined it with a distant frown. It was a plain brown shirt with crossed paddles on the front in white. The words read, \u201cSchitt Creek Paddling Co.\u201d The white of the letters was marred with dried, dark blood stains.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked as he walked over and started wiping the crusted blood off Ty\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI like this shirt,\u201d Ty answered softly.</p><p>Zane looked down at Ty\u2019s hands and just kept wiping. \u201cI\u2019d rather have the shirt be bloody than you.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned as he looked at the dried blood and felt Zane\u2019s gentle swipes clean the back of his neck. Finally, he looked down, finding a spot of interest on the floor instead, and he asked, \u201cWere you worried?\u201d</p><p>Zane pressed his lips together, deciding what to say that would offend Ty the least. \u201cNah. You\u2019re tough. I knew you could handle it.\u201d But his voice was soft, no edge or joking to it. Ty\u2019s expression was hidden from him, and the only response Zane could see was Ty\u2019s head lowering so the cloth could slide more easily against his neck.</p><p>Rubbing gently, especially close to the wound, Zane took care of the rest of the blood he could reach. At the last moment, he sighed, leaned over, and pressed his lips to the back of Ty\u2019s neck. \u201cThere you go,\u201d he murmured, unable to explain the unusual gesture.</p><p>Ty lowered his head further and shivered again, finally turning his head to brush his cheek against Zane\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d Zane asked, frowning a little, but rubbing his cheek lightly against Ty\u2019s in return.</p><p>\u201cQuit rubbing cold water over me and I won\u2019t be,\u201d Ty murmured in answer, his head turning just a little bit more until his lips moved against Zane\u2019s skin.</p><p>The wet cloth was still warm in his hand, but Zane pulled it away from Ty\u2019s neck anyway, carefully not moving. He closed his eyes as he held still, letting Ty do as he liked. Ty\u2019s entire body trembled as the cool air hit the wet skin on the back of his neck.</p><p>Feeling Ty shiver again, Zane went down on one knee beside him. He wasn\u2019t sure what to think. Zane knew a concussion could make you really feel off\u2014Lord knows he\u2019d had enough of them himself\u2014but the shivering was new. Maybe Ty was still hurting? He had a lot of injuries to deal with, and being in pain could do odd things to your body. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not helping a lot here. Warm shower?\u201d he suggested</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big change from the hard-ass cold-shower threats,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>Zane smiled fondly. \u201cWorked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Ty groaned and closed his eyes, leaning over until his chin rested on top of Zane\u2019s head. He closed his eyes, fully prepared to sleep just like that.</p><p>Zane sighed. Ty could be so damn difficult to deal with, mainly because even when he was being stubborn it was almost endearing. \u201cUp you go. You need to stay awake at least another half-hour. Lord. How am I going to entertain you for that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShadow puppets?\u201d Ty suggested as he stood carefully.</p><p>Chuckling, Zane got to his feet, giving Ty some room but staying close by. \u201cHow about food? I\u2019ll order us some burgers. We missed breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned as he turned his clunking mind to food. \u201cSounds good,\u201d</p><p>he said in a slightly surprised voice.</p><p>Zane smiled. \u201cGood.\u201d He walked back to the bedroom, got the menu, and called room service.</p><p>Shuffling after him, Ty leaned against the door frame and closed his eyes as the room began to spin just a little. He concentrated on Zane\u2019s voice instead.</p><p>Zane hung up the phone and glanced around to see Ty stopped in the doorway. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p><p>Ty grunted in response and opened his eyes. \u201cI need to sit,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cNeed a hand?\u201d Zane asked neutrally, not wanting Ty to take offense.</p><p>Instead, Ty just nodded and held out his arm unsteadily. Zane strode over and took his elbow, then slid his other arm around his waist. \u201cNice, comfortable armchair over here. You can sit and insult me all you like,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Ty merely nodded, either not hearing or not caring. Zane helped him to the chair, then sat down on the edge of the bed nearby and started unlacing his boots, keeping an eye on Ty the whole time. The other agent wore only a thin undershirt now\u2014and there were bloody streaks along the back of it, as well.</p><p>Leaning back into the deep and surprisingly comfortable armchair, Ty closed his eyes as soon as he saw that Zane intended to remove some clothing.</p><p>He might actually be able to fall asleep while Zane was distracted.</p><p>Ditching the boots, Zane stood up, took two steps, and knelt down right at Ty\u2019s knees, pushing them apart. Ty\u2019s eyes snapped open, and he jerked back as he looked down at Zane with wide eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked in a slightly higher voice than usual.</p><p>Zane looked up at him innocently as he started in on Ty\u2019s cowboy boots. \u201cYou want to be comfortable so you can crash after we eat, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty insisted almost nervously.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Zane dismissed, not touching, not rubbing, not doing a single thing untoward as he worked on pulling off the boots.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and shivered again, leaning back in the chair and slumping as he rested his elbow on the arm of the chair and held his head up.</p><p>Finally, he opened his eyes and watched Zane blatantly, giving in to the fact that he enjoyed it. Zane\u2019s lips turned up as he slid his hands up past Ty\u2019s ankles to pull off each sock, tossing them aside. Then he pushed Ty\u2019s knees a little further apart and leaned forward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTease,\u201d Ty accused softly.</p><p>\u201cDo I have your attention now?\u201d Zane drawled.</p><p>\u201cYou never lost it,\u201d Ty responded before thinking better of it.</p> <p>Zane grinned and set each hand on a knee and slid them slowly up Ty\u2019s thighs. \u201cI almost like you better when you\u2019re concussed,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Ty blinked at him and swallowed hard, unable to respond.</p><p>A heavy knock on the door interrupted them. Zane pushed himself up and captured Ty\u2019s mouth in a gentle kiss before going to get the food. He left Ty sitting there, confused and slightly dazed as his head and side both throbbed.</p><p>Zane got the tray, locked the door behind him, and carried the food into the room. He popped open the Cokes, and while pulling the tops off the food containers, pulled three gel capsules out of his pocket. He split them, put the powder into one of the cans, and threw the capsules into his mouth and swallowed them, chasing them with some Coke from the other can. \u201cTy, come and eat,\u201d he called out as he set Ty\u2019s plate with the full Coke can on the sturdy metal and wood table and started unwrapping the cake.</p><p>Ty blinked at the doorway and licked his lips again. Finally, he stood carefully, waiting until he was sure that he was steady before unbuttoning and unzipping his jeans and pushing them down to his ankles. He gingerly kicked out of them. \u201cJackass,\u201d he called softly as he padded out into the outer room.</p> <p>As soon as the smell hit him, his mouth began to water, but it also made him slightly nauseous. It was an unusual feeling.</p><p>Zane just grinned as he sat down and took a bite of his burger.</p><p>\u201cCompromise,\u201d he said after swallowing. \u201cEat and then you can sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Ty offered as he sat opposite and licked his lips slowly.</p><p>Shrugging, Zane squeezed out some ketchup onto his plate to go with his fries and got to eating. Ty followed suit, eating his fries slowly just in case he got sick. He couldn\u2019t manage to eat anything but the fries; just the smell of the burger made him shudder. His Coke was disgusting, but then Coke always was. Give him Dr Pepper or give him death.</p><p>Zane finished his burger and fries and sat back with the bag of Doritos, taking sips of Coke between bites. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d he asked, looking over at Ty.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Ty answered, annoyed, as if that should have been obvious from all the begging to nap he\u2019d been doing.</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019ve eaten enough if you want to lie down,\u201d Zane said in a long-suffering tone. He dropped his bag of chips on the table and stood up.</p><p>\u201cYour cake will just have to wait until later.\u201d</p><p>Ty put his half-eaten fry down and glared across the table at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked as another shiver ran through him.</p><p>Zane frowned. \u201cYou said you were tired. Eat your cake now, if you want. I figured once I finally let up on you, you\u2019d be in that bed in a shot. The 198</p><p>doctor said an hour or two, and...,\u201d he looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s two-ten now.</p><p>So, bed. Or I could resume where I left off,\u201d he said, eyes flaring with heat as he smirked.</p> <p>Ty glared at him for another moment before pushing out of his seat unsteadily. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Zane hovered close by as Ty walked into the bedroom and sat on the bed, and then he turned off the lights, throwing the room into quiet and shadow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to stay, right?\u201d Ty asked softly, peering at Zane through the dim.</p><p>Zane sat down next to him on the bed. \u201cOf course I am,\u201d he said quietly, smoothing Ty\u2019s short hair back from his face.</p><p>Ty fought the light-headed heaviness that he was unaccustomed to, and he turned his head slowly to narrow his eyes at Zane. He had Zane pegged as the type who would be out the door to do something dangerous the moment he was asleep, just to prove that he could. But just then, there was nothing Ty could do about it and he was fucking tired. He rubbed his eyes and turned away, crawling slowly up the bed and sliding under the covers as he laid his head carefully on the pillow.</p><p>Zane pulled up the sheet, face turning stony. He knew well and good that Ty would have an absolute shit fit when he figured out what Zane had done. But he\u2019d done what he felt was right. With that kind of knock on the head, Ty absolutely had to rest, and Zane felt that he wouldn\u2019t until he absolutely collapsed no matter how much he begged to sleep. Zane couldn\u2019t have that\u2014not after today. They both needed to be at the top of their game, because the stakes had just gotten a lot higher. He could trust Ty to stay in bed for at least a few hours now, and he could go and retrieve their things while the man slept.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you leave,\u201d Ty murmured in warning as he fought back the sleep.</p><p>Zane sighed, reconsidering. He could wait to go back to the Holiday Inn. Or he could go now, an action that would surely incense his partner beyond any hope of them even being civil to each other again. \u201cWhy are you so worried?\u201d he asked spur of the moment. \u201cI can handle myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s on us,\u201d Ty slurred in answer. \u201cHe\u2019s ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded seriously, though his voice was light. \u201cAnd here I thought you hated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Ty murmured as his eyes closed involuntarily. Zane stared down at him for a long time before making his decision. He stood up, gave Ty one last glance, and left the bedroom.</p><p>he low whir of the air conditioner was the only sound in the well-soundproofed room. There were no crying babies or shouting couples T to be heard. The lights had all been turned out, and the drapes were closed against the morning sunlight, allowing only the faintest light to appear around the corners of the heavy fabric. Two bodies sprawled on the king-size bed.</p><p>Ty groaned softly and rolled over, burying his head under his pillow to drown out the filtered light. He jerked and pulled his head back with a gasp of pain as the pillow hit the throbbing knot on the back of his head. Suddenly hyper-alert, he pushed up onto his elbows and looked around the room in a near panic, trying to remember where he was.</p><p>Eyes blinking open as the bed tossed, Zane pushed himself up slightly. \u201cTy, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he said sleepily. \u201cWe\u2019re at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Ty groaned as his head whirled unpleasantly. He pushed up onto his hands and knees and closed his eyes, then began crawling clumsily to the edge of the bed.</p><p>Zane sat up to watch him move. He hoped the other man didn\u2019t fall off the edge of the bed and hit his head again. Zane winced at the thought. But Ty made it off the bed cleanly and staggered into the bathroom, barely making it to the toilet before he was retching violently.</p><p>Zane sighed and rubbed his face. He was screwed. With the concussion, Ty might have been sick like that. But in Zane\u2019s experience it didn\u2019t hit you so suddenly. Unless he was sensitive to drugs. Shit. And Zane had given him a lot. He dragged himself up and pulled on his jeans. This wasn\u2019t going to be pretty; he could feel it in his bones.</p><p>Ty was on his knees on the expensive tile, head hanging as he panted for breath. As soon as he\u2019d moved quickly after waking so suddenly his stomach had turned, and he\u2019d known he was going to lose last night\u2019s miniscule dinner. As he slumped miserably in front of the toilet, he knew that most likely there was more to this than the concussion. Zane had given him something\u2014probably something to get him to sleep so he could go off on his own and do God knew what. His head hanging in the toilet this morning pretty much confirmed that. Ty had never handled any sort of chemicals well.</p><p>Even too much Tylenol had a tendency to make him queasy.</p><p>As soon as he was sure he wouldn\u2019t fall over, he pulled himself to his feet and grabbed the sink counter, holding onto it as he splashed his face with water.</p><p>In the outer room, Zane\u2019s face was grim. They had a lot to do today, including finding out who had tried to kill them. Again. Deciding not to wait, he started getting dressed. He pulled a T-shirt over his head. He wished briefly for a less shitty start to the morning, but he supposed he only had himself to blame. Shrugging into the holster, he dismissed it. He was here to work, not get touchy feely or indulge himself\u2014and he\u2019d already gone over the line with Ty too many times.</p><p>\u201cYou fuckshit!\u201d Ty called hoarsely from the bathroom.</p><p>Zane snorted. It was about what he had expected to hear. Slightly more creative.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you give me?\u201d Ty demanded angrily.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cDiphenhydramine hydrochloride,\u201d he answered, pulling socks and a long-sleeved button-up out of his duffel.</p><p>\u201cFucking Benadryl? What the hell, man?\u201d Ty asked in a hoarse, incredulous voice. \u201cWere you trying to put me in a coma?\u201d he asked angrily.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you give me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust three capsules,\u201d Zane answered flatly.</p><p>For Ty, three capsules was damn near an overdose. Christ, he would be twitching for weeks after this. He closed his eyes and snorted like a bull preparing to charge, trying to calm himself. \u201cDid you get our things?\u201d he asked in a barely controlled voice.</p><p>Zane appeared in the doorway, pulling on his holster over his shirt, and then stood there looking at him for a long moment. \u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly before walking out to the main room.</p><p>\u201cGet your ass back here,\u201d Ty snarled at him as he left.</p><p>Ignoring him, Zane stopped at the low table in front of the couch and started filling his pockets. Wallet, keys, paper with phone numbers, Holiday Inn key card.</p><p>Ty turned and followed unsteadily, furious again. Zane had no fucking right to be pissed off. He watched him, waiting for him to turn around again.</p><p>Zane knew Ty was behind him. He also knew Ty was angry, but so was he. He wished Ty hadn\u2019t got hurt, because Ty\u2019s attitude being so reduced bothered him quite a bit. He wished now he\u2019d gone ahead to the hotel. He might as well have had their things if Ty was going to be utterly pissed at him.</p><p>Zane turned around and looked at him, waiting.</p><p>Ty met his eyes, nostrils flaring as he tried to keep calm. He had actually trusted the fucker. Even something as small as being slipped Benadryl in his Coke was a huge deal to someone who was accustomed to having his life on the line every day. It was taking a massive effort not to overreact, and it was making his head hurt.</p><p>What hurt the most was that he still had to work with Zane\u2014and try to trust him\u2014even after this shit. He took a slow, deep breath. \u201cTell me you won\u2019t do it again,\u201d he requested after a long moment of silence, his voice finally calm again.</p><p>Raising a brow slowly, Zane considered. That wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected. He\u2019d figured Ty would blast him or even take a swing at him. But would Zane dose his partner again? Knowing what he did now about how Ty would react physically, there was only one logical answer. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent, waiting for more, for an apology of some sort.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going downstairs to get us some coffee and breakfast,\u201d Zane added. With that he turned and left the room, door snapping shut behind him.</p><p>Ty was left standing in the middle of the room, confused by Zane\u2019s anger and feeling betrayed by someone he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d completely trusted.</p><p>Zane was back in twenty minutes, a white bag of food in one hand and a carafe of coffee in the other. He pulled out the key card and opened the door, making sure it shut firmly behind him. Ty wasn\u2019t immediately visible in the suite. A brief survey of all the rooms produced nothing. On closer inspection, however, the Ty-shaped lump under the covers in the bed said that his partner had given up the fight and crawled back under his pillow.</p><p>Setting the bag and carafe on the table, Zane felt another flare of anger. Why the hell was Ty doing this? Should he take him back to the hospital? Zane didn\u2019t figure a minor concussion would keep a former Recon Marine down, hence the sleep aid. He was starting to think Ty was seriously hurt, in which case drugging him had been a very bad idea. The anger ebbed briefly, but it was immediately replaced with worry, and then another flare of irrational anger.</p><p>Pressing his lips together, he walked through to the bedroom and stood at the side of the bed with his hands on his hips. \u201cTy, are you getting up or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d came the muffled, groggy reply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that flexible,\u201d Zane muttered. \u201cYou know, I really didn\u2019t think a concussion would keep you down. Why else would I try to get you to sleep and sleep well? It\u2019s been two times this asshole has gotten close enough to hurt us. You can\u2019t be out of commission and vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing I\u2019m not the type to drug myself for sleep, then,\u201d Ty\u2019s disembodied voice responded icily from under the pillows.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t drug myself, now did I?\u201d Zane said just as coldly. \u201cGet your ass up or I\u2019m going without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck are you pissed off?\u201d Ty asked in an angry, slightly slurred voice as he sat up without first removing the pillow. It flopped melodramatically to the floor, and Ty glared at Zane with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me that. Why are you pissed at me?\u201d</p><p>Zane pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cI\u2019m not angry at you,\u201d he said, voice taut with repressed tension. \u201cI\u2019m angry that you got hurt so bad, okay?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth. What a fucking useless thing to have to say. Here came the pansy-ass comments again.</p><p>But Ty was silent, glowering petulantly for a moment before relaxing a little. \u201cWell, stop taking it out on me, all right?\u201d he finally mumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve got a fucking headache.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Zane sat down on the edge of the bed next to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said quietly. He could say more, but it wouldn\u2019t make a bit of difference. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right you are,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Zane asked softly. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ... I don\u2019t really remember much from last night and yesterday,\u201d Ty admitted, his voice low. \u201cAnd some further back from that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I guess you hit your head pretty hard,\u201d Zane said. \u201cSo you don\u2019t remember streaking through the room and dancing on the bed?\u201d he asked solemnly.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty shot back with little feeling.</p><p>Zane sighed, reaching to push Ty\u2019s hair away from his eyes. Ty\u2019s eyes closed automatically, and he leaned into the touch unconsciously. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything I can to help you feel better,\u201d Zane offered softly. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t include drugs, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Ty offered as he rubbed at his eyes.</p><p>The vibrating of Ty\u2019s cell phone on the table beside the bed caused him to jerk and jump, then groan plaintively as he slowly laid his head back down and held it in his hands to keep it from spinning.</p> <p>Zane rubbed Ty\u2019s shoulder soothingly and picked up the phone, snapping it open. \u201cYeah?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cGrady?\u201d the voice on the other end inquired doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cNo. Who is this?\u201d Zane asked. His voice was low and emotionless.</p><p>To him, anyone was a suspect now. Anyone but the man practically in his arms.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is this?\u201d the voice demanded in outrage. \u201cWhere the hell is Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot available. You can talk to me,\u201d Zane answered, his voice flat.</p> <p>There was silence on the other end of the line. Finally, the voice asked in a low tone, \u201cIs he hurt? Did he get hurt?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow furrowed, and he looked down at Ty, considering. \u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d he said noncommittally, but his voice wasn\u2019t as hard.</p><p>Ty turned his head and looked up at Zane with narrowed eyes. \u201cWho is it?\u201d he asked as the silence on the other end of the line stretched on once more. Zane held out the phone, and Ty took it with a frown, sitting back up slowly. \u201cHello?\u201d he said into the phone as soon as he had it to his ear. He listened for a long minute, the shouting on the other end of the line loud enough that Zane could hear it, and finally Ty smiled tiredly and responded with, \u201cAnd I love you, too, jackass... no, it wasn\u2019t our car.... No. No, I\u2019m not lying to you. I would never lie to you,\u201d he went on wryly, which produced more cussing.</p><p>Finally, Ty told the man that he had to go, and he didn\u2019t wait for the last curses before he ended the call with a small smile. \u201cThose ex-Recon boys can mother you to death,\u201d he told Zane by way of explanation. His face clouded over, though, and he frowned slightly. \u201cWord of the car bomb is out, and so is the fact that we were the targets.\u201d</p><p>Nodding slowly, Zane processed that more people than the killer would be looking for them, and that Ty had people who worried about him and kept track of him. It made the other man a little more human. \u201cI don\u2019t trust our own right now,\u201d he said as he tried not to think about Ty. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have much choice but to work with them. We need the contacts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContacts,\u201d Ty muttered in frustration. \u201cCall Henninger. We\u2019ll meet him somewhere... the other hotel room,\u201d he suggested. \u201cKill two birds with one trip,\u201d he grunted as he crawled out of bed slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay?\u201d Zane asked, watching Ty move so carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live,\u201d Ty muttered.</p> <p>Zane pulled his cell out of his back pocket, flipped it open, and made the call. It took a few rings to pick up.</p><p>\u201cHenninger,\u201d came the clipped answer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Garrett,\u201d Zane said shortly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the climate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty tame, considering,\u201d Henninger answered in a completely different voice, one that was slightly more accommodating. \u201cThey\u2019re asking about you, but not too diligently. People are wondering how fucking long it takes you two to get a cup of coffee, but other than that they\u2019re still too distracted with the scene in the parking deck to give a damn about you,\u201d he went on in a low, almost whispered voice. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cIn a secure location,\u201d Zane said vaguely. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need some assistance, and you\u2019re our man. Are you in?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence. Finally, Henninger answered carefully with,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having lunch at the Hard Rock,\u201d Zane said, deliberately picking a busy place way across town despite Ty\u2019s suggestion. \u201cTry to keep the goons off our backs, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d Henninger asked softly, his voice far away, as if he had turned to look behind him as he spoke.</p><p>Zane looked at his watch. 10:30. \u201cNoon,\u201d he said curtly, and he ended the call.</p><p>Ty watched him with one eyebrow raised. \u201cHard Rock?\u201d he asked with a frown.</p><p>Offering the other man a grin, Zane shrugged. \u201cPopular. Busy.</p><p>Noisy.\u201d He tucked the phone back into his pocket and stood to stretch slowly, getting out the kinks.</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d Ty responded flatly as he rubbed the wet rag he\u2019d retrieved over the back of his head and looked around for his clothing. \u201cHe say he\u2019d meet us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d do what he could,\u201d Zane answered. \u201cI think he\u2019ll show.</p><p>Eager, wet behind the ears and all that.\u201d He groaned as his arms reached far above him and he rolled his neck. \u201cChrist. How long have I had this job?</p><p>Calling him a damn puppy. He must be in his late twenties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis file said thirty,\u201d Ty responded without thinking as he finally located his pants.</p><p>Zane looked at Ty in amusement. \u201cYou read his file?\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou read my file, too, didn\u2019t you? At least the unclassified one.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>Ty looked up at Zane and flushed slightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t read yours,\u201d he answered in slight embarrassment.</p><p>Tipping his head to one side, Zane settled his hands on his hips. \u201cThe way you say that makes me think you acquired my file, then. Why not read it?\u201d</p><p>Ty pursed his lips and shook his head. \u201cFiles don\u2019t tell the whole story,\u201d he finally murmured. \u201cI guess I was hoping you\u2019d make me read between the lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d Zane asked, not moving.</p><p>Ty was silent and unmoving for a long moment. Finally, he gave an almost imperceptible nod and said, \u201cI certainly never expected you to drug me.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cYou sort of got a hard-knocks pharmacist on your hands, man,\u201d he said before walking over to the table for his holster.</p><p>After a long moment, he added, \u201cWasn\u2019t any malice behind it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ty responded before he could stop himself. \u201cFucker.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t hold back the snort. He just shook his head and shrugged into the holster. It seemed like they\u2019d be okay. For now, anyway.</p><p>\u201cGet into your pants, Ty. We don\u2019t need to attract that kind of attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my ass is so sore there\u2019s probably a bull\u2019s-eye on it,\u201d Ty grumbled as he stepped into his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhiner,\u201d Zane said with a quiet chuckle as he turned to look at Ty while he shrugged into his shirt. \u201cYou\u2019d think you went skiing and had a terrible time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Ty huffed. \u201cBarely remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already proven what a good liar you are; no need to practice,\u201d Zane retorted.</p><p>\u201cI am not a liar,\u201d Ty responded with an affronted grunt.</p><p>Zane raised an obviously disbelieving eyebrow. \u201c \u2018No, it wasn\u2019t our car, I would never lie to you\u2019,\u201d he repeated back with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cPft,\u201d Ty offered as he shrugged into his shirt. \u201cHe knew I was lying through my teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact that you were lying. Through your teeth.</p><p>Gleefully, even,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty grunted.</p><p>Zane crossed his arms. \u201cAren\u2019t you ready yet? You\u2019re as bad as a woman, taking forever to get ready to go out,\u201d he dug.</p><p>Ty stopped what he was doing and looked up, meeting Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cChalk it up to working off the roofie,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>There was nothing to say to that. Zane had been there, many a time.</p><p>He knew he shouldn\u2019t have pushed. He sighed, nodded, and headed out to the front room.</p><p>Ty just rolled his eyes and sat to pull on his boots. \u201cYou know if I was really pissed I would have just hit you, right? Or tried to, anyway,\u201d he called wryly, even though he was slightly pissed about it, and would remain so. It had been a stupid fucking thing to do.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually what I expected,\u201d Zane called back as he opened the forgotten bag of breakfast and pulled out yogurt and a couple bagels. Ty would have a conniption when he saw it. Zane grinned.</p><p>\u201cWant me to hit you, then? So you won\u2019t be disappointed?\u201d Ty offered hopefully as he stood slowly and made his way into the other room.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t look up from the table. \u201cIf it\u2019ll make you feel better,\u201d he said as he mixed sugar into his coffee. He was hyper-aware of where Ty was, though.</p><p>\u201cMaybe when my head doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Ty shrugged negligently as he peered down at the breakfast. \u201cWhat the shit is this?\u201d</p><p>Zane snickered and added cream to his coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking pansy,\u201d Ty muttered under his breath.</p><p>Zane sniggered a little more. \u201cThey\u2019ve got hot food down in the lobby, but since we\u2019re going to lunch we don\u2019t need to eat this crap.\u201d</p><p>Ty picked through the slim offerings, grumbling wordlessly. \u201cLet\u2019s get the fuck out of here,\u201d he finally muttered as he grabbed his battered leather jacket. He stopped and sighed as he examined it. \u201cNeed to get a new jacket, I guess,\u201d he said almost to himself, his voice wistful and slightly sad.</p><p>Stepping close and rubbing a finger along the sleeve, Zane said softly,</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s got character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had character before,\u201d Ty muttered with a frown as he practically cradled the jacket in his arms. \u201cNow it\u2019s got blood on it. And it smells like burnt cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about the jacket or worried about yourself?\u201d Zane asked, still sliding his fingers along the leather.</p><p>\u201cI smell like burnt cow?\u201d Ty asked innocently in return. Zane shook his head, wryly expectant. \u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked as he held the jacket to his chest defensively.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t believe that of all things, he was utterly charmed by this side of Ty. He took Ty\u2019s chin between his fingers, leaned closer, and kissed him firmly.</p><p>Ty stiffened in surprise, then relaxed slightly and returned the unexpected kiss. It wasn\u2019t soft or sweet, but it wasn\u2019t out-of-control hot, either. He mumbled softly against Zane\u2019s lips, confused by the actions but enjoying them anyway. \u201cThat\u2019s not nice to do to a man with a concussion,\u201d he admonished in a low voice when their mouths parted.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Zane asked, lips quirked, dropping his hands and waiting.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m easily confused,\u201d Ty answered without thought to the many meanings the words could have.</p><p>\u201cI rather doubt that,\u201d Zane murmured. They were standing chest to chest, not touching but for the jacket between them.</p><p>Ty poked him gently in the stomach, trying to put some distance between them again to dispel the uncomfortable warmth.</p><p>\u201cIs that the best you can do? You must be more hurt than I thought,\u201d</p><p>Zane needled.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Ty responded softly, taking a step back and licking his lips nervously.</p><p>Zane slowly nodded. All right, that\u2019s how it was going to be. He picked the keys up off the table. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then,\u201d he said as he pocketed the key cards.</p><p>\u201cAre you ... are you feeling this, too?\u201d Ty asked against his better instincts.</p><p>There was a hitch in Zane\u2019s movement that gave away his reaction to Ty\u2019s words, and his hand stayed jammed into his pocket as he shifted his weight and then his eyes returned to Ty. Zane searched the other man for some clue, some sign, as his mild apprehension was overwhelmed by want.</p><p>Want for something of Ty he couldn\u2019t define. Zane didn\u2019t say yes ... but he didn\u2019t say no.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go one way or the other with this,\u201d Ty went on earnestly with a little wave of his hand.</p><p>The tone of Ty\u2019s voice made Zane smile. \u201cOne way or the other, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re big on rules, right? We need rules,\u201d Ty responded with a sincere frown. \u201cI prefer rules that still allow fucking.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes widened. He cleared his throat and rubbed the back of his neck with one hand. \u201cRules that still allow fucking,\u201d he repeated, voice a bit shaky as he was really trying hard not to grab Ty, throw him on the table, and suck him off until he screamed. \u201cWhat sort of rules? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more surprise kisses,\u201d Ty demanded with a wag of his finger.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zane agreed, a bit mystified.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and pursed his lips as if he had thought there would be an argument. The impulsive kisses, while very enjoyable, were blurring the lines for him. He didn\u2019t like blurry lines unless he was trying to cross them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I can think of,\u201d he finished with a frown and a slight blush.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look too sure about that,\u201d Zane pointed out helpfully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI reserve the right to add rules,\u201d Ty responded with a deeper flush as he crossed his arms protectively over his jacket.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Zane asked, fascinated by Ty\u2019s mind at work despite the shuffling it had suffered. The man was obviously struggling with something he didn\u2019t want to admit. Zane thought, perhaps, Ty wanted him and didn\u2019t want to say so. Perhaps.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Ty asked uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cDo I get to make rules?\u201d Zane asked, moving slightly closer.</p> <p>Something about Ty had changed. He seemed more approachable, more moldable. Definitely more fuckable. Like the hit on the head had knocked some of the abrasive stubbornness out of him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ty allowed warily.</p><p>Another step forward, so they were practically chest to chest again.</p><p>\u201cOnly maybe?\u201d Zane rumbled.</p><p>Ty breathed out heavily through his nose and tilted his head to the side restlessly.</p> <p>Zane tilted his head to match him. \u201cHow about we take turns making rules?\u201d he purred, putting both hands on the leather jacket and pulling it out from between them. This he could do. Sex he could do. Sex with Ty he could definitely do.</p><p>Ty just licked his lips and watched the jacket as if it were a lifeline slipping away. Zane laid it aside on the table, reached up, and turned Ty\u2019s chin toward him. Hell, sometimes just looking at him made Zane hard, and all good sense went flying out the eighth-story window. What being this close was doing to him ...Ty was a goddamn narcotic.</p><p>\u201cWhat about not-surprise kisses?\u201d Zane rasped.</p><p>Ty swallowed heavily and inclined his head slightly, his chin still in Zane\u2019s grasp. \u201cI don\u2019t think those have been banned yet,\u201d he finally answered hoarsely.</p><p>Zane realized that he finally had Ty just as off-kilter as Ty had him.</p><p>And Ty was a very strong man. Strong of will and strong of opinion.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Zane replied. \u201cJust wanted that clarified. Now. You want me to not-surprise kiss you or walk away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d Ty answered gruffly, lowering his head stubbornly before reaching up and grabbing the back of Zane\u2019s neck to pull him that last inch closer and kiss him.</p><p>Joining in the kiss, Zane pulled Ty hard up against his body, wrapping his arms around him. Fuck, why did they always talk so much? This was the way they related best. This was the way they clicked. What were they supposed to do with that?</p><p>Ty finally pushed away and held him at arm\u2019s length. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>he panted breathlessly, his breath hitching painfully as his ribs protested the festivities.</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cAre you feeling this, too?\u201d he rasped. This insane, blown-away pleasure, the near impossible-to-assuage hunger, the ache deep inside, contrasted by short moments of tenderness that seemed so out of place. Zane certainly wasn\u2019t sure where they came from, but oh, God ...</p><p>Ty watched him, still trying to slow his breathing and holding him at arm\u2019s distance. \u201cNo,\u201d he lied blithely.</p><p>Knowing full well what Ty was saying, Zane let out a pent-up breath before slowly shaking his head. \u201cMe, either,\u201d he said, voice more intent than he\u2019d meant it to be. His eyes stayed unswervingly on his partner.</p> <p>Ty was nodding almost fervently even as Zane spoke. \u201cGood,\u201d he breathed quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded slowly. \u201cYeah ... good.\u201d</p><p>ROUGHLY an hour later, Zane and Ty sat in a booth at the Hard Rock Cafe, Ty shifting restlessly in a new jacket he had sworn he would never like as they both pretended not to be watching the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re pissy about the jacket,\u201d Zane said to him, admiring the black leather as he tapped his unlit cigarette on the table. Damn no-smoking-in-restaurants ordinances. \u201cI should have gotten one. Been a few years since I had a leather jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s black,\u201d Ty huffed. \u201cAnd it smells new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had brown,\u201d Zane pointed out, eyes studying the busy crowd.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no help for it smelling new, unless you want to find some dirt and roll around in it, maybe drive over it a few times with the SUV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy other one got run over by a motorcycle once,\u201d Ty responded hopefully, leaning forward on his elbows. \u201cAnd the brown ones was all too small.\"</p><p>Zane smiled, noticing the way Ty\u2019s accent was stronger and his grammar was worse when he was irritated. The more he got to know him, the more obvious it was becoming that a lot of Ty Grady was a fa\u00e7ade\u2014or layers of several masks. Zane wasn\u2019t sure if he would ever see the real man, and it made him slightly sad. He thought maybe he would really like the real man.</p><p>\u201cYou could have waited,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cLord knows there\u2019re enough stores in this town.\u201d He sat back, stretching his legs out to the side of the table almost into the aisle. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go get one yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019ll be fun, being twins,\u201d Ty muttered under his breath.</p><p>Finally, he growled and shrugged out of the squeaky new leather and tossed it across the table at Zane. \u201cFucking take it,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Catching the jacket just before it hit him in the face, Zane grinned and shook it out, looking over it gleefully. Without even blinking away from the jacket, he murmured, \u201cHenninger\u2019s here,\u201d before saying louder, \u201cThanks, Grady, it\u2019s not even my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go fuck yourself,\u201d Ty muttered, loud enough for Henninger to hear as he approached the table.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s ... good to see you\u2019re still the same sweet pair,\u201d Henninger murmured as he nodded at them and glanced around idly before sliding into the booth beside Zane.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, it\u2019s still the honeymoon phase,\u201d Zane answered dryly, picking up his iced tea.</p><p>\u201cMy condolences,\u201d Henninger responded flatly, nodding at Zane.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d he asked as Ty growled wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou tell us,\u201d Zane retorted, still sitting back, relaxed. \u201cI imagine the shit\u2019s still hitting the fan at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s dripping off the walls,\u201d Henninger nodded in answer. \u201cIs there a ... particular reason, by any chance, that you two haven\u2019t come back in yet?\u201d he asked carefully. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked Ty with a small frown.</p><p>Zane glanced at Ty, who was doing a good job of looking bored and disinterested. That or his head was still pounding and he really wasn\u2019t paying attention. It was hard for Zane to tell. \u201cHe\u2019s got a little headache. He\u2019s fine,\u201d</p><p>he answered for the other man. \u201cAnd we\u2019re rather fond of our skins,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe office seems to be a hotbed of opportunity for assassinations right now,\u201d Zane said. \u201cCan you get the information we need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone in the Bureau is trying to kill you,\u201d Henninger murmured almost under his breath, repeating his words from the day before but sounding slightly more convinced. The noise of the busy restaurant covered their conversation perfectly. \u201cHow did he find out why you were here?\u201d he asked, apparently wanting them to know that he agreed with their assumptions. \u201cAnd why risk confirming what, up to now, has just been a suspicion?\u201d</p><p>Zane just raised his brow, and they sat back quietly as a server appeared to take Henninger\u2019s drink order and drop off Ty and Zane\u2019s appetizer. Snapping out of his supposed daze, Ty reached forward and snagged a chicken finger, crunching on it as he watched Henninger thoughtfully. The kid seemed to be having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that the serial really was an FBI man.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t just us he\u2019s trying to off,\u201d Ty said to the younger man.</p><p>\u201cThere was an attempt on you as well, in case you forgot,\u201d he reminded softly. \u201cThis boy knows what we\u2019re doing before we do it. He knows how to get in and get out without getting on tape. He\u2019s a step ahead of us all the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we\u2019re not going back in there, and we\u2019re not reporting in again until we get some hard evidence to take to someone high up,\u201d Zane said. \u201cYou can get us the information we need from inside\u2014and you\u2019ve proven you can keep your mouth shut.\u201d He reached out and took up a loaded potato skin. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of the rest,\u201d he murmured, meeting Ty\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Ty merely sat and stared, and Henninger looked between them with a frown. \u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d he finally muttered. He shifted uncomfortably and looked away. He had several healing cuts on his face and a laceration that had been stitched up on his neck.</p><p>Ty watched him with a small frown. It had taken a lot of guts for the kid to come out here and meet them, knowing they were AWOL. And he appeared to be legit, which Ty found almost surprising. No tail that Ty had seen. Risking his neck to try and help them just days after getting metal and plastic shrapnel to the face, the kid was earning Ty\u2019s grudging respect.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Henninger finally said softly as he looked back at Zane and then at Ty.</p><p>Zane smiled crookedly. \u201cGood. Here\u2019s what we need.\u201d</p><p>STANDING outside the SUV smoking, Zane waited as Ty finished talking with Henninger before they went their opposite ways. The kid had balls, that was for sure. He still seemed so damn na\u00efve, though. Shaking his head, he leaned back against the door, tapping ashes to float to the ground.</p><p>\u201cThat shit\u2019ll kill you, y\u2019know,\u201d Ty murmured as he walked up to stand beside the SUV.</p><p>Zane gave him an amused look as he pulled the cigarette from between his lips. \u201cThis was the least destructive of my vices. Quit as many as I did and see if you don\u2019t need one to keep the others in line.\u201d He thought about that for a minute. \u201cI suppose I could have kept whoring instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll kill you, too,\u201d Ty responded simply.</p><p>Taking another drag, Zane tipped his head. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll think about it when I don\u2019t need the stress relief,\u201d he allowed. He blew the smoke up into the air away from Ty and chuckled darkly. \u201cThey were all good for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not troll the bars?\u201d Ty asked curiously, unable to help himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good-looking guy. Did you just get a kick out of paying for it?\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled. \u201cDid I catch a compliment in there?\u201d he asked, flicking ashes to the side as he looked at his feet. He took another pull off the half-gone cigarette before answering. \u201cBreaking the rules is addictive, too.\u201d</p><p>Ty inclined his head slightly and peered at Zane through the dark lenses of his brown aviators. \u201cHow in the hell did you make it past the psych exams?\u201d he asked finally in exasperation.</p><p>Breathing in deeply and blowing the smoke out and away, Zane looked resigned. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one good at lying through your teeth.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent for a long moment before he leaned closer and lowered his sunglasses enough to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf you turn out to be the killer I\u2019m going to be all kinds of pissed off, got it?\u201d he warned.</p><p>Zane threw back his head and laughed. \u201cI got plans for a lot more fucking before any mercy killing, man,\u201d he said, taking a last drag of the cigarette before dropping it and grinding it under his boot.</p><p>Ty snorted in response and looked up and down the sidewalk slowly before reaching for the door handle and opening the passenger side door.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the fuck out of here,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI got a headache.\u201d</p><p>Keys jingling in hand, Zane climbed into the SUV along with Ty.</p><p>\u201cHenninger said he\u2019d put in the paperwork for the car so they won\u2019t tag us for it,\u201d Ty said as they both got settled. \u201cHe also said I never actually called him about those damn personnel files. I could have sworn I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we got distracted by food, then the NYPD called and off we went,\u201d Zane answered regretfully. \u201cDid he say he\u2019d get on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d need the original files. They\u2019re in the old room,\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>\u201cHoliday Inn?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cI want my other jacket,\u201d he grumbled in answer.</p><p>Zane looked down at his dandy new black jacket and smirked. \u201cOff we go, then.\u201d He went quiet for a long minute as the radio played. \u201cWhiner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty muttered, trying not to watch the traffic passing so it wouldn\u2019t make him sick. He took his sunglasses off and rubbed his eyes. \u201cI should not have eaten,\u201d he murmured after a moment, and he leaned his head against his hand and covered his eyes with his fingers.</p><p>Glancing over at the other man, worry showed on Zane\u2019s face. \u201cWe can go back to the Tribeca for a while,\u201d he offered. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly want to see you puking your guts up.\u201d</p><p>It spoke to just how lousy he was feeling that Ty didn\u2019t argue. He just swallowed heavily and nodded in agreement. Zane turned at the next right and twenty minutes later they pulled up at the doors. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll go park the truck,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty answered with a shake of his head as he looked up at the hotel. \u201cWe need to stick to each other as much as we can.\u201d</p><p>Without saying another word, Zane put the SUV back in motion and drove down into the parking garage. When he stopped the truck, one glance at the other man worried him more. \u201cTy, you don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel so good, neither,\u201d Ty muttered. A violent shiver ran through him, and he looked over at Zane with a frown. He had lost his color, and he was feeling slightly light-headed.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cIs this left over from before? Are you that sensitive to drugs?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the concussion thing,\u201d Ty murmured as he unbuckled his seat belt and opened the door with a slight lurch. \u201cI been fighting it all morning,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAnd no more drugs!\u201d he called as he got out of the car and pushed the door shut.</p><p>Sliding his way out of the seat belt and getting out of the truck, Zane met Ty at the back bumper, reaching forward to catch the other man when he staggered. \u201cChrist,\u201d Zane hissed below his breath. He slid an arm under Ty\u2019s and helped him walk.</p><p>\u201cTold you I should\u2019ve stayed in the fucking hospital,\u201d Ty grumbled as he held to Zane tightly. \u201cJesus. At least I didn\u2019t do this in front of the kid,\u201d he muttered as he tried and failed to walk a straight line. \u201cMaybe I need to go back,\u201d he said doubtfully.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t safe at the hospital,\u201d Zane answered. He tightened his arm around Ty when they stopped at the elevator and he reached out to hit the button. \u201cAnyone can walk into those rooms. You\u2019re better off here. But this time you\u2019re taking some Tylenol to help with the swelling and fever,\u201d he chastised. Zane could feel the heat radiating off his partner.</p><p>\u201cFever,\u201d Ty huffed dubiously, closing his eyes and staving off another wave of nausea. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a concussion before,\u201d he added in a distant voice.</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d Zane said in disbelief as he helped Ty into the elevator.</p><p>\u201cYou were Recon in the Marines and undercover for the FBI, and you\u2019ve never had a concussion? How the hell did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ducked,\u201d Ty answered in a childishly honest voice.</p> <p>\u201cYou ducked,\u201d Zane muttered. \u201cSmartass.\u201d He shifted Ty closer against him as he made sure he had the other man on his feet when the door opened. \u201cThink you can make it under your own power to the main elevator?\u201d</p><p>he asked, looking out into the corridor.</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Ty answered with a nod that made him wince. He swallowed heavily and straightened up, closing his eyes and trying to use sheer willpower to force his head to stop spinning. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he amended.</p><p>Zane looked over him doubtfully, but led the way out of the elevator, hovering right next to Ty as they strolled slowly down the hall to the main bank of elevators. Luckily, being the middle of the afternoon, people were sparse. He hit the up button.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t know what was worse, keeping his eyes open and seeing the room spin or closing them and feeling it. He placed his palm against the wall and leaned heavily against it, going whiter as he tried to plow through it.</p><p>\u201cWhich hotel was this?\u201d he asked Zane as he finally closed his eyes again.</p> <p>Zane\u2019s eyes flashed to Ty, seeing him pale. \u201cThe Tribeca Grand,\u201d he murmured, moving closer to slide his arm around Ty\u2019s lower back.</p><p>\u201cSo I can crash?\u201d Ty ventured hopefully, leaning into Zane again as the elevator doors opened.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you can,\u201d Zane agreed, not letting go of him as they stepped into the elevator. Five minutes later they were in the room, and Zane helped Ty to the bed. \u201cHere we are again,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cCan you sit up long enough for me to get the Tylenol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty answered with a deep blush of embarrassment.</p><p>Zane crouched in front of him and cupped his cheek. \u201cHey. It\u2019s not you, okay? It\u2019s the crack on the head. Nothing to be ashamed of, feeling like shit. Believe me, I\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>Ty merely nodded, barely meeting Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Zane lifted Ty\u2019s chin. \u201cStubborn jarhead,\u201d he muttered, a smidgen of fondness in his voice. Then he stood up and walked to the bathroom.</p><p>Ty lowered his head and licked his lips slowly, sighing in relief as the dizziness began to ebb. He hated not having control over his body. He hated being hurt at all, but head injuries had always been one of his greater fears.</p> <p>He\u2019d seen what they could do to even the strongest of men, days, even months after the initial injury.</p><p>Walking back with two pills and a glass of water, Zane crouched down again. \u201cReal Tylenol, see? Only two,\u201d he joked quietly, offering them palm up. \u201cBottoms up, then bottom down. You need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Ty commented quietly as he took the pills and downed them.</p><p>\u201cJust a few minutes,\u201d he insisted stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone AWOL,\u201d Ty said with difficulty, using the wrong terminology and not even realizing it. \u201cGotta get something done.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned. \u201cWhat is it? Something I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just ... something. Anything,\u201d Ty clarified.</p><p>Shaking his head, Zane settled a hand on Ty\u2019s arm. \u201cWhat you need to do is sleep,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThen we can do something. But we can\u2019t if you can\u2019t even walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint,\u201d Ty allowed as he let himself slowly curl on his side.</p><p>Zane nodded and tugged off Ty\u2019s boots before pushing his legs up onto the bed and pulling up the sheet. \u201cYell if you need me,\u201d he murmured, sliding his hand through Ty\u2019s hair gently. Ty grunted in answer, already drifting off.</p><p>Getting to his feet, Zane rubbed his face with one hand and sighed, looking around aimlessly. If he left the room, Ty would smack the shit out of him when he woke up. Zane was certain of that. So with a sigh he pulled off the leather jacket and walked out to the front of the suite to wait.</p><p>HOURS later, Ty awoke with a gasp, reaching for a knife he hadn\u2019t slept with in almost seven years. Zane glanced up from where he sat at a small table in the corner of the bedroom, writing notes on a hotel notepad. \u201cTy?\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Ty looked over at him, wild-eyed and tense for a brief moment before he seemed to calm himself. His breathing was still labored, though, and he was still taut as a bowstring.</p><p>Cautiously, Zane laid down the pen and kept both hands above the table, moving as little as possible. The man looked really spooked. And a spooked Force Recon Marine with a head injury was not someone to fool around with. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ty watched Zane for a long time before lowering his eyes, as if looking for the answer to the question. He glanced at the window with its heavy drapes drawn, and he looked down at the toes of his socks briefly before licking his lips and nodding. \u201cOkay,\u201d he answered cautiously.</p><p>\u201cNeed some more Tylenol? Something to drink?\u201d Zane asked, watching closely. He thought that the other man did look better. Not pale, not sweating, steadiness back in his eyes. Sort of. But no sign of any recognition on Ty\u2019s part sent a cold slice of worry through him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty answered in the same cautious tone. He reached out slowly and patted his left calf, not finding what he was looking for and frowning as he looked around the bed for whatever was missing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Zane asked, brow furrowing.</p><p>Ty glanced back up at Zane as if he wasn\u2019t sure he was real. \u201cMy knife,\u201d he answered dubiously. He licked his lips and watched Zane for another second before clearing his throat and muttering, \u201cI didn\u2019t have my knife, did I?\u201d</p><p>Zane pressed his lips together. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>Ty looked slightly stricken as he stared at Zane. He watched him warily, then finally nodded in acceptance.</p><p>\u201cYou know who I am?\u201d Zane asked evenly.</p><p>Ty nodded again, rolling his shoulders to try to ease some of the tension invested in them.</p><p>\u201cHow about some water?\u201d Zane asked, scooting his chair back from the table.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty answered cautiously, still scowling at Zane and watching him warily.</p><p>\u201cYou know who you are, right?\u201d Zane ventured, stopping at the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty muttered grumpily. \u201cJackass,\u201d he added to let Zane know he really did remember him.</p><p>Zane grinned and leaned over. \u201cHmmm. I\u2019d kiss you to welcome you back from la-la land, but it\u2019s against the rules.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at him, eyes widening slowly at the highly unusual pronouncement. \u201cRules?\u201d he asked in a suddenly hoarse voice.</p><p>Biting his lip, Zane shook his head. \u201cWell,\u201d he muttered, \u201cdespite what you think, I never was one for rules.\u201d He reached forward to hold Ty\u2019s chin and kissed him firmly, a little bit of relief easing the tension in Zane\u2019s body.</p><p>Ty tensed and returned the kiss as if he was merely too surprised not to do so, but then he relaxed slowly and leaned forward into it. \u201cI hope to hell I can remember where that came from,\u201d he murmured with a small smile.</p><p>Zane hummed against Ty\u2019s lips lowly. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, voice a little rough. Just one kiss and he was aroused. Zane closed his eyes for a moment, taking a steadying breath and pushing himself away from the bed.</p><p>\u201cThat ... that\u2019s pretty damn nice,\u201d Ty said softly as Zane moved away from him. Zane paused, looking back at Ty with darkened eyes before he sank to sit facing him on the bed, waiting to see what he would do. Was this the real Ty? The one who stayed hidden under layers of Marine training and forced sarcasm? Or was it just the conk on the head?</p><p>Ty watched him quietly, eyes unusually calm and thankfully clear once more. \u201cI remember wanting you pretty bad,\u201d he finally admitted.</p><p>Zane stayed quiet for several heartbeats. \u201cWanting ... then?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Ty just shook his head and gave a small, embarrassed half-smile.</p><p>\u201cJust ... in general.\u201d</p><p>A smile slowly pulled at Zane\u2019s mouth. \u201cThe feeling\u2019s mutual.\u201d</p><p>Ty licked his lips and grinned slowly. \u201cI\u2019m going to deny saying that when my head stops hurting,\u201d he told Zane gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any less. Can\u2019t have you threatening my pansy-ass status in this relationship,\u201d Zane quipped.</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow and jerked his chin to the side at the word.</p><p>\u201cRelationship?\u201d he asked with a small laugh. He remembered screwing around with the man. He didn\u2019t remember any \u201crelationship,\u201d so to speak.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes despite the jump in his pulse at Ty\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t read into it. We are partners, after all.\u201d He shifted his weight to stand back up. Ty\u2019s hand shot out with surprising speed and grabbed him. Zane stopped in place, turning dark, questioning eyes on Ty. Ty inclined his head in a beckoning gesture and gave Zane\u2019s hand a slight tug.</p><p>Sliding over onto his thigh, Zane shifted closer, interested, but also somewhat suspicious. Ty was a devious little fucker. Zane could hope for a kiss ... but he figured it was about sixty-forty Ty would shove him to the floor. All in jest, of course.</p><p>\u201cAre we doing the right thing?\u201d Ty asked breathlessly as he looked up at Zane.</p><p>Zane looked down at the hand that still grasped his wrist, then up at Ty, the desire written all over him. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted in a rasp, facing the quandary of the two of them together head-on. \u201cBut it sure as hell feels right.\u201d</p><p>Ty just shook his head and licked his lips, attention rapt on Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t mean us. I mean the case. Should we even still be here?\u201d he asked in a rough voice.</p><p>Cheeks reddening, Zane blinked rapidly at him. \u201cThe case. I don\u2019t know anymore,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>A moment passed in silence, not even the sound of their breathing breaking the moment. Finally, Ty tugged Zane closer and kissed him passionately.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, Ty,\u201d Zane rasped once they separated to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI think maybe a shower is in order,\u201d Ty muttered with one final kiss.</p><p>He felt himself searching for any reason not to go through with what he had started. It felt too much like spinning out of control for him to be comfortable.</p><p>He kissed Zane again impulsively and then pushed him away to crawl off the bed and start for the bathroom carefully. He felt like he might fall over if he moved too quickly.</p><p>Rolling to his side, Zane watched Ty walk away. \u201cYeah,\u201d he whispered. Christ, what a view. He squeezed his eyes shut for a few seconds.</p><p>What would he do when Ty went back to being ... Ty? As much as he found this Ty endearing and sexy as hell, it was disconcerting to have him be so totally different from the man Zane had come to know, sex and all. It was like meeting a new partner all over again, one that was easy to work with and actually friendly and affectionate, and Zane just didn\u2019t know what to think of it. Even worse, he could feel the dangerous allure of it, threatening to drag him under with wanting it.</p><p>Ty clanked around in the bathroom for a few moments before the shower started, and soon he was out again, a towel around his shoulders and running it through his short hair carefully as he watched Zane and moved closer. His entire right side was covered with nasty purpling bruises, and he walked with a slight hitch to his step. \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d he finally asked with a wince.</p><p>\u201cFriday,\u201d Zane murmured. He was on his back again, arm thrown over his eyes.</p><p>Ty frowned but said nothing in response, instead walking closer to the bed and flopping the towel down on Zane\u2019s thighs. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Zane lifted his arm. His brow was furrowed as he looked at Ty.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d What was Ty asking about? His state of mind? Zane moved his hand to grasp the towel as he looked up at Ty, who was towering over him. God, he was incredible-looking like this\u2014even all beaten up\u2014flushed and soft after a hot shower.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m becoming more a hindrance than a help,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d Zane answered evenly.</p><p>Ty nodded and lowered his head, retrieving his towel from Zane\u2019s grasp without another word.</p><p>Zane sat up and peered up at his partner. \u201cHow fuzzy are you, still? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Do we need to lay low until your brain pulls itself out of the frying pan?\u201d he asked worriedly.</p><p>Ty lowered his head and looked at Zane from under lowered brows.</p><p>\u201cThings are fuzzy,\u201d he admitted after a moment of honest self-examination. \u201cI remember most of the important things. Mentally I\u2019m okay. Physically, not so much. I think if we were in a fight tonight I\u2019d be a liability,\u201d he added with a wince as he bowed his head again.</p> <p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll stay in and take it easy. I do want to make a few phone calls and go pick up our stuff, get those personnel files to Henninger. Right now, that\u2019s our only lead. Other than that, we\u2019re sadly lacking in choices to pursue on the case. I hate to say it ... it\u2019s going to take another killing\u2014and some lucky evidence\u2014to give us a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if we weren\u2019t ducking and covering every other day we\u2019d have made more progress,\u201d Ty muttered sulkily as he sat down on the edge of the bed. \u201cWhere are the files again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the other room,\u201d Zane answered evenly, trying not to show how worrying it was that Ty was having trouble remembering. \u201cI\u2019ll run out and pick them up, get us some food other than room service and some snacks, and head back this way,\u201d he continued nonchalantly.</p><p>Ty looked up at him, something like hurt resentment in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Henninger? Can you call him to go with you?\u201d he finally asked resignedly.</p> <p>Zane turned his chin and looked at him evenly. \u201cI\u2019d rather have you there. But yeah, I can call him.\u201d</p><p>Ty merely looked up at him blankly, his fa\u00e7ade from the first several days slowly returning. Zane\u2019s lips twitched ruefully. There was \u201chis\u201d Ty. It was something like protective armor. If Ty was feeling threatened, he turned into that man. Zane stood and walked out to the front room to call Henninger.</p><p>At least this Ty he knew how to handle. The other, softer man threw him totally. But oddly, Zane\u2019s chest hurt. It was something he had said that made that newer man disappear again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you if you trust me to,\u201d came a soft call from the bedroom.</p><p>Torn, Zane held the cell in one hand. The past day and a half, Ty had threatened him with bodily harm if he went back to the Holiday Inn without him\u2014something Zane had first thought was disdain for his abilities, but later discovered was concern. Now, Ty was acting like Zane was the one who was sitting in judgment over his abilities. Sliding the phone into his pocket, Zane walked back to the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not all here,\u201d Ty said to him flatly as he sat on the edge of the bed with his hands clasped between his knees.</p> <p>\u201cEven not all here, you\u2019re better than I am,\u201d Zane said conversationally. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you to believe me or not.\u201d Ty was Recon. A goddamn Marine. A top undercover agent. Survival was ingrained in his instincts and reflexes, things that just didn\u2019t come naturally to Zane.</p><p>Ty jerked his head slightly and looked up at Zane appraisingly. \u201cGive me a minute to get dressed, then,\u201d he finally muttered.</p><p>Zane nodded and walked to the dressing table where he\u2019d set out their guns and started adjusting his holster. Ty dressed slowly, quietly dreading another attack of dizziness or nausea. Finally, he looked over his shoulder as he buttoned his shirt and muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t like feeling useless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zane replied, not turning around from where he was checking over the guns. Ty turned and watched the movements of Zane\u2019s shoulders as he checked that the guns were loaded and working properly. He moved closer, bare feet on the carpet letting him move almost soundlessly. He stopped just out of arm\u2019s reach and slid his hands into his pockets.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I\u2019m not remembering, Zane?\u201d he asked softly, the words slow and pointed.</p><p>Zane looked up, though he didn\u2019t turn, hands still moving knowledgeably on the weapon. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say,\u201d Ty answered in quiet confusion. He could feel that Zane expected something of him, and he knew whatever it was, he wasn\u2019t delivering.</p><p>The falter in Ty\u2019s voice made Zane\u2019s shoulders stiffen. He turned around. \u201cTy,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI\u2019m just worried, all right? This isn\u2019t ... exactly ...</p> <p>you. It\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s not wrong, just not the same, and it worries me. It worries me what you\u2019ll think about it after. What you\u2019ll think about me.</p><p>Okay?\u201d He held out Ty\u2019s gun, butt toward the other man.</p><p>Ty looked down at the weapon and then back up at Zane in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ll think about you?\u201d he echoed, sounding slightly lost.</p><p>Zane\u2019s smile was self-deprecating. \u201cI\u2019m fairly sure that, fucking aside, you\u2019re not at all fond of me. Remember the pansy-ass comments?\u201d He offered the gun again. \u201cYou meant them wholeheartedly. And not undeservedly, I guess.\u201d He shrugged and looked at Ty evenly, and his voice was slightly flatter. \u201cDon\u2019t think too hard about it. Give it another day or so, and you\u2019ll be okay. Then all this can be as unfond of a memory as you want.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned harder as he took the gun. \u201cFine,\u201d he said softly, checking automatically to see if the gun was loaded.</p><p>Why it hurt when Ty turned away, Zane didn\u2019t know. And he refused to think about it.</p><p>ON the way to the Holiday Inn the call came over the radio. Another murder.</p><p>The dispatcher gave the address, the name of the hotel, and the room number, and Ty inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201cI know that number,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhy do I know that number?\u201d</p><p>he asked Zane in frustration. His head was pounding, but Zane didn\u2019t need to know about that. Or about the black around his peripheral vision.</p><p>Zane glanced over at him worriedly as he drove.</p><p>\u201cGo there,\u201d Ty requested. \u201cGo to the scene.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and punched in the address on the GPS, then turned on the siren as they made their way through traffic toward the hotel. The front entrance was already busy with city cops and FBI forensics. An ambulance idled in the tow-away zone.</p><p>Ty was opening the door and getting out of the car before Zane even had it in park, and Zane cursed creatively and followed him hastily. Ty walked out into the middle of the road, and Zane spared a thought that it was a damn good thing the street was cordoned off, or Ty would have just wandered into traffic unheeded. The fact that his partner was definitely not all there came crashing down on him so quickly that it hurt.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Garrett,\u201d Ty gasped out in horror as he stared up at the fa\u00e7ade of the hotel building. \u201cIt\u2019s her,\u201d he said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s who?\u201d Zane asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here. That room number,\u201d Ty answered as his breathing began to accelerate even more. \u201cIt was hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose?\u201d Zane asked in frustration.</p><p>\u201cThe little stewardess,\u201d Ty whispered. \u201cFrom the flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl you fucked the other night?\u201d Zane asked in dread as he looked back at the ordered chaos of the police vehicles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all over that room,\u201d Ty told him quietly. \u201cShe was leaving that night. If it\u2019s her, I was the last person with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Zane hissed as he ran his hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty murmured as his mind reeled. \u201cI think it\u2019s time we report in,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbefore I get framed for this fucking murder.\u201d</p><p>Zane swore, pulled out his cell, and started dialing.</p><p>Four hours into the night, they were standing outside the room, talking quietly with Special Agents Sears and Ross as members of the forensics team and others worked busily.</p><p>They had been given a chance to look at the scene before anything was touched.</p><p>Isabelle St. Claire\u2019s body had been hung up in the window against a clean white hotel sheet. She was naked and bloody, covered with various colors of water-based paint, and framed by the painted wooden casing of the window like a portrait.</p><p>Ty had stared at the scene motionlessly, going dangerously pale as he looked up at the obscene parody of a framed portrait on the wall. Zane had finally taken his elbow and pulled him away, unable to watch the effect the scene had on him.</p><p>\u201cSo you knew the victim?\u201d Sears asked Ty as they stood out in the hallway.</p><p>Ty nodded, but then shook his head. \u201cShe was an acquaintance,\u201d he said hollowly, unable to take his eyes off the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMeaning you fucked her then left,\u201d Ross supplied.</p><p>Zane cleared his throat, but Ty merely nodded again in answer, not taking exception to the harsh words.</p><p>Zane hovered closer. \u201cHe was gone for less than two hours that night,\u201d he supplied in a hard voice. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t covered in paint or blood when he got back. I think I would have noticed that, at least. We\u2019ve been with each other pretty much twenty-four/seven since,\u201d he told them.</p><p>Ty turned to stare at Zane briefly, but added nothing.</p><p>Ross and Sears looked between themselves, silently communicating before Ross turned his attention back to the agents. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ve got your numbers in case there\u2019s anything that comes up. Get out of here,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t move; his feet were rooted to the floor in front of the yellow police tape that now cordoned off the room. \u201cHow\u2019d she die?\u201d he asked in a hoarse voice. \u201cWas she still alive when he put her up there?\u201d he asked as the elevator dinged down the hall.</p><p>He waited as their two fellow agents looked at each other again. Sears answered, finally. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of blood. It looks like maybe she was,\u201d she murmured regretfully.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and turned his head to the side, fighting back the urge to be sick. Zane had to fight hard not to touch him or comfort him in any way, and finally he placed a gentle hand on his shoulder.</p><p>There was a sickening thud as the coroner lowered the body and sheet to a piece of plastic on the floor.</p><p>Sears closed her eyes and looked away. \u201cSometimes, I hate my job,\u201d</p><p>she muttered, turning to look at her partner, who was watching dispassionately.</p><p>Another hand on his other shoulder caused Ty to open his eyes again, and he turned to see that Henninger had joined them. Ty didn\u2019t even think to ask why or how.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Zane asked, frowning a little. He looked over the younger man\u2019s shoulder to see Morrison several feet away, getting paperwork from one of the city cops who had been called in to secure the scene.</p><p>\u201cI figured you might be here when I heard the call,\u201d Henninger answered quietly. \u201cAre you sticking around?\u201d</p><p>Zane looked at Ty. The man was obviously shell-shocked. \u201cNo.</p><p>We\u2019re leaving. Come on,\u201d he murmured as he took Ty\u2019s arm, pulling him along behind to the stairwell at the opposite end of the hall. Henninger followed them, glancing over his shoulder to see Morrison absorbed in discussion with his back to them.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Ty muttered as they got to the fire door. He shook his head and looked at both men, then turned to look back at the activity behind them.</p><p>\u201cIf we disappear again it\u2019ll make us suspects,\u201d he reminded hazily.</p><p>Lips pressing hard, Zane bit down on his urge to protest. Although Ross and Sears had cleared them\u2014for now\u2014that didn\u2019t guarantee it would stay that way. \u201cShit,\u201d he swore under his breath. \u201cFuck it. I don\u2019t want to be where that bastard knows where we are.\u201d He turned and waved Henninger back to the activity, then took Ty\u2019s elbow and put his hand on the heavy stairwell door.</p><p>Henninger nodded and headed back down the hall to the crime scene and his partner, glancing over his shoulder worriedly at them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this,\u201d Zane muttered as he opened the stairwell door and gestured Ty inside.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t reply as he entered the stairwell and stood staring down the steps unseeingly.</p><p>Zane started down the stairs, then stopped and turned when he realized Ty wasn\u2019t following.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hands hung limp at his sides and he cocked his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cHe knew I\u2019d been here,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cHe followed me. He knew he could hurt us through her. He knew we\u2019d take different rooms than the ones we were given and he found us. He knew we\u2019d stay on it even after being hurt and he planned for it in case we weren\u2019t killed,\u201d he rambled slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s profiled us,\u201d he whispered with a bit of shock in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane agreed. \u201cSo we\u2019re not going to get anywhere.\u201d He paused a long moment. \u201cUnless we break profile.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and frowned. \u201cWe need to take this to Burns,\u201d he said softly, as if they might be overheard. \u201c\u2019Cause right now my number one suspect would be me.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWas your last assignment here in New York?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ty pressed his lips together tightly, prepared to offer the usual \u201cthat\u2019s classified.\u201d But there was really no point in that. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered finally.</p><p>Jaw setting, Zane stared at Ty for a long minute. \u201cYou\u2019re not the killer,\u201d he finally said evenly. \u201cThere will be evidence to track and clear you.</p><p>Just like there\u2019s evidence to track and trap him. We just have to find it.\u201d</p><p>Ty returned the look with one that was unreadable. Finally, he nodded and looked down at his booted feet.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said, trying to get his attention. \u201cI can\u2019t do this without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know they\u2019ll take us off this case, right?\u201d Ty responded softly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both probably looking at probation until I\u2019m cleared.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou said it before. Burns put us on this case for a reason; both of us are already fuckups who should have been fired or buried. He\u2019ll keep us on it,\u201d Zane asserted as he studied the other man. \u201cHow much is still missing from your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ty asked defensively.</p><p>\u201cWe can use it to our advantage. If you\u2019re off your usual style, that may throw him,\u201d Zane pointed out seriously. \u201cOf course, you might wake up after a thirty-minute nap and be back to your usual irascible self.\u201d</p> <p>Ty stared at him for a minute and then his lips twitched in a half-smile. \u201cIrascible?\u201d he echoed weakly. Rubbing his hands over his eyes with a sudden sigh of frustration, he shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s like swimming through cotton, trying to remember the past couple weeks,\u201d he answered. \u201cI remember some of the smallest details. But other things, bigger things, I can\u2019t recall at all.\u201d</p><p>Taking the few steps up so he could reach him, Zane pulled Ty\u2019s hands away from his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t push it\u2014that\u2019s what the doctors told me.</p><p>Trying consciously to remember will just give you a bad headache.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked down at him, nonplussed. \u201cI already have a headache,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Zane smiled sadly and looked over Ty carefully, still holding both of Ty\u2019s wrists in his hands. \u201cYou look ... unwell,\u201d he murmured with a frown.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t think,\u201d Ty murmured in response, fidgeting as much as a man could when he was perched on top of a staircase with both hands being held by someone else.</p><p>Zane sobered and watched his agitated movements, slowly releasing his hands so he could pace if he wanted to. \u201cTy. You\u2019ve got to calm down.</p><p>There\u2019s only so much we can do right now; that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t be able to do more later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Ty finally told him with an uncharacteristic show of emotion. He sat down hard on the top step and bent over, placing his hands on each side of his head and squeezing his eyes shut as if he were trying to block out everything. He began to rock back and forth slowly as he spoke. \u201cI can\u2019t concentrate on anything, not when all I can think about is you. And now with this fucking headache,\u201d he ground out in frustration, not finishing his thoughts as he closed his eyes once more and held his head in his hands. \u201cI feel sick,\u201d</p><p>he finally added pitifully.</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath was caught in his chest. This wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected at all. Ty was obviously having more difficulty with the concussion than he had been outwardly letting on, and the slip of admitting that he couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything but Zane made his body warm uncomfortably. It was hard to decipher what Ty really meant through the babbling.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d Zane asked softly, trying to stay as detached as possible, at least for a little longer.</p><p>Ty pressed his lips tightly together and breathed out slowly through his nose. \u201cI think I need to request medical leave,\u201d he answered finally, his voice hoarse and full of pain. It was obvious that he had never before been forced to admit he was not physically capable of something.</p><p>The mask broke, and Zane looked stunned. \u201cTy ... I ...\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to say. His hands curled into fists.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be done alone; we\u2019ve already established that,\u201d Ty breathed. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t ... think,\u201d he ground out in frustration. \u201cIf I request it before they can suspend us, the suspension won\u2019t go in your file,\u201d he added.</p><p>Zane nodded slowly, feeling helpless. Powerless. Again. He lifted both hands and rubbed at his eyes.</p><p>Ty sat there and bowed his head with a sinking feeling. \u201cWe both know I\u2019m no good to you,\u201d he said finally. \u201cHell, I\u2019m light-headed right now.\u201d</p><p>Dropping his hands, Zane pulled open his eyes to look at Ty. \u201cLie back before you fall over,\u201d he said quietly, tone soft, even worried. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Ty tilted his head up, and his expression softened as he looked up at Zane. \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me,\u201d he murmured to him softly. He knew it was the right decision, to pull himself off the case. It didn\u2019t mean he had to like it.</p> <p>Zane reached down to run his fingers through Ty\u2019s hair, but just as the tips of his fingers touched, the loud clank of the stairwell door being pushed open startled them both and interrupted the tender gesture.</p><p>Ty lowered his head again as an agent stepped into the stairwell, and then he looked up to meet Zane\u2019s eyes again. They looked at each other intently for several heartbeats before Ty climbed to his feet unsteadily and turned to face the man.</p><p>\u201cI need a doctor,\u201d he said hoarsely to the agent.</p><p>\u201cAND I want you both to know this will in no way negatively impact your records. Grady, you\u2019ve been cleared of any involvement in the murder, not that we really expected trouble there,\u201d Assistant Director Burns said as he looked at the two men. He received no answers, much the same as the last ten minutes he\u2019d been talking. \u201cGarrett, you\u2019ve been put back on active duty for immediate assignment,\u201d he continued.</p><p>The two agents in the room with him were about as different as night and day from the last time he had seen them. Ty sat quietly, slightly distant and reserved. He\u2019d been kept at a hospital in New York under observation for nearly a week, diagnosed with a severe concussion and PTSD. When they released him, he\u2019d been flown directly back to DC and driven to this very meeting. Burns noticed that he still wore the little hospital bracelet on his wrist.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zane had been taken straight to Washington to be debriefed over and over as the internal investigation continued. His attitude had understandably been for shit the whole time. Getting him to cooperate with anything had been a fight, but Burns didn\u2019t really blame the man.</p><p>Now, Ty was scheduled for medical review over at Walter Reed in two hours, and looking at him as he sat in his office, Burns wasn\u2019t sure he would pass muster. He had never seen Ty Grady look so defeated. And Burns had his doubts about Zane\u2019s willingness to go back to work at all. Zane stood at the window, staring out with his arms crossed, face schooled blank. Burns suppressed a frown. The Zane Garrett of old seemed to have made a reappearance: dark jeans, T-shirt, black leather jacket, two days without shaving, at the least. Burns could smell the cigarette smoke coming off him from ten feet away. It was only because he\u2019d seen Zane\u2019s medical review the day before that Burns knew the man hadn\u2019t gone back to any more of his old habits.</p><p>It was almost like the two had switched places. He shook his head.</p><p>This had not been his aim when he had paired them up. He should have known Ty could corrupt anyone.</p><p>\u201cDo you two have any questions?\u201d Burns asked. Ty shook his head, and Zane merely stared out the window without responding. Burns sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both being reassigned,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve not shared the whereabouts with anyone but you individually. If you tell each other, that\u2019s none of my business.\u201d And Burns would leave it at that. He looked between them one more time. Neither man spoke. \u201cWell. I have a meeting downstairs.</p><p>Take care.\u201d And with that he departed, leaving them alone in the room when the door clicked shut behind him.</p><p>Ty sat staring at the floor listlessly, unable to look up at Zane as he sat with his knee bouncing. Zane didn\u2019t move from the window, and silent minutes passed. It wasn\u2019t tense. It was just empty.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know where I\u2019m going?\u201d Ty finally asked, doubt clear in his voice.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t turn from the plate-glass window. \u201cMedical leave.</p><p>They\u2019ll poke and prod and pick your brain apart at Walter Reed and a few specialty places for a while, then send you off to another city; Norfolk maybe, Atlanta. Possibly back to Baltimore. To live quietly for a predetermined amount of time and see a doctor three times a week,\u201d he said in a monotone.</p><p>He knew the drill; he knew it too well.</p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s a no, huh?\u201d Ty affirmed flatly. He cleared his throat and stood, taking his cues from Zane and not asking where the other man was being sent. \u201cWell. Probably for the best, right?\u201d he muttered as he shrugged into his coat carefully. His ribs were still tender even after the weeks that had passed. \u201cGood luck, Garrett,\u201d he offered with a small sigh, not allowing himself to think about why he regretted this ending.</p><p>\u201cGet better, Grady. The Bureau needs you,\u201d Zane said, not moving.</p><p>He tried to decide why this hurt so much. They\u2019d known each other barely a week. Granted, they\u2019d screwed each other like crazy. But why did this feel so wrong?</p><p>Ty watched him for a moment, a sinking feeling in his chest as he realized that Zane didn\u2019t even intend to fucking turn around and say goodbye.</p><p>He moved silently toward the door, worn boots soundless on the industrial carpet.</p><p>\u201cTy\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ty stopped with his hand on the doorknob, turning to look back at Zane.</p><p>He had turned around to look at him, and some of the cold was out of his demeanor, revealing a hint of unusual vulnerability. \u201cYou said I wouldn\u2019t miss you.\u201d He drew in a long breath, and his voice was even quieter when he spoke again. \u201cYou were wrong.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent, unmoving as he met Zane\u2019s eyes across the room. \u201cI was wrong about a lot of things,\u201d he said finally, his voice soft and wistful.</p><p>He turned the knob and quickly slid out of the room.</p><p>Turning back to the window, Zane leaned his forehead against the glass and closed his eyes.</p><p>he motorcycle sped down the well-lit freeway, far above the speed limit, the hunched figure aboard shrouded in black leather and a full-T face helmet. The bike swerved through traffic, darting around cars and trucks without a hint of hesitation before exiting and rolling to a slower speed at the bottom of the ramp.</p><p>The bike sped up again as it entered an older, run-down, darker part of town, where the city rotted from the inside out. The rider guided it down a maze of streets before stopping in front of a small warehouse. With the hit of a button, a large bay door opened, and the rider steered the bike inside before the door closed behind him.</p><p>Once the bike stopped, the rider stood up and swung his leg over, leaving the keys in it as he walked over to a scarred table. He pulled off his helmet and set it there before looking around.</p><p>Zane had been in Miami almost four months, working the inner city, trailing down some major drug deals with quite a bit of success. A lot of it was sheer cussedness and bravado; his Bureau contact had already warned him to be more careful three times. But safety didn\u2019t matter to him, as long as he got the job done.</p><p>He tossed his gloves next to the helmet and unzipped his jacket as he walked further into the warehouse toward a loft. He climbed the steps, tossing the black leather over the railing, revealing a skin-tight, sweaty T-shirt, covered by a double shoulder holster, and sheaths holding wickedly sharp knives with well-worn handles at his wrists.</p><p>After disarming but shoving one gun in the back of his waistband, he went to a cabinet and looked tiredly over several bottles\u2014many empty\u2014and pulled out a half-empty one of rotgut tequila. He screwed off the top before he shook a cigarette out of a crumpled pack. He collapsed on the lumpy couch, lit up, and took a long pull of the harsh liquor, leaning his head back to stare at the ceiling and lose himself in his vices. It would be a lonely, silent, hot night.</p><p>TY sat on the balcony of his row house in Baltimore, smoking a Montecristo No. 4 Reserva and blowing smoke rings into the starless sky. The cigar was a limited production (only 100,000 had been made down in Cuba), and they were packaged in sleek black boxes of twenty cigars, each box labeled with a gold number between 1 and 5,000. In the back of Ty\u2019s closet, he had five boxes in a safe, numbered 12 to 16.</p><p>It was good to have resourceful friends stationed at Gitmo.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice called from inside the bedroom. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come back to bed, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>Ty lowered his head and tapped the tip of his finger on his beer bottle.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Ty. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>Another smoke ring drifted its way toward the clouded moon, and somewhere in the city a horn honked angrily.</p><p>\u201cYou shithead!\u201d the woman called. \u201cI fucking knew this was a mistake,\u201d she mumbled to herself as the rustling of sheets and clothing drifted out to Ty\u2019s ears. A few moments later the front door slammed shut.</p><p>Ty sighed heavily and inhaled the cool air with its hint of fragrant cigar smoke. He sat with his bare feet propped on the railing, nothing but a worn pair of sweatpants protecting him from the chill, and he watched the sun rise silently.</p><p>It had been almost four months since his medical leave had been granted. He had been evaluated\u2014both for his injuries and for what had been deemed severe exhaustion and shock\u2014observed, treated, treated again, observed some more, and finally given three weeks of vacation to \u201cget his head back on straight.\u201d He had another thirteen days of nothing to do but barmaids. He might actually go crazy before then.</p><p>ZANE pulled off his jacket and threw it to the floor, stamping up the steps to the loft and making for the bathroom. He flipped on the light and turned toward the mirror to look at the angry, bloody gash across the meat of his upper arm.</p><p>He muttered in harsh Spanish. Fuckers. Taking potshots at him like that when he\u2019d delivered what they wanted and more. He\u2019d taken more satisfaction than usual beating the shit out of a couple of them before he called in the cavalry to arrest the whole lot of them.</p><p>He hissed angrily as he poured peroxide liberally over the gunshot wound, covered it messily with antibiotic cream, ignoring that it was still gaping and bleeding, and wrapped it up. He walked toward the kitchen, still muttering angrily as he slid a cigarette between his lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Walking by the answering machine, he turned up his nose at the blinking red light and lit up. The only person who called him here was the Bureau contact, and he definitely didn\u2019t want to talk to her. Cursing under his breath, he hit the button and pulled out his guns, checking them as he disarmed.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Garrett, this is Assistant Director Richard Burns.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s head shot around so he could stare at the machine. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare ignore me. Call me. It doesn\u2019t matter what time.\u201d He left an unfamiliar return number and hung up.</p> <p>Hitting the erase button, Zane frowned and tapped the ashes from his cigarette. It was odd to hear English not made rapid-fire by an accent.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he want?\u201d he murmured to himself, the Spanish flowing easily. He tapped his fingers on the phone for a long moment before picking up and dialing the number he had easily memorized.</p><p>Two minutes later, he was connected to Burns, presumably at home, since it was the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Garrett. Thank you for returning my call so promptly,\u201d Burns said by way of greeting, no hint of censure or sleep in his voice.</p><p>Zane walked with the handset over to the couch and pulled out a bottle of painkillers. \u201cWhat do you want, Burns?\u201d Zane muttered in his well-practiced accented English, setting his cigarette in an overfull ashtray. He poured a handful of pills into his hand and popped three into his mouth, sitting on the edge of the couch and holding his arm out to look at it.</p> <p>\u201cEver the conversationalist. Nice accent, by the way. Have you been following the Tri-State murders?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s jaw set. \u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>\u201cGood. Get to DC. I want you here by three-thirty tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDC?\u201d Zane objected. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of all kinds of shit here, Burns. I can\u2019t just drop it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will turn over all information and material to Special Agent Black, who is waiting quite patiently right outside your door. Be here, and don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>Burns hung up, leaving Zane staring at the handset. After a long moment, he hurled it at the wall, foreign expletives flowing off his tongue as it shattered.</p> <p>TY didn\u2019t sleep at night. He never had, even as a child. While the military had forced him to change that, the subsequent years of working undercover mostly at night had hardwired his body once more to sleep during the day and prowl restlessly during the late hours when he had nothing else to keep him busy. And so, when his phone rang at roughly two in the afternoon, it sent Ty straight up and into a full-out panic before he was able to track down the vibrating cell phone and growl at it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he answered in a huff, rubbing sleepy eyes and shaking his head to wake himself fully.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Grady,\u201d a familiar voice greeted warmly.</p><p>\u201cDick?\u201d Ty responded in shock. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said immediately.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it was, I didn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m on vacation,\u201d he insisted defensively.</p><p>There was a chuckle in response. \u201cI know you\u2019re on vacation, Ty.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need you to cut it short,\u201d Burns told him solemnly. \u201cHave you been following the Tri-State murders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty answered immediately.</p><p>\u201cGood. Get in here. One hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t come in smelling like beer and cheap cigars!\u201d Burns chastised before hanging up.</p><p>ZANE let the bike coast as he pulled up at the gate to the Bureau parking lot.</p><p>He showed his badge and was waved through, although he got a couple of odd looks. He hadn\u2019t bothered to dress up, just bringing the basics in the saddlebags on his bike. And the leather, of course, since he was riding. His favorite jacket had that gash in the arm from last night, but he wouldn\u2019t give it up. He parked the bike in the garage and pulled his leg over, boot hitting the pavement with a clunk. He pulled off the helmet and ran a hand through his overgrown hair. He left the helmet on the bike and stalked toward the building.</p><p>The receptionist blinked at him as he entered the Assistant Director\u2019s office. \u201cThey\u2019re ... waiting for you,\u201d she stuttered at him.</p><p>Zane offered her a rakish grin before reaching for the knob to open the door.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can assure you the cigars are not cheap,\u201d a voice was saying conversationally on the other side of the door. \u201cThe beer is,\u201d the man added,</p><p>\u201cbut never the cigars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to know about those cigars,\u201d Burns responded in a tired voice.</p><p>Zane stopped just inside, having caught words in a voice he knew he\u2019d never forget. Instead of focusing on Burns, who looked up at him, Zane focused on the back of the man who sat across from the Assistant Director.</p><p>\u201cGarrett. Nice of you to join us. Over half an hour late,\u201d Burns greeted, but he didn\u2019t sound too perturbed.</p><p>Ty stiffened in the chair and went still. Slowly, he turned his head to look back at Zane, and the stunned reaction was too instantaneous to conceal.</p><p>Zane swallowed hard, looking over Ty\u2019s face. He looked ... good.</p><p>Really good. Finally, he found the nerve to speak. \u201cHello, Grady.\u201d The words came out still tinged by an accent.</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Ty greeted in shock as he stood uncertainly. He turned to Burns and asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>Zane tore his eyes away from Ty and looked to Burns.</p><p>\u201cDespite how your last collaboration ended, we need you two in New York again,\u201d Burns answered. His smile faded. \u201cThe killer went quiet, without showing so much as a shadow, for about three months after you two were removed from the case. As if he ... missed you,\u201d he told them with an odd uncertainty. \u201cUntil two weeks ago. Since then there has been one more murder, and two days ago, the two agents we had on the case were seriously injured in a gas line explosion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting us back on the Tri-State case?\u201d Ty blurted in shock.</p><p>\u201cTogether?\u201d</p><p>The Assistant Director nodded. \u201cIn a way,\u201d he answered vaguely.</p><p>\u201cYou two are the only ones left who\u2019ve worked the case at all and are around to tell about it. The others might not make it.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd I know it\u2019s important to you both. For many reasons,\u201d he added quietly with a glance at Ty.</p><p>Zane took a few steps toward Burns\u2019 desk. \u201cAre we gonna be handcuffed like last time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandcuffed?\u201d Burns asked in confusion. \u201cWhat you two do on your own time is none of the Bureau\u2019s concern,\u201d he added with a wink at Ty, who rolled his eyes and sat back down slowly.</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Zane said flatly. He\u2019d just ridden over fifteen hours on a motorcycle to get there and he wasn\u2019t amused. No matter how much he jumped inside at the chance to see Ty again, Zane knew they\u2019d be walking right back into an uncontrolled fire that could too easily torch them both\u2014but it was the best news he had heard in months. \u201cWe had a tail up our asses and too many people looking over our shoulders. It didn\u2019t stop that bastard from tracking us down somewhere else.\u201d Zane\u2019s words were clipped and run together, blending his accents. He glanced to Ty, trying to get some feel for him after four months apart.</p><p>Ty sat silently, head slightly bowed and body completely still as he watched Burns from under lowered brows. There was no nervous bouncing of his knee or jittery twitching like there had always been before when he was forced to sit still. He was also clean-shaven, and his hair was still closely cropped. The only remnant of his previous wardrobe was the slightly wrinkled white dress shirt he wore beneath his suit coat, untucked and unbuttoned at the collar. He stared at Burns emotionlessly, none of the usual fire in his eyes or features.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be sent in unofficially with no other Bureau resources aside from what I have here for you,\u201d Burns answered seriously as he waved a manila envelope. \u201cThe two of you have unique experience, you understand.\u201d</p><p>Zane was still watching the other agent, seeing the stamp of medical overload and a bureaucratic smackdown all over him. He\u2019d lived it himself, and it was a fucking mess to deal with. He\u2019d wondered, more than once, if he\u2019d have broken the self-enforced conditioning if he hadn\u2019t met Ty. How in the hell was Ty supposed to break free of it?</p><p>\u201cGrady?\u201d Zane asked abruptly. \u201cAre you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not really a request, gentlemen,\u201d Burns said gently.</p><p>Zane barked back something rough in Spanish before catching himself. \u201cKiss my ass, Burns. After what we went through last time, I think we have some say,\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>The Assistant Director narrowed his eyes, but didn\u2019t disagree.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes moved from Burns to Zane, and he merely nodded in answer.</p><p>Zane studied him for a long moment, trying not to get lost in the details. \u201cAll right. We\u2019re in. Give me the stuff; I want out of here. We shouldn\u2019t have come in to the office to start with, if we\u2019re supposed to be under the radar. Word will get around.\u201d</p><p>Burns slid an envelope across the desk. \u201cApproval for this directive comes from the Director himself. Having a killer on the inside like this is a terrible failure on the part of the system. It has to be corrected.\u201d He looked between them. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to repeat this. You have carte blanche. Those credit cards do not have limits. There are alternate identifications in that envelope, if need be. Just take this bastard out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want him in jail?\u201d Zane asked sharply.</p><p>The Assistant Director turned and walked to the window. \u201cGood luck, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood and watched Burns for a moment, then turned to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. He licked his lips uncertainly, unable to think of anything to say.</p><p>He just nodded his head at the door and gave Burns one last glance.</p><p>Zane picked up the envelope and led the way out, not another word for the Assistant Director. He assumed Ty would follow, but he still stopped in the outer room to wait and get another good look at the man he\u2019d thought about far too much the past four months. Ty did follow, ignoring the batting eyelashes of the secretary who had previously looked at him with such disdain.</p><p>Instead, he came to stand beside Zane, not looking him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking good,\u201d he commented softly.</p><p>Zane raised a sardonic eyebrow, not that Ty would see it. He looked like a hell-bent-for-leather biker, with the clothes, the three-day whiskers, and his messy hair. It was an image he\u2019d cultivated for a while now, and one he was pretty much comfortable in. But Ty....</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking different,\u201d Zane answered, voice low. \u201cGood. But different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty muttered as he began moving slowly to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear that wry sense of humor is still in there,\u201d Zane murmured to him.</p><p>Ty looked over at him as they walked, a small, slightly sad smile gracing his features. They were both quiet on the elevator as it took them down to the parking deck level.</p><p>When the elevator doors opened, Zane asked, \u201cYou got a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a cab,\u201d Ty admitted. \u201cWasn\u2019t quite sober when I got the call.\u201d</p><p>A grin pulled at Zane\u2019s lips as he unzipped his jacket, slid the envelope inside, and zipped it back up. \u201cYou can ride with me, then,\u201d he said casually as they left the elevator and stepped out into the parking deck.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I get the feeling that\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d Ty asked warily as he followed.</p><p>Zane\u2019s answer was a low, smug chuckle, and a minute later they stood next to his cobalt blue Honda Valkyrie. Zane held the helmet out to Ty, a dare in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty answered immediately. \u201cHell, no,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, baby, don\u2019t you want to feel this much power purring between your thighs?\u201d Zane drawled.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty answered earnestly with a shake of his head as he patted the seat of the motorcycle apologetically.</p><p>Zane pouted. \u201cI suppose I can just meet you somewhere,\u201d he offered, lips twitching. He mounted the bike and turned the key and the motor came to life; a growling, rolling, beautiful purr\u2014just like Zane had said.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d Ty answered immediately. \u201cI\u2019m going home to get my shit.\u201d</p><p>Glancing back to Ty, Zane sat with his legs splayed as he pulled on his gloves. \u201cAnd where is home?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou actually want me there rather than going ahead to get us some rooms somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed heavily and looked Zane over as he sat on the bike.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he murmured almost dejectedly. \u201cI want you there,\u201d he said pointedly.</p><p>Zane smiled slowly under Ty\u2019s frank appraisal. Maybe they were still on the same wavelength. \u201cTell me where,\u201d he requested. \u201cUnless you want to change your mind....\u201d he tilted his head to the seat behind him.</p><p>\u201cMy dignity and common sense won\u2019t allow it,\u201d Ty answered as he nodded to the entrance of the garage. \u201cFollow,\u201d he said succinctly as he turned and began heading for the daylight.</p><p>Chuckling, Zane waited a moment and then coasted the bike behind him. A harrowing ride through DC traffic later and they were in Baltimore, bumping over cobblestone streets as they made their way through the warren of the old city toward Ty\u2019s home. Zane parked in the walkway that led to the row house as Ty paid the hefty cab fare.</p><p>Ty stood back and watched the car drive off, then turned slowly to look back at Zane. He cocked his head and narrowed his eyes as Ty walked closer. \u201cI know that jacket,\u201d he murmured as he stopped right in front of Zane, hands in his pockets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The leather was broken in and beaten up, well-lived in with a few scuffs here and there, a couple rips, and one gash across his upper arm.</p><p>Abused, but loved. \u201cDo you, now?\u201d Zane asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cI would have taken better care of it,\u201d Ty responded haughtily as he reached up to finger the gash in the arm that didn\u2019t look near as worn as the other rips and tears. \u201cThis new?\u201d he asked seriously.</p> <p>Zane looked at his arm. \u201cLast night. Didn\u2019t move out of the way fast enough. Even I can\u2019t dodge two bullets at once.\u201d</p><p>Ty tutted and shook his head sadly. \u201cNot the man I thought you were, then.\u201d He sighed sorrowfully as he tugged at the slice in the leather and peered in at Zane\u2019s arm. Zane shook his head and obligingly held his arm out.</p><p>The white bandage was still there, extending out from under the red T-shirt he wore under the black leather. What he didn\u2019t know was that a few splotches of dark blood colored the gauze. He hadn\u2019t checked it since he had stopped for breakfast about ten hours ago.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d Ty told him matter-of-factly as he tilted his head toward the front door. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll pour some rubbing alcohol in it and make me feel better,\u201d he offered with a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou want your eardrums broken, too? You\u2019ll finally get to hear me scream,\u201d Zane muttered, closing his palm over his arm protectively and looking petulant.</p> <p>\u201cBonus,\u201d Ty crooned as he took Zane\u2019s good arm and led him forcefully to the door. Zane grumbled under his breath but didn\u2019t resist as Ty pulled him along. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been somewhere rough,\u201d Ty observed as he unlocked the door. \u201cThey put you undercover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said, just looking at the other man, soaking in his features. He\u2019d thought about him so much the past four months, he still couldn\u2019t quite believe he was here looking at him. \u201cInner Miami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplains the accent. It was a waste of your time,\u201d Ty muttered as he pushed the door open and gestured for Zane to go in. \u201cOnly thing that\u2019ll fix Miami is a fucking nuke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Zane agreed with a shrug. \u201cKept me busy and out of Burns\u2019</p><p>nonexistent hair, I figure.\u201d He walked into the house and paused a few steps inside the front room. The rooms were immaculate, completely at odds with the fa\u00e7ade Ty showed to the world. The furnishings were comfortable and well-kept\u2014not to mention actually matching\u2014and not a single item seemed to be out of place. Framed pictures lined the walls of the little living room, each frame identical to the next. They were all black-and-white prints, and told the story of Ty\u2019s life and career, showing him smiling and laughing with a variety of heavily armed, uniformed individuals in various exotic and not-so-exotic locations. There were several others that Zane felt certain were of Ty\u2019s family.</p><p>Ty watched Zane from behind, letting him observe. Zane\u2019s lips pressed together hard. \u201cYou sure you got the right house?\u201d he finally asked.</p> <p>Christ. This was nothing like what he would expect from the man he thought Ty was. The dichotomy of the man he had known had run deeper than he had ever suspected.</p><p>Ty frowned at him. \u201cI\u2019m a neat guy,\u201d he pointed out softly.</p><p>Zane slanted him a grin. \u201cI\u2019ll have to check the hospital corners on the bed, Jarhead.\u201d He unzipped the jacket and slid it from his shoulders, pinching the bandage.</p><p>\u201cYou can bounce a quarter off my bed,\u201d Ty boasted as he led the way into the kitchen. He dug under the sink and brought out an antique metal First Aid cabinet. The red cross on the front was faded and scratched, and the metal was dented and scarred. When he opened the door the contents were all modern, though, and he pulled out some gauze, a tin of Rawleigh\u2019s medicated salve, and some medical tape.</p><p>Zane tossed his jacket over the bar and pushed up his sleeve as he plopped himself onto a stool. He jerked the bandage off in one go with a grimace and poked at the oozing gouge. It was a good three inches long across his upper arm, and had taken out quite a chunk of flesh. He supposed now that a few stitches might not have been a bad idea.</p><p>Ty glanced over at it and immediately groaned softly. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m not stitching you up in my kitchen,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cThat needs a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust bandage it up,\u201d Zane said stubbornly. \u201cAnother scar won\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>Ty frowned doubtfully, but he cut the tape into strips and stuck them to the side of the counter, then opened the tin and slathered a good deal of the salve inside the wound without waiting to see if Zane would allow him to touch it. He worked quickly and finally pulled the wound together, placed a thin piece of gauze over it, taped the damaged skin as close as he could, and wound it all up without a word. Zane sat there unmoving, gritting his teeth. It hurt. A lot.</p><p>\u201cGlass of water?\u201d he requested after Ty was done.</p><p>Ty simply nodded and went to a cabinet near the refrigerator to retrieve a glass. He filled it from a bottle that sat on the counter and handed it wordlessly to Zane. Reaching over to the jacket, Zane dug into the pocket and pulled out a battered bottle of Tylenol, got a couple pills, and swallowed them down.</p><p>\u201cTough guy, huh?\u201d Ty asked sarcastically. \u201cI bet you got all kinds of action with that routine in Miami,\u201d he muttered as he watched with a frown.</p><p>Zane lowered the glass and looked at Ty appraisingly as he tucked the bottle away. \u201cDepends on what kind of action you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said, being deliberately vague. Ty could be talking about fighting \u201caction.\u201d</p><p>Possibly. If Ty were true to form ... that wouldn\u2019t be it.</p><p>Ty just raised one eyebrow and shrugged. \u201cIf you got called papi more than once, then I want blood tests before I touch you again,\u201d he said as he turned to the sink behind him and began washing his hands.</p><p>Chuckling, Zane pushed off his stool and reached out to snag Ty around the waist and start pulling. \u201cNot even once. Didn\u2019t pay anybody, either.\u201d</p><p>Ty huffed a laugh and let himself be pulled closer, swatting the faucet off before he was out of reach and pulling away only enough to make it seem like an effort. \u201cBucking the trend, then,\u201d he drawled. \u201cHow proud you must be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmmm.\u201d Zane reached out with his other arm to drag Ty closer, facing him, then slid his lips along the curve of Ty\u2019s neck. \u201cI got some ass,\u201d</p><p>he admitted before scraping his teeth on Ty\u2019s skin for a moment. Then he added, \u201cNo men.\u201d</p><p>Ty lowered his chin until his cheek brushed against Zane\u2019s, and he frowned and nodded. \u201cGood,\u201d he replied softly.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Zane inhaled Ty\u2019s scent slowly and let himself fall under the sound of his voice. It aroused him like nothing else. \u201cThe ass? Or the no men?\u201d he rasped, moving slightly to rub their cheeks together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Ty breathed in answer as he turned his head and pressed his lips to Zane\u2019s in an open-mouthed, hungry kiss.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hand closed around the back of Ty\u2019s neck as the other man beat him to the kiss, one he joined with just as much desire. Christ, he\u2019d missed this, missed Ty. He\u2019d never expected it, and he\u2019d lied to himself about how much it had hurt to be without him, unable to understand how he\u2019d grown so attached to this man in the space of seven hectic, awful days. His other hand tightened around Ty\u2019s waist, hauling him up against his body.</p><p>Ty flailed briefly, trying not to grab the upper arm he had just bandaged, and he groaned softly into the kiss. He had tried not to think about their brief stint in New York together. Parts of it he still didn\u2019t remember, and that just made it worse as he tried to force the memories out. Now, though, it all seemed to come rushing back and he let it, wrapping his arms around Zane and pulling him closer until there was no room left between them.</p><p>Ty\u2019s soft sounds made Zane\u2019s gut cramp with more than just passion; it was powerful enough for him to shudder. Emotion he\u2019d packed away in a tiny little box somewhere inside broke free, and everything he\u2019d tried to deny bubbled up. Once the kiss finally broke he dropped his head to Ty\u2019s shoulder, turning his face into Ty\u2019s neck, and he clutched him tightly, unwilling to let go. Not just yet. Not until the lonely ache that had been building the past four months faded.</p><p>Ty gave a little whuff of surprise when Zane clung to him, but he slowly slid his arms around him and hugged him, resting his chin against Zane\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked in a whisper.</p><p>Zane slowly nodded, waiting a few heartbeats before admitting, \u201cI am now,\u201d in a matching whisper. There was so much he wanted to say but didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes as the answer sent a shiver through him. He had been afraid of this. Terrified of this. He had known Zane had meant something more to him than just a weeklong partnership or a few wild fucks.</p><p>He had known, given the chance, that Zane could mean quite a lot to him.</p><p>Now, it seemed that Zane returned at least a portion of that feeling. Maybe more. And Ty didn\u2019t know how to handle it. He didn\u2019t even know if he wanted it.</p><p>He swallowed heavily and slid his hand up Zane\u2019s back into his hair, cradling his head as he ran his fingers through the short, messy curls.</p><p>\u201cYou need a haircut,\u201d he murmured finally, unable to say what he really wanted.</p><p>Zane shrugged slightly, not willing to move unless Ty pushed him away. He was trying to memorize the feel of the other man\u2019s body against his.</p><p>\u201cAnd a shower,\u201d Ty continued in a soft voice. He turned his head and pressed his nose and mouth against Zane\u2019s cheek gently. \u201cAnd some sleep, I bet.\u201d</p><p>Zane knew he was exhausted, but he was so used to it he hardly felt it anymore. He\u2019d been numb until he saw Ty again. Or maybe he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cAll of the above?\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty laughed as he smiled against Zane\u2019s skin. \u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything but Cuban,\u201d Zane said immediately before grinning and gnawing a little on Ty\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Ty laughed again, louder this time as another shiver ran through him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any Cuban in me, but I doubt I\u2019ll taste great,\u201d he warned as he pulled away. \u201cHow about pizza?\u201d he suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll go get it while you shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Zane said reluctantly, meaning Ty leaving rather than the food choice.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sulk as well as I do,\u201d Ty informed him dispassionately as he moved away.</p><p>\u201cI just need practice,\u201d Zane objected, leaning forward to snag Ty\u2019s arm before he got too far away. \u201cHow about a counter offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on which counter you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Ty answered warily as he looked from Zane\u2019s hand up to his eyes.</p><p>Zane tugged gently. \u201cHow about you shower with me, and then we\u2019ll both go get pizza?\u201d It was overt, Zane knew. An outright play for attention.</p><p>But now that he had Ty this close he didn\u2019t want to let him out of reach. He could feel the heat spiraling between them and all he wanted to do was stoke the flames.</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow and stepped closer with the tug. \u201cYou want me to shower with you?\u201d he asked in amusement. \u201cNeed help reaching your back, do you?\u201d he asked with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cAnd other places,\u201d Zane said, looking Ty up and down significantly.</p><p>\u201cI can go next door and ask the lady neighbor for her loofah,\u201d Ty teased gently. \u201cBubble bath, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever gets you in there with me,\u201d Zane responded earnestly.</p><p>\u201cSubtle, Garrett,\u201d Ty laughed softly. \u201cMan, you really did shed the fake layer, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he observed.</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cSomebody reminded me it was best to be myself,\u201d</p><p>he said seriously, tugging on Ty\u2019s arm again. \u201cHe seemed rather fond of me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have been a genius you were dealing with,\u201d Ty said cheekily as he remained a few steps away.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have to admit, he was pretty smart, though I teased him otherwise,\u201d Zane said, curling his arms back around Ty and relaxing as he moved closer. \u201cI regretted that, later. The teasing, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned and leaned back so he could look into Zane\u2019s eyes without going cross-eyed. \u201cOne of the advantages of teasing a man with a cracked head is that he doesn\u2019t remember it after,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Zane\u2019s face went still. \u201cHow much do you remember?\u201d he asked quietly, eyes filled with silent questions.</p><p>Ty licked his lips nervously and shrugged. He hated when people asked him that. He hated admitting when he couldn\u2019t recall something.</p><p>\u201cEnough that I know kissing me wasn\u2019t a really weird thing for you to do,\u201d he answered vaguely.</p><p>Rather than being surprised or confused, Zane looked disappointed.</p><p>So, Ty remembered they\u2019d had a good time. Sort of. But that was all, apparently. Zane nodded and offered a small, forced smile. At least he had that. It would do while he figured out how to make the longing for that fire between them to stop.</p><p>Ty watched his reaction carefully, confused by it. \u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d he asked in frustration. He had worked for weeks to regain the memories he had lost. He knew he was still missing quite a few, some that he would never get back, but until right then he hadn\u2019t come across any holes that had seemed important, either to him or to someone else.</p><p>Zane swallowed hard as he slid his hand to take Ty\u2019s and lace their fingers together. \u201cAre you feeling this, too?\u201d he asked, echoing what they\u2019d asked each other months ago, only to have it pushed aside. But not forgotten. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty watched their fingers intertwine, fighting back the fluttering in his stomach when Zane spoke. He jerked his head up sharply and met Zane\u2019s eyes. That one he did remember, although he had regretted that conversation for months, blushing furiously whenever he thought of it even when he was alone. He shook his head and swallowed. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered hoarsely, echoing the answer he had given before.</p><p>Slowly, Zane raised his other hand to cup Ty\u2019s reddening cheek. \u201cMe, either,\u201d he breathed before leaning forward to kiss Ty gently.</p><p>Ty groaned plaintively to break the kiss, and he took a step back to put some distance between them. \u201cJesus Christ, Zane,\u201d he muttered in exasperation. \u201cI was horrible to you. Why are you even here?\u201d</p> <p>Zane clamped down on the emotion swirling inside him, forcing himself to be as reasonable as he could. Some insane declaration would get them nowhere but upset and blustering. \u201cI missed you,\u201d he admitted hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cAll the damn time.\u201d</p><p>Instead of asking why in the hell Zane had missed someone who\u2019d been so shitty to him for the majority of their time together, Ty decided to accept it as a gift and shook his head, moving closer again. \u201cI missed you, too,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>A small smile pulled at Zane\u2019s lips as Ty stepped back into his reach.</p><p>\u201cMissed a pansy-assed poster boy?\u201d he teased as he pulled Ty to him.</p> <p>\u201cI had a head injury,\u201d Ty answered defensively, mumbling against Zane\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou called me that before the head injury,\u201d Zane needled.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Ty affirmed with a small smile against Zane\u2019s skin.</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips against him made Zane happier than he could remember being in some time. Four months\u2019 time, if he was honest, which he really tried to avoid.</p><p>Ty turned his head, breathing in Zane\u2019s scent. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to the shower idea,\u201d he suggested softly, pulling away gently again.</p><p>Zane kept hold of Ty\u2019s hand even as the other man backed away. He felt both relieved and scared, and it was a toss-up as to which was stronger.</p> <p>\u201cYour shower idea? Or my shower idea?\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted softly and looked back down at their joined hands. \u201cWhich do you prefer?\u201d he asked with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cMy idea,\u201d Zane admitted, tilting his head to one side as he raised their combined fists. \u201cBut that won\u2019t get me food anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned mischievously, acknowledging the obvious joke he could make and passing it over. \u201cTell you what,\u201d he murmured as he tugged at their hands and brought Zane closer. \u201cYou go shower, and I\u2019ll order pizza and change the sheets on the bed,\u201d he offered.</p><p>The purr started low in Zane\u2019s chest and built as he stepped right up against Ty for one more enveloping kiss. \u201cDeal,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Ty grinned against his lips and gently extricated himself. \u201cWhat do you want on your pizza?\u201d he asked as he moved away before Zane could snag him again.</p><p>\u201cAnything but onions and fish,\u201d Zane said as he reached for the jacket. \u201cI\u2019m gonna duck outside for a smoke first, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose things\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Ty admonished as he headed for the phone.</p> <p>Zane had the cigarette between his lips already as he headed for the back porch. \u201cI think the bullets will get me first,\u201d he said wryly as he stepped out and pulled the door shut behind him.</p><p>Ty stared after him for a moment, unsettled. He wasn\u2019t sure what it was about the situation that left him feeling odd. He sighed heavily and dialed the nearest pizza joint, placing the order and giving his phone number for delivery. Then he headed up the narrow stairs to the bedroom at the front of the little row house and began yanking the sheets off the bed. They smelled like the girl from the bar and expensive cigars and possibly Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade. Ty was a little hazy on the details. Regardless, Zane didn\u2019t really need to catch a whiff of any of those things.</p><p>Taking his time with the smoke, Zane stared off into the city that sprawled out down the hill from the roofs of the brownstones. He spent a few long minutes picking apart his own feelings\u2014why he felt simultaneously steadier and shakier than he had in months. Steadier, because he was with Ty.</p><p>It had to be. But just the implications shook him. He had no idea how he had become so dependent on the other man without even seeing it happening.</p><p>How did he do something about it? More importantly ... did he want to do something about it?</p><p>Christ. He shook his head. Zane didn\u2019t even know what \u201cit\u201d was. But he knew he was afraid it would disappear. He didn\u2019t want to watch Ty walk away again. He finished the cigarette, stubbed it out on the concrete, and dropped it into the planter that looked like it had been used for that purpose before. Zane briefly wondered who had been smoking out here if Ty was so against cigarettes, and he drew in a deep breath. He knew Ty\u2019s habits. It didn\u2019t bear thinking. Shower first. Then he\u2019d see what other emotions reared their heads. Hopefully they\u2019d be ones he understood.</p><p>He found Ty upstairs, searching for the spare set of sheets and muttering to himself as he rummaged through the top shelf of the closet.</p><p>Zane stopped in the doorway. \u201cTowels in here?\u201d he asked, taking in the length of Ty\u2019s body and pushing back the desire that revived inside.</p><p>Ty glanced over his shoulder and shook his head. \u201cBathroom,\u201d he answered. \u201cI was just looking for clean sheets.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and glanced into the closet briefly. He was surprised to see an old, beat-up motorcycle helmet sitting on the top shelf. He didn\u2019t say anything about it or even show that he saw it, but he looked at Ty curiously as he wandered away. The bathroom was easy to find. He stripped down, then frowned at the fresh bandage.</p><p>\u201cWell, damn,\u201d he muttered. He scrunched his nose. Might as well take it off. It would just get wet and sticky and gooey and that was just gross.</p><p>He pulled the tape as fast as he could, pleasantly surprised when it didn\u2019t take off too much skin. He turned on the water, poked at the side of the gouge again, and watched a thin stream of red trickle from the deepest cut of it.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think that\u2019s gonna hurt even more if I get it wet,\u201d he muttered to himself. He grabbed a washcloth from the counter and climbed into the shower, holding the cloth over his upper arm.</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d Ty\u2019s voice asked softly from the doorway.</p><p>Zane turned his chin to look through the clear shower curtain. Ty was a little wavy, but recognizable. \u201cI forgot about the bandage,\u201d Zane said. \u201cI took it off so it wouldn\u2019t get ... gloppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloppy,\u201d Ty echoed with a nod, as if that made perfect sense. \u201cNeed help?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave that a small smile and moved into the bathroom, pulling his buttoned shirt over his head and tossing it to the floor. He then slid out of his suit pants and briefs and left them on the ground as well before he stepped into the shower and gently pressed a hand to the rag over Zane\u2019s arm.</p><p>Once Ty held the cloth, Zane turned his back to the water and leaned his head into the spray, wetting down, running one hand through it to soak his hair. He let the hot water pour over his face, groaning quietly as it sluiced down over his shoulders and body. Without warning, Ty stepped into him and pushed him hard against the shower wall, kissing him hungrily as the water cascaded over them both.</p><p>Zane\u2019s groan didn\u2019t abate as it came out over Ty\u2019s lips. He wrapped his good arm around Ty and gave as good as he got; the sizzle popped inside him, just like every time before. He\u2019d craved it. He\u2019d tried the oblivion of alcohol and the high of drugs, but he\u2019d not been able to find anything to match this. Ty\u2019s touch was unique and irreplaceable. The idea stunned him, and he wavered a little, catching himself against the wall with one hand.</p><p>Ty murmured to him soothingly and pressed himself hard against Zane\u2019s body with a growl. Zane lowered his chin to rub his cheek against Ty\u2019s temple, flattening himself against the wall\u2014practically out of the water\u2014to keep Ty as close as possible. He shifted his hips, sliding his more-than-interested cock against Ty\u2019s wet thigh. Ty murmured quietly and bit down on Zane\u2019s lip, rocking his hips into Zane as his hands traveled down his wet body to slide around and grab his ass possessively. Gasping, Zane shifted into the rhythm of Ty\u2019s hips so they ground against each other. A hoarse moan from his throat echoed around them before being drowned out by the falling water.</p><p>Ty pulled away with a gasping pant suddenly, and he put his hand on Zane\u2019s chest and stepped back carefully in the shower stall. \u201cYou finish your shower,\u201d he rasped breathlessly. \u201cThen we\u2019ll do this right,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Reaching up to hold the cloth to his arm, Zane lifted glazed eyes to look at Ty as he dragged in breaths. He was flushed all over, both from the hot water and the attention.</p><p>Ty was obviously just as turned on as he was, chest heaving as he tried to regain his composure, and body on full alert as the water pounded down on him. \u201cWe may even eat first,\u201d he added with a crooked smirk.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the shower before I turn you around and fuck you right here,\u201d Zane warned in a growl.</p><p>\u201cPushy,\u201d Ty observed as he turned and stepped out of the shower, standing there for a moment to calm himself before he grabbed a thin robe and shrugged into it.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes and turned to the side, pressing his heated cheek to the cool tile while the water started to soak into the rag he held over his arm. What was it about Ty that made him lose control? Inhaling sharply as his arm twinged painfully, he merely dropped the rag and turned around to grab the soap and clean up.</p><p>By the time he was done, Ty had retrieved the pizza from an unimpressed delivery boy who was apparently used to people answering the door while soaking wet and still in a robe, and he\u2019d set a couple sodas out on the kitchen counter. As soon as he got out of the shower, Zane shook his jeans out and frowned at them. They were a mess. He just dropped them and wrapped the big towel around his waist. Wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d need clothes for that long.</p><p>He thumped down the steps to join Ty in the kitchen and groaned happily. \u201cPizza. Food of the gods.\u201d</p><p>Ty just gave him a crooked smile and pushed the pizza box in front of him. It didn\u2019t take long for them both to eat. Despite being hungry, they both wanted something else.</p><p>Finally, Zane got up from the stool, towel dipping precariously low on his hips, and took his empty drink can to the trash. Ty watched him as he finished his drink. Waiting.</p><p>One hunger fed, the greater one was almost overwhelming. Zane turned and walked back to Ty, took the can out of his hand and set it on the bar, and grabbed his chin. \u201cI want you on that bed, under me, now.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s body reacted instantly to the words. He licked his lips in anticipation and stood, pressing their bodies together. \u201cMissed me, huh?\u201d he wagered with a small smirk.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Zane murmured, pulling Ty closer. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than heroin.\u201d</p><p>Ty stopped short and cocked his head at Zane. \u201cNot sure that\u2019s a compliment,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Zane tipped his head to the side and sighed, not able to meet Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cI crave heroin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Christ,\u201d Ty groaned as he moved again and pushed away from Zane. He walked slowly to the sink counter, rubbing the back of his neck and grumbling to himself. \u201cYou know, you keep turning into a worse and worse idea.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed and shifted to sit on the nearest stool again. He leaned his elbows against the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, scrubbing at his face with one hand. \u201cAnd another addiction is just the thing I need, let me tell you.\u201d</p><p>Never mind that he feared this addiction was already rooted deep inside him.</p><p>Ty stood with his back to Zane, his hands flat on the sink top as he stared at the reflection of the overhead lights in the stainless steel. Being called an addiction was not sitting well with him, especially from an addict, and he began to worry about how Zane was seeing this arrangement. Ty lowered his head and frowned down at the drain. A lot of things occurred to him to ask of Zane at that point. The only thing Ty knew he could ask without making a damn fool of himself, though, was, \u201cAre you using?\u201d</p><p>Zane closed his eyes. \u201cOnly you,\u201d was the best answer, the answer he wanted to give. But it wasn\u2019t the correct answer, and he had no right to lie.</p><p>\u201cNothing hard core,\u201d he finally admitted. It had been a self-destructive couple of months, when he first got to Miami. He wondered if Ty would care.</p><p>Ty straightened and turned to stare at Zane. \u201cYou back on the bottle?\u201d</p><p>he asked neutrally.</p><p>Nothing other than a flat-out negative while steadily meeting Ty\u2019s eyes would convince him otherwise, and Zane couldn\u2019t do it. He shrugged a little. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked away and shook his head, walking to the steps wordlessly and heading to the second floor. Zane sighed as he sat in the kitchen before slowly getting up to follow. Ty retrieved the pair of sweatpants he had been wearing before he was called in to Burns\u2019 office, tossed his robe aside, and he was stepping into them when Zane topped the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said as soon as he heard Zane enter the room. \u201cYou won\u2019t mind if I have a drink,\u201d he said curtly as he brushed past Zane and headed downstairs for the kitchen again.</p><p>Zane sighed. That answered that question. \u201cBy all means,\u201d he said, going to the bathroom to put his briefs and dirty jeans back on and taking another look at the rip in his arm. He sniffed at it and ventured back down the narrow stairs to face Ty, who had retrieved a bottle from the refrigerator and was standing at the kitchen counter, drinking it as he played the bottle top over his fingers like it was a poker chip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane sat on the stool across from him, sliding a hand through his wet hair. \u201cNow what?\u201d he asked. It was a question that had many meanings.</p><p>\u201cWant a drink?\u201d Ty offered sarcastically.</p><p>Narrowing his eyes, Zane shook his head sharply. \u201cOnly when I\u2019m in for the night,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that makes it better,\u201d Ty responded in the same sarcastic tone.</p><p>\u201cWe all know the chicos in Miami sleep like babies.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s face went hard. \u201cWhy are you giving me shit over this if you don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I sound like a man who doesn\u2019t care?\u201d Ty asked, trying to keep the hostility out of his voice.</p><p>That brought Zane up short, and his sharp reply died in his throat. Ty sounded ... upset? He certainly looked angry. After four months apart, he was angry because Zane had started drinking and popping again. He didn\u2019t know what to say without going back into that dangerous emotional territory. \u201cSo you want me to leave off it again?\u201d he asked, voice even.</p> <p>Ty closed his eyes and snorted in exasperation as he lowered his head.</p><p>Rubbing his eyes and wincing, he shook his head and said, \u201cThat is sort of the idea of the whole being on the wagon thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I obviously have so much respect for the whole being on the wagon thing,\u201d Zane retorted, sliding off the stool and heading back upstairs to get his shirt. This wasn\u2019t going to go well, and he saw no reason to stick around for more abuse. He\u2019d made his decision at the time, and at the time it had made sense. The sound of Ty\u2019s beer bottle crashing against the nearest wall followed his exit.</p><p>Zane stopped midway up the stairs and turned to look down at Ty as the man stood in the middle of the kitchen. \u201cWhat the fuck is your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even care, do you?\u201d Ty asked heatedly as the wall dripped and fizzed with Hard Lemonade. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give a damn if you were killed down there.\u201d</p><p>Zane leaned his shoulder against the wall, tipping his head back to glare at the ceiling. What did you say to a question like that? The truth? \u201cWhy should I give a damn? I got the job done, and no one I worked with was hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Ty glared at him for a moment before lowering his head once more and placing his hands flat on the countertop to calm himself. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d</p><p>he finally said in a soft voice.</p><p>Anger flared again in Zane, and he wasn\u2019t of any mind to repress it.</p><p>\u201cSo now you\u2019re going to sit in judgment over four months of my life with no explanation? Fuck you, Grady.\u201d He stalked up the steps and into the bathroom. For a long moment there he\u2019d almost been convinced Ty did care.</p><p>\u201cYou told me,\u201d Ty called after him angrily, coming up the steps behind him, \u201chow long it had been since someone gave a damn about you!</p><p>You make it fucking impossible to do it!\u201d he shouted as he rounded on the bathroom door.</p><p>Zane froze, hands on the sink as he looked at the hurt that surfaced in his eyes and crossed his face despite his effort to swallow it down. After a tense silence he felt Ty standing nearby, and he said hoarsely, \u201cAdd four more months to the tally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going for a record?\u201d Ty asked heatedly. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t give a flying fuck about the people you were working with in fucking Florida.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Ty? \u2019Cause I\u2019ve changed my mind about four times about what I think you\u2019re saying,\u201d Zane snapped back before turning on him. \u201cI didn\u2019t give a shit about anybody for five years, and then when I did, I didn\u2019t do a damn thing about it slipping away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying,\u201d Ty answered in a slow, stubborn tone, \u201cthat I would be hurt if something happened to you.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s anger wilted, and he just looked at Ty while he stood there and ached inside. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Ty had nothing to say to that. He sighed heavily and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIs this going to interfere with what we have to do?\u201d he asked resignedly after a long moment of tense silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop with the drinking,\u201d Zane finally promised after a long pause, turning to pick his shirt up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cAnd your other ... addictions?\u201d Ty asked slowly.</p><p>Zane tilted his head, trying to stretch some of the tension out of his neck before looking back to Ty. \u201cI\u2019ll get it under control,\u201d he murmured, settling his dark eyes on Ty\u2019s body appraisingly.</p><p>Ty shivered slightly in the cool air of his bedroom, and he looked away toward the window and the small balcony. \u201cYou staying here tonight?\u201d</p><p>he finally asked in a beaten voice.</p><p>Looking up at himself in the mirror, Zane knew what his reply had to be, as much as he didn\u2019t want it to be. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll go on ahead and find somewhere for us to work,\u201d he said quietly. It would not be a good idea for him to stay so close to Ty. It was far, far too tempting, and he knew he\u2019d never be able to resist.</p><p>Ty sighed and rolled his head back and forth. \u201cHow \u2019bout this, then?\u201d</p><p>he said in exasperation. \u201cI would like for you to stay,\u201d he told Zane slowly.</p><p>Zane sighed and turned to walk over to Ty, sliding his arms around his waist and leaning to press their foreheads together abruptly. Ty had asked; Zane would go for broke. \u201cSo,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIs this one addiction I can indulge?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes closed as soon as they made contact, and he turned his head to the side and sighed softly as he slid his arms around Zane. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not one that\u2019ll kill you,\u201d he answered flatly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s mouth tipped up at the corners. He wasn\u2019t too sure he\u2019d say that. \u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Ty just nodded in response, not moving from the tentative embrace.</p><p>He rested his chin on Zane\u2019s shoulder and exhaled slowly. Zane squeezed his arms tentatively. \u201cNever a dull moment,\u201d he muttered. They\u2019d been flash and bang from the first moment they\u2019d met.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, if you weren\u2019t such a dick...,\u201d Ty murmured with a small smile.</p><p>Zane snickered. \u201cWorks out well since you\u2019re an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to talk about these puns.\u201d Ty groaned as he pulled away and shuffled slowly for the bed. Neither man was thinking of sex any longer. It was obvious from the slump of Ty\u2019s shoulders that he had exhausted what energy he had left on being pissed off.</p><p>\u201cMm hmm,\u201d Zane answered, following along. Some sleep wouldn\u2019t go unappreciated, depending on if he slept at all without several whiskey shots first.</p><p>\u201cNext bad pun you make I\u2019m kicking you in the shin. I don\u2019t care where we are,\u201d Ty threatened as he turned and raised his chin.</p><p>\u201cAh ah ah, you forget, pain is not an incentive for me to quit,\u201d Zane prodded, crossing his arms.</p><p>Ty responded with a swift kick to Zane\u2019s shin. Zane laughed and caught Ty around the waist, hefting him practically off his feet and swinging him around. Ty flailed gracelessly. A man of his size and demeanor was not accustomed to being tossed around like a rag doll, and it showed. Zane\u2019s size advantage was finally paying off. He snickered and let Ty get his feet under him. \u201cYou love it,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Ty snapped as he held to Zane for a moment longer to make sure he really was on the ground again. Zane kept his arms wrapped around him, and he leaned forward to nuzzle the side of Ty\u2019s neck. \u201cWell, that\u2019s ...</p><p>sort of embarrassing,\u201d Ty muttered almost to himself.</p><p>Zane grinned and pressed his face close so the other man couldn\u2019t see it and get cranky again. Ty simply let himself be cuddled with a resigned sigh.</p><p>Unable to hold back a yawn, Zane mumbled against Ty\u2019s skin, unwilling to move just yet.</p><p>\u201cBed, huh?\u201d Ty murmured as he finally wrapped his arms around Zane and patted him on the head.</p><p>Zane nodded, feeling drowsy for the first time in a long while without the help of copious amounts of alcohol.</p><p>\u201cTake off those nasty jeans before you get your ass in my clean sheets,\u201d Ty warned. Zane disrobed obediently as Ty watched him, leaving only his briefs to sleep in, then Ty stepped back and nodded for him to get into bed. \u201cFucking later,\u201d he promised with a tired smile.</p><p>Zane grunted at him and crawled over the foot of the bed and slid down to lay on his belly with a soft sigh, not even bothering to reach for a pillow. Ty stood watching him for a moment, then walked over to the door and flipped off the light before crawling in after him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be here?\u201d Zane asked sleepily, shifting one hand to just barely touch Ty\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not, look on the balcony,\u201d Ty answered softly as he rolled onto his side and slid his hand over Zane\u2019s back.</p><p>The other man hummed softly and dropped quickly off to sleep. With his eyes closed, the shadows and thinness of his face became more pronounced. Ty sighed softly as he looked over him.</p><p>There was an obvious familiarity to this situation. Except before, their roles had been reversed, and Ty hadn\u2019t yet been forced to resort to substances to keep his sanity. He reached up and ran his fingertips down the side of Zane\u2019s face with a frown. There wasn\u2019t much to be done for him, either, nothing that Zane wouldn\u2019t resent.</p><p>Zane managed to sleep a couple hours before the dreams and the shakes woke him with a startled gasp. He sat up quickly, reaching for the gun Z that wasn\u2019t there, looking around in confusion. The man in bed beside him groaned in response to the bouncing of the mattress and flopped onto his side. Seeing that, Zane remembered where he was and why, and his heart started to calm. He looked down at Ty, though he couldn\u2019t see much in the dark. He glanced to the clock and sighed. Two damn hours. He was wide awake now with little chance of more sleep.</p><p>He scooted up to lean against the headboard and stare off into the dark, trying to order his thoughts. A day ago, he would have hit a bottle. Now</p><p>... he pulled one knee up to his chest and sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s harder to go back to sleep when you\u2019re sitting up, numbnuts,\u201d Ty muttered sleepily without moving or opening his eyes.</p><p>A smile pulled at Zane\u2019s lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that, thanks,\u201d he murmured, reaching out to smooth a hand through Ty\u2019s hair. It was comforting to have him there, though Zane wouldn\u2019t have admitted it aloud.</p><p>Although, he figured, he\u2019d already said it in a way, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Ty swatted at him grumpily and muttered again, tossing an arm over Zane\u2019s lap as he sat there beside him. He rested his face against Zane\u2019s hip and sighed sleepily. Settling his hand in Ty\u2019s hair again, Zane petted him gently as he let his head loll back. No more drink; it would be hard to get to sleep at night, hard to gear down. He\u2019d probably be a worse mess in the morning, and Ty sure wasn\u2019t going to tolerate him popping pills to wake up and stay up. He winced. He should get that other tin out of his jacket before Ty had reason to find it.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d Ty muttered against his hip. \u201cAnd stop thinking about drinking.\u201d</p><p>Zane thumped his shoulder. \u201cBastard,\u201d he cursed quietly before allowing himself to slump. He stilled and calmed, looking at the dark shadow of the man curled up against him. It didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d spent enough time together all those months ago to have developed this sort of comfort, but it was there nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Ty muttered as he lifted his head and scooted back, patting the bed next to him.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said tiredly. It wouldn\u2019t work. As soon as he went back to sleep he\u2019d wake right back up. Too much time spent on a hair trigger. But he didn\u2019t want to keep Ty awake, so he slid down and turned to his side, facing him, and laid his head down.</p><p>\u201cRoll over,\u201d Ty ordered in a hoarse, sleepy voice as he slid his arm under Zane\u2019s head. He gave his shoulder a push for good measure.</p><p>Frowning, Zane let him push him to his back. Ty manhandled him until he was on his side again, facing away, and Ty snuggled against him. He wrapped his arm over Zane protectively and nuzzled his nose into Zane\u2019s hair with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he whispered soothingly, knowing if Zane didn\u2019t, then he wouldn\u2019t either. It was impossible for him to rest with a tense body next to him.</p><p>Zane laid there for a long moment, surprised, but he started to relax more as Ty held him close. It was ... indescribable. He could feel sleep encroaching again, and Zane hoped he might rest for a change.</p><p>He twitched slightly as he started to fall asleep; the warmth of Ty\u2019s body and the sound of his breathing eased Zane enough that he dozed off, feeling safer in Ty\u2019s arms than he had in a long time.</p><p>The next time one of the two men awoke, it was Ty, waking without moving. The morning light was seeping through the windows and he groaned softly. Zane still lay on his side, just where Ty had maneuvered him, deeply asleep with Ty wrapped around him. He hadn\u2019t even moved, much less woken up again. Ty extracted himself carefully and padded into the bathroom, making as little sound as possible. When he returned, Zane still hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>Ty slid back into the warm bed and up next to him. He slowly kissed his neck, nuzzling into the warm skin. Zane shifted slightly and his breath caught as he started to wake, recognizing the touch as out of the ordinary.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Ty murmured softly as he felt Zane stir. Zane hummed quietly, almost questioningly. \u201cWake up,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>Starting to move a bit, Zane drew in a deeper breath and turned his face up toward Ty, eyes still closed. \u201cTime to wake up already?\u201d he asked, voice soft and heavy with sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got an hour or so before we have to get out of bed,\u201d Ty answered as he continued to nuzzle against Zane\u2019s skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane made a few appreciative sounds and shifted closer to Ty. \u201cDon\u2019t wanna wake up ... this is nice,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWant to sleep a little longer?\u201d Ty asked in a softer voice.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Only if you stay,\u201d Zane murmured faintly, about to drop back off into a doze.</p> <p>\u201cIf I stay, I might do unseemly things to you,\u201d Ty warned in a low voice as his hand moved slowly down Zane\u2019s side.</p><p>The corner of Zane\u2019s mouth turned up. \u201cMmmm. As long as I\u2019m not dreaming it,\u201d he murmured, smoothing his hand down over the mattress in front of himself.</p><p>Ty scooted closer, pulling Zane back by his hip as he lifted himself up more. \u201cThis is becoming distracting,\u201d he informed Zane softly, lips moving against Zane\u2019s ear.</p><p>Zane laughed hoarsely and finally opened his eyes. \u201cThis?\u201d he asked, covering Ty\u2019s hand with his own, just to touch. Ty\u2019s fingers dug into Zane\u2019s hip slowly, and he flexed his hips against him.</p><p>\u201cWaking up like this every morning would have its perks,\u201d Ty murmured without thinking as he kissed at Zane\u2019s neck.</p> <p>Biting his lip, Zane tried to ignore how much that thought pleased him\u2014but he couldn\u2019t ignore the curl of desire. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Ty pushed up further and pulled Zane to lie flat on his back, kissing him languidly as his hand roamed up and down warm skin. Zane slid his arm over Ty\u2019s waist as he let him control the kiss. God, he could get used to this.</p><p>He wanted to get used to this.</p><p>Groaning softly, Ty straddled one of Zane\u2019s legs, pushing his knee between them and forcing them apart.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane encouraged, sliding his hands down Ty\u2019s back and gripping his ass, pulling their groins closer together. Ty growled and kissed him harder, insinuating himself between Zane\u2019s legs and sliding his hands under his shoulder blades to hold him still. Body relaxed and malleable from sleep, Zane moved as Ty moved, his mouth giving as Ty took, Zane\u2019s body quickening as he tried to rock against him.</p><p>Ty gasped softly into Zane\u2019s mouth and reached up to tangle one hand in his hair, sliding their groins together for the friction. The phone on the bedside table began to ring and vibrate demandingly, and Ty practically snarled at it before stealing another kiss. Zane\u2019s hands tightened on Ty. He wanted so much to say \u201cforget the phone, you\u2019re supposed to be fucking me,\u201d</p> <p>but he let the kiss end instead of lengthening it.</p><p>Ty stretched and reached for the phone, groaning as his hips pushed into Zane even harder, and he snatched the phone up and flipped it open.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he barked in answer as he settled back down over Zane\u2019s body. The voice on the other end was loud enough to almost be distinguished, and it was obviously female. Ty bent his head to nip at Zane\u2019s neck as he listened.</p><p>A hum rumbled in Zane\u2019s chest as he settled his hands on Ty\u2019s hips, giving him the angle to pull the other man against him as he slowly rutted against his body.</p><p>Ty reached again for the bedside table, letting the voice on the phone ramble on as he grabbed the drawer pull and yanked at it. He fumbled in the drawer, finally extracting a tube of lubricant and then a torn box of condoms.</p><p>He kissed Zane again, bringing the phone close enough to Zane\u2019s ear that he could hear a brief but heartfelt curse. Zane smiled against Ty\u2019s lips.</p><p>Obviously it wasn\u2019t critical enough to stop Ty from fucking him, so he couldn\u2019t care less that the person on the other end of the line was pissed off.</p><p>To help out, Zane lifted his hips and snagged his briefs with one hand, pushing them down to his thighs.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty whispered to him as he reached down to help, pushing the briefs further down and kissing him again. The phone fell from his hand and slid down the pillow, and he reached for the lubricant as he pushed Zane\u2019s legs further apart with his knee. Zane kicked the briefs to the side and spread his legs more to make room for Ty. His cock was already erect and standing.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t taken long, not with Ty touching him. It never did. As he sucked in a breath, he turned his head and could hear the feminine voice still talking.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d the little voice questioned angrily. \u201cTy! Are you even listening to me?\u201d it shouted.</p><p>Ty reached for the phone and put it to his ear again as he reached between Zane\u2019s legs with the other. \u201cListening,\u201d he grunted unconvincingly before moving the phone away from his mouth and kissing Zane again as he slid a finger inside him.</p><p>Biting his lip against a soft cry, Zane arched into Ty\u2019s hand, squeezing his eyes closed and gripping the sheets. Fuck, he wanted this so badly, and the fact that Ty was doing it despite the phone call just made him crazier. Zane lifted one hand to curl around himself, lightly running his thumb over the head of his aching cock.</p><p>Ty could barely form complex thoughts, much less deal with the woman on the other end of the phone. He wanted Zane and just Zane, and he wanted him right that minute. He slid another finger into him slowly, practically vibrating with the desire to go faster.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me an apology!\u201d the woman\u2019s voice shouted from the cell phone, and Ty dropped the phone again to grip Zane\u2019s hair and pull his head back roughly so he could bite at his neck. \u201cTy!\u201d the woman shouted.</p><p>Zane gasped for a breath, tipping his head back and clenching his hand into Ty\u2019s sides as he felt teeth scrape against his skin. Zane tightened his hold on his own cock, pleasure already lapping through him. It would only get better. The annoyed voice was a tiny buzz he couldn\u2019t be troubled to notice.</p><p>All his attention was on Ty\u2019s hands. And Ty\u2019s hands were going ever further, his fingers twisting wickedly inside Zane as he dragged his teeth down Zane\u2019s neck.</p><p>Another screaming demand from the woman on the phone caused Ty to pull up short and grab the phone. \u201cStacey, I\u2019ll call you back,\u201d he grated into the phone before hanging up and tossing it over his shoulder to land precariously on the edge of the bed at their feet. He bent to kiss Zane again, letting himself moan loudly with the contact.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. \u201cTy ... please,\u201d he whimpered.</p><p>As if to accentuate his point, the phone began to ring and vibrate at the end of the bed. Ty ignored it, instead focusing all his attention on Zane and preparing him for a nice, rough fuck. He kissed him hungrily as the phone hopped around angrily on the tangled bed covers, and he reached for the condom wrapper and ripped it open after pulling his fingers out and sliding the palm of his hand up the length of Zane\u2019s cock teasingly.</p><p>Zane choked down a cry as he felt Ty\u2019s hand on him, and he couldn\u2019t stop his hips from snapping up into Ty\u2019s hand. \u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed. \u201cFuck, Ty....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Ty rasped as he rolled the condom on and reached to tug at the back of Zane\u2019s thigh. The phone finally stopped ringing, and Ty kissed Zane again messily. Seconds later, Ty was pushing slowly into Zane\u2019s body as the landline began to ring.</p><p>Zane growled. \u201cWho the fuck is she?\u201d he demanded, keeping his hands on Ty, smoothing them over hard muscles. \u201cNever mind,\u201d he gasped as Ty moved inside him. \u201cShe just wants what I\u2019ve got.\u201d And he purposefully tilted his hips and rocked up to sink Ty deeper inside him.</p><p>Ty groaned, the sound close to a whimper as he pressed his lips to Zane\u2019s jaw and pushed harder.</p><p>Ty\u2019s voice on the answering machine could be heard from the kitchen, warning not to leave a message because he never returned them anyway, and then a loud beep sounded as Ty pushed up onto his hands and flexed his hips. \u201cDon\u2019t listen,\u201d he told Zane in a tight voice as he began to rock into him.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Zane breathed. \u201cYou think I can pay attention to anything but you?\u201d He struggled to focus on Ty moving inside him; he\u2019d been missing this for four months and now that he had it? He wasn\u2019t going to miss it anymore.</p><p>\u201cCome on, fuck me,\u201d he growled, fingers digging into Ty\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Ty obliged with a little growl, one hand going back to Zane\u2019s hair to hold him in place as he began to truly thrust into him. The bed rocked with their movements, the headboard groaning in time, and in the distance an angry female voice shouted into an answering machine. But Zane\u2019s ears were filled with the sound of his own heartbeat and Ty\u2019s panting gasps. He cried out Ty\u2019s name as he started to rock against him, intensifying the effect of the thrusts.</p><p>He snaked his hand back between them to pump his cock, and the shock waves multiplied.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes,\u201d Ty hissed as he buried his face in Zane\u2019s neck and used the muscles of his back and legs to thrust.</p><p>The motions made Zane arch his body, the slow, almost languid rocking driving him even more insane than any amount of frenzied pounding could have done. Under it all, he could hear the girl\u2019s voice, but he couldn\u2019t think about that right then. This felt too damn incredible to focus on anything else.</p><p>A low groan built in Zane\u2019s chest as he pulled at his cock, Ty\u2019s slow, rhythmic movement building the fire higher but not providing quite enough spark. \u201cTy...for God\u2019s sake ...have I got to beg?\u201d Zane asked helplessly, pulling his knees up to try to get Ty to move faster, thrust harder.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t answer him, instead speeding the rhythm of his thrusts with a grunt of effort.</p><p>Zane gasped out encouragement, throwing his head back as he felt the orgasm clenching inside him. He tightened his fist on himself. \u201cNot long...,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Garrett,\u201d Ty coaxed in a low, rumbling voice. \u201cCome all over me,\u201d he whispered against Zane\u2019s skin.</p><p>Zane\u2019s body started to tighten up, and his hand moved faster on himself. \u201cTy...,\u201d he hissed. And with another few thrusts, he jerked in place and yelled as he came, the hot liquid smearing between them with each pulse as he cried out each time, nearly delirious with pleasure.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and groaned, thrusting harder and grunting with each push of his hips. \u201cOne day,\u201d he ground out with difficulty, \u201cI\u2019m just going to sit in a corner and watch you jerk off,\u201d he promised as his belly rubbed against Zane\u2019s slick knuckles. Just the thought was enough to send him over the edge, and he tried to slow his movements to stave off the orgasm. But the friction from the slow rocking was still too much, and he came with a shout that was loud enough to drown out the final beep of the answering machine.</p><p>Zane\u2019s gut jerked again in reaction to Ty\u2019s words. Fuck, Zane would love that, to feel Ty\u2019s eyes on him. He moaned Ty\u2019s name long and low. Ty rocked through the torturous friction and finally collapsed with a small gasp, panting. The cell phone on the end of the bed began to vibrate and sing, dancing itself to the edge of the bed and then falling to the floor with a clatter.</p><p>Ty pushed up shakily and kissed Zane breathlessly, pulling out of him carefully and groaning as he did so. Zane clutched at him mindlessly, trying to pull him close again, but Ty rolled onto his side instead, pulling Zane with him. He kissed Zane one more time, almost gently, and then flopped onto his back. The phone ceased its singing somewhere on the floor at the end of the bed, and Ty sighed loudly and closed his eyes in relief.</p><p>\u201cI was with her night before last,\u201d he admitted in a low, breathless voice.</p><p>Sighing softly, Zane shifted to lie against Ty\u2019s side, settling his cheek on his upper arm. He thought idly about how much more cut Ty seemed to be now. He didn\u2019t look different, but he felt harder somehow. Perhaps Zane had just been too caught up before to notice the changes. He could imagine that Ty had had very little to occupy himself with other than physical endeavors, though. He remembered well what it was like on medical leave, under orders not to do anything mentally \u201cstrenuous.\u201d The only thing left to someone as active as Ty was physical.</p><p>\u201cHope it was better than what I did that night,\u201d Zane murmured absently, his mind turning to the gunshot wound that now throbbed angrily.</p><p>Ty turned his head slightly and rested his chin against Zane\u2019s head as he wrapped his arm around him carefully. He didn\u2019t say anything, knowing that everything coming to mind would either really piss Zane off or be a lie.</p><p>Zane lay just breathing for a while, and finally he smiled. \u201cSit in a corner and watch me jerk off?\u201d he drawled. \u201cMy, my.\u201d</p><p>Ty blushed slightly, though in the early morning light it wasn\u2019t entirely noticeable. \u201cSounds fun,\u201d he explained shortly.</p><p>\u201cMmmm. I agree,\u201d Zane murmured as he turned his lips to Ty\u2019s skin and stretched out against him. He sighed, the sound muffled against Ty\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat is it about you that makes me want to chuck everything and just fuck you again?\u201d he asked seriously.</p><p>Ty blinked in surprise and turned his head slightly. \u201cMust be the Old Spice,\u201d he joked weakly. Zane snorted and shook his head, though he did turn his head to inhale the scent of Ty\u2019s sweaty skin. \u201cI don\u2019t know, then,\u201d Ty murmured more seriously with a tilt to his chin.</p><p>Zane went quiet for a long moment, but there wasn\u2019t anything he felt like he could say without sounding like an absolute fool. The nerves were creeping back, and he could feel the shakes threatening. He rolled to his back, lifting both hands to rub at his face before having to curl them into fists because they were shaking visibly. Damn damn damn. He\u2019d hoped he\u2019d have a little longer before the cravings hit. And he couldn\u2019t drink when it was time to get to work. \u201cWe need to get going,\u201d he murmured faintly. He winced as it came out sounding totally weak.</p><p>Ty lay still for a moment, nonplussed by the sudden change in subject. \u201cYeah,\u201d he finally agreed with a grunt as he rolled and swung his feet over the edge of the bed. He hefted himself up and shuffled to the bathroom to clean up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane watched Ty walk away with a swirling of confusing emotions.</p><p>Fuck, he needed a hit. Flipping his legs out of the bed, Zane headed downstairs, first to the little bathroom under the steps, then to his jacket. He had to get rid of the damn pills or he\u2019d be popping them like crazy\u2014and that would make it so much harder to control himself around Ty. Not to mention royally pissing Ty off.</p><p>Ty heard the rustle of the sheets as Zane slipped out, and he stood in front of the bathroom mirror with the damp cloth and waited a few moments before giving into the suspicion and following silently. He took his time getting into his briefs and jeans, hoping he wouldn\u2019t find Zane doing what he thought he was doing. The fact that he was already jonesing was pretty obvious, and Ty knew enough addicts to know that Zane\u2019s stash would be close.</p> <p>Zane rifled through the jacket and found the tin he carried the pills in.</p><p>He didn\u2019t open it, just tapped the tin nervously on the leather sleeve, again trying to make himself get rid of them. He was still there when Ty came up behind him and leaned quietly against the kitchen counter. Zane was so wrapped up in his internal struggle that he didn\u2019t hear Ty, and the tin kept tapping nervously, speeding up, slowing down, speeding up.</p><p>Ty watched him silently, frown deepening as Zane continued to visibly struggle with himself.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hand shook as it curled around the tin, and he closed his eyes.</p><p>He could give it up. He could. It wasn\u2019t his body that wanted the drug. It was his head. He took a deep breath, opened his eyes, and turned, freezing in place when he saw Ty there. Ty met his eyes emotionlessly and then slowly looked down at the tin in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cMints?\u201d he asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s jaw clenched and then relaxed again. \u201cBit early for those, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Zane debated explaining\u2014for about two seconds. Instead, he reached out and grabbed Ty\u2019s hand. He set the tin in his palm, curled his fingers over it, and then brushed past him, heading upstairs to the bathroom. Ty watched him go, then looked back down at the tin and pursed his lips. With a sigh, he slid it into his back pocket and headed back up to the bedroom to start getting packed.</p><p>Zane turned on the cold water in the shower and sank down to sit on the edge of the bathtub, cursing himself. It should be easier than this. He\u2019d quit before, and it had been much more hard-core shit. These poppers were no big deal.</p><p>He climbed into the shower. So why did he feel like he had so much more to lose? The craving for the drugs echoed through his head, the urge to find a drink curled in his gut, and the wish for a cigarette set his fingers to twitching. God, he\u2019d fucked himself up. At the time he hadn\u2019t cared anymore.</p> <p>He\u2019d figured he wouldn\u2019t last long enough for it to be a problem. Body shaking, he leaned against the wall, fighting for control.</p><p>Not much more was said between the two of them until they were at the airport waiting for the commercial flight Ty had hastily booked. They sat in the lounge area of the airport bar and watched CNN, Ty rapping his fingers on the table impatiently.</p><p>Zane had been shaky and distracted all morning, nervous and tense as he waited for the other shoe to drop. He was just as twitchy from coming off the drugs as wondering what Ty might do about it. He knew there was nothing he could do to change Ty\u2019s opinion about them, and that was what still bothered him; that he\u2019d damaged Ty\u2019s opinion of him. For Ty\u2019s part, he hadn\u2019t even alluded to the pills Zane had handed over.</p><p>Finally, after half an hour of delay and being too restless to keep quiet any longer, Ty looked from the television mounted in the corner of the bar to Zane and tilted his head. \u201cGot any preferences as to where we stay in the city?\u201d he asked flatly.</p><p>Zane blinked, pulled out of his thoughts. He glanced to Ty and shrugged. \u201cSomewhere ... unpredictable. Queens, maybe,\u201d he mused. \u201cOr Chinatown.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and sipped at his orange juice. \u201cGood idea,\u201d he responded, unable to think of anything further to say to the man.</p><p>When Ty went quiet again, Zane fell back into thought, trying to focus on his memories about the case, pushing aside his worries. He wasn\u2019t having much success, though, especially with the seeming party in the bar across the room. He winced when a raucous group clanged bottles together.</p><p>God, he didn\u2019t want to be here. He wanted to be back at Ty\u2019s apartment, curled up and warm like early this morning.</p> <p>Ty sat and watched without emotion. He sighed and looked down at his watch, knee bouncing restlessly. \u201cYou can still step away from this case,\u201d</p><p>he said to Zane softly.</p><p>Zane raised his eyes to meet Ty\u2019s. \u201cThe case isn\u2019t the problem. I\u2019m the problem,\u201d he murmured, shifting to set his elbows on his knees.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my problem,\u201d Ty reminded.</p><p>\u201cYour problem?\u201d Zane asked, frowning a little.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t get your shit together, then you\u2019re my problem,\u201d Ty clarified. \u201cWe established before this isn\u2019t a job that can be done alone.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s face went still and he sat up, averting his eyes toward the windows. \u201cI\u2019ll have it together,\u201d he said gruffly. It wouldn\u2019t be pretty inside, but he\u2019d deal with that when he came to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so afraid of?\u201d Ty asked suddenly.</p><p>Dark eyes going bleak, Zane didn\u2019t know if he could explain the answer to himself, much less to Ty. \u201cI....\u201d He pressed his lips together and tried humor. \u201cAfraid of embarrassing myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t buy that,\u201d Ty replied after a moment of thought. He cocked his head and looked Zane over carefully. \u201cWhat is it? Dying? Being alone?</p><p>Dying alone?\u201d he ventured sarcastically. \u201cAt least those are legitimate things to be afraid of,\u201d he added before Zane could answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of dying,\u201d Zane murmured. It was the complete opposite, actually. He was afraid that it would be someone else doing the dying. Wasn\u2019t that just all sticky and sentimental, he thought darkly, sending his mood even further down.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Garrett,\u201d Ty murmured as he leaned closer. \u201cIf we can fuck each other senseless, we can be honest with each other.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes shifted sideways to meet Ty\u2019s and they shifted away just as quickly. When he spoke, it was a bare whisper. \u201cYou remember when I said I didn\u2019t give a shit about anybody for five years? And how that had changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Ty answered questioningly. At the time, he had thought Zane had been referring to the wife he\u2019d lost, but now in this new context he had a sinking feeling that he had been wrong.</p><p>A sad smile twisted Zane\u2019s lips. \u201cBecky was killed five years ago,\u201d he mentioned, seemingly offhand.</p><p>\u201cThat was your wife,\u201d Ty said carefully, getting a little more confused.</p><p>\u201cYes. I never thought I\u2019d care about anyone after her,\u201d Zane answered quietly. \u201cWe\u2019d been married almost ten years. It was like half of me was suddenly gone. I can\u2019t explain it any other way.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded slowly, sliding his plastic bottle top on the table restlessly.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he invited.</p><p>Christ. Zane felt like an idiot. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about anybody, even myself. And when I did....\u201d Zane\u2019s jaw clenched, and he kept his eyes focused on the window. Anything but on the man sitting across from him. \u201cI let him walk away.\u201d</p><p>Without even really realizing it, Ty had produced the tin of pills in his hand as Zane spoke. He tapped the hollow tin almost angrily. \u201cSo, this is you,\u201d he said with a rap, \u201cpining over someone you let get away.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced over at the table in surprise, seeing the small tin. He looked up at Ty in shock and realized that Ty either hadn\u2019t caught the meaning of his words or simply didn\u2019t apply them to himself. Although he felt relieved, he also felt worse than before. He stared at the tin. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have brought those here.\u201d Avoid the question. Avoid the question. Forget about the question, Ty. You don\u2019t want to know the answer.</p><p>Ty merely looked at him blankly. \u201cFigured if you kept this up, I might need them,\u201d he finally snapped.</p><p>\u201cGoddamnit,\u201d Zane hissed, hand flashing out to scoop up the tin. \u201cIt\u2019s you, you asshole,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s me?\u201d Ty demanded defensively. \u201cGive those back,\u201d he added with a hiss and a motion of his hand.</p><p>Zane leaned over and grabbed the front of Ty\u2019s shirt, yanking him forward. \u201cYou are the one who walked away,\u201d he growled before shaking him slightly and pushing him back into the chair.</p><p>Ty\u2019s chair rocked precariously before righting itself again, but Ty never seemed to notice as he stared at Zane with shocked hazel eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>he asked stupidly, his voice hoarse and slightly higher than normal.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Zane muttered, getting to his feet and pocketing the tin. \u201cI need a drink.\u201d He stalked off toward the bar. What a fucked-up situation.</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Ty barked after him.</p><p>Zane stopped dead in his tracks just four steps away, his body jerking itself to a halt in response to Ty\u2019s commanding voice. He slowly straightened his shoulders and turned his chin to indicate he was listening.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a drink,\u201d Ty said to him in slow, measured words.</p><p>Inhaling sharply, Zane held his breath for a long moment as he closed his eyes and dropped his head. His hands slowly rose to burrow into the pockets of the leather jacket, and he just stood there. So, what now? Go forward? Go back? He wished again for the oblivion of too much alcohol\u2014</p><p>but Ty\u2019s words echoed through him, and he stayed in place.</p><p>\u201cLet me have those pills,\u201d Ty requested after a moment of tense silence.</p><p>Zane turned automatically, walked back, and held out the tin, looking everywhere but at Ty. Ty took it, eyes on Zane and piercing through him. He slipped the tin into a pocket inside his canvas jacket and then shifted in his chair. With a long sigh he closed his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying ... what?\u201d he murmured finally with a wave of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane was quick to insist. \u201cI\u2019m saying that I figured out I cared about what happened to you and then let you walk away,\u201d he answered stubbornly. He had no idea about loving Ty. The whole concept scared the absolute shit out of him, and he simply refused to even consider the possibility. He could care about his partner, though, right? No harm in that.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty responded slowly, nodding his head. \u201cSo now you\u2019re either trying to push me away or you\u2019re trying to self-destruct,\u201d he ventured.</p><p>\u201cMaybe both,\u201d he shrugged as he continued to stare at Zane, waiting for eye contact. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t get is why.\u201d</p><p>Zane gritted his teeth, then his shoulders and demeanor sagged, and he just looked exhausted. He looked up, and his eyes were filled with resignation. \u201cCan\u2019t exactly pull you closer, can I?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>There was a long, tense moment of silence as Ty met Zane\u2019s eyes emotionlessly. \u201cMaybe not in public,\u201d he answered finally.</p><p>Zane stared at him, silent, and he shook his head minutely. Was Ty joking at his expense? He sounded inexplicably solemn.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Ty warned, lowering his head slightly and looking up at Zane with narrowed eyes and a barely perceptible twitch of his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t grope me in public.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked and flinched a little, totally surprised. This wasn\u2019t at all what he\u2019d expected in the way of reply from the man sitting in front of him.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he replied, brow furrowed. He still wasn\u2019t sure that Ty wasn\u2019t yanking his chain. Christ. All Zane wanted was to be able to fuck Ty and make sure the man didn\u2019t get killed. Wasn\u2019t that simple enough?</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty repeated with a nod. He looked around the airport lounge and then back up at Zane towering over him. \u201cYou\u2019re drawing some attention,\u201d he informed his partner casually.</p><p>Still not sure what had just happened, Zane shook his head, turned in place, and headed for the men\u2019s room. No liquor, no uppers, and a crackjob partner who Zane couldn\u2019t keep his hands off of. Well, fine. They were just getting used to each other again, right? The insanely satisfying and addictive sex was just a bonus. Anything else he felt was shoved away as far as he could push it.</p><p>Left alone, Ty rolled his eyes and sagged his shoulders as Zane walked away. It was far more difficult to deal with Zane when he didn\u2019t have the heart to be an asshole to him.</p><p>Zane got to the bathroom and splashed his face with cool water, looking up at his face and the dark circles under his eyes. One night of sleep did not make up for months of deprivation. He realized how shitty he looked; why hadn\u2019t he noticed before? He almost looked like death warmed over. No wonder Ty was worried. Zane splashed more water on his face. He had to get this shit out of his head or he was going to go insane over it.</p><p>As he stood over the sink, the loudspeakers in the ceiling crackled to life and announced that the flight he and Ty were awaiting was now boarding.</p><p>After one last breath, Zane grabbed some paper towels, dried his face and hands, and left the bathroom to rejoin Ty.</p><p>As soon as they got into their seats, Ty turned to Zane with a small frown. \u201cWhen Burns called you for this, did he ask you if you\u2019d been following the case?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane answered as he pulled out the seat belt and messed with it. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Zane raised a brow as he glanced over at his partner. \u201cI told him no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him the truth?\u201d Ty pressed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane frowned. \u201cYes. I\u2019d been buried in the barrio for almost fourteen weeks. I hadn\u2019t heard or read anything that wasn\u2019t in Spanish in at least that long.\u201d He moved in the seat, trying to stretch out his long legs.</p><p>Ty nodded. That was the answer he\u2019d expected. \u201cI lied,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Ty answered with a shrug. \u201cIt was the first thing that came out. He asked if I\u2019d been following, and I said no before I even thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after you said it?\u201d Zane prodded.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t look back,\u201d Ty answered immediately. He produced a thin leather binder and handed it over to Zane.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Zane asked in surprise as he took the portfolio and looked at it warily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the clippings I kept about the case when I was in the hospital and after,\u201d Ty answered as he crossed his arms over his chest defensively and shifted in his seat.</p> <p>Zane looked up in surprise. \u201cYou kept up with it the whole time?</p><p>Why would you do that? With all the mess in your head you were trying to straighten out?\u201d He clearly remembered the look on Ty\u2019s face when they\u2019d seen that girl hanging in the window.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being outsmarted,\u201d Ty answered in a soft, determined voice. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like feeling guilty,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Zane raised his head and looked at him seriously. He\u2019d taken for granted that a man like Ty would be able to shrug off the past easily. His behavior and his attitude all implied that he lived in the here and now, but Zane knew him well enough now to see that he took everything to heart, especially his failures. And Zane knew Ty considered that woman\u2019s death his fault. The killer never would have set his sights on her if Ty hadn\u2019t led him to her. Suddenly, whatever Ty had collected in that binder seemed very important to Zane. It would tell him about more than just the case. It would tell him about Ty, about the man he thought he could care deeply for.</p><p>\u201cI highlighted some bits. Underlined and ... scribbled. I was cooped up,\u201d Ty muttered defensively.</p><p>Zane tipped his head, eyes warming, and he smiled slightly. \u201cOkay,\u201d</p> <p>he said quietly, trying not to laugh. He schooled his features and looked back down at the portfolio solemnly. \u201cAnything I should know before looking?\u201d he asked, sliding his hand over the leather.</p><p>Ty pursed his lips and then nodded his head. \u201cThe last murders were....\u201d He seemed to hesitate, unsure of how to continue. Zane frowned worriedly. \u201cThey found them in the morgue,\u201d Ty told him hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cThe morgue?\u201d Zane asked with a sudden drop in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>\u201cThe ME and her assistant,\u201d Ty answered as he lowered his head.</p><p>Zane\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cKaren? What the hell?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t look up, merely kept his head bowed as if it was somehow his fault. Zane looked back down at the binder with dread, then opened it and turned it to look over the first page. The articles weren\u2019t in any sort of order.</p><p>They were merely put in as Ty had found them.</p><p>The first page, however, was about the woman. It detailed her discovery with all the gory relish of the popular press, and Ty knew it word for word. He looked away from the photograph included of Isabelle St. Claire in her airline uniform. \u201cThe way she was found,\u201d he said in a hoarse voice,</p> <p>\u201cmade me start thinking the way the bodies were found was even more important than we thought it was.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced up at him before going back to the article. \u201cGo on,\u201d he invited.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really the victims he\u2019s after,\u201d Ty conjectured. \u201cIt\u2019s the situations,\u201d he went on with a point at the next page. \u201cHis vics have to fit the situation he\u2019s after, but other than that he doesn\u2019t care who they are. He went after the ME and her assistant next.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced up at him with a wince.</p><p>Ty nodded grimly. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t in the same manner as the agents he killed, or like us or the other people he was trying to merely get rid of. It wasn\u2019t like they stumbled across him as he was doing something. It was methodical. I think they were planned victims, killed in the morgue for some reason,\u201d he said with emphasis.</p><p>Flipping through the pages, Zane stopped on that article, seeing the picture of the dark-haired woman they\u2019d worked with. He shook his head. Ty must have done this just in the last few days, right before he got the call from Burns. He was still keeping up, somehow. Zane\u2019s chest hurt with the thought.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThey were locked in the autopsy lab. But why?</p><p>You\u2019re right; there\u2019s something off about it. Always before, there\u2019s some sort of odd positioning. They were just there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. In the morgue. I started looking back at the other ones. The first with the meth guy found in his bed. The second with the hooker found in the graveyard, which happens to be one of the most elite burial grounds in the city,\u201d he added with a point of his finger at the binder. \u201cThen the two girls with the dyed hair who were switched in each other\u2019s beds. I don\u2019t think it mattered how they were killed or who they were. Just how they were found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the guy with the bird flu? Or the twins that looked like a mutual execution? What was off about them?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty sighed heavily and shook his head, looking out the window as the plane began to taxi down the runway. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with my theory,\u201d</p><p>he admitted. \u201cThe twins were the ones that were killed across state lines. They were the reason the FBI was brought in at all. That is the importance of their location. But aside from that? There wasn\u2019t anything special about where or how they were found, just what they were killed with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one man with a rare disease and the others with their own twin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh. Nothing else stands out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than they were different from all the others,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Ty muttered as he looked out the window diligently. \u201cThere\u2019s an answer there, but I\u2019m just not seeing the big picture,\u201d he added in frustration.</p><p>Zane kept paging through the binder quietly, reviewing the older cases and then reading up on what had happened since.</p><p>A shiver ran through Ty and he closed his eyes and bowed his head again. \u201cI hate knowing this fucker is smarter than I am,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Zane\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cHe\u2019s not smarter than you,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cHe just has inside information.\u201d</p><p>Ty sneered at that bit of logic and snorted. \u201cYou saying he\u2019s the kid in class with the teacher\u2019s copy of the textbook?\u201d he asked wryly as his knee began to bounce restlessly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s easy to beat the other kids\u2019 test scores when you have the answer key,\u201d Zane pointed out.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and rubbed them. \u201cStill doesn\u2019t mean the other kids have to like it,\u201d he muttered as the engines roared and the plane lifted off.</p><p>ONCE they arrived in New York, a brief discussion established that they would contact Tim Henninger at the Bureau. It was fairly safe and probably the most expedient way of going about things. He\u2019d risked his neck to help them before, and despite Ty\u2019s inherent lack of respect for the kid, they both trusted him in their own ways.</p><p>When they called him, he sounded almost happy to hear from them.</p><p>Ty could practically hear him vibrating over the phone as he asked where they wanted to meet.</p><p>When Henninger arrived at the diner, Zane was eating as Ty drank a glass of juice. They sat on the same side of the table, Zane somewhat sprawled in the booth, Ty sitting up straight and slightly stiff. Henninger blinked at them, noticing the outward changes; Zane\u2019s scruff set off by Ty\u2019s more polished, professional look. For the first time, it was easy to see the former Marine in the FBI agent.</p><p>\u201cGuys, it\u2019s great to see you,\u201d Henninger said quietly as he slid into the booth across the table from them, looking at them in mild confusion. He leaned closer, looking at them both oddly. \u201cBut why are you back?\u201d he asked with a frown.</p><p>Ty gave Zane a glance and then looked back at Henninger seriously.</p><p>\u201cThey wanted someone who could fly under the Bureau radar, as it were. And the ... the general feeling was that the killer...missed us,\u201d he answered hesitantly.</p><p>Henninger\u2019s dark eyes lit up with amusement, and he smiled and nodded as he laughed softly. The smile gave him an entirely different look, one that Ty probably would have found appealing in other circumstances. \u201cIt would appear that he did,\u201d Henninger said with some amusement as the waitress sauntered over to take his order. \u201cSo, you\u2019re here to draw him out?\u201d</p><p>he went on after he ordered. \u201cIf you\u2019re under the radar, how do you plan to make yourself known to him?\u201d</p><p>Ty just frowned. That wasn\u2019t exactly why they were here, but it made a certain kind of sense when put that way. If the killer had gone silent because they had abandoned the case, then it stood to reason that their mere presence would kick him back into doing something stupid. That also meant that their mere presence might cost someone else their life.</p><p>Zane pushed a bite of waffle around on the plate in front of him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly the plan,\u201d he murmured half to himself.</p><p>\u201cBut you hope to catch the killer\u2019s attention?\u201d Henninger asked as he watched Zane\u2019s fork distractedly.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want his attention,\u201d Zane answered carefully. \u201cWe want him. Tell us about the cases. We\u2019ve both been out of the loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d Henninger responded with wide eyes, looking back and forth at them. \u201cSo you don\u2019t know anything about the last two murders?\u201d he asked, his brow creasing.</p><p>Ty shook his head in answer, lips pressed tightly together.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t even tell you about the other agents?\u201d Henninger asked them in disbelief.</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cJust the basics,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>Henninger looked between them, clearly surprised. Ty stared back at him, not appearing at all fazed.</p><p>\u201cThe murders when he resurfaced, medical examiner Karen Bryce and her assistant, Mina Holmes,\u201d Henninger told them regretfully. \u201cThey found the two of them in the morgue, locked inside. Looked like a nasty, bloody fight. Karen\u2019s throat was cut, and Mina had been strangled.\u201d</p><p>Zane cursed quietly and looked away, fighting back the desire to throw something.</p><p>Henninger frowned. \u201cHow do they expect us to make progress on finding this guy if we keep starting over? I mean, you got pulled right in the middle of things. You hadn\u2019t been killed yet; you were ahead of the curve,\u201d</p><p>he pointed out wryly. His eyes shifted back and forth between the two, still puzzling over the changes in them.</p><p>\u201cThat knock on my head was a bit worse than we thought at first,\u201d Ty answered shortly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t making much sense there at the end.\u201d</p><p>Henninger watched him silently for a moment, frowning and pursing his lips. Finally, he seemed to accept that and sat back.</p><p>Zane pushed his plate away, unable to eat any more after the news about Karen. \u201cThe Bureau has pretty much accepted that he\u2019s one of us now, right? Has anyone done anything about security in the offices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from more locked doors in the building and lengthier pass codes? Not really,\u201d Henninger answered with a shake of his head. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to spook him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ,\u201d Zane spit out under his breath, sitting back with a thump and crossing his arms.</p><p>Henninger boggled at them. \u201cWhat\u2019d you two do? Switch brains?\u201d</p><p>Ty sat silently and glared at the kid, remembering why he might have disliked him. Zane\u2019s glare matched Ty\u2019s, and Henninger shrank back a little.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cThis is what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Zane bit off after a little more glaring. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get us all the case files\u2014the originals, not copies\u2014</p><p>and the personnel files we were working before. I want the manifest lists from evidence, including everyone who\u2019s touched every single piece, and everyone who\u2019s filed a single piece of paper in this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have clearance from on high this time,\u201d Ty added. \u201cNo sneaking required.\u201d</p><p>Henninger blinked, looked vaguely worried, and opened his mouth to utter a very obvious word, but caught it just in time. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know, do I?\u201d</p><p>Ty just shrugged and looked back down at his untouched food.</p><p>\u201cJust get it. Then call us when it\u2019s together, and we\u2019ll meet again to pick it up. You\u2019ve got my number.\u201d Zane scooted out of the booth and stood up, pulling a wad of cash out of his pocket and tossing a twenty on the table.</p><p>Henninger watched him rise with a slightly stricken look and then looked back at Ty, who was still sitting and staring at him blankly. \u201cI kind of liked him better when he was you,\u201d Henninger grumbled to him.</p><p>Ty gave him a weak, sympathetic smile and slid out of the booth.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes and nudged Ty to get moving. Ty nudged him back, hard, and snarled at him as they left the restaurant. Henninger turned in his seat and watched them go, frowning at them thoughtfully.</p><p>Zane pulled out a cigarette and lit up as soon as they were outside. \u201cI still don\u2019t like him,\u201d he said as they started walking.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, still?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a puppy dog. Didn\u2019t we have this conversation?\u201d Zane said around his cigarette. He stopped at the curb to wait for the light to change. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you had a problem with him?\u201d Ty questioned.</p><p>\u201cAt first I didn\u2019t, but I think that\u2019s because I was so wrapped up in being annoyed with you,\u201d Zane admitted. \u201cBut damn, he\u2019s eager. I was never that shiny.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave Zane a sidelong glance and shrugged. \u201cGuess that depends on who you ask,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Zane looked at Ty with narrowed eyes. \u201cYou met a caricature. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s still fun to watch you get all puffy over it,\u201d Ty laughed softly, a glimmer of the man Zane had first met shining through in his eyes.</p><p>Chuckling as they crossed the street, Zane smiled and winked at Ty.</p><p>\u201cYou just like to poke and poke and get me riled up,\u201d he said with a purposeful double meaning.</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Ty said with a grin, and then he stopped suddenly and kicked Zane in the shin.</p> <p>\u201cOw!\u201d Zane cried, though he was laughing slightly in surprise as Ty turned back around and began walking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna start wearing steel-toed boots,\u201d Ty said over his shoulder.</p><p>Zane snorted as they walked. He stopped without warning as he glanced across the street. \u201cOooh\u2014detour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked in confusion as he turned and then followed Zane\u2019s line of sight worriedly.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Zane ordered. He actually sounded happy all of a sudden.</p><p>He pulled Ty along to the corner and then crossed to the other side of the street and walked partway back up to stop in front of the classy storefront window of a privately owned bookstore.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked again as he looked up at the hand-carved sign.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about this place,\u201d Zane said, looking up at the sign. \u201cIt\u2019s all mysteries, suspense, thrillers....\u201d He nearly bounced in place.</p><p>\u201cDo you not get enough of that shit in your real life?\u201d Ty asked with a roll of his eyes. \u201cCome on,\u201d he ordered as he turned away. \u201cI don\u2019t do books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do. Get an espresso or something,\u201d Zane said, pulling open the door and going inside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do espressos,\u201d Ty called after him stubbornly. As he stood outside the doors, his shoulders slumped, and soon he obediently followed Zane into the store.</p><p>Zane was already browsing on a table marked \u201cOld Favorites\u201d when Ty stepped through the door. Quiet jazz played in the background, and a slim, white-haired man with spectacles sat behind the counter reading. A full coffee and espresso bar was set up to the side, steaming gently.</p><p>Ty forced himself not to groan. He hated these fucking places. Give him McDonald\u2019s black coffee and a copy of Guns and Ammo to read on the john and he was set. He didn\u2019t even like coffee.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re a man of action rather than one of reflection,\u201d the old man said out of the blue, his twinkling eyes looking over the glasses.</p> <p>Ty was slightly surprised to be addressed, but he recovered quickly enough to respond with, \u201cI\u2019m prone to paper cuts.\u201d</p><p>The man chuckled and closed his book, using a tasseled bookmark.</p><p>\u201cYour friend is happy to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s happy to be anywhere,\u201d Ty grumbled with an unfavorable glance at Zane.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he\u2019ll be better company the rest of the day. Coffee?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and glanced at Zane again with a frown. \u201cYou can keep him,\u201d he told the man in a grumble as he checked his watch.</p><p>Lifting his teacup, the man took a sip and looked over at Zane speculatively. \u201cIt changes one\u2019s appearance so, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up at the old man in confusion and then glanced over at Zane again. The agent was practically beaming, another Jekyll and Hyde turnabout in five minutes flat. Ty watched him for a long moment, blinking in surprise at the twist in his chest. Finally, he gave the old man another look and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself to a seat,\u201d the old man offered.</p><p>Ty sighed and moved closer cautiously to take the chair. He realized that he wasn\u2019t used to people addressing him at all, especially strangers. Most everyone shied away from him because of his threatening, grumpy air. Was it slipping or was the old dude just crazy?</p><p>The man settled back in his seat, picking up his book again. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019ll take pity on you soon,\u201d he said, opening the pages and going back to his reading, looking through the spectacles that sat low on his nose.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that very much,\u201d Ty muttered as he turned his attention to Zane and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>Within a minute, Zane felt Ty\u2019s eyes on him, and he looked over his shoulder to favor Ty with a smile. Then he nodded and looked at the books he held. He chose three and put a couple back, then walked over to the counter.</p><p>\u201cNot even going to look, huh?\u201d</p><p>Ty suspected that Zane wouldn\u2019t be enjoying this quite as much if he knew Ty didn\u2019t mind watching him. So he maintained his slightly sulky air and shook his head.</p><p>Zane glanced to the old man who was reading and apparently paying them no attention. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m happy. We can go after I pay for these.\u201d It hadn\u2019t even been ten minutes.</p><p>Ty looked him over and then sighed softly, allowing a small smile to show through. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more time,\u201d he murmured in a low voice.</p><p>Zane tried not to grin like a fool. He adored bookstores, and it was a welcome distraction from his worries and brooding. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said softly with an indefinable look in his eyes. Then he turned to disappear in the stacks that led further into the store.</p><p>As soon as he was gone, Ty rolled his eyes heavenward and slouched in his chair in defeat. That look in Zane\u2019s eyes would get him anything.</p><p>The old man didn\u2019t make a sound or look up from his book. But he was smiling. \u201cShut up,\u201d Ty muttered to him. He glanced over at him again, reading the gold lettering on the book the man read: The Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe.</p><p>Ty frowned at the leather-bound volume as something buried deep in his memory began to click. Anyone who lived in Baltimore for any period of time had read at least one Poe story. The only ones Ty could remember were the one about the heart in the floorboards, the guy being bricked up in a wine cellar, and the name of the last one he had read, the Murders in the Rue Morgue.</p><p>\u201cCan I see that?\u201d he asked suddenly, sitting up and pointing at the old book.</p><p>The man looked up at him, a small smile curling at his lips. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said graciously, putting his bookmark in place carefully before he closed it and handed it to Ty.</p><p>Ty flipped to the index, where he found a list of the stories included in the volume. \u201cHave you read all these before?\u201d he asked without looking up.</p><p>\u201cMany times,\u201d the man answered.</p><p>\u201cTwo people locked in a morgue,\u201d Ty murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one, yes,\u201d the man answered, mistakenly thinking that Ty was still speaking to him.</p><p>\u201cIs there one with a blonde woman and a brunette, maybe switching places?\u201d Ty tried as he looked up at the man. \u201cOr one about a painting? A girl getting her teeth all pulled out?\u201d</p><p>The old man nodded with a confused look at Ty and then at the book.</p><p>Ty stood up quickly, thrusting the book back into the old man\u2019s hands. \u201cGarrett!\u201d he called out excitedly.</p><p>Zane appeared around one of the long bookshelves, moving toward him quickly and obviously alarmed. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI think you just broke this fucking case,\u201d Ty said to him with a grin.</p><p>\u201cGo find a copy of that book,\u201d he ordered as he pointed at the hardback the old man held gingerly in his hands.</p><p>Zane watched the activity from between the blinds of a small storefront across the street from the crime scene. He\u2019d been watching for twenty Z minutes, not moving at all. Ty stood beside him, a little further away from the window because he was restless and couldn\u2019t quite stand still.</p><p>They watched as the local police set up a perimeter to keep out curious bystanders, cordoned off possible witnesses, and spread plainclothes agents through the gathering crowd to spot possible suspects. They watched Detectives Pierce and Holleman stand and scratch their heads in bewilderment, and they watched Ross and Sears arrive with Henninger and Morrison in tow and scratch their heads, too. They watched the medical examiner arrive\u2014the new one\u2014followed by two techs and a body bag.</p><p>\u201cLooks pretty chaotic. I think we can get in and out and never be seen,\u201d Ty murmured to Zane. \u201cThe ME is new; he won\u2019t know us. And you know he\u2019s got it pretty cleared out in there now as he examines the body.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded slowly, still watching. He pulled out his phone, hit a few buttons, and waited. Down on the street, Henninger dug out his phone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in with the ME. Keep the rest out,\u201d Zane said shortly.</p><p>After a long moment in which the other agent answered, he snapped the phone shut, a grim look on his face. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAround the block and through the back. Entrance through the back.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and followed silently. They\u2019d been leaving the bookstore with their newly purchased collection of Poe stories when they\u2019d received the call, and he was almost eager to see if this newest murder would fit into their theory.</p><p>They headed outside and around the block, well away from the gathered law enforcement, and came in through the back alley where the ambulance was parked. There were just a couple cops to stand guard. A quick flash of their badges and some officious government snarls at the overworked men, and they were in.</p><p>Zane shoved his hands in his pockets and walked carefully on the narrow runner of plastic laid over the slick and sticky floor. Each room was bloody. They found the new ME in the living room.</p><p>The man looked over his shoulder at them. \u201cYou\u2019re the team from the Bureau?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane and then back at the ME. \u201cWhat can you tell us?\u201d</p><p>he asked without answering the question.</p><p>\u201cOccupant of the house is a seventy-one-year-old male. We don\u2019t know if he\u2019s the victim yet, but he\u2019s nowhere to be found. No way to tell time of death just yet except for the congealing of the blood. I\u2019d say anywhere from three to five hours,\u201d the examiner told them. He stood up from where he crouched, carefully keeping his hands away from his own body. His gloves were stained almost to the wrists. \u201cWe\u2019re still finding pieces around the house. I figure most of the victim is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the scene discovered?\u201d Zane asked stoically.</p><p>The ME glanced between them. \u201cThe victim\u2019s heart was delivered to Federal Plaza with this address on a return address label.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heart?\u201d Ty echoed flatly.</p><p>The ME nodded and merely looked at him as Zane rubbed his hand over his eyes, flinching painfully. Ty glanced around and pursed his lips. The blood that was visible was beginning to dry and grow darker. There were indeed pieces, just as the man had said. It was like a scene from some camp slasher movie. But Ty wasn\u2019t registering the absolute horror of the scene he was calmly perusing. Instead, he found himself trying to fit it into the profile he had made of the killer all those months ago.</p><p>\u201cAnything else remarkable?\u201d Zane forced himself to ask. He wanted\u2014needed\u2014to get out of there. Very soon. It was messing with his head.</p><p>\u201cThe murder weapon,\u201d the ME answered with a nod. He had one of the crime scene techs lead them over to a dresser that was decked out with a white cloth and tapers in silver candlesticks. On a tarnished silver platter in the center of the cloth was a gore-caked hacksaw.</p><p>Zane took one good look, nodded sharply and turned away, clenching his trembling hands into tight fists. It wasn\u2019t the blood and carnage that bothered him so much; it was the idea that someone did this to another living person, that it was so obviously planned.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t notice his partner\u2019s reactions. Instead, he stared at the placement of the murder weapon curiously, intrigued by it.</p><p>\u201cThey found it like this?\u201d he asked with a wave at the platter.</p><p>The tech nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones who\u2019ve been in this room, sir.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned and looked over the room, glancing at Zane and then back at the bloody floor again. \u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked the crime scene guy.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing we\u2019ve found that\u2019s odd is a hole cut in the floorboards. We\u2019re pretty sure the murder weapon was used to do it,\u201d the tech answered.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the hole?\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>\u201cBedroom. Here, I\u2019ll show you,\u201d the man answered as he pointed to a nearby doorway. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a hole. The killer covered it again,\u201d he added hastily as he led them into a front room of the house. \u201cWe haven\u2019t lifted the cover yet. We just finished taking photos.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned down at the crudely cut square in the floor. \u201cThis dude\u2019s nuttier than squirrel shit,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>The tech glanced at him and bit his lip to keep from smiling.</p><p>Zane carefully knelt down, staring at the cracks in the wood.</p><p>\u201cGloves,\u201d he asked, holding up one hand.</p><p>The tech blinked down at him, then glanced at Ty.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think maybe you should let the crime scene dudes do this, Hoss?\u201d Ty asked Zane pointedly.</p><p>\u201cGive me some fucking gloves,\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>The tech pulled some out of his pocket and handed them over without questioning. After pulling them on, Zane started slowly tracing the cracks in the floorboards with his fingers. Ty watched wordlessly, recognizing Zane\u2019s gears turning but too annoyed with him to care.</p><p>All Ty knew was that their perp was getting frustrated with the lack of progress the Feds had been making, and he was now putting on a show. It felt almost like he was excited. The scene had a sense of manic glee to it, something none of the other scenes had carried with them. Ty looked over his shoulder, back in the direction of the room with the platter and the murder weapon, flanked by silver candlesticks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It felt like a party. Like a welcome home party, complete with bloody confetti. But that wasn\u2019t possible, and Ty frowned as he began to wonder about his own mental stability. The killer had no way of knowing they were back on the case yet. If their theory was correct, he had nothing to be celebrating.</p><p>Kneeling on the floor, Zane pulled at the cutout of the hardwood floor with his fingers, but it was too tight to lift. He reached into his jacket sleeve and pulled out one of his knives, sliding it into the gap between the boards and applying pressure carefully.</p><p>The board lifted easily. He pulled it away and set it aside, then reached for the next one.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ty asked in alarm as Zane began destroying the crime scene.</p><p>Zane looked grimly down into the hole as he lifted a second floorboard. \u201cTake a look,\u201d he said to Ty as he sat back.</p><p>Ty and the tech both bent over the hole and peered down into it.</p><p>Inside was a simple piece of white construction paper. Drawn on it in blood was a stylized heart.</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d the tech observed flatly.</p> <p>Ty turned his head to look at the man, then down at Zane. \u201cProbably our token. What\u2019d you expect to find?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>Zane shrugged distractedly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Had hardwood floors growing up, used to hide things under them,\u201d he explained in a troubled voice.</p><p>He stood up, peeling the gloves off and handing them to the tech. \u201cThanks,\u201d</p><p>he said quietly before turning on his heel and leaving the room.</p><p>Ty stood still and watched Zane retreat with a frown, then looked back down at the note left under the floorboards. He sighed and looked back up. Even in here, far removed from what appeared to be the main crime scene, there was blood and gore.</p><p>\u201cTakes a real madman to do this to another human being,\u201d the ME</p> <p>said to him softly from the doorway where he\u2019d been watching.</p><p>Ty gave the ME a glance and shook his head, taking stock of the fact that he himself was trying to figure out how the perp had done it physically, rather than mentally or morally. He stood and walked slowly to the door, standing beside the man.</p><p>\u201cScarier still,\u201d he murmured to the medical examiner as he looked through the house to the back porch where Zane stood. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s crazy at all,\u201d he said softly as he left the room carefully, making certain he stayed on the plastic on his way out.</p><p>Zane stood outside, a cigarette already lit. He didn\u2019t move when Ty came out onto the porch. The dark circles under Zane\u2019s eyes were pronounced, and he looked exhausted and ill. His eyes were still blank, as if he was thinking about something so hard that he was almost zoning out over it.</p><p>Ty reached over and took the cigarette from between his lips, putting it out against the thick denim of his jeans. He then put the butt in his shirt pocket and looked away toward the back alley. Zane had to be out of it to be smoking at a fucking crime scene. He didn\u2019t know what evidence the smoke might destroy.</p><p>\u201cBetter get going before anyone else tries to come in,\u201d Ty said to him in annoyance. \u201cHenninger can\u2019t hold them off for long.\u201d</p><p>They ducked around the ambulance just as they heard Gary Ross\u2019s deep voice, and Zane led the way back out of the alley and down the street, away from the scene. They stopped moving six blocks away, and Zane pulled out another cigarette, getting that deep-in-thought look in his eyes again.</p><p>Ty gently reached out and plucked the cigarette from his fingers.</p> <p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he requested calmly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes followed the unlit cigarette in confusion, and he blinked owlishly when he looked up at Ty. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, reaching to take the cigarette back.</p><p>Ty pulled it further away, holding it out of reach as he looked at Zane pointedly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brows drew together, and he took a few seconds to review the last minute. \u201cOh ... I was thinking about the floorboards,\u201d he said, looking at Ty\u2019s hand and then back up at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d Ty prodded.</p><p>\u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart, \u201d Zane answered with a nod. \u201cYou were right.</p><p>He\u2019s re-enacting Poe stories. Where that gets us, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a relief to finally see the pattern though.\u201d He wrinkled his nose, gave up on the cigarette, and pulled the crumpled pack out of his pocket to get another.</p><p>Ty sighed and handed the cigarette back. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we get that book out, make a list of the murders, and send it to Henninger,\u201d he suggested. \u201cBut you\u2019re right, it gets us nowhere closer to him. That scene was</p><p>... different,\u201d he added in a tired voice, mind still working over the new form of his profile.</p><p>Zane took the cigarette and tapped it on the pack, but now he was focusing more on Ty\u2019s reaction to giving it back. He didn\u2019t want Zane to smoke. That must be it. He remembered Ty\u2019s wry voice: \u201cThose things will kill you.\u201d He slid the cigarette back into the pack and stuffed it into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d he asked belatedly.</p><p>Ty merely shrugged and looked down, frowning. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said softly as he stepped to the side and began moving again, \u201cI need to write some shit down.\u201d</p><p>Zane rubbed a hand over his face, and they headed back to where they\u2019d parked. It took a while to get back to the seedy motel they\u2019d picked out, and they were both quiet the whole way. Once in the room, Zane shucked the jacket, the weapons, and his boots, and immediately laid face down on the bed. Maybe if he dozed, something would come to him.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t follow Zane\u2019s lead. Instead, he paced at the end of the other bed, pen in hand, drumming it against his thigh as he moved. He was thinking about the welcome party, about his inability to be horrified by the gore. His frown deepened the more he paced.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you pacing?\u201d Zane muttered after several minutes. \u201cCan\u2019t you sit to think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty snapped in answer. \u201cLeave me the fuck alone.\u201d</p><p>Zane sat up, obviously peeved. Growling quietly, he stalked over to his jacket and pulled out the cigarettes and lighter before turning to the door.</p><p>Ty watched him go, glowering at the cigarettes in his hand. Zane yanked the door open, shoved the latch over to block it open, and stepped out onto the concrete walkway as he lifted an unlit smoke to his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he set up the scene like that?\u201d Ty called after him before the door could close.</p><p>Startling slightly, Zane almost dropped the lighter. He pushed the door back open partway. \u201cThe scene?\u201d he asked, cigarette between his lips as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cHe set up the murder weapon like an offering,\u201d Ty answered, voicing what had been bothering him. \u201cLike a ... gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a silver platter, yeah. I wasn\u2019t amused,\u201d Zane said, blowing the smoke away from the door. \u201cI bet he was.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at him and his lips parted slightly as if he was surprised at what Zane had said. He looked down to the thin carpet and blinked again, mouth working silently for several moments. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been amused,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Zane watched Ty, confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d</p><p>he asked mildly, the snap and frustration gone for the moment.</p><p>\u201cI think I completely missed the profile,\u201d Ty answered dazedly.</p><p>Zane blinked in surprise. He stuck the unlit cigarette behind his ear and reentered the room, shutting the door behind him and turning the bolt.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been assuming he was playing games, flaunting how good he was and waiting for someone worth playing the game against,\u201d Ty answered quickly as he began pacing again. \u201cBurns said there was an overall feeling that the killer was depressed after we left, despondent and silent. We assumed\u2014because we\u2019re FBI and ego is a requirement\u2014that it was because he thought we were good enough to play the game. But why would he think that?\u201d he posed as he stopped and looked at Zane. \u201cWe were here for a grand total of, what, seven days? We made no progress, no more than any of the others, and the only thing we succeeded in doing was almost getting killed.</p><p>He\u2019s not trying to play. He\u2019s trying to please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to please? You mean to keep us busy? To give him our attention? And then when he lost it, he was unhappy?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cYou read crime novels and watch detective movies, right?\u201d he said eagerly. \u201cThe stereotype in almost every one is a bored cop; he wants something exciting to sink his teeth into, wants action, wants...a big case to work on,\u201d he rambled almost excitedly. \u201cRight? For all his intelligence and talent, this perp has bought into that image. He admires law enforcement officers,\u201d he went on, beginning to form a new profile as he spoke. \u201cHis dad or father figure might even have been a security guard or some sort of pseudo-policeman type. That\u2019s why he became a Fed, if he is one. He admired them. He wants to please the people he admires, give them something worth their time.\u201d He closed his eyes and lifted his chin, raising his face to the ceiling.</p><p>Zane bit back a smile. He glanced to the stack of crime and suspense novels he\u2019d bought. \u201cOkay, I can see that. So, he\u2019s hoping to give us a good game. So if we figure it out, what\u2019s to stop him from changing the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has to change it. He\u2019ll be well-schooled in forensics and profiling. He\u2019ll think he\u2019s hiding by switching his MO, but he\u2019s still got that pattern. He may have picked it because it offered so many different methods.</p><p>Or it may have more special meaning to him. He killed the Poe Toaster in Baltimore, we can be sure of that, either as a jumping-off point or practice. He had to have picked him because of who he was. Poe is the playbook he\u2019s sticking to in order to stay safe. He\u2019s not killing for the pleasure of the kill, not like normal serials. What he enjoys\u2014 his real ritual\u2014is the after-effects,\u201d</p><p>Ty explained as the profile unfolded before him like a road map over his mental steering wheel. \u201cWhat he craves is the attention of the authorities afterward. Not the press, not the public. Just the cops and Feds. He doesn\u2019t just return to the scene of the crime; he lives it. He soaks the mayhem in afterward, either by being physically present or thriving on the official reports. That\u2019s why he\u2019s sending stuff in the mail; he\u2019s helping the people he admires try to solve him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it might not be someone at the Bureau, but maybe a cop from the city who\u2019s got access,\u201d Zane realized. \u201cSomeone who works both sides of the case, although in a minor role. Like the Steves are attached to this case.\u201d He tossed the cigarette pack on the table and sat back down on the bed. \u201cI wish we had that damn list of all personnel who\u2019ve touched anything to do with this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new profile screams cop with an inferiority complex,\u201d Ty agreed. \u201cBut with the access he has, I\u2019m still saying FBI. It also makes me think that something we did, the two of us, told him that we were enjoying what he was doing,\u201d he went on more tentatively. \u201cWe may have expressed admiration for his skill somehow or shown interest in how or why he did something that none of the other agents had noticed. Whatever it was we did, he thought he\u2019d finally found someone who was enjoying the fruits of his labor.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s face was blank and then he blanched. \u201cSo he\u2019s been doing this</p><p>... specifically to amuse us? You and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at first,\u201d Ty answered with a shake of his head. \u201cAnd not even now. To assume that would be to assume he knows we\u2019re back. The two of us, specifically. I think he heard somehow that the Bureau was sending in a new crew. That, back there? That was his welcome party.\u201d</p><p>Zane closed his eyes, feeling slightly ill at the thought. That had been perhaps the most gruesome scene he had ever witnessed, and he\u2019d seen a lot, but Ty seemed to be thinking of it as merely another stepping stone to finding their killer.</p><p>He opened his eyes again and looked\u2014really looked\u2014at Ty, studying him, catching on to the slightly detached air he had about him. He\u2019d had it ever since they\u2019d been reunited. Even back at his home in Baltimore. He remembered Ty\u2019s reaction to the woman being found in his hotel room all those months ago, and experience with psychology told Zane what was going on. Ty was still in shock. He\u2019d gone through the treatment like a good little soldier, but he hadn\u2019t really processed any of the therapy. He had basically severed any links to deeper emotions to avoid anything hurting too much.</p><p>Ty snorted and continued to pace, oblivious to Zane\u2019s study of him.</p><p>\u201cWe should call Henninger,\u201d he finally murmured. \u201cTell him to change the profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be several hours \u2018til he\u2019s off the scene and able to talk,\u201d Zane reminded. He felt for Ty. Not just aching because Ty was so removed, but in other ways as well. It scared him, and his chest tightened as he watched his partner pace.</p><p>\u201cCall him anyway, this shit is important,\u201d Ty grunted in annoyance as he patted himself down for his own phone.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Call Henninger, then what?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cWe need somewhere bigger than this to spread out the files he\u2019s supposed to bring us and give them a good study. We should probably change hotels anyway, just in case.\u201d</p><p>Ty was very still, letting the last words sink in. \u201cYou think he knows we\u2019re back?\u201d he asked neutrally.</p><p>Zane swallowed, thinking back to what they\u2019d talked about minutes before. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs, specifically?\u201d Ty asked quietly.</p><p>Meeting Ty\u2019s eyes, Zane wondered if the curling anxiety showed in his own. \u201cYeah.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Ty responded in the same quiet, calm voice.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be long until he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs us,\u201d Ty interrupted confidently. \u201cHe needs us to make him feel as if he\u2019s doing well. He won\u2019t try to hurt us again. I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d he lied.</p><p>The lie didn\u2019t go unnoticed, but Zane had no plan to comment. He looked up at Ty sadly, wanting to say something, anything other than the soft words crowding in his throat. He swallowed on them again. He didn\u2019t know how much more \u201cspeaking\u201d they could do. Finally, a sentiment broke free in a rasp. \u201cI won\u2019t lose you. Not now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to get any more lost than I am,\u201d Ty answered roughly.</p><p>He turned quickly, pacing away from the bed as he flipped open his phone.</p><p>Zane squeezed his eyes shut and cursed silently. Curling his hands into fists, he got off the bed, put on his jacket, and retrieved his lighter, sliding the cigarette from behind his ear as he walked toward the door again.</p><p>Ty watched him go from under lowered brows, waiting for Henninger to pick up. When the younger agent answered, Ty quickly told him about the change in profile and the pattern they had discovered.</p><p>\u201cPoe?\u201d Henninger asked in a low voice, obviously trying not to be overheard. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe latest murder pretty much clinches it,\u201d Ty answered. \u201cWe got one of those damn anthologies; we\u2019re going to go through it and see what we find. Did you get a chance to gather those personnel files for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Henninger answered hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019ll have them by the morning,\u201d he promised quickly. \u201cYou wanted anyone who worked or lived in Baltimore between 2000 and 2002, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ty answered with an unconscious nod. \u201cNow, go get the word out about the pattern, get Bureau analysts all over this shit. We have to get ahead of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But how do I go to them with this?\u201d Henninger asked worriedly. \u201cWhat do I tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake up something. Take the credit,\u201d Ty instructed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Henninger asked in a slightly stunned voice.</p> <p>\u201cTell them you figured it out with this latest murder; it\u2019s pretty damn obvious when you think about it,\u201d Ty suggested. \u201cTell them about the murder in Baltimore and how you made the connection from there. If they ask,\u201d he was careful to instruct. \u201cThey probably won\u2019t, so don\u2019t offer any information you don\u2019t have to. They\u2019ll probably just be glad to have something to go on. If you get in too deep, just tell them you got a tip from a buddy in the Bureau who didn\u2019t want to be named. Give them my name and number in Baltimore if they demand it.\u201d</p><p>He waited until Henninger got a notepad and gave him the number in case he needed it.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Henninger asked with a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cJust be careful. We suspect he may know we\u2019re back, and if he does, he may connect you with us,\u201d Ty warned worriedly. He didn\u2019t like the thought of being responsible for any more innocent lives. He still saw Isabelle St.</p><p>Claire\u2019s face when he slept.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, sir,\u201d Henninger murmured. Ty ended the call and sighed unhappily. Despite what should have been considered two major breaks in the case, he didn\u2019t feel as if they\u2019d made any progress.</p><p>Zane stepped back into the room, smelling of smoke and looking troubled. \u201cTime to move?\u201d he asked Ty.</p><p>Ty nodded wordlessly, and they began gathering their small amount of things and carrying them out to the rental car. The feeling that the killer was on their trail, rather than the other way around, sat heavily on both of them. They didn\u2019t say another word to each other as Zane got behind the wheel and began driving with no particular destination in mind.</p> <p>Finally, Ty glanced over at him and watched him for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cWe could just cut and run,\u201d he suggested softly, watching Zane closely.</p><p>Forcibly keeping his eyes on the road, Zane pressed his lips together hard, and his hands curled tightly around the steering wheel. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice dream,\u201d he finally answered, his voice as unsteady as the rest of him. \u201cBut I\u2019d never be able to sleep. And neither would you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cYeah,\u201d he responded as he looked back out the window.</p><p>They were silent for several more minutes as they sat in midday traffic.</p><p>\u201cOkay so, change of venue,\u201d Zane said suddenly in a slightly louder voice than he intended, hoping to dispel the funk that had settled over them.</p><p>\u201cHow about a jazzy place in Greenwich? Good restaurants. Great bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talking hotels?\u201d Ty asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cMore bungalow-type setups. Rent by the week. Artsy places,\u201d Zane explained. \u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like an artsy type to you?\u201d Ty asked, bristling on principle.</p><p>It didn\u2019t even faze Zane. \u201cYou look like sex on legs to me. You\u2019ll blend in, no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, if you try to put me in leather pants or some shit like that I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Ty warned with a point of his finger at Zane.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking along the lines of no pants, baby,\u201d Zane said with a smirk. \u201cIn our room, anyway.\u201d</p><p>That gave Ty pause and he pursed his lips to consider. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d</p><p>he finally agreed with a smirk.</p><p>ZANE found an eclectic neighborhood with bohemian shops, art galleries, and people all over the place. They lucked out and found a furnished studio apartment for rent rather than a hotel, and the landlord was happy to rent to them for an unspecified amount of time as long as it came with the hefty down payment they offered, no questions asked. Hundreds of people drifted in and out of Greenwich each year. These two men were nothing special.</p><p>The three-room apartment that was half of the third floor of an old brownstone was decorated in warm colors and comfortable fabrics. There were no electronics, except for a phone, but there was wireless Internet coming from somewhere, probably the small caf\u00e9 across the street.</p><p>Zane dropped his bag and box on the round table in the front room.</p><p>He turned to see Ty surveying the room warily, and it made him smile.</p><p>\u201cComing in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ty frowned. \u201cDoes it smell like hemp and incense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the bed,\u201d Zane said straight-faced.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Ty replied seriously. \u201cThat was the only part I was looking forward to.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cStill have the couch,\u201d he said, trying to get Ty into the room.</p><p>Ty took a step into the room and stopped stubbornly. \u201cI feel my manhood seeping out of me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Zane dropped his jacket on a wingback chair after pulling the bottle of Mountain Dew out of it. The apartment was cute and quaint; somewhere no one would ever look for two FBI agents. He pulled his gun out of the holster and set it on the table as Ty ventured further into the rooms.</p><p>When Zane turned his attention back to his partner, Ty had his back to him, his jacket was off, and his holster sat snug against his pressed blue dress shirt. He was rubbing the back of his neck and looking down at the bed in front of him, his free hand on his hip. Looking at the shined dress shoes and the expensive, tailored suit he wore, from this angle he may as well have been a different person from the one Zane had worked with before.</p><p>Zane wondered what had happened to Ty\u2019s crazy T-shirts. They had fit his style and his hard-ass image. He\u2019d probably packed them away, Zane figured, packed them away with all his old habits and thoughts as the physical and mental therapy had taken over.</p><p>Zane missed those T-shirts.</p><p>Watching him, Zane considered pulling Ty into his arms in hopes the man might relax a little. But the vibe Ty was putting out clearly said that touching of any sort was not the way to relax him. Stretching, Zane sighed and dug into his duffel, looking for a clean T-shirt. Unfortunately all of his were plain ones.</p><p>He went to the bed and pulled the covers back, smoothing his hand over the sheets before heading to the bathroom. It had been a long day, and he was more than ready to rest.</p><p>Ty followed him and leaned against the doorframe that led into the bathroom as Zane went over to the antique oval mirror above the sink. Zane washed up as Ty moved closer to him, and he stiffened in surprise when Ty wrapped his arms around him from behind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have you here,\u201d Ty told him impulsively.</p><p>Zane shifted back, closer to Ty\u2019s body, sliding his arm back and around Ty\u2019s waist to press flush against him. Ty held him silently, settling his chin on Zane\u2019s shoulder after several breaths. Zane turned his cheek into Ty\u2019s and closed his eyes, and Ty waited tensely for some sort of response, flushing at the words he had uttered.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have agreed to come here, if it hadn\u2019t been you,\u201d Zane murmured finally. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><p>Ty jerked a little in surprise, but he didn\u2019t release him. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked in a whisper.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes and kept their cheeks pressed together. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>A flush of guilt swept through Ty with the words. He couldn\u2019t say the same about why he had agreed to take this case. He would have come alone. It was revenge for him, pure and simple. Unfinished business. He turned his head more and pressed his nose against Zane\u2019s cheek. \u201cThen you\u2019re a fucking idiot,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cYeah, but you already knew that.\u201d Ty was silent.</p><p>Zane pulled away gently and moved past him, figuring no other comment on Ty\u2019s part meant the talking thing was done. He went out into the main room and reached for his duffel to dig out his shower kit.</p><p>Ty let him move away, a heavy feeling in his chest and an unsettled feeling everywhere else. He couldn\u2019t seem to feel anything but guilt unless Zane was near him. Why was that? Why did he need Zane in order to feel?</p><p>\u201cWe do better when we\u2019re fucking,\" Ty muttered to him as he followed him back out into the room.</p><p>Zane snorted quietly. \u201cNews flash,\u201d he said as he sat on the edge of the bed and began unlacing his boots.</p><p>Zane thumped into the room and dropped the bag of snacks and drinks he\u2019d just picked up at the quick mart down the block. He hadn\u2019t been Z able to sleep, and he was glad that some places were open at four in the morning. He tossed his jacket to the side and headed to the table to unload his gear. He glanced over at Ty, who curled on his side on the bed, apparently sleeping. As Zane watched him in the light from the street that filtered through the window, Ty growled in his sleep and rolled, tangling in the sheets as he did so.</p><p>Smiling slightly, Zane stopped to look down at him. Ty never seemed to sleep easy, except when Zane was in bed holding him. He wondered what Ty dreamed about. Usually Ty woke as soon as Zane moved. The fact that he was still asleep meant he\u2019d either already been awake and discerned he wasn\u2019t needed, he was very tired, or he was sick. Thoughtful, Zane took care of his gun and wallet, setting them carefully aside.</p><p>Ty muttered in his sleep and tossed his head fitfully. Frowning, Zane walked over and crouched down beside the bed, looking over Ty\u2019s face as it twisted slightly. Zane wanted to wake him just to interrupt the bad dreams, but he wasn\u2019t going to reach out and touch until the other man knew he was there, just in case. Ty had all kinds of ingrained military training that his body instinctively followed, and Zane didn\u2019t relish getting attacked by a Recon Marine having flashbacks.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d he murmured, prompting the other man to wake up a little as he shielded himself with the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Ty responded as he tossed his head again and rolled back toward Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tossing around so much, you can\u2019t be resting,\u201d Zane said quietly.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes fluttered open and he looked at Zane without seeming to recognize him. He stared for a moment and then closed them again. He sighed and shifted slightly in the bed, then opened his eyes again. They were clear when he met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cShut up,\u201d he muttered sleepily.</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be crankier than you were when you went to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cranky,\u201d Ty insisted drowsily as he closed his eyes again and rolled onto his back. He stretched with relish, yawning and curling his toes contentedly. \u201cI was dreaming,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cMm hmm,\u201d Zane agreed, shifting to sit on the edge of the bed and lay his hand lightly on Ty\u2019s abs. \u201cDreaming of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe desert,\u201d Ty answered in a mumble. He shifted again, arching up into Zane\u2019s hand like a dog getting his belly rubbed.</p><p>Zane started rubbing agreeably, watching Ty move. \u201cDesert, huh?\u201d</p><p>Ty inhaled deeply and then sighed, opening his eyes again to stare at the ceiling. \u201cMakes my trigger finger itch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSand does itch,\u201d Zane replied blithely. \u201cOne of the reasons I chose Miami over western New Mexico.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head slightly and looked up at Zane in confusion.</p><p>Zane raised a brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked in a lost voice.</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely not awake. One of the reasons I refused the assignment in New Mexico is because I hate eating sand.</p><p>And I don\u2019t like rattlesnakes.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at him rapidly and then looked around the room before pushing himself into a sitting position. \u201cWhat assignment in New Mexico?\u201d</p><p>he asked as he rubbed his eyes.</p><p>Peering at him in amusement, Zane decided to explain even though Ty was still out of it. \u201cThe one I was offered before they stuck me in Miami. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bilingual agents are scarce lately,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Ty responded flatly with a little nod as he moved. \u201cThat\u2019s very important,\u201d he assured Zane gruffly as he flopped back onto his side and buried his head under his pillow.</p><p>Zane chuckled and pulled away the pillow. \u201cCranky?\u201d he teased.</p><p>Ty groaned softly and then huffed in irritation. \u201cCan\u2019t a man sleep in peace around here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently not when he dreams of the desert,\u201d Zane drawled. He leaned to press his lips to Ty\u2019s temple. \u201cSleep, then,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI always dream of the desert,\u201d Ty muttered sulkily as he pressed his face against the mattress, refusing to be roused.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips drifted to the corner of Ty\u2019s eye. \u201cWhy?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Ty twitched and turned to elbow Zane in the ribs. \u201cThat\u2019s where I lived,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Zane smoothed his hand over Ty\u2019s arm in a soothing motion and turned his face to lay his cheek against Ty\u2019s for a moment.</p> <p>Ty sighed again and relaxed under the pressure of Zane\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very high-maintenance,\u201d he mumbled against the pillow.</p><p>Grinning, Zane curled his arm over Ty\u2019s back and rubbed slowly over his hip. \u201cYeah, so I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty ordered.</p><p>Zane coasted his hand over Ty\u2019s cheek and rolled away. \u201cSleep, oh cranky one.\u201d</p><p>Ty groaned and rolled back onto his back. \u201cWell fuck, Garrett, I\u2019m awake now,\u201d he muttered disconsolately.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Zane murmured, letting his arm fall between them and looking down at Ty.</p><p>Ty looked up at him in irritation for a moment before letting the fa\u00e7ade fall away and smiling slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn sight better to wake up to than what I usually do,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Zane smiled crookedly. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really want to know, do you?\u201d Ty asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cI already know about the woman who was screeching on the phone,\u201d</p><p>Zane pointed out.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and looked away, staring up at the ceiling with a frown. \u201cUsually,\u201d he finally said with a scowl, \u201cI don\u2019t wake up to anything.</p><p>So, I guess you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there a compliment hidden in there somewhere?\u201d Zane asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cBeggars can\u2019t be choosers,\u201d Ty muttered with a small smirk.</p><p>Zane whapped Ty\u2019s hip. \u201cI don\u2019t beg,\u201d he asserted.</p><p>Ty jerked and laughed softly, turning slightly away in case Zane decided to smack him again. \u201cI beg to differ,\u201d he snickered.</p><p>Zane smacked him again, a little harder this time. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an instance. Not a legitimate one, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an illegitimate reason to beg?\u201d Ty asked as he continued laughing softly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hand stilled, as did his face. His eyes shifted across the room blankly. \u201cThey exist,\u201d he said vaguely.</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes up at his companion and then rolled them as he looked away. \u201cMoody,\u201d he accused as he sat back up again and stretched.</p><p>\u201cMoody?\u201d Zane\u2019s face scrunched. \u201cI was sort of thinking about the last time I begged for my life and could really have cared less. Just figured if I told you, I\u2019d get the violins treatment again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right. And that\u2019s not an illegitimate reason, moron,\u201d Ty told him as he swung his feet over the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI was referring to the \u2018could really have cared less\u2019 part, actually,\u201d</p><p>Zane said, closing his eyes and letting his head lean back against the wall.</p><p>Ty sat with his back to Zane, looking at the opposite wall with his head cocked thoughtfully. \u201cFuck,\u201d he commented with a slight shake of his head.</p><p>Zane opened his eyes and looked at Ty\u2019s back. \u201cMaybe later,\u201d he said as he picked up the file folder again. \u201cTold you I was fucked up while we were apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just let them kill you?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cWhy beg at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGut reflex, I guess,\u201d Zane said quietly. \u201cDidn\u2019t really think about it, except that there was something I\u2019d miss. Was scared, too. Being shot in the head doesn\u2019t appeal too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be quicker than a lot of other ways,\u201d Ty pointed out as he turned around slightly and met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cI was always afraid of dying slow,\u201d he said thoughtfully.</p><p>Zane\u2019s mouth quirked. \u201cI played that game, too.\u201d He curled his hand into a fist as his fingers started twitching.</p><p>\u201cWhat game?\u201d Ty asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cFiguring out what will kill you slow and easy,\u201d Zane said, opening his fist and rubbing his palm against his thigh. \u201cPain wasn\u2019t a consideration.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him for a long moment. \u201cWhy\u2019d you want to go slow?\u201d</p><p>he finally asked.</p><p>Zane\u2019s mouth quirked. \u201cSo I could enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised one expressive eyebrow. He licked his lips and looked away. \u201cMy daddy used to mind the mines when I was little,\u201d he said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI used to dream that I was stuck down there. I wouldn\u2019t mind freezing to death,\u201d he claimed abruptly. \u201cGoing numb and then going to sleep. But I think I\u2019d want it quick. I got too much to look back on and regret to want time to ponder it all.\u201d He glanced back at Zane. \u201cJust another thing we don\u2019t have in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegrets? Maybe. Sometimes I think I deserve all the shit I went through. Did it to myself,\u201d Zane said. He met Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cI would think you wouldn\u2019t agree. You don\u2019t seem the type to self-flagellate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pretend I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Ty responded with a ghost of a smile. His regrets were one thing he did not plan on going over with Zane any time soon. Or ever.</p><p>Zane nodded slowly. \u201cAll right,\u201d he murmured. It was obviously a topic to avoid. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying you think I don\u2019t have regrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just commenting on the fact that you\u2019d rather have time to linger over them at the end,\u201d Ty corrected. \u201cThis is a morbid conversation. What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d he asked in a huff as he rubbed his hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Zane asked in disbelief. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I wanted to linger over anything. Just that if I have to die, I want to enjoy it.\u201d He shrugged slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have enough focus to ponder much of anything hopped on heroin.</p><p>That\u2019s the allure.\u201d His hand twitched again.</p><p>Ty sighed and looked away again with a shake of his head. \u201cHow long ago was it?\u201d he asked tiredly.</p><p>\u201cHow long ago was what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heroin?\u201d Ty asked curtly as he glanced back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFour and a half, maybe five weeks, I guess,\u201d Zane answered.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m to assume it wasn\u2019t a constant thing?\u201d Ty asked tightly.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re not screaming in pain from the withdrawal, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him for a long moment. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t constant. It was all I had to cut the pain when I got shot.\u201d His hand went to his abdomen, where Ty knew there was a fresh, barely healing scar. \u201cI know what I can handle.\u201d</p><p>Ty examined him for a long time, and then turned his head to face the wall again. He sighed softly. \u201cOkay,\u201d he finally acknowledged quietly. It just wasn\u2019t worth the fight it could turn into to continue the conversation, and Ty was getting tired of talking about it.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever use?\u201d Zane asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Ty answered immediately.</p><p>\u201cBut you drink,\u201d Zane murmured, looking down at his hands, wondering if there was any way he could explain so Ty could have some idea of what it was like to be addicted. \u201cEver drink too much and still want more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time I drink too much I swear it off for a week,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>\u201cBut I pick the bottle up the next weekend. The next day. Maybe even that night,\u201d Zane said softly. \u201cJust until I get my fill. Feels good, not hurting anybody. Once I\u2019ve had enough, I\u2019ll stop. I won\u2019t drink too much this time.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head slightly, but didn\u2019t quite look back at Zane. \u201cI understand what an addiction is,\u201d he said in a low, hard voice. \u201cNot everyone is that weak.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s body went totally still. \u201cEveryone is that weak. Even guys who fuck a different woman every night just to forget somebody else.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s shoulders tensed slightly as he looked back at the wall.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>Zane raised a brow, staring at the other man. \u201cTouch\u00e9? That\u2019s it? Five months ago you\u2019d have clocked me for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me, Garrett?\u201d Ty asked in frustration. He turned his head slightly but still didn\u2019t turn to meet Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Sitting up, Zane reached for him. \u201cLook at me, Ty,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>Ty glanced over his shoulder, his jaw clenching angrily.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to say first? Before your newly installed conscience caught your brain and had you say something else?\u201d Zane asked, fingers tightening.</p><p>Ty looked down at Zane\u2019s fingers as they dug into his arm, then back up to look sideways at Zane. \u201cSome creative version of \u2018fuck you\u2019, I\u2019m sure,\u201d</p><p>he answered tightly.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say it? Christ knows you\u2019ve called me about every name in the book. Why not now?\u201d Zane prodded. If Ty didn\u2019t let some of that anger out somehow he was going to implode. Zane had seen it happen.</p><p>Zane had had it happen.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Ty answered stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d Zane parroted, refusing to back off. \u201cThink I can\u2019t take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to start a fight?\u201d Ty asked as he shook his arm away from Zane\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cApparently. And you\u2019re determined to sit there all buttoned up and not hurt my feelings,\u201d Zane said, catching Ty\u2019s arm again, this time the forearm. \u201cLet it go. There\u2019s no one here to act for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many harsh words will it take to send you into a bottle?\u201d Ty asked as he yanked his forearm away and smacked at Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cNot too damn many, I\u2019m guessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times am I gonna have to rip down these walls you keep putting up before you fucking pop and go ballistic at precisely the wrong time?\u201d Zane snapped, fingers grasping and tightening despite the smack.</p><p>\u201cHow long can you keep it all inside? \u2019Cause believe me, you\u2019ve got no chance of doing it forever.\u201d</p><p>Ty reached for Zane\u2019s hand suddenly, squeezing his wrist to free his other hand. As soon as Zane\u2019s fingers let go, Ty reached out and backhanded him.</p><p>If Zane had been a smaller man, he might have fallen sideways under the blow. As it was, his chin snapped to the side from the strength of it, and when he looked back at Ty, he had to lick a trickle of blood off his split lip.</p><p>When he spoke, his voice was strong and even with the surety of hard-won personal experience. \u201cIf you can\u2019t learn to let go of the anger and frustration somehow, it will eat you up inside,\u201d he advised. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean hiding in the bottom of a bottle or between some stranger\u2019s thighs.\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and looked away, visibly trying to calm himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he finally murmured. He turned slightly and reached back to Zane, sliding his hand against the side of his face as he wiped the blood away from Zane\u2019s lip with his thumb regretfully.</p><p>Zane pressed his cheek into Ty\u2019s hand, looking over him with softer eyes, and his mouth quirked. \u201cWell, I deserved it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go through what I did.\u201d</p><p>Ty wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say in response, and it showed clearly on his face. Instead of saying anything, he turned his head and let his hand slide away from Zane\u2019s face. He picked up Zane\u2019s hand and turned it over with a sad shake of his head. \u201cYou\u2019re quite susceptible to that move,\u201d he chastised softly as his thumb slid gently over the pressure point he\u2019d utilized.</p><p>Grimacing, Zane rolled his wrist. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ve worn the sheaths so long that I\u2019m not used to having my wrists vulnerable. It\u2019s hard to change a habit like that.\u201d</p><p>Ty hummed thoughtfully and set his hands back into his own lap.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d the knives come from?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cJack Tanner,\u201d Zane answered.</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow and tilted his head so he could see Zane better.</p><p>\u201cYou worked with Jack at the Academy?\u201d he asked in obvious surprise. Jack Tanner was an ex-SEAL, employed by the Bureau to teach agents going through the Academy the basics of not getting killed in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>By the time Ty had gone through, Tanner was old enough and grouchy enough that he didn\u2019t teach classes anymore; he merely picked prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to run the lessons and supervised them.</p><p>Zane smiled slightly and nodded. \u201cI needed the help,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRemember me telling you about having to repeat? Yeah. Jack\u2019s the reason I didn\u2019t wash out the second time through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he did one-on-one lessons,\u201d Ty remarked with a small smirk.</p><p>\u201cOnly for special cases,\u201d Zane said. \u201cThat, and Becky was a really good cook.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and looked away uncomfortably. \u201cJack was always a sucker for a good ribeye,\u201d he muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane tipped his head. \u201cAnother story there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always another story somewhere,\u201d Ty answered vaguely.</p><p>\u201cLike why you want it to end quick,\u201d Zane said, deciding he\u2019d pushed enough. He already knew more about Ty\u2019s past than Ty knew about his. He supposed he was lucky in that respect. Sighing, he rubbed his eyes. \u201cGoing numb and then going to sleep,\u201d he agreed finally. \u201cI guess that appeals to a lot of people in our line of work. We\u2019re more likely to be beaten up, shot, knifed, blown up, hit by a car, tortured....\u201d</p> <p>Ty merely nodded distantly, his head slightly turned as he stared out the window.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you take this job?\u201d Zane asked curiously. \u201cAfter they ran you out of Recon? Why not tell the government to take a flying leap and buy a coal mine?\u201d</p><p>Ty scratched his chin and cocked his head. \u201c\u2019Cause I was afraid of the coal mines,\u201d he answered curtly.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were a smart man,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t take a smart man to be afraid of the coal mines,\u201d Ty responded seriously.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it take? For you to be afraid?\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head quickly and frowned at Zane. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m afraid?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t, then you\u2019re way beyond fixing,\u201d Zane claimed. \u201cI want to know what makes you afraid. I\u2019ve seen it, a few times, in your eyes. On your face. But I couldn\u2019t figure out why. Not really.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged and looked away before Zane could see anything else in his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered defensively. \u201cNormal things, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said quietly, seeing the evasion for what it was.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty huffed.</p> <p>Zane sighed and shook his head, but he had to laugh just a tiny bit. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever met someone as stubborn as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty said uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an insult. Hell.\u201d Zane sighed and leaned back against the headboard. He watched Ty for a long minute. The man looked antsy and unable to settle. On edge. \u201cTy, chill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou woke me up,\u201d Ty said accusingly. \u201cWhy do you want to know?</p><p>What does it matter what I\u2019m afraid of?\u201d he asked, obviously unable to let the conversation go.</p><p>Zane blinked in surprise. \u201cIt matters to me,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI want to know. So I...,\u201d His voice trailed off and he swallowed. \u201cSo I can protect you.\u201d</p><p>Ty sniffed. \u201cProtect me from being afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect you when you\u2019re afraid,\u201d Zane corrected.</p> <p>Ty muttered quietly to himself and shook his head. \u201cOkay,\u201d he finally ground out. \u201cYou want to know what I\u2019m afraid of?\u201d he asked as he turned his head slightly and looked back at Zane. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of small spaces,\u201d he said as he raised his hand and began counting off with his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of small, dark spaces. I\u2019m afraid of small, dark spaces with bugs and/or rodents in them. And I\u2019m afraid of falling when my ass isn\u2019t attached to a parachute.</p><p>Satisfied?\u201d he asked sarcastically.</p><p>Zane refused to be baited. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said simply, just watching Ty, wondering what was making him so cranky. He\u2019d tried picking a fight; he\u2019d tried reasoning with him. But Ty was still tense, unwilling or unable to just let the frustration go and shout at him. \u201cDo I still make you that uncomfortable?\u201d he asked, sounding forlorn. \u201cAfter all we\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and raised his chin slightly, sighing quietly. \u201cA little,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not used to answering questions, okay?\u201d he explained defensively. \u201cI just ... it\u2019s just weird for me.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded from where he leaned against the headboard, and a bit of his own tension seeped away. \u201cCome here,\u201d he requested, reaching out an arm.</p><p>Ty glanced over at him to see if he was making light. When he didn\u2019t see any signs of joking he narrowed his eyes slightly. \u201cFuck off. Priss,\u201d he offered with a small smile.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes sparkled and he laid his hand over his propped-up knee.</p><p>\u201cWho are you callin\u2019 Priss, Mr. Suited Up and Shiny?\u201d he taunted.</p><p>\u201cIf this is going to resort to name-calling, I\u2019ve already got you beat, Spanky,\u201d Ty warned with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure that, Jarhead?\u201d Zane replied.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I rock,\u201d Ty explained in an even voice. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t,\u201d he continued as he pointed at Zane, pinky finger held out to the side daintily as if he were drinking tea.</p><p>Smirking, Zane sat up, grabbed Ty and dragged him down onto the bed and under his bigger body. \u201cI\u2019d poke you, but you\u2019d beat the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>Ty flailed briefly before he was pinned, and he blinked up at Zane suspiciously as he flexed his fingers under Zane\u2019s grip. \u201cPower trip,\u201d he accused softly.</p><p>Zane waggled his eyebrows. \u201cI gave you a chance to come peacefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re easily distracted, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Ty deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Zane said smoothly, dragging one hand down Ty\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019m still focused on you.\u201d</p><p>Ty shivered as Zane\u2019s fingers raised goose bumps all over his body.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is the crux of our problem,\u201d he reminded softly.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Zane echoed, his hand continuing its descent.</p><p>\u201cAll kinds of problems,\u201d Ty affirmed. He reached up with the hand Zane had left free and smacked the bigger man gently on the side of the head.</p><p>\u201cFocus,\u201d he chastised.</p><p>Zane screwed up his face before looking down at Ty seriously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a problem. Not to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I am,\u201d Ty argued. \u201cWe know the bare minimum about each other, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that\u2019s just the way we want it. We know we want to take each other to bed, but we don\u2019t have much else to go on. To me, that spells all kinds of problems,\u201d he pointed out gently. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I was complaining,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cGrady....\u201d Zane groaned and rolled to his side, then curled one arm around his partner\u2019s waist. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to pick a fight here, but what do you propose we do about it? Neither one of us is all that good at talking. In fact, I\u2019d say we suck spectacularly at talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you stop asking so many questions,\u201d Ty suggested. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll start giving a damn when you look like you need a hug,\u201d he added cheekily.</p><p>\u201cYou already give a damn,\u201d Zane chanced.</p><p>Ty merely smiled, his lips twitching as if he was trying not to. Zane grinned and stole a kiss.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty muttered before jabbing Zane in the ribs gently and rolling out of his grasp.</p><p>Restraining the urge to yank Ty back into his arms, Zane instead let go and just lay there watching him. Ty sat up and swung his legs over the edge of the bed, then cocked his head and stared at the far wall thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d he asked after nearly a minute of silence.</p><p>That silence extended as Zane struggled with what to say. \u201cNot being there,\u201d he finally murmured.</p><p>Ty turned his head slightly to look back over his shoulder. \u201cNot being where?\u201d he asked in confusion.</p><p>Zane looked haunted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there when Becky was killed. I wasn\u2019t there when my first partner went stupid and drove home drunk. And I lost them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Ty responded unsympathetically. \u201cI was there when my partner was shot and killed,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI even took the bullet just like he did,\u201d he said as he pointed to the spot low on his abdomen where a scar told the story of a through and through. \u201cStill didn\u2019t do him a damn bit of good. Just \u2019cause you\u2019re there, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any less tragic.\u201d</p><p>Zane closed his eyes and shrugged a little. \u201cIf I\u2019d been there, I might have been able to do something. But I wasn\u2019t, and I lost them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019d been there,\u201d Ty said softly, \u201cI would have lost you.\u201d</p><p>Zane slowly opened his eyes to look at Ty\u2019s back as his breath caught. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you walk away again,\u201d he said to him thickly without thinking about it first.</p><p>Ty gave a lopsided shrug and then nodded, not turning to look back at Zane. \u201cIt\u2019s debatable, who walked away,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Zane drew in a deep breath, held it, and let it out slowly. \u201cWe ...</p><p>couldn\u2019t have done this then. We didn\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded thoughtfully as he finally turned to look Zane over, but the look on his face clearly said that he might disagree.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Zane asked, tilting his head to one side.</p><p>\u201cHow what, Chief?\u201d Ty asked softly.</p><p>\u201cHow would it have worked?\u201d</p><p>Ty pursed his lips and shrugged again. \u201cSame way it is now, I guess,\u201d</p><p>he answered, displaying the sort of nonchalance with which the Ty of old had always handled emotional situations. \u201cExcept without the drinking and drugs and copious amounts of anonymous sex, I\u2019d imagine,\u201d he added with a cock of his head.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cAnonymous sex? I thought you knew all those women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did after a few minutes,\u201d Ty pointed out with a hint of a blush.</p><p>A smile broke free. \u201cYou did better than I did, then,\u201d the other man muttered, though he wasn\u2019t at all self-conscious about it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna know,\u201d Ty said immediately, closing his eyes and shaking his head.</p><p>Zane chuckled and swiped playfully at Ty\u2019s arm. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said again. \u201cWe can sleep until Henninger calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sleep, I\u2019ll wake you up during the middle of a dream,\u201d Ty promised crankily.</p><p>\u201cYou were having a bad dream!\u201d Zane insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I ain\u2019t afraid of?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cBad dreams!\u201d He swatted at Zane\u2019s grasping hand and then began crawling toward him slowly.</p><p>\u201cDreams mean I\u2019m sleeping, and sleeping means I ain\u2019t laying awake trying to get to sleep. Understand?\u201d he asked as he got right in Zane\u2019s face and brushed his nose against Zane\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Zane repeated dutifully, rubbing the tip of his nose against Ty\u2019s before lifting just enough to press a soft kiss against his lips.</p><p>\u201cFirst night I slept without passing out drunk in four months was that night at your place,\u201d he said, his voice barely audible.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and sighed quietly, deflating a little just before he clambered to the side and flopped down beside Zane.</p><p>Zane knew Ty didn\u2019t want to hear it. But he\u2019d said it to him anyway; the closest he could come to communicating how much he felt he needed his partner. He shifted and lay along Ty\u2019s side, letting his eyes close while he just focused on feeling him close.</p><p>Ty\u2019s arm snaked around him, pulling him closer. \u201cAfter this case is over,\u201d he said quietly as he stared up at the ceiling and idly twirled a lock of Zane\u2019s hair, \u201cpromise me you\u2019ll get help.\u201d</p><p>Zane inhaled and exhaled slowly. \u201cI promise,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ty merely nodded his head almost indiscernibly and continued to play with Zane\u2019s hair. \u201cSo, what exactly was the point of waking me up and picking a fight?\u201d he asked finally.</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d Zane grunted. He knew full well what Ty was asking about. For now, Zane was just pleased to have the cranky, gruff Ty back. He could relate to him. This Ty didn\u2019t scare him and make him feel incredible, baffling emotions he\u2019d tried to shut away.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and shook his head again. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he accused almost fondly. He was unable to stay quiet for long. \u201cI mean,\u201d he said pointedly, \u201cI know why I poke you. But where\u2019s the fun in poking me? Why start arguments just for the sake of fighting?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Zane opened his eyes. He considered teasing, but thought it might be bordering on cruel at this point. \u201cYou\u2019re more yourself now than you\u2019ve been since I saw you again,\u201d he said seriously.</p><p>Ty blinked up at the ceiling. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>Raising an eyebrow, Zane raised his head and rested his chin on Ty\u2019s chest as he looked up at him. He didn\u2019t answer, though.</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes again and sighed heavily. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to drive me crazy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends, I guess,\u201d Zane said. \u201cIf it helps you shake off that damn conditioning, I\u2019ll do whatever I have to.\u201d</p><p>Ty cocked his head and frowned. \u201cConditioning,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Proper behavior\u2019?\u201d Zane said, sounding like he was parroting from a doctor. \u201cAll those things the shrink told you were the right things to do when you actually felt emotions?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes narrowed even further and he growled softly in the back of his throat.</p><p>Zane considered carefully what to say. \u201cThere\u2019s a piece of you missing. Or that you\u2019ve buried. One that I think we\u2019re going to need for this case.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent as he pushed Zane off him and sat up, leaning against the headboard and staring at his partner expectantly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think so?\u201d Zane asked evenly, watching Ty intently.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re trying to egg me on,\u201d Ty responded without answering.</p><p>\u201cMake me cranky and somehow use me to solve an unsolvable case. What the hell are you, Zane, a Little Rascal?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes flashed with a little temper before calming, and he sat up to look over at the other man. \u201cIt\u2019s your passion that\u2019s missing, Ty. You want to solve the case. You desperately want to catch a break on it. But that drive you had ... I just don\u2019t see it. I mean, for Christ\u2019s sake, you figured out the pattern the guy follows! That drove you insane when we were here before, but now you don\u2019t even seem to give a damn!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty leaned forward and his nostrils flared angrily. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a lot of shit you miss with your head so far up your ass,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Zane just smiled, watching Ty with something that looked like pleasure mixed with hunger and a tinge of amusement.</p><p>Ty stopped short when he saw the reaction, sitting back against the headboard suspiciously. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Ty huffed as he rolled off the bed and began to pace restlessly.</p><p>Zane shook his head slowly, still watching him. \u201cCome back here,\u201d</p><p>he tried, though he didn\u2019t move from his sitting position on the end of the bed.</p><p>Ty shot him a dirty look and stopped pacing. He crossed his arms defiantly and pursed his lips to see what Zane would do. But the other man just waited for a moment, then patted his thigh and raised an eyebrow.</p> <p>Ty snorted and looked at him incredulously. \u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d he advised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather fuck you,\u201d Zane drawled. Ty merely snorted stubbornly and turned to continue his pacing. Zane grinned and sprawled back on the bed. \u201cWell, whenever,\u201d he added, tipping his head back against the headboard to look at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cSo is the fucking a part of your little plan, too?\u201d Ty asked suddenly.</p><p>Zane brought his chin down and focused on Ty. \u201cI want to fuck you, regardless,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have any idea how far you\u2019ve gotten under my skin?\u201d</p><p>Again, the hairs on Ty\u2019s arms rose and his chest tightened slightly. He shook his head wordlessly and scowled.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Ty. I get a hard-on just looking at you,\u201d Zane snapped.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>Ty took an involuntary step back and blinked at Zane stupidly. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he insisted and shook his head as he finally looked away.</p><p>Zane cocked his head. \u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d he asked, voice revealing his surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty answered defensively. \u201cI just didn\u2019t ... realize....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t realize what?\u201d Zane asked softly, sitting up to lean his elbows on his knees.</p><p>Ty was slowly regaining his balance, and as he did so he smiled slowly. \u201cThat you were so easy,\u201d he answered with a smirk.</p><p>Zane chuckled and leaned back again. \u201cBlame the hookers.\u201d</p><p>Ty grew serious once more and took a step closer. \u201cIs it the same?\u201d he asked softly.</p> <p>The smile on Zane\u2019s face dimmed. \u201cNot even remotely close to you.\u201d</p><p>Ty stopped as Zane spoke and then took another step closer. \u201cDo you have any idea,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201chow far you\u2019ve gotten under my skin?\u201d</p><p>Zane stilled completely. \u201cNo,\u201d he said honestly, voice low.</p><p>Ty moved closer and stood at the side of bed in front of Zane. \u201cYou should,\u201d he murmured as he reached out and ran his fingers through Zane\u2019s hair.</p><p>Zane\u2019s dark eyes focused on him. \u201cHow? You don\u2019t believe the same of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d Ty asked softly.</p><p>Gaze going soft, Zane reached up to touch Ty\u2019s hand, though he didn\u2019t interfere with its movement. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ty sighed softly and bent over, dropping his hands to lean on Zane\u2019s thighs. He slid them up to rest against Zane\u2019s hips and he knelt there, looking up at him. \u201cThe girl who called that morning at my place,\u201d he said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cShe was so upset because I fucked her, then spent the rest of the night on the balcony with a beer and a really fucking rare cigar. Thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>Zane could feel his heart pounding in the quiet. He wondered if Ty could hear it. He moved his hands to rest on Ty\u2019s forearms. \u201cThinking about what?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cWhere I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who and what you were doing,\u201d Ty answered with a slow nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat we had done, what we should have done....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have....\u201d Zane stopped and shook his head. \u201cI thought about you,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou should have what?\u201d Ty pressed softly.</p><p>Zane sighed and closed his eyes. \u201cI should have stayed,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>Ty watched him closely, frowning. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have stayed,\u201d he finally responded.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zane answered. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><p>Ty remained on his knees, frowning at Zane without anything to say.</p><p>He pulled Zane\u2019s hand toward him and kissed the inside of his wrist impulsively. Zane\u2019s pulse was racing, and Ty could feel it jumping under his lips. \u201cWhy are you nervous?\u201d he whispered in confusion.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Zane let out his greatest fear. \u201cWhat if something happens to you?\u201d It was out of left field, for sure. But it was eating at him from the inside.</p><p>Ty raised his head slightly, looking at Zane seriously as he released him. He slowly eased himself up to sit cross-legged beside the bed and rested his elbows on his knees. This all went back to Zane\u2019s wife, he realized. It was a pretty common reaction when someone lost a person they loved; to close off and try to refuse to care or let anyone close. The bitch of it was that there was no way to guard against losing again and again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that nothing will,\u201d he finally answered with a shrug.</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cI know,\u201d he said in a pained voice. \u201cBut I still want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Ty asked gently.</p><p>Zane raised one shoulder in a confused shrug. \u201cYou said it: we get along best when we\u2019re fucking. How do we make that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything needs to be planned, Zane,\u201d Ty answered with a tinge of frustration. \u201cNot everything needs a why or how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we just see how it goes?\u201d Zane asked. Ty answered with a nod and smiled. Zane smiled slightly in return, the vise that had been around his chest finally eased. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Ty reached out and patted his knee almost delicately and then hefted himself off the floor.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hands almost itched with the need to touch Ty again, but he curled them into fists and cursed his nerves. See how it goes. Well, it wasn\u2019t going anywhere right this moment. He clambered off the bed and walked over to his jacket, poking through the pockets for his cigarettes. Ty was watching him silently, a crooked smirk curling his lips.</p><p>Zane turned around. When he saw Ty watching, he didn\u2019t move; he just stood there with his cigarettes in one hand and lighter in the other.</p><p>\u201cThose things\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Ty advised in amusement.</p><p>Looking at Ty ruefully, Zane shook his head and flipped him off as he walked to the door. \u201cLeave me at least one of my vices?\u201d he requested.</p><p>Ty sighed and watched him as he reached the door. \u201cThe pills are in my bag,\u201d he offered quietly.</p><p>Stopping at the door, Zane looked back over his shoulder at Ty. Yeah, he wanted the damn pills. Just a single thought and he was dying for them, for the artificial high and confidence he got from them. Having them around was like a burr stuck in his shirt, scraping his skin raw. He turned around. \u201cGive them over, please,\u201d he requested quietly.</p><p>Ty waited for a moment and then walked over to the bag to rummage through and find the tin. He held it up and rattled it, then tossed it to Zane without a word. Zane caught the tin deftly and looked down at it for a long moment. Then he moved, walking past Ty and into the bathroom, where he worked to pry the tin open. Ty lowered his head, listening intently and hoping to hear the flush of the toilet instead of the running of the water to fill a glass.</p><p>Zane stared down at the little pink pills. How big a deal was this?</p><p>They didn\u2019t hurt anyone but him ... and Ty. Zane turned his chin toward the door. Because Ty didn\u2019t want him doing the drugs. Caught in that thought, he turned the tin over and watched the pills fall into the toilet and sink to the bottom to land on white porcelain. Stone-cold sober, he flushed them down and tossed the tin into the garbage can with a clink.</p><p>When Zane turned around, he saw Ty standing there. He took two steps and captured Ty\u2019s mouth with his own, his hands closing gently about his face.</p><p>Ty returned the kiss with feeling, sliding his hands around Zane\u2019s hips and pulling him closer. \u201cGood boy,\u201d he murmured between kisses.</p><p>enninger called promptly at nine that morning, just a few hours after Zane flushed his pills. The young agent told Ty he\u2019d arranged to have Hone of the earlier crime scenes opened for them, because he knew how much Ty liked to go and stare, and they had to meet him as soon as possible before anyone got wind of it. He also had the personnel files for them, and there were some interesting things in there.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Ty asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cLike the number of people involved with this case that were in Baltimore in 2001,\u201d Henninger answered wryly. \u201cYou and me included, Special Agent Grady,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cAh, fuck,\u201d Ty muttered into the phone. \u201cBring them anyway, kiddo,\u201d</p><p>he requested as he gestured for Zane to hurry and get his shit together. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Henninger answered before ending the call.</p><p>As soon as the call was over, Zane and Ty scrambled, got down to their rental car in record time, and set off to drive across town to meet the other man.</p><p>Ty found himself pondering the way Tim Henninger had come through for them as he drove in the seventy-mile-an-hour traffic. He had seriously underestimated the kid. He would have to buy him dinner or something in apology.</p><p>In the passenger seat, Zane paged through a notepad of his own scribbling that he\u2019d grabbed on the way out the door. \u201cI\u2019m still unhappy about the evidence missing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cDifferent things from each case,\u201d Zane said. \u201cNo pattern I can see.</p><p>ME supplementary notes from one. Skin scrapings from another. Time notations from a third.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked over at him and frowned. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarge assumption: If he\u2019s making a different mistake each time and managing to clean up after himself, we might be able to create additional profile information,\u201d Zane said. \u201cAreas he\u2019s weak in. That\u2019s assuming it\u2019s all not just human error.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d Ty drawled. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like trying to see a puzzle that\u2019s all been painted over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can still match the edges,\u201d Zane said distractedly as he started making notations on a yellow legal pad in his lap.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything missing from the murders that occurred after the computer exploded?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Zane flipped through his notes, frowning. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think he removed that shit as bait,\u201d Ty claimed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>The loose papers scattered across his lap as their car was thumped hard from behind.</p><p>Ty was thrown forward with the impact, but he kept the car straight as his head jerked. He glanced into the rearview mirror and frowned at the yellow cab behind them. The windshield had been illegally tinted until you could barely see through it, and the call numbers had been removed. \u201cUh oh,\u201d</p><p>he muttered.</p><p>Turning around in the seat, Zane tried to look as the cab hit them again, harder this time. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he hissed. Before they could react, the cab swerved slightly to ram the back passenger quarter panel of their car, pushing them toward the concrete median wall.</p><p>Ty tensed, his mind going blank and relying on training and instinct rather than common sense as he handled the nearly out-of-control vehicle. He watched the cab out of the corner of his eye in order to anticipate the next attack, and he kept his attention on the concrete barrier and his hands on the wheel.</p><p>Zane pulled his gun out, looking back at the looming vehicle as it hit them again, this time actually revving the engine and pushing them. The collision was hard enough to jostle them both, and Zane had to grab the door handle. Other cars in the two lanes to their left honked and swerved wildly, skidding to keep from hitting them or the wall.</p><p>\u201cFucker,\u201d Ty growled. This was the fuck who\u2019d been killing. This was the fuck who\u2019d tried to kill them. He was sure of it. \u201cHold on,\u201d he said to Zane with a dangerous glint in his eyes, and he slammed on the brakes, sending the rear end of their vehicle crashing into the front of the cab in retaliation.</p><p>Biting off a curse, Zane braced himself against the dashboard just in time with his free hand as they jerked back and forth. Ty hit the gas once more and sped up, leaving the cab lagging behind.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, I can\u2019t see him,\u201d Zane ground out, trying to get a look through the tinted windshield as the cab advanced again, pulling partway up the passenger side to knock them closer to the barrier. \u201cThe sides are blacked out, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t risk being seen,\u201d Ty said through gritted teeth as he veered the rental car into the cab with a crunch of metal and the burning stench of rubber. Whoever the man was, though, he was good with a speeding car. Instead of veering out of control, he turned the cab to meet the push, crashing the two cars together so hard that sparks flew and smoke began to churn out of the cab\u2019s ruined grill.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take a shot, even to take out the tires. He\u2019ll kill somebody besides us,\u201d Zane said sharply as the driver gunned the cab\u2019s engine to pull up beside them on the passenger side. The driver swerved over to smash the cars together again, hitting the passenger side, pushing them within a few feet of the wall as Ty tried desperately to keep them from going out of control. Zane could see the cab gaining on his side of the car for another attempt. \u201cHe\u2019s coming....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty ground out as the side of their car squealed against the concrete. The cab smashed into their side again and the metal of the passenger door screeched and crumpled alarmingly. Ty glanced over at it, taking his eyes off the road for a second to see Zane leaning and struggling to pull his arm away from the door. If the cab smashed them again, one of them was getting hurt, and Ty could easily see who it was going to be. He glanced in the rearview mirror again, seeing that the traffic they had passed was slowing and giving the two dueling cars a wide berth. \u201cHold on,\u201d he breathed as his peripheral vision caught the cab swerving for another impact.</p><p>He slammed on the brakes to avoid the coming collision. The back wheels smoked as they locked, and the vehicle fishtailed dangerously as the Ford struggled to go from eighty to stop in no time flat. Despite the seat belt, Zane was thrown forward and his free hand landed on the dashboard to catch himself, his gun thumping to the console between the seats. The cab veered into their lane, finding nothing to slam into since they were no longer beside him, then it accelerated in a burst of black smoke as the Ford finally fishtailed out of control and hit the wall with its back left panel. The front tire blew, then the back, and the rental car left the ground, spinning gracefully into the air and then crashing back down onto its side.</p><p>Zane gasped aloud as the seat belt caught him painfully across the chest and snapped him against the door when the car upended. The Ford smashed against the blacktop on the passenger side and slid, only to slow and slam against a hapless motorist before crashing back onto all four wheels.</p> <p>The crumpled car finally drifted to a weaving, smoking stop just inches from the concrete as the cab disappeared out of sight ahead of them. Ty sat with his hands clutching the wheel, knuckles white and breathing hard as sirens began to sound somewhere in the distance.</p><p>Beside him, Zane leaned against the crunched passenger door, his entire right side a mass of swamping pain. Glancing over to the driver\u2019s side, Zane didn\u2019t see any blood on Ty as the man sat staring out the windshield.</p><p>Zane glanced up around them to see if help was close, only to see the cab about fifty yards away\u2014facing them\u2014and he could see the tires spinning as the driver held down the brake and revved the engine. All traffic on their side of the highway had come to a stop; the lanes littered with wrecked cars and stunned motorists.</p><p>Zane\u2019s voice was strained and stunned as he spoke. \u201cTy. Ty, we gotta get out. Get out of your seat belt.\u201d He tried to pull away from the passenger-side door and excruciating pain tore through his entire body in burning waves, taking his breath away.</p><p>Ty sat staring at the menacingly crushed front grill of the cab in the distance, unmoving as Zane gave the ruined door several weak sideways kicks, trying to free himself. Calmly, as if in a daze, Ty reached up and began plucking away what shards remained of the moonroof\u2019s glass.</p> <p>Zane swallowed hard as his vision began to fade and blur. He was going into shock. \u201cI can\u2019t get out that way,\u201d he told Ty, gritting his teeth.</p><p>Ty looked at him, still in a calm, detached sort of haze. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck,\u201d he murmured as he reached across Zane\u2019s chest and prodded the metal where the other man\u2019s arm was captured. He glanced up at the cab, then reached across Zane\u2019s lap to the seat handle that would lay the seat back. It didn\u2019t budge, and Ty turned his head slightly, his nose brushing against Zane\u2019s cheek. He glanced again to see the cab begin its run, heading toward them on a sure collision course. It would gain speed quickly, and then the impact would come. The heavy steel construction of the old car would tear the battered Ford to pieces.</p><p>Ty clambered to stand on the middle console, rising up out of the moonroof as he drew his gun. He waited a half-second and then opened fire.</p><p>The yellow paint on the hood of the cab began to dent and explode as the bullets hit, and the safety glass shattered, but didn\u2019t break. The illegal tinting inside the windshield kept it from falling apart as it was riddled with bullet holes. Ty couldn\u2019t see the driver or tell if he was hitting him. He lowered his aim and began trying for the tires, but his gun clicked empty and he shouted a frustrated curse.</p><p>He reached for his backup as the cab barreled toward them, but he couldn\u2019t reach it in the small confines. He contorted with difficulty and snagged Zane\u2019s gun from where it had landed on the dash during the roll and straightened back up, aiming for the lower part of the car.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Ty, get out of the car!\u201d Zane yelled, his voice breaking as the pain began to overwhelm his emotional control. His eyes flickered between the oncoming car and his lover, and he pushed against Ty\u2019s legs with his free hand.</p> <p>One of the front tires blew out as Ty emptied the clip again, ignoring Zane\u2019s demands, but the cab continued to limp toward them at alarming speed. It was almost on them. If the crash didn\u2019t kill them, the man inside the cab would.</p><p>Ty fired the last round, then reared back and chucked the empty gun at the cab in utter frustration before he ducked back into the car. He just shook his head wordlessly, awkwardly kneeling on the console as he tried to free Zane\u2019s arm from between the torn metal of the door and the crumpled frame.</p><p>He knew that even if he got Zane free now, it was too late. But it wasn\u2019t in him to give up.</p><p>\u201cShit, Ty, you can\u2019t take my damn arm off! Please ... baby,\u201d Zane\u2019s voice cracked with agony as he pleaded between uneven gasping breaths.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the car,\u201d he ordered weakly.</p><p>Ty responded with a small, chaste kiss. As he heard the roaring of the battered cab\u2019s engine coming closer he curled protectively around Zane, hoping to shield him from the brunt of the crash. He tried not to tense, but his physical discipline was no match for simple human instinct. As the cab barreled toward them, he hunched his shoulders and prepared for the impact.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he breathed as he closed his eyes tight and waited.</p><p>\u201cTy...,\u201d Zane choked out as he curled his free arm around Ty\u2019s back, holding him tight and turning his face into his neck. Christ. Forget about not being there. This. This was Zane\u2019s worst nightmare.</p> <p>The sound of the sirens was closer now, and through his closed eyelids Ty could see the changing light and dark that told him the flashing lights were on top of them. There was a sound of squealing tires and the smell of burning rubber. He raised his head and opened his eyes, knowing the impact should have come already. He turned and looked out the cracked window at the yellow blur of the cab as the driver turned at the last minute, spinning out right beside their wrecked Ford on the highway. He turned out of the spin, gunned the engine, and headed off in the other direction. Several squad cars gave chase, flying by the wreck of their vehicle in a blaze of light and sound.</p><p>The driver knew he couldn\u2019t finish them off and still get away. He had chosen to fight another day, and he\u2019d left Ty and Zane alive to do it.</p><p>When Ty shifted, Zane opened his eyes to blurrily see the cab retreating and police cars stopping around them. He started to shake. Shock.</p><p>He was going into shock. His arm was already numb, and the pain was still shooting up into his shoulder and down his back. His side was screaming and he couldn\u2019t feel his leg. \u201cWhen we get out of this car I am kicking your ass,\u201d</p><p>he rasped.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t respond. He was already climbing through the roof and holding up his badge and his empty gun, handle first, calling out the code for an officer down.</p><p>ZANE sat in the back of the ambulance with a blanket over his shoulders and lap as the EMT worked him over. He stayed put, cowed by a tiny woman who barked at him when he\u2019d tried to leave without medical treatment. All he\u2019d allowed was an IV of clear fluids, and he\u2019d checked the bags. What she was doing hurt like hell (he\u2019d also insisted on no painkillers after a very few words with her about the past addiction record) so he was focusing hard on what was going on away from the ambulance.</p><p>Ty stood talking with some of the cops. Luckily, they\u2019d not given him any trouble, none that Zane saw anyway. The EMT found another broken rib and Zane hissed, jerking away instinctively.</p><p>\u201cDoing okay, Special Agent Garrett?\u201d the EMT asked.</p><p>\u201cStill here,\u201d he answered hoarsely after pulling away the oxygen mask. His eyes were still glassy and glazed with pain.</p><p>\u201cFeeling light-headed again?\u201d she asked, pausing in her examination.</p><p>\u201cJust get it over with, huh?\u201d he said weakly, leaning his head sideways against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI told you already, I can\u2019t do anything more for you here. You\u2019re going to have to go to the hospital and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do whatever you have to do,\u201d Zane interrupted. \u201cI have to be able to use that arm.\u201d It would be his right arm. He swallowed hard. \u201cSet it and do whatever.\u201d</p><p>The EMT stared at him silently. When she spoke, her voice was thin.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much you\u2019re going to hurt?\u201d</p><p>Zane turned his chin so he could look at his mangled arm and then at her. \u201cYeah, I know. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>Frowning deeply, she got to her feet and climbed into the ambulance with practiced ease. Zane just closed his eyes. He was going to pass out; he knew it. When he opened his eyes again, he found that Ty had finally managed to break away from the cops who\u2019d been asking him questions and was making his way hastily toward the ambulance.</p><p>He glared his way past a man who tried to stop him, and he came up to Zane with a twisting sensation in his gut. He could take pain himself, but he couldn\u2019t take watching other people go through it. Especially not people he cared for.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t they drugged you yet?\u201d he asked Zane in outrage.</p><p>Zane pulled the mask away to answer, but the EMT beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cHe declined pain treatment,\u201d she said, voice clearly disapproving.</p><p>\u201cWell, fuck that, give it to him anyway,\u201d Ty demanded with an impressive scowl.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said sharply. \u201cYou pump me full of something strong enough to help, and I\u2019ll be out of commission for two days and then suffering another week of cravings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA local won\u2019t cause drug cravings, moron!\u201d Ty shouted angrily.</p><p>Zane merely shook his head stubbornly.</p><p>The EMT looked between them, scowling heavily. \u201cSpecial Agent Garrett, please reconsider,\u201d she asked, voice soft. \u201cThe pain from the broken bones is just going to grow worse; you\u2019re already well in shock. And your partner is right. I can give you a local for your arm and it has nothing to do with\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zane looked up at Ty and shook his head, cutting her off. \u201cGo make arrangements for a car,\u201d he rasped to his partner. \u201cYou didn\u2019t listen before.</p><p>Listen now. Go and come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Ty huffed. \u201cGive him the drugs,\u201d he told the EMT.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give him the drugs if he doesn\u2019t consent,\u201d the woman said helplessly.</p><p>The corner of Zane\u2019s mouth turned up triumphantly, although his eyes drilled into Ty. But he was still shaking slightly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s severely injured,\u201d Ty argued calmly, looking at the woman intently. \u201cHe\u2019s not mentally capable of making the decision,\u201d he said pointedly.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and she looked from him to Zane and back.</p><p>\u201cWhat? The hell I\u2019m not,\u201d Zane said hoarsely. \u201cWhat are you trying to do to me?\u201d he demanded of Ty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to keep you out of the fucking hospital,\u201d Ty snarled.</p><p>\u201cGive him the shot,\u201d he told the woman. \u201cYou know if he goes catatonic from the pain you\u2019ll just have to do it then, and take him to the hospital, and shoot me because I\u2019ll have to kill someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, goddammit, we have things we have to do. I can\u2019t be stoned out of my mind for an hour, much less a day\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cA local wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d Ty interrupted in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat if that son of a bitch comes back after ... what the hell?\u201d Zane stood up in a rush and his head snapped around as the EMT stepped back, pulling an empty syringe from the IV feed line.</p><p>Ty pointed at her and gave a triumphant little, \u201cHa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Special Agent Garrett, you\u2019re exhibiting strong symptoms of shock,\u201d she said soothingly, laying her hand over the IV shunt in his arm, making sure he didn\u2019t yank it out. Her eyes shifted from Zane\u2019s badly broken arm again over to Ty. \u201cYou need to sit down right now. I\u2019ve given you a sedative and something to help with the pain.\u201d</p><p>Zane took two steps right up into Ty\u2019s face. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to a partner and expect there to be any lev ... level of tr\u2014trus....\u201d His knees started to give out as he blinked slowly.</p><p>Ty took him by his good arm and eased him toward the stretcher he had refused to use before. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about trust later, Special Agent Garrett,\u201d he cooed as he forced Zane down.</p><p>Wobbling as he sat back down, Zane\u2019s eyes glazed. \u201cTy,\u201d he said pleadingly as he sagged against the stretcher, laying out flat as Ty and the paramedic moved his nearly limp body. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ty held him down until he was certain Zane wouldn\u2019t thrash around when released. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured as his hands slipped away once Zane\u2019s eyes closed. He looked up at the EMT and sighed dejectedly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled, but looked nonplussed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s not out cold. We should take him to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do the hospital,\u201d Ty told her softly. \u201cNot safe there.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as if she understood, then looked between them thoughtfully. \u201cSo he\u2019s your partner?\u201d she asked carefully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty nodded as he looked back down at Zane, not even catching that there was more than one meaning to the question. \u201cWe\u2019re working a case,\u201d he answered distractedly as he pulled out his badge and showed it to her. The action was completely habitual. \u201cBeen a bad one,\u201d he murmured quietly.</p><p>The EMT glanced at the badge. \u201cSo he\u2019s your partner at work,\u201d she clarified.</p><p>Ty looked over at her and blinked stupidly. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked in confusion.</p><p>The woman smiled a little. \u201cI asked if he\u2019s your partner at work.</p> <p>You\u2019re looking a little wobbly yourself. Why don\u2019t you sit down, Special Agent....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrady,\u201d Ty supplied as he frowned. \u201cYes, he\u2019s my partner at work,\u201d</p><p>he echoed, still confused by her interest. \u201cI don\u2019t need to sit down,\u201d he added stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI just thought you might want to stick around. He should be out for about thirty minutes. He\u2019s still going to hurt when he wakes up, though. He told me about why he didn\u2019t want the drugs.\u201d She gave him an even look. \u201cWho are you to him to countermand his decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his partner,\u201d Ty answered defensively, beginning to bristle a little under the scrutiny. \u201cYou knew as well as I did that he wouldn\u2019t be able to take it. Common sense trumps alcoholism every day of the week, Sunshine.</p> <p>He\u2019ll thank us later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know it\u2019s more than alcoholism, right?\u201d she asked as she instructed another EMT to set Zane\u2019s arm and wrap it up while he was out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re so protective,\u201d she continued as she took Ty\u2019s arm and pulled him gently away. \u201cOf your partner.\u201d</p><p>Ty was getting annoyed and beginning to suspect that she could tell he hadn\u2019t exactly made it out of the car without injuries either. He could feel the urge to bark at the woman and he stamped it down, just hoping to get away without being doctored. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point, Princess?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cHonestly? I\u2019m trying to decide if you care enough about him to take care of him after this. He\u2019s going to be a mess for a couple days, at least. Broken bones all over, the sedative and his reactions to it. Seemed to me you were worried enough that he might be more than just a partner. Maybe a friend?\u201d She stood and straightened, not bothered at all that she was more than a foot shorter than Ty. \u201cNow. Tell me what I want to hear, or I\u2019m shipping him off to Lenox Hill. And unbutton your shirt; I see bruising,\u201d she demanded as she pointed at his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to hear?\u201d Ty asked as he pulled the top of his shirt together to hide the bruising from his seat belt, his frustrated voice going slightly higher than it normally did.</p> <p>\u201cGrady?\u201d a soft voice called from amidst the crowd of police, firemen, and EMTs. Ty turned distractedly to see Henninger making his way precariously through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he said to the man with a dismissive wave of his hand, looking back at the woman.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to take care of him?\u201d she asked bluntly. \u201cOr do I need to find someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a fucking doctor? That\u2019s what he needs, right?\u201d Ty asked in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Henninger asked as he jogged up to them.</p><p>\u201cJesus. Is he dead?\u201d he asked as he looked down at Zane.</p><p>The woman shook her head, face hardening. \u201cGo take care of your business, Special Agent Grady.\u201d She turned away and joined the other paramedic in tending to Zane\u2019s more severe wounds. They worked on the arm, one holding a preformed brace as the other wrapped his now-set arm into it.</p><p>Ty fought back the urge to reach out and throttle the infuriating woman. He looked down at Zane and his features softened unconsciously as he watched them lift him carefully to wrap his ribs tightly. \u201cHow long is he going to hurt?\u201d he asked as Henninger stepped closer and peered down at Zane as well.</p> <p>Zane was jostled as the stretcher was moved around, wheeling him toward the back of the waiting ambulance. The agent didn\u2019t even protest as they moved him, just sluggishly stared into nothing when he should have been unconscious. \u201cHe\u2019s going to hurt for a while. A week, at least. Two is more likely. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s three or four. He\u2019s dislocated his shoulder, broken two bones in his forearm, cracked four ribs, had his brain rattled around in his skull, and his hip is badly bruised,\u201d she said grimly.</p><p>\u201cLooks like his knee may be out, too. He\u2019s a mess. I don\u2019t know how he expects to operate without painkillers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s out of commission,\u201d Ty muttered with a defeated look at Zane as they moved him.</p><p>She shrugged in answer.</p><p>\u201cBut how...\u201d Henninger started, but glares from both Ty and the EMT shut him up.</p><p>Ty was torn. He\u2019d already stepped over the line by forcing the anesthesia on Zane, though why the EMT hadn\u2019t just done a local he couldn\u2019t guess. She obviously knew more about it all than he did.</p><p>Should he call Burns and let him know Zane was out of service? He certainly wouldn\u2019t be much good to the case now. Perhaps Ty should have Burns send someone new in. Or he could keep going on his own until Zane recovered, although he knew he couldn\u2019t do this alone. He wasn\u2019t as smart as the killer. He didn\u2019t know what to do, and the indecisiveness was as annoying to him as it was uncharacteristic.</p><p>\u201cGarrett can\u2019t work like that. You\u2019re going to have to call in and have him taken off the case,\u201d Henninger advised as he watched Ty think it over.</p><p>\u201cA case is the last thing Special Agent Garrett should be worrying about,\u201d the EMT offered.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Ty asked them both distractedly. \u201cHow did you get here, anyway?\u201d he asked the young agent with sudden annoyance.</p><p>\u201cI was waiting to meet you, heard about this mess over the radio, and got a bad feeling about it since you were late. When you got later, I decided to drive up here just in case and I saw you standing by the wreck,\u201d Henninger answered defensively. He glanced to the EMT uncertainly, and she rolled her eyes and walked the few steps to climb up into the truck with her patient.</p><p>\u201cLook, Grady,\u201d Henninger continued. \u201cCatching this serial is more important than keeping Zane Garrett on the job.\u201d</p><p>Ty was shocked that he almost found himself agreeing with the sentiment. He blinked at the man and then looked over at Zane, who was obviously struggling with the effects of the drugs. \u201cYou ever been asked the question \u2018Who would you choose to save? A hundred strangers or one family member?\u2019\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Henninger drew back in surprise and a hint of concern. \u201cNo,\u201d he said cautiously. \u201cBut I\u2019d answer a hundred strangers. That\u2019s our job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the noble answer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ty murmured as he looked back at Zane.</p><p>\u201cWe have a responsibility. If that\u2019s noble, then....\u201d Henninger shrugged, frowning as he noticed Ty\u2019s attention wavering. \u201cYou know it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care, anyway?\u201d Ty asked him in slightly desperate whisper.</p><p>\u201cI care about catching the guy who\u2019s going around cutting people into such small chunks you could make Hamburger Helper with them!\u201d Henninger retorted. \u201cI\u2019d care about that more than I\u2019d care about one man who I can barely stand to work with.\u201d</p><p>Ty was still aware enough of his surroundings not to argue that point.</p><p>\u201cDo you have your car?\u201d he asked Henninger hoarsely without answering.</p><p>Henninger blinked at the sudden change in topic. \u201cYeah,\u201d he answered warily.</p><p>\u201cCan he ride?\u201d Ty called out to the EMT inside the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cIf you can make him sign this release, he\u2019s all yours,\u201d the woman yelled back.</p><p>Ty cringed and looked back at Henninger. \u201cGo get your car,\u201d he told the kid softly. \u201cWe\u2019re getting him the hell out of here,\u201d he muttered as he headed for the ambulance.</p><p>Before Ty could get there, Zane stepped down out of the truck, holding tightly to the grab bar as the paramedic held the clipboard and the signed release form up behind him for Ty to see. Zane\u2019s glazed eyes were blazing with anger, and he was trembling from the pain and the drugs. \u201cYou goddamn piece of shit,\u201d he said thickly, obviously trying to throw off the effects of the sedative.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ty agreed unapologetically as he reached out to support Zane. How the man was walking, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Zane was wobbly and weak, and he hated that he felt like he was moving through water and seeing through a haze. A red haze, but still a haze.</p><p>He had to lean heavily on Ty when the other man slipped under his good arm.</p><p>He thought about cussing some more, but all that came out was a hiss of pain, and his knees tried to give out on him. \u201cBitch gave me a shot, goddammit,\u201d he muttered mostly to himself. \u201cI am so fucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ty repeated as he tried to support him without hurting him or himself. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be just fine,\u201d he promised. \u201cHenninger\u2019s got cigarettes for you,\u201d he said as if in consolation as he nodded at the kid.</p><p>Henninger watched them with wide, confused eyes before nodding quickly and fishing for his keys. \u201cIn the car,\u201d he told Zane agreeably.</p><p>Zane grimaced. \u201cWhy does everything hurt when just one side got banged up? And why did it have to be my gun arm?\u201d he half-whined as Ty got him walking, albeit unsteadily, to follow Henninger, who took off ahead to get his car and move it closer.</p><p>\u201cI used all your ammo anyway,\u201d Ty grumbled. \u201cAnd then threw your gun at a car. Have fun filling out that paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Zane managed to clear through the haze enough to look at Ty as they struggled through the crowd. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I say yes, will it make you not mad at me?\u201d Ty asked almost teasingly, his voice slightly strained under the bigger man\u2019s weight.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane bit out. He went quiet as they walked several steps. \u201cI asked you to get out of the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust not have heard you,\u201d Ty murmured in response.</p><p>\u201cI begged you,\u201d Zane said weakly, but his hand tightened on Ty\u2019s arm. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ty repeated softly, looking around at the various pods of people being tended to and interviewed as they made their way practically unnoticed through them, following Henninger toward the concrete barrier.</p><p>Henninger pulled up nearly in front of them as they broke free of the perimeter of the wreck site on the other side of the closed-off highway, and Ty groaned as he looked at the two-foot-high concrete median wall.</p><p>Henninger hopped out and stood on the other side indecisively, unsure of how to help.</p><p>Zane focused on the wall and sighed. \u201cShit. It\u2019s never easy, is it?\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he blinked hard and lifted his weight off Ty to stand up straight. By force of will he walked the two steps to the barrier and stepped over it. Both Ty and Henninger had their hands out around him, hovering protectively and looking like parents watching their firstborn take a step. Zane couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at the two of them as he took the three more steps to the car and sagged against it. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m done,\u201d he whispered as the pain from his whole right side echoed through him.</p><p>Ty hopped the barrier behind him as Henninger opened the back door for him. \u201cWhere to?\u201d Henninger asked worriedly as Ty helped Zane into the back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Ty answered in a low growl. \u201cSomewhere safe.\u201d</p><p>Zane sagged back against the seat and closed his eyes, holding his arm close against his chest protectively. His jacket sleeve hung loose over the sling, sliced in several long pieces.</p><p>Nodding, the young agent pulled into traffic and got them moving.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need help, Grady. Should I call Sears and Ross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty grunted in answer. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna help me,\u201d he said in a low, even voice.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Henninger bleated, looking into the mirror again. \u201cI don\u2019t have field experience. Sears and Ross would be a lot more help since Garrett can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Ty was glaring at him in the rearview mirror, and he trailed off and cleared his throat. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is we need backup,\u201d he continued quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think your presence in New York is going to be all over the Bureau now that this shit has gone down?\u201d</p><p>Ty rubbed his eyes and looked out the window, then back at Zane once more. He had laid his head against Ty\u2019s shoulder and wasn\u2019t moving at all, and Ty thought he might have passed out. \u201cCall \u2019em,\u201d he grunted softly.</p><p>Henninger nodded. \u201cWhat are you going to do with Garrett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking know!\u201d Ty answered in frustration as he fought with the decisions. \u201cAny suggestions?\u201d</p><p>Henninger looked at him hesitantly. \u201cCould take him to my place,\u201d he offered. Ty frowned at him, nodding. Zane trusted Henninger, and for the most part, so did Ty. They could leave Zane at his place with a guard detail and then they would go after the fucker. There was a hot trail to follow, and part of Ty resented the fact that he was in this car with his injured partner rather than on that trail right now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s secure,\u201d Henninger assured him. \u201cKey card to get in, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake us there,\u201d Ty ordered as he pulled his mind off the man who had gone slack against him and back on the man who had once again almost killed them both.</p><p>A thirty-minute drive through thick traffic later, Henninger parked the car in the garage under his building and turned to look at them. \u201cHow are we getting him upstairs?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow far is it?\u201d Ty inquired as he took stock of his own injuries. He had failed to mention the possible cracked rib or sprained wrist to the EMT, and his chest was killing him where the seat belt had cut into him. But he could carry Zane if he had to.</p><p>\u201cAbout forty feet to the elevator, then another fifty to the apartment,\u201d</p><p>Henninger said, looking unsure. \u201cCould be more.\u201d</p> <p>Ty groaned and shook his head. He wouldn\u2019t make it that far, and there was no way he\u2019d risk dropping Zane and causing further injury.</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d he murmured in Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cWake up, man. We need you to walk.\u201d</p><p>Zane stirred. \u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cWe there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty answered with a flood of relief. He hadn\u2019t relished the idea of dragging Zane\u2019s heavy frame through the building. \u201cCome on,\u201d he murmured with a pat to Zane\u2019s head, fighting back the urge to make a gesture more intimate in front of Henninger.</p><p>The bigger man groaned and sat up. \u201cI feel like I got hit by a truck, and it\u2019s all your fault,\u201d he accused weakly.</p> <p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s all my fault,\u201d Ty murmured agreeably as he slid out the back of the car and pulled Zane carefully with him. \u201cTechnically, you should be feeling really good,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cToo much pain negates the effects of happy juice,\u201d Zane croaked as Ty got him out of the car. \u201cToo much abuse negates the body\u2019s reaction,\u201d he added, all too familiar with the medical reasoning. He leaned on the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d he asked tiredly. His face was gray, and his shoulders hunched as he cradled his arm and babied his ribs.</p><p>\u201cElevator,\u201d Henninger said. \u201cCome on. When we get upstairs, I\u2019ll call Ross and Sears, fill them in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Zane asked, voice sharpening in surprise.</p><p>\u201cBackup,\u201d Ty answered in almost a whisper as he slid under Zane\u2019s good arm and urged him to walk before he fell over.</p> <p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Zane repeated as they made their way to the elevator. He wasn\u2019t leaning on Ty as much, but he was still dizzy and wobbly.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to babysit you,\u201d Henninger offered.</p><p>Zane stopped dead in his tracks. \u201cWhat!?\u201d he barked.</p><p>Ty winced and tightened his hold. \u201cThank you, Henninger,\u201d he snapped in annoyance. \u201cGarrett, come on before you fall over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis conversation is not over,\u201d Zane growled as he got to walking again.</p><p>Henninger got to the elevator first and hit the up button. \u201cCome on, Garrett, be realistic. You can\u2019t go out in the field in this condition. You\u2019re dead weight now,\u201d he observed clinically.</p><p>Ty winced again at the delivery of the logic, but he knew it was true.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered to Zane. \u201cIt\u2019s this or the hospital, either way with a guard detail. You ain\u2019t going back in the field,\u201d he declared with finality.</p> <p>Zane didn\u2019t answer as they got into the elevator, and he didn\u2019t say anything the rest of the way to the apartment. His face was strained and white as they went inside.</p><p>Henninger pointed them toward the bedroom. \u201cThis is a restored building from the turn of the century, so the doorways are wide; that ought to help,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the architecture.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded disinterestedly.</p><p>\u201cThe parking garage was the best perk,\u201d Henninger rambled on. \u201cNot many buildings like this have them. And they even kept the original tunnels below the building intact for storage units. Nobody uses them, though. They used to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Ty grunted as he guided Zane toward the bedroom.</p><p>The bed was made neatly, with an almost military precision that even a Marine could appreciate. The room, like the rest of the apartment, was uncluttered, almost Spartan in its simplicity. Somehow, it didn\u2019t fit the image he had of Henninger. \u201cGarrett?\u201d he breathed as he helped him to the bed.</p><p>Lowering himself to the edge of the bed, Zane looked up slowly, not at Ty, but at the other agent. Henninger took a step back. \u201cUh. I\u2019ll go call the others and get them over here,\u201d he said before disappearing.</p><p>Left alone with Zane, Ty was silent, waiting for either the blowup or\u2014what he feared worse\u2014complete silence. And that was what he got as Zane dropped his chin and stared at the floor. He raised his hand to rub his eyes. He looked like he was ready to fall over. Ty swallowed heavily and put a hand to Zane\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you lay back?\u201d he said softly, his tone resigned.</p><p>Zane reached up to take Ty\u2019s wrist in a firm grip and pull his hand away, but he didn\u2019t let go. Ty was still, holding his breath as he waited.</p><p>Slowly, Zane looked up at him. His dark eyes watered with pain and emotion.</p><p>\u201cWe can still cut and run,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ty\u2019s chest tightened, and his insides seemed to lurch with the words.</p><p>He nodded as he let his fingers curl over, trying to touch the hand that still gripped his wrist. \u201cWe will. But I need revenge first,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow furrowed as he loosened his fingers. \u201cWhat for?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Ty answered simply.</p><p>Zane exhaled painfully, and he tugged gently at Ty\u2019s hand, trying to get him to lean over. Ty moved with the tug and licked his lips nervously.</p><p>Zane merely looked him in the eye as he got closer. \u201cYou come back, you understand?\u201d he rasped intently. \u201cIf I have to come after you there will be absolute hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and butted his head against Zane\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat could go wrong, hmm?\u201d he asked softly, a small smile playing at his lips. \u201cI\u2019ve got the kid with me, we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, who we\u2019re after, or what we\u2019ll do when we find him.... It\u2019s foolproof.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers gripped Ty\u2019s chin, and he moved to kiss Ty desperately, palm sliding down to cup the nape of Ty\u2019s neck as their lips moved against one another. Ty breathed out heavily into the kiss, almost losing his resolve not to do exactly what Zane had suggested: cut and run.</p><p>Leave this all behind and just get the two of them to safety. He slid his hand across Zane\u2019s cheek and kissed him as if it were the last time.</p><p>All the pain and fear and upset and desire balled up in Zane\u2019s gut, and his breath stopped as he gripped his lover\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCome back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Ty assured him softly. From the outer room they heard the obvious crackle of a radio and Henninger\u2019s muffled response. Ty pulled away and looked down into Zane\u2019s eyes. He slipped him his backup sidearm.</p><p>\u201cAnyone comes too close, you blast \u2019em,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBadge or not,\u201d he added pointedly, his voice so low it was a whisper.</p><p>Letting out a shaky breath, Zane took the gun in his left hand, then slid it with a wince into his sling. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed, eyes trained on Ty.</p><p>Ty stood up and slid a plastic prescription bottle out of his back pocket, setting it by Zane\u2019s side. The other agent blinked at it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cPills I took from the EMT,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cShould get you through.\u201d Zane looked at the bottle and then at Ty. He nodded slowly. Ty began backing away from the bed slowly. \u201cSee you soon,\u201d he whispered before turning and exiting the room quickly.</p><p>Zane drew a breath to speak, but Ty was gone, and Zane didn\u2019t have the strength or ability to chase after him. He slowly lay down on his good side, head resting on a thin pillow. The words he\u2019d wanted to say were stuck in his throat, and he squeezed his eyes shut tight, tiny drops sparkling in his eyelashes.</p><p>IN the front room, Henninger turned as Ty reentered. \u201cGot him settled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettled as he\u2019s gonna be, anyway,\u201d Ty mumbled as he rubbed a spot of tension at the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI just got a call from a friend in the NYPD,\u201d Henninger told him excitedly. \u201cThey located the cab that was used.\u201d</p><p>Ty perked up and stared at him expectantly. The buzzer beside the door rang, and Henninger started toward the intercom to answer it. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Ty demanded impatiently. \u201cWhere\u2019d they find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot two blocks from here,\u201d Henninger answered with a grin as he pushed the button that would let Sears and Ross in.</p><p>Adrenaline began to pump through Ty\u2019s body as the prospect of catching the man became more plausible. If they had the cab, then they could follow the trail. And Ty could track anything and anyone, whether it was in backwoods, desert, or the streets of New York City, he was confident of that fact. They had him.</p><p>It was only a minute or so before Sears and Ross stepped through the door, but waiting for them to arrive was torturous. As they waited, Ty and Henninger stood at the large windows that lined the far side of the apartment, and Henninger explained to him what was around the neighborhood as they formed a plan of action.</p><p>\u201cGrady, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s good to see you again,\u201d Special Agent Sears greeted, brushing her blonde hair over her shoulder. \u201cHow is he?\u201d she asked with real concern.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hurt bad,\u201d Ty answered grimly.</p><p>Ross stood at her side, looking annoyed. \u201cWe tried calling you,\u201d he said to Henninger.</p><p>\u201cThis building\u2019s got shitty reception,\u201d Henninger muttered uncomfortably as he looked at his phone that had never rung.</p><p>Ty nodded at them both, suddenly very aware of the splatters of blood from the crash that spotted his rumpled clothing and the fact that he looked like he\u2019d been tumbled on high spin for an hour. It seemed to him that it spoke of his failures so far, that he hadn\u2019t even been able to protect his partner, much less catch the killer he\u2019d been set on.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d he said to them both quietly, not a trace of apology or embarrassment in his tone. There was impatience, however, and he was practically vibrating in his shoes.</p><p>Sears looked over him, but didn\u2019t comment. \u201cWe can stay a couple hours before they start asking us where the hell we\u2019ve disappeared to,\u201d she said apologetically. \u201cSo you better get going unless we make this official.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left our notes on the case in there with Garrett,\u201d Ty told her gruffly.</p><p>The unspoken reason\u2014in case neither of them lived long enough to share what they\u2019d found\u2014wasn\u2019t lost on anyone. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a stack of personnel files here that has the name of our killer in it somewhere,\u201d he added as he pointed to the files Henninger had put on the coffee table.</p><p>Henninger nodded and glanced between them uncomfortably. \u201cYou want to change your shirt, Grady?\u201d he asked finally, eyes drifting over the small amount of blood.</p><p>Ty glanced at him and then quietly shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019ll be more on it when we\u2019re done,\u201d he said in a low, soft voice.</p><p>Ross and Sears glanced at each other. \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to call in backup,\u201d Sears reminded disapprovingly.</p><p>Henninger nodded, turned to grab a small bag, and led the way out the door and to the elevator.</p><p>Neither man spoke as they headed out of the apartment. They rode down in the elevator in silence, Henninger glancing at Ty every few seconds as if wishing to say something. Finally, as the elevator came to a jolting stop at the parking deck floor, he cleared his throat and said, \u201cBefore we start this, I just want you to know, Special Agent Grady, it\u2019s been a real pleasure working with you. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at him as the doors whooshed quietly open. \u201cLikewise,\u201d</p><p>he said softly to the kid.</p><p>He stepped out of the elevator as Henninger gave him an almost shy smile. He looked out into the dark parking deck and stepped forward, but his progress was halted as a hand suddenly covered the lower part of his face. He struggled as he breathed in the sickly sweet scent that covered the handkerchief, but he had already inhaled too much of the chloroform, and he sank helplessly to his knees, not able to reach his gun or even strike out at his attacker.</p><p>The last sound he heard was a shout and struggle that seemed to be miles away and a distant thunk as his limp body hit the concrete floor.</p><p>Zane laid on Henninger\u2019s bed for a while, dozing, until he started hurting too much to rest. Dragging his eyes open, he spent a long Z minute looking at the bottle of pills Ty had left him. There was nothing more tempting than a bottle of painkillers when you had a legitimate reason to take them, but he didn\u2019t pick them up. Instead, he lurched out of the bed and walked out to the main room to find Ross pacing and Sears sitting and watching her partner calmly.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>They both looked at him as if they hadn\u2019t expected to see him at all.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be up,\u201d Sears admonished as she stood and made her way over to him. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stiff drink,\u201d Zane muttered, moving to sit in an armchair.</p><p>\u201cI would be more comfortable if you returned to the bed,\u201d Sears said to him soothingly, looking over at her partner pointedly.</p><p>\u201cLet him sit there if he wants,\u201d Ross replied with a wave of his hand.</p><p>\u201cCan I have a drink? Please?\u201d Zane asked pitifully. \u201cI don\u2019t care what. Tap water, anything.\u201d</p><p>Sears sighed, accepting the fact that Zane wasn\u2019t planning on listening, and she headed to Henninger\u2019s kitchen as her heels rapped on the wooden floors and echoed to the open ceilings. She began rummaging in the refrigerator as Ross came closer to Zane.</p><p>\u201cSo, the Bureau sent you in under the radar,\u201d he said to Zane with obvious disdain. \u201cBecause they thought we couldn\u2019t handle it on our own?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane rolled his head around carefully. \u201cBecause six Bureau personnel had already been killed or injured,\u201d he corrected. \u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to work in Baltimore in 2001, did you?\u201d</p><p>Ross snorted unhappily but shook his head in answer as he moved away again, pacing restlessly in much the same manner Ty always did. Zane watched him with a frown until Sears came out with a glass of sparkling liquid. \u201cThis was all I could find besides water,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pomegranate juice. Figured some sugar might do you good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Zane murmured, taking the glass and a long drink. \u201cSo, you two get to babysit me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the shelf right now, anyway,\u201d Sears answered loudly before Ross could respond. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t here,\u201d she went on more gently as she sat on the coffee table opposite Zane and crossed her legs daintily, \u201cwe would be drowning in paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced between the two with a growing smile. Ross grimaced and started pacing again. \u201cGotta love paperwork,\u201d he commented, eyes actually brightening a little. \u201cLately, I wish I\u2019d had more of it and less death and destruction.\u201d</p><p>Sears reached out and put a hand on his knee gently. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to be in the hospital?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the wire, what happened. We could set up a guard there. You\u2019ve got to be in a lot of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Marian, leave the man alone,\u201d Ross huffed. \u201cAnd stop batting your eyelashes at him,\u201d he added grumpily.</p><p>\u201cI am doing no such thing,\u201d Sears responded calmly as she maintained eye contact with Zane. \u201cDid they give you painkillers?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>Zane looked at her steadily and lied through his teeth without giving anything away. \u201cYeah, I took some already. And I\u2019m fine. Just worn out.\u201d</p><p>Sears narrowed her eyes but then nodded as she accepted what he said for truth. She seemed out of ideas, and she looked up at her partner for help.</p><p>Ross, who was still pacing behind Zane restlessly, just shrugged and gestured at him in agitation.</p><p>\u201cYou should be resting,\u201d Sears insisted as she sat and observed Zane.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t just watching him. She was observing. It reminded Zane of the way Ty watched people sometimes. Everything seemed to remind him of Ty lately. Ross came around to flop gracelessly into a nearby chair.</p><p>Aware of Sears\u2019 interest, Zane let his injured shoulder sag a little and the exhaustion show. No need for them to know exactly how bad of shape he was in ... just in case. He wasn\u2019t all that sure about Ross. \u201cYou trust Henninger enough to hop to and come running when he calls like that?\u201d he asked. \u201cI barely know the kid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHenninger\u2019s a better agent than he\u2019s given credit for,\u201d Sears answered neutrally. \u201cIf he says he needs help, then he needs help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou barely know the kid and yet he\u2019s your inside contact?\u201d Ross asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s who we got tagged with by the New York office when we got here,\u201d Zane allowed. \u201cWhen we came back, we used him \u2019cause he\u2019d helped us before. We needed someone who could get us information fast and dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s been so jumpy lately,\u201d Ross laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cPoor kid,\u201d Sears added with a fond smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat? He getting flack at the office?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cEvery time there was a loud noise somewhere, he would hit the ceiling,\u201d Sears told him with a smirk she tried to hide. \u201cApparently, he had a guilty conscience.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned a little. \u201cHe seemed okay when he was talking with us,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHuh.\u201d He shifted and slumped in the chair a little. \u201cSo.</p> <p>What\u2019s the story on you two?\u201d he drawled, looking between them.</p><p>Both agents looked back at him with suddenly unreadable expressions. Finally, Sears smiled slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll show you mine if you show me yours,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Zane immediately broke out in wheezing laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Sears wheedled with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ll spill on my partner if you tell me about yours.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted and peered at Sears as Ross protested noisily. \u201cWatch out,\u201d he told the woman with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how Grady behaves around a woman. He\u2019s an utter bastard.\u201d He sighed and some of the amusement died away. \u201cAs for me,\u201d he said quietly, dropped his eyes, and looked at his ring thoughtfully, \u201cI can\u2019t see another woman without thinking of my wife.\u201d</p><p>The teasing dropped away, and Sears smiled softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured in the tone of voice that said she knew Zane\u2019s wife had died rather than left him.</p><p>\u201cYou girls finished getting your nails done?\u201d Ross asked with a huff.</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Ross,\u201d Zane bit out, aggravation showing.</p><p>\u201cBoys, boys,\u201d Sears murmured as she stood and rolled her eyes.</p><p>Ross snapped his mouth closed and gave Zane an infuriating smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou look a little restless, Garrett,\u201d he observed with false sympathy.</p><p>\u201cHenninger told us about your Poe theory when we demanded to know why he needed us here. Why don\u2019t you explain that one to us if you need something to do?\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Zane glanced over at the wall of bookshelves nearby. \u201cSee if you can find a copy of Poe over there,\u201d he requested. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what we can find.\u201d</p><p>THE sound of scraping and the musty smell of something old and wet were the first things to batter Ty\u2019s senses. He groaned involuntarily and his head lolled, his chin resting on his chest as if he were upright rather than prostrate.</p><p>Slowly, with more effort than he liked, he forced one eye open. His eyelid was too heavy, though, and he soon closed it and raised his head to let it rest back against the cold, rough surface behind him. He was upright, he realized, but he didn\u2019t understand how he was capable of standing, or even sitting up. He was soon aware of labored breathing that wasn\u2019t his own coming from somewhere close, and then more scraping sounds came with it.</p><p>There was an odd, wet sound, followed by a few thuds that echoed hollowly, and more scraping.</p><p>\u201cGrady? Special Agent Grady, are you okay?\u201d The unfamiliar voice echoed in the darkness, bouncing around in the damp and distorting in a surreal manner.</p><p>Ty wasn\u2019t even sure he had really heard it. \u201cOkay?\u201d he echoed with difficulty. His tongue felt swollen and dry, and his throat was scratchy and painful as he spoke. His head pounded as if his ears had been filled with concrete. He blearily recognized the aftereffects of chloroform, and a cold fear began to twist in his chest.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re okay. I thought you might talk to me while I work.</p><p>Make the time pass faster.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised his head slightly, forcing his dry eyes open again and blinking in the weak, flickering light of a candle that was sitting on the floor next to him. It was dark otherwise, utterly so. Not a bit of natural light flowed around him, and the cold and damp gave him the distinct feeling of being in his grandmother\u2019s root cellar.</p><p>\u201cWork,\u201d he repeated as if testing the word. He swallowed painfully and then cleared his throat. The odd scraping noise stopped for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. You get to hang there and rest while I\u2019m working.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t seem very fair, does it? But I\u2019m pretty sure you wouldn\u2019t cooperate otherwise. Which is why you\u2019re tied up.\u201d</p><p>Ty let his head rest against the cold surface behind him again. It was rough, like brick or hewn rock. He had thought his limbs were just too heavy to move, but he tugged at the restraints on his arms with the sinking realization that he was restrained. A sound like a chain clanking met his ears, and he frowned in confusion. He was chained to a wall? Seriously? He realized, after hearing the man\u2019s words, that there was a rope of some sort wound under his arms and around his chest, holding him upright even as he slumped, and there were shackles around his ankles as well, keeping him pinned to the wall.</p><p>He squinted back out into the flickering darkness. The man seemed to be working by candlelight as well. Ty glanced down at the candle sitting in a pool of melted wax at his feet. Staring at it, he remembered tidbits from his childhood that had never really surfaced in his adult life. The old miners in his hometown in West Virginia had always told stories about the candles they carried with them underground, as well as flashlights. When the light died, you had to hustle your ass out of there because the oxygen was either going or gone and you were next. It was cheaper than a canary.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re underground,\u201d he stated stupidly.</p><p>\u201cVery good!\u201d the distorted voice said sarcastically. \u201cYou must be shaking it off quicker than I expected. Luckily, I planned for that.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned harder and turned his head to the side, groaning as the motion caused his head to swim. \u201cDid you kill the kid?\u201d he asked the man with a tinge of anguish he was ashamed to let creep into his voice.</p><p>The man responded with a short laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll find he\u2019s just fine,\u201d he answered drolly, then paused as if in thought. \u201cActually, no, you won\u2019t. But someone else will. Perhaps your partner.\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes at the lance of pain that went through him at that thought. Zane. His mind was foggy, and he tried desperately to rally.</p><p>\u201cGarrett\u2019s not gonna be amused by this,\u201d he told the man, trying in vain to squeeze his hands through the antique shackles. They were far too tight, though, and the rough metal cut at him as he tugged. \u201cYou picked the wrong one to play with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d the man answered, his voice bouncing off the subterranean walls. \u201cYou\u2019re much more dangerous than your partner, you see.</p><p>He\u2019s an addict and an alcoholic, and you were the only thing keeping him from fucking himself into the ground. You and I both know it.\u201d The voice sounded oddly pleased.</p><p>Ty felt himself go cold as he listened. The man knew them well, almost as if he had been with them through their personal struggles. And Ty knew this man had no intention of leaving Zane alive, either. Ty had just been picked off first because Zane was hurt.</p><p>\u201cDid you see my welcome back present?\u201d the voice asked abruptly.</p><p>The question made him sound almost hopeful, like he was trying to please.</p><p>Ty was silent, listening to the odd scraping sound as a violent shiver went through him. \u201cI did,\u201d he finally answered softly, sensing that talking about Zane would get him nowhere. \u201cI especially liked the confetti.\u201d</p><p>Another soft laugh greeted his words. \u201cThat took a lot of planning. I wanted you to know how much I appreciate people who paid attention.\u201d There was a thoughtful pause while the scraping \u201cwork\u201d continued. \u201cShame. If you hadn\u2019t found my file so quickly, you would have been able to keep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour file?\u201d Ty asked hoarsely.</p><p>The man hummed in response. \u201cI\u2019m in that little stack you have; Baltimore \u201901,\u201d he answered regretfully. \u201cI understand you\u2019re the one who caught on to Poe, as well. Bravo, Ty, I must say. I expected Zane to get it first, him being the brains of your operation and all.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned. If he knew about both the files and the fact that Ty, and not Henninger, had been the one to figure out Poe, then he had to have taps.</p><p>Probably all over the Bureau.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still trying to solve it, aren\u2019t you, Grady?\u201d the distorted voice asked in amusement. \u201cYou were enjoying yourself, weren\u2019t you? Maybe not your partner, but you were loving this case,\u201d he said with confidence. \u201cWhere did you stash Special Agent Garrett, by the way?\u201d he asked slyly, as if he might have already known the answer. \u201cI do hope he\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed heavily and licked his dry lips. As their conversation continued, the man still sounded completely sane. That was possibly more frightening than even his situation. It would have been easier to deal with him if he had been delusional or something.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s safer than you are,\u201d Ty murmured, cursing his earlier stupidity.</p><p>If he\u2019d been thinking clearly he would have told the man Zane was dead or severely injured from the wreck. Now, he had practically sealed Zane\u2019s death sentence as well.</p><p>The scraping stopped, and the voice that responded was one of pure sympathy. \u201cHe\u2019s hurt, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s hurt, and you left him behind to go work on the case, didn\u2019t you, Grady?\u201d He tutted in disapproval. \u201cYou just couldn\u2019t let it go, that need for revenge. Oh, don\u2019t be surprised. I knew about you and Sanchez. He found the Baltimore connection, too. He even put a call into his old Recon buddy Ty Grady down in Maryland to ask him about it, but you never answered your phone, did you, Ty? You\u2019ve been wondering what that call was about since you got here, haven\u2019t you? You weren\u2019t there for Sanchez, and you won\u2019t be there for Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and lowered his head, pain lancing through his chest at the killer\u2019s accusations.</p><p>\u201cAh. You did leave him, didn\u2019t you? Embarrassed, are you? That\u2019s no way to treat a partner. You should be ashamed of yourself. What will he think when you don\u2019t come back? He\u2019ll think you abandoned him; left him because he was worthless.\u201d</p><p>Ty licked his lips and opened his mouth to speak, but no words came.</p><p>He swallowed with difficulty and then tried again, managing a hoarse, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be relieved to be rid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. I\u2019m not sure I believe you, Grady. Who else will he work with? Who else would work with him? He\u2019s a loose cannon.\u201d There was a soft chuckle. \u201cBut then, so are you. At least you\u2019re firing real ammunition. He\u2019ll be even easier to take care of without you around.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again, Ty was silent, and the odd sounds started up again. It was a slow, squishing sound, like a shoe stuck in the mud, and then a long scrape followed by several shorter ones. Ty couldn\u2019t quite identify it, but as he listened, he accepted with a sinking sensation that he was going to die.</p><p>SEARS brought Zane another glass of juice while he sat and flipped through the pages of the leather Poe anthology Ross had found. Ross sat with a pen and paper, making notes as Zane searched for similarities between the cases and the stories he read.</p><p>\u201cThe Murders in the Rue Morgue,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>\u201cThe ME,\u201d Sears provided with a wince.</p><p>\u201cRight. In the story, one woman\u2019s head is practically cut off. The other was stuffed into the chimney.\u201d Frowning, Zane shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThe location is what\u2019s important there, right?\u201d Ross asked as he made a note.</p><p>Zane nodded and moved onto the next. \u201cLigeia,\u201d he announced. \u201cFirst thing, the wife in the story dies,\u201d he said woodenly. He grimaced and kept reading. \u201cThe man in the story remarries, but he\u2019s convinced that his new wife is the old one, reincarnated or something, and he slowly poisons the second wife, who then dies as well. The second wife was described as raven-haired.</p><p>The first wife was blonde,\u201d he stated in clipped tones.</p> <p>\u201cThe dye-job roommates,\u201d Ross said with a nod without looking up from his paper. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t location; it was body positioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the wife thing explains the plastic wedding rings,\u201d Zane supplied tiredly. \u201cHooked together to symbolize they were really one person, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Sears murmured with a shake of her head. She was thumbing through the files that sat nearby, making notes. Henninger had pulled only the files of anyone who had lived in or around the Baltimore area in 2001, which included large areas like Washington, DC. The stack was huge.</p><p>An odd feeling of dread settled into Zane as he looked at the files. It was like searching for one particular needle in a fucking needle factory. How would they know which file was relevant? Even Ty\u2019s file was in that stack, and Zane\u2019s fingers itched to search for it. Instead, he paged through the book and found another story, one he\u2019d read over and over while in school. \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart,\u201d he announced.</p><p>Both agents looked up from their notes. Zane didn\u2019t need to explain that one.</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019VE been a fine conversationalist, but it\u2019s almost time for me to leave.\u201d</p> <p>The distorted voice was more muffled, and the light had grown very dim.</p><p>It took a while, but Ty had finally decided that he knew what the sound was. In hindsight, it bothered him that it took him so long to figure it out. He had spent one summer when he was thirteen years old helping his father build a small outbuilding on their property. It had been nothing but cinderblock and beam, but they had still needed mortar and a trowel. He had grown to love the sound of laying the mortar that summer. He was trying to come to terms with the fact that that sound would be one of the last ones he heard.</p><p>The fucker was bricking him in. He recognized The Cask of Amontillado now that his head had cleared and he knew what was happening.</p><p>This had been the only Poe story Ty had read and actually enjoyed. Ironic that it would be what killed him.</p><p>He turned his head in the darkness. He could see the outline of the man at the top of the wall he was building. When he spoke, his voice echoed off the cavernous walls of the catacomb and came back too distorted to even decipher an accent, much less if it was familiar.</p><p>Again, Ty felt the cold dread creep over him. It was his worst nightmare, one he had never actually dreamed; knowing his lover was in danger and he couldn\u2019t do a damn thing about it. His wrists and ankles were bloody from his silent struggles with the shackles. He was shivering from the damp and cold. But he hadn\u2019t yet given up. He couldn\u2019t, not while knowing that the killer\u2019s next stop would be Zane.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill you,\u201d he told the man who was in the process of murdering him. \u201cHe\u2019ll make it hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be disappointed if he doesn\u2019t try,\u201d the man answered sincerely.</p> <p>\u201cWell, three bricks left, Special Agent Grady. Time to say goodbye, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent as the man made some rustling sounds, as if he were crumpling a trash bag. Soon, a handful of white plastic was stuffed through the hole left in the brick wall. It was a plastic suit that had obviously been protecting the man\u2019s clothing from the mud and mortar. It fluttered to the ground and the candle flickered threateningly. As soon as it landed, the plastic caught the flame and flared, bathing the little room in a burst of light. It illuminated the tiny space, making the water dripping down the old brick walls shimmer.</p><p>Ty could see the heavy drilled brackets that bound him to the bricks with thick chains, and the solid wall of brick a couple feet in front of him that closed in the tiny alcove. He knew instantly that no one would find him here.</p><p>Not in time.</p><p>He glanced up at the face in the hole in the brick wall and swallowed past his shock as he finally saw the man\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he managed to utter to the face looking down at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, Ty. That\u2019s very kind of you. By the way, don\u2019t worry about the kid. He needs to be alive enough to pass on the news about you disappearing. But I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t make the same promise about your partner.\u201d</p><p>Three bricks left.</p><p>Ty fought back the panic that bubbled up. Even the glimpse of the man\u2019s face didn\u2019t make a dent in the cold curtain of fear that had fallen. What good did it do to finally know who they had been hunting if he was going to die here?</p><p>Two bricks.</p><p>The candle flickered as the wall was nearly finished. A soft gust of cool, damp air flushed through the small hole remaining. Then there was a thump, a wet plop, a long scrape, and a quiet slide of sticky mortar.</p><p>The last brick.</p><p>Ty swallowed as the outside world was shut out. He looked down at the candle, the flame unwavering but weak. When it ran out, so would he.</p><p>\u201cWE have five more victims to explain,\u201d Ross told Zane as he scribbled quickly.</p><p>\u201cBerenice,\u201d Zane answered as his entire right side burned with throbbing, incessant pain. \u201cThe woman whose teeth were all yanked and she was wrapped up in a shroud and dumped at the cemetery. Then we have The Oval Portrait, the woman who was painted with her own blood and stuck up on a canvas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s so easy to see now,\u201d Sears groaned.</p><p>\u201cA few more and we have them all. All except the agents who got too close.\u201d Zane was shaking as he continued to turn through the book.</p><p>\u201cJesus, it was right there all this time,\u201d Ross whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou told the Assistant Director about this, right?\u201d Sears asked suddenly.</p><p>\u201cHenninger was supposed to relay it,\u201d Zane answered with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cBetter make sure,\u201d Ross mumbled as he pulled out his cell phone and started punching buttons while Sears took his notepad from him.</p><p>Zane turned to the front of the book to look at the index as Ross swore at the phone and moved to the window. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he murmured as he scanned over the names of the stories he remembered reading years ago. \u201cThe Fall of the House of Usher,\u201d he announced to Sears as she wrote quickly.</p><p>\u201cThe character is suffering from extreme hypersensitivity. That\u2019s got to be the first guy, the meth overdose.\u201d</p><p>Sears nodded without looking up from her writing.</p><p>Zane paged through some more with his good hand. \u201cThere\u2019s one.</p><p>William Wilson,\u201d he said. \u201cA man kills his double. That explains the twins.\u201d</p><p>He continued to scan and passed on story after story. \u201cThere\u2019s a classic,\u201d he murmured to himself. \u201cThe Raven,\u201d he mused. He made to turn the page to go to the next page of the index.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sears said as she reached out and took Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cBird flu,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Ross paused in his pacing, still messing with his phone, and he looked over at them sardonically. \u201cWell, that\u2019s sort of clever,\u201d he commented before tossing his phone onto the couch and pulling Sears\u2019 off the strap of her purse.</p><p>Zane\u2019s face was grim. \u201cThat\u2019s all of them. There\u2019s got to be twenty more stories in here that he can play with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what? So we\u2019ve figured out the pattern, but it doesn\u2019t get us closer to him,\u201d Sears protested in disgust.</p><p>\u201cIt helps us understand how he thinks,\u201d Zane pointed out.</p><p>\u201cUntil your profiling buddy comes back, that doesn\u2019t do us much good,\u201d Ross pointed out as he paced and waited for the call to go through.</p><p>\u201cWe still know next to nothing about him,\u201d Sears pointed out. \u201cEven if we did, we can\u2019t leave you alone here to go do anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you most certainly fucking can,\u201d Zane insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter, and Grady and Henninger are going to need backup. Call for someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t call anyone from here. Something in the building\u2019s blocking cell service,\u201d Ross informed them in frustration as he waved the useless cell phone.</p><p>\u201cUse Henninger\u2019s phone,\u201d Sears suggested logically.</p><p>Except Henninger didn\u2019t have a landline.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going down to the garage and then up to the front of the building, okay? I\u2019ll be back,\u201d Ross declared, and he was out the door.</p><p>Zane nodded and pushed himself out of the chair to grab one of the personnel files. \u201cChrist. There\u2019s got to be some way to find this asshole,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>SPECIAL Agent Gary Ross hadn\u2019t gone far into the darkened parking deck when he stumbled over something on the ground as he jogged with his phone held out in front of him, and he almost went sprawling. He righted himself and turned to look, cursing creatively when he realized that it was a man on the ground. He knelt beside him and felt his pulse.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he hissed, recognizing Henninger\u2019s dark, curly hair, now matted down with blood. \u201cTim?\u201d he murmured as the man groaned. \u201cWhy the hell don\u2019t you have a fucking phone?\u201d he asked in annoyance as he began to gather the man off the ground. He glanced toward the exit signs attached to the ceilings of the parking deck, knowing that just a few more steps would give him a signal, but he needed to get Henninger inside and safe before he could go call for help.</p><p>\u201cPhone?\u201d Henninger mumbled weakly as he stirred.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Ross grunted, hefting Henninger up and dragging him back toward the elevators.</p><p>Sears was pacing and Zane would have been as well had he been able to walk, waiting for Ross to return. \u201cHow do we find him?\u201d Zane muttered from where he leaned awkwardly to one side, trying to keep the pressure off his broken ribs. \u201cWe need another murder, another city he lived in. Some dots to connect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to slip up sometime, especially since we know what to look for now,\u201d Sears assured. \u201cThe net\u2019s closing on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich only makes him more dangerous,\u201d Zane gritted out through the pain.</p><p>A thump on the door interrupted them. Zane glanced to Sears, who pulled her gun out from under her jacket and nodded toward the door. She carefully walked to the side of the door until she was right up against it before looking through the peephole. \u201cShit!\u201d she yelled, throwing the door open.</p><p>Ross was panting as Henninger tried and failed to stand. They staggered through the door together. Ross dumped the man on the couch with a gasp, and Sears kicked the door closed as she rushed to help them.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she demanded as she knelt next to Henninger on the couch, trying to check the head wound.</p><p>\u201cWe got jumped,\u201d Henninger croaked in answer as he winced away from her touch. It looked as if someone had hit him in the side of the head with something nice and blunt. There was enough blood that it had caked down the side of his face, and it would probably hurt like hell, but he was in no mortal danger. \u201cI saw him take Grady down with a cloth or something and then the lights went out. There must have been two of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloth?\u201d Zane breathed. He squeezed his eyes shut tightly.</p><p>\u201cChloroform,\u201d he groaned. They had been right about that aspect, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHenninger,\u201d he said thickly. \u201cWe need to call the Bureau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Henninger asked dazedly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so out of it, he won\u2019t have a clue what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d</p><p>Ross muttered, walking over to the window to peer out as if someone might be out there now, looking guilty. Sears sniffed and went to the kitchen for ice.</p><p>\u201cFocus, Henninger,\u201d Zane tried desperately, not even able to think about Ty being at the hands of this monster.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Henninger mumbled as he sat up and held his head, squinting at them all. He seemed to be having difficulty comprehending the urgency of a phone. Their need was even more urgent now; they needed every unit in the city on the lookout for Ty and his captor.</p><p>\u201cWe need to call out. How the hell do you get any of your messages?\u201d</p><p>Ross asked him testily as he jabbed at his phone again.</p><p>Henninger swallowed and rubbed at his ribs gingerly as he looked up at the other agent. \u201cI turn off the signal blocker on the window,\u201d he answered flatly.</p><p>Ross turned to him, confusion flitting over his features, and Sears stepped back into the room to look at them oddly. Henninger shrugged apologetically to them both before pulling a silenced gun from under his jacket. With two quick, quiet pops the gun sent both agents to the hardwood floor. He stood quickly and turned to Zane, who\u2019d only had time to scramble out of the chair and get a few steps away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d Zane whispered through a sudden stupor.</p><p>Henninger gave a lopsided shrug and a small smile, the gun trained on Zane unerringly.</p><p>Zane remained motionless, hand lowered out to his side, injured right arm useless in its sling. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ty?\u201d he rasped.</p> <p>\u201cDying,\u201d Henninger answered bluntly, his head cocking to the side with the word.</p><p>It took everything Zane had to hold it together as agony ripped through him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Henninger laughed softly, amusement written all over his slightly bloody face. \u201cYou know, Grady had the good sense not to ask me such a stupid question.\u201d</p><p>Zane let out a shaky breath. Dying meant not dead yet. He held onto that thought tightly. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was, indeed,\u201d Henninger drawled. \u201cAnd so are you. If you two were a little less smart we\u2019d not have two dead agents on our hands,\u201d he told Zane with a nod of his head at the two bodies on the floor. \u201cHad you found my file amongst the stack, yet?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe got too close,\u201d Zane realized aloud. \u201cJust like Reilly and Sanchez. You killed them in their hotel room. You were meeting with them, weren\u2019t you? About the case. They trusted you,\u201d he ground out. \u201cWe trusted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Henninger laughed. \u201cEveryone trusts me, Garrett. Even strangers,\u201d he grinned impishly.</p><p>Zane shook his head slowly, hefting his hurt arm up against him with a wince. \u201cWhy all the murders? You\u2019re too sane for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop moving, Garrett,\u201d Henninger ordered seriously. \u201cYou know, every time someone\u2019s asked me that I gave them the answer they wanted. It\u2019s such a trite question, really, but it\u2019s the only thing a dying person can think of, apparently. But you,\u201d he went on as he began stepping a little closer, \u201cyou, I can\u2019t read well enough to give you an answer. I\u2019m not sure what it is you want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice for you,\u201d Zane snarled, pushing aside desperation for anger. \u201cPut down the goddamn gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really in a position to be giving orders, Special Agent Garrett,\u201d Henninger murmured. \u201cAny more questions before I kill you? I\u2019m rather short on time, you see, having all these unexpected dead bodies lying around,\u201d he said in amusement.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you need from me to give me the answer?\u201d Zane tried, wincing and gasping in pain as he bumped back against the door with his injured arm. He could feel the gun Ty had given him resting heavily in his sling, though he\u2019d have to use his left hand to shoot.</p><p>Henninger tilted his head and narrowed his eyes, intrigued by the challenge. \u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d he asked finally, the amusement and enjoyment clear in his voice. \u201cWhy did you come back with that asshole for a partner and the very real probability that you would die? Grady, he came back for revenge. But you? Why didn\u2019t you just stay away? Stay away and drink and drug yourself to a quiet death?\u201d</p><p>Zane jerked backward in apparent surprise, slamming his useless arm against the door. He yelped and grabbed for his elbow, his good hand sliding under the sling to support it. He made a conscious decision to let the pain show clearly on his face. He was going to need his strength for other things ...</p><p>Weighing his options as Henninger watched in lurid amusement, Zane tried to decide what to say to get the most reaction. Enough reaction. He drew a breath. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>At that, Henninger stopped short in surprise. Then he began to chuckle. \u201cLove him?\u201d he echoed with a gleeful laugh. \u201cOh, that is rich! No wonder he looked so crushed when I told him it was his fault you were going to die.\u201d</p><p>The chilling edge of Henninger\u2019s words cut through him, and Zane drew another breath. \u201cI love him,\u201d he repeated, voice stronger.</p><p>Henninger laughed harder in the face of Zane\u2019s conviction. Within a heartbeat\u2019s time, Zane snapped his left arm out away from him, sending the slim stiletto from its sheath hurtling toward the killer with enough speed that Henninger couldn\u2019t dodge it. The knife buried deep into his upper chest, close to the shoulder of his gun arm.</p><p>Crying out in anger and surprise, Henninger jerked to one side as the knife hit, his gun firing uselessly off to the side, giving Zane just enough time to pull out his own gun and fire. The shot hit him in the gut\u2014the perfect wound since Zane wanted to interrogate him as he died a slow, painful death.</p> <p>Henninger staggered back, looking down at the burgeoning stain of blood in shock. Slowly his knees gave out, and he began to sink to the floor.</p><p>Arm shaking, Zane kept the gun trained on him as he stalked over and kicked the weapon out of Henninger\u2019s hand, sending it sliding to wedge under the couch. He crouched down in front of him, took hold of the hilt of the knife sticking from Henninger\u2019s shoulder, and twisted it hard.</p><p>Henninger cried out in shock and pain and struck out, hitting Zane\u2019s injured hip with as much force as a fatally wounded man could muster. Zane gritted his teeth as his entire leg exploded into fire, but he kept twisting.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d he ground out. \u201cTell me where he is, and I\u2019ll call you an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>The blood drained from Henninger\u2019s face as the pain took him over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so smart,\u201d he slurred as he struggled weakly. \u201cFigure it out,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cTalk or you can bleed out here.\u201d</p><p>Henninger merely laughed at him hoarsely. Growling, Zane drew back his fist and hit Henninger in the gut, close to the gunshot wound.</p><p>The edges of Henninger\u2019s vision darkened as he gurgled and gasped, but when the pain receded he managed another laugh. \u201cHe said you\u2019d kill me,\u201d he murmured as blood began to dribble out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHe said you\u2019d make it hurt,\u201d he told Zane tauntingly.</p><p>Anger and terror building equally, Zane stood up and yanked the knife out of Henninger\u2019s shoulder, ignoring the agonized cry of pain. He lifted the gun and pushed it to the killer\u2019s forehead, staring down at the man who knelt before him. \u201cHe\u2019s right. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>Henninger closed his eyes and shook his head. He knew he would be handed the death penalty if they found Grady alive. He also knew, deep down, that Garrett was going to kill him even if he did tell him where Grady was.</p><p>Garrett was just that kind of guy. Grady had too much honor to do it, but Garrett would pull the trigger in a heartbeat. He probably should have taken Garrett out first, now that he thought of it.</p><p>It was too late now, considering there was also the surprising factor of the fact that he had been gut shot and was going to die a slow, painful death if Garrett didn\u2019t do it fast. He preferred fast. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to get Garrett angry and make him lose his temper, and then ... sweet oblivion.</p><p>Henninger\u2019s lips twitched in a slow, amused smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve thought about what happens when I die, haven\u2019t you?\u201d he asked in a weak, pained voice. He would win either way, even in death. \u201cNo one will believe you.</p><p>You\u2019ll become Suspect Number One without Grady to back you up,\u201d he said with a quiet confidence. \u201cHow will you live with knowing that it wasn\u2019t love that made you so desperate to find him?\u201d he asked as he opened his black eyes. \u201cHow will you remain sober?\u201d he asked with a disdainful sneer.</p><p>\u201cKnowing it\u2019s only self-preservation that\u2019s making you so desperate?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s face went very still as his emotions settled into solid certainty, momentarily blocking out the pain. He used the gun barrel to nudge Henninger\u2019s chin up so he could see his eyes, and he put the gun back to the other man\u2019s forehead. Then he smiled coldly.</p><p>Henninger\u2019s eyes flickered open, filled with a sudden doubt that quickly faded back into the depths. Out of them all, Garrett had turned out to be the biggest problem for him; like a chameleon who couldn\u2019t decide on his color. He had been predictable at first, but then had begun to change to the point that Henninger couldn\u2019t decide what to do with him. Even now, Henninger wasn\u2019t sure what to do with him. As Garrett looked down at him, Henninger could feel, for the first time, the possibility of defeat creeping in on him.</p><p>Zane stood and drew a steady breath to speak. \u201cLuckily, you don\u2019t have to worry about that,\u201d he said softly, then he pulled the trigger.</p><p>Henninger\u2019s body jerked and thumped to the floor. Gathering himself, Zane went over to the window to search for the signal blocker. Finally, he found it and yanked the cord out of it, then grabbed the phone out of Ross\u2019s limp hand and hit buttons with his thumb as he swayed dangerously. He sank to his knees as his entire right side throbbed and burned viciously. The call was answered immediately. Zane gave the codes for officers down and perpetrator down, and then the location to the best of his knowledge before tossing the phone onto the coffee table, still open so it could be traced.</p><p>Painfully, he pushed himself to his knees and crawled to check Ross for a pulse. Grimacing when he found none, Zane shifted awkwardly and moved to Sears. She was gone, too. He hung his head, an agonized whimper escaping. He looked back at the murderer\u2019s body. No need to check a pulse there. The feeling of grim satisfaction gave him the strength to grab for the book he\u2019d left in the armchair. The answer was in there, somewhere. He felt sure Henninger had thought of Ty as another victim, not just someone in the way. Sitting there sprawled on the floor, he started paging through it again, shaking as he prayed it would give him some clue.</p><p>\u201cFuck all,\u201d he hissed toward the body. \u201cGod, please ... Ty...,\u201d he whispered as he kept turning, story after story, anguish encroaching as no inspiration hit until he couldn\u2019t hold it off anymore. It gripped him hard, and he curled in on himself, hot tears slipping loose and dotting the pages. He could hardly think through the pain and loss of blood.</p><p>Defeated, he looked up at Henninger\u2019s body. Blood was matted in his hair. Ty\u2019s blood? More stained his hands, along with traces of what looked like grit and dust from where he had laid on the concrete of the parking deck.</p><p>He must have taken Ty down with chloroform\u2014because Zane knew Ty would have hurt him badly if he had tried some other method\u2014hidden him away, then hit himself in the head just hard enough to make blood flow. All he had to do was lay on the ground pretending to be unconscious until someone found him.</p><p>The tears gave way to an ill resignation as Zane\u2019s eyes continued down the killer\u2019s body, looking for some hint. Henninger had been on his knees and fallen backward, his heels pushing to one side as he had died.</p><p>It took a long moment for Zane to register what he was seeing. The bottoms of Henninger\u2019s dress shoes were covered in gritty, gray mud. It was ground into the treads and covered the insteps. Zane pulled himself closer, almost out of energy. Reaching out slowly, Zane drew shaking fingers down the sole, and they came away covered with thick, damp mud. He stared at the dead body. They were in the city, and it had been dry all week. Where would he find fresh mud?</p><p>\"They even kept the original tunnels below the building intact....\"</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Zane hissed, grabbing for the book, ignoring the gritty muck coming off his hand onto the pages. He found what he was looking for: The Cask of Amontillado. \u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>Lurching to his feet, Zane collapsed again with a harsh cry, catching himself on the couch\u2019s arm with his good hand. He was too weak, and he hurt so badly he could barely tolerate it. He focused on the one thing he could. Ty.</p><p>Ty would be going crazy, stuck somewhere small and in the dark, like in the story.</p><p>He needed something to pump him up until he could get to Ty.</p><p>Stumbling into the bedroom, he made it to the nightstand and swiped up the bottle Ty had given him. Pulling the top off, he saw the caplets marked OC inside and shook them all out onto the bed. Ten pills. Without a thought to the dosage, he scooped up a handful, tossed them in his mouth, and started chewing. The dry, sharp chemical taste filled his senses when he swallowed, and he pushed himself out to the front room again and found his gun and the bloody knife. He grabbed Sears\u2019 gun for good measure and drew a deep breath as he felt the first wave of drug-induced energy. He wove dangerously as he headed to the door, the drugs already taking effect since he\u2019d bypassed the time release by chewing them up. By the time he got to the elevator, the high was rushing through him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, Ty,\u201d he murmured to the closing elevator doors. \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>TY struggled and called out for help until his voice was hoarse and his abused wrists were dripping blood down his arms. The chains held fast, though, and nothing but the flicker of the candle noticed his distress.</p><p>Soon he found himself hyperventilating, and he forced himself to breathe slowly in a desperate attempt to calm. He would surely die if he didn\u2019t remain calm. He closed his eyes, but realized immediately that the darkness felt heavier without the light of the candle. He opened them and stared longingly at the bricks. They were so close in the small space, but still unreachable.</p><p>Tim Henninger\u2014and Ty was still trying to get his mind around how horribly he had misjudged the kid\u2014had left everything incriminating inside Ty\u2019s tomb with him. His plastic protective gear, his tools, the bucket of drying mortar, and probably the cruelest of all, the keys to Ty\u2019s shackles, just out of reach on the ground.</p><p>Ty looked back at the candle with a growing sense of calm. He was going to die here. In the dark. He swallowed past the tightening of his throat and watched the candle. The flame had weakened alarmingly, and now its circle of light didn\u2019t even reach Ty\u2019s feet. As Ty watched it, the flame went blue, stuttering in the growing darkness.</p><p>Ty took in a deep breath of the stale, damp air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His head shot up at the sound of a voice echoing faintly on the other side of the wall. Was he hallucinating? He could have sworn that he\u2019d heard a shout somewhere in the distance. He stared at the brick wall in front of him, shaking convulsively with cold and encroaching shock. At his feet, the tiny flame spit and flared violently, then sputtered one last time and died.</p><p>He tried to call out for help, but his voice was gone.</p><p>The desire to simply close his eyes and let sleep take him over was almost overwhelming. Ty cocked his head as he heard the sound again.</p> <p>\u201cZane,\u201d he whispered to the hallucination, the sound barely a word as his head spun and he gasped for the nearly nonexistent air.</p><p>ZANE emerged into the darkened basement, lit only by a couple of bare, hanging light bulbs. He was shaking again, this time with manic energy instead of pain and exhaustion. The drugs had taken hold quickly and adrenaline and chemicals shot through his body at warp speed. He walked past the large furnace, looking around quickly, gun in his hand. He had no idea if Henninger had an accomplice or not. He came upon a long, ill-lit hallway that had doorways covered by chain-link fence on each side. Storage units.</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d Zane yelled, his voice echoing through the large space as he moved down the hallway. The echo was the only thing that answered his calls.</p><p>Finally, he spotted a darker hole in the wall at the end of the hallway, one that wasn\u2019t lit at all. Tunnels, Henninger had said.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t see into the rough-hewn passageway, and he quickly started patting his jacket pockets and found his lighter. Thank God he\u2019d talked Ty out of making him stop smoking. Annoyed with the restraining sling, he pulled his arm out of it and dropped it, then held up the flaming lighter and looked down at the dirt. It was gray, just like Henninger\u2019s shoes.</p> <p>\u201cTy!\u201d he yelled again, heading into the catacombs, bypassing the insets filled merely with old crates and construction debris.</p><p>Walking in long strides, hurt arm raised to shelter the flame, Zane almost kept going before he noticed that he had passed a space of wall where an inset should have been. Backtracking, his heart plummeted as he saw a square of clearly new brick in the wall.</p><p>\u201cTy....Ty!\u201d he yelled, running to the inset and touching the wall. The mortar was wet. He pulled out his knife and started prying at a brick with one hand and pushed it in. He heard it thump to the ground inside the little alcove, accompanied by the rattle of plastic. Then he dislodged another, and another.</p><p>From inside there was a clank of chains and a soft groan.</p><p>Zane frantically started pulling at the bricks, easily ignoring how they scraped and cut into his hands. The bricks reluctantly pulled loose; the mortar was closer to setting than not. When he had a rough opening, Zane leaned over with the lighter.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d he rasped, pulse pounding with adrenaline.</p> <p>Ty was strapped to the wall of the tiny alcove, his hands stretched out to the sides and above his head, blood running down them and clotting at his wrists. His feet were spread shoulder-width apart, shackled to the wall so that he couldn\u2019t even kick out, and a rope around his chest kept him from sagging forward. Everywhere the restraints touched him, there was blood. His head was bowed, his chin resting on his chest, and his fingers hung limply from his shackled hands. He didn\u2019t move, but a small groan told Zane that he was still alive. Barely.</p><p>Glancing around inside the alcove, Zane saw the plastic and the bucket of mortar. He cursed under his breath before seeing the candle and a rusted set of iron keys. \u201cThat son of a bitch,\u201d he breathed. Leaning over the bricks, he reached to light the candle so he could pocket the lighter and start digging at the bricks again. The drugs filtering through his system built up his manic concern, and he worked feverishly, heedless of the pain or his ever-increasing heart rate and lightheadedness. Once the hole was big enough that he could get a leg in and duck under, he did so, which put him right up against his partner. There wasn\u2019t much room. There wouldn\u2019t have been much air, either, and just standing there made him claustrophobic.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d he whispered, gently cupping his chin and raising it, praying he wasn\u2019t too far gone. Ty\u2019s head was heavy in his hand. But another groan came from his cracked, dry lips and he stirred.</p><p>Breaths harsh, Zane carefully lowered Ty\u2019s chin before moving to grasp for the keys he had seen lying on the ground. Fussing and cursing the locks, he started with Ty\u2019s feet, then moved to unlock the shackles on one bloody and cut-up wrist.</p><p>He\u2019d struggled, Zane noted with a lurch of his stomach. Oh, Lord, he\u2019d struggled. Zane\u2019s heart hurt with the mere idea of how hard Ty must have fought to cut into his wrists and chest like he had. When Ty\u2019s body sagged, Zane draped the free arm over his shoulder and fought to unlock the last shackle. The other man collapsed against him. Trying to pull him free, though, Zane couldn\u2019t get him away from the wall. He fingered the rope, and with a growl pulled out one of his knives and cut through it. Glancing to the uneven hole, he gathered Ty against him and turned them both toward it.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty breathed pitifully, the tortured sound barely audible.</p><p>The sound of his name almost tore Zane\u2019s heart out. \u201cI\u2019m here, baby.</p><p>I\u2019m getting you out of here,\u201d he promised.</p> <p>Ty seemed to be coming around, gasping at the stale air as if it were the sweetest thing he had ever tasted. \u201cAre you real?\u201d he asked Zane as he tightened his weak grip. His words were hardly recognizable.</p><p>Zane\u2019s laugh was tinged with a little desperation. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m as real as it gets, baby,\u201d he answered, stopping at the bricks. He drew several fast breaths, gritted his teeth, and lifted Ty totally from the ground. He moved very slowly and cautiously to step over the broken wall, setting his feet amongst the tumbled bricks, where he stumbled.</p><p>Ty\u2019s feet hit the uneven ground as Zane set him down, and he sank to his hands and knees. \u201cHenninger,\u201d he gasped as his head swam. \u201cIt\u2019s Henninger,\u201d he said urgently, his voice still hoarse and abused from the harsh chloroform and the desperate shouting for help.</p><p>Collapsing to his knees beside him, both of Zane\u2019s hands hit the ground in an attempt to catch himself. The jarring didn\u2019t hurt, and neither had the lifting. Instead, he felt hot, dizzy, and lightheaded. His pulse raced dangerously, and his gut burned with nausea. He was buzzing all over. He knew what was happening.</p><p>\u201cDead. He\u2019s dead,\u201d Zane bit out viciously as he tried to remember when he\u2019d last eaten anything solid and how many of what kind of pills he\u2019d taken. There had been a whole handful, but his memory seemed bright and fuzzy.</p><p>Ty blinked at the man, both of them on their hands and knees and looking as if they\u2019d just lost the fight rather than won it. He swallowed and nodded, unable to think of anything to say as confused relief washed through him.</p><p>Zane curled his hand around Ty\u2019s, looking up with glazed eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get you out of here,\u201d he said roughly as another strong swell of adrenaline and haze swamped him. He just barely quelled the impulse to laugh hysterically. \u201cRunning out of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Ty asked. His head was clearing and he was beginning to actually function once more. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Zane managed to shake his head and climb awkwardly to his feet, helping Ty up as well, and they leaned heavily on each other as they started moving toward the dim light. Zane was sweating now, and his arms and hands were clammy and trembling even where he held Ty tightly. \u201cAfter I took him out, I could hardly move. I took the pills you left me so I could find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d Ty asked in horror.</p><p>Zane actually laughed; a high, thin noise totally unlike him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve overdosed,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cFuck,\u201d he groaned as he tried to gather his strength and take more of Zane\u2019s weight. He stumbled with the attempt.</p><p>Managing a weak chuckle, Zane tried to hold on, but his entire body was shaking uncontrollably. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d Not really, though.... \u201cHad to get here. Had to find you.\u201d He lurched to the side as dizziness hit him, and both men fell to their knees, neither one strong enough to fully support the other. \u201cYou were in the dark.\u201d</p><p>They stayed there wallowing for too many moments before Ty pushed himself up and grabbed Zane\u2019s uninjured arm to pull him to his feet weakly. \u201cCome on,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never see daylight again; I can\u2019t die in here with you now.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed again. \u201cDaylight. I\u2019ve already got stars in my eyes,\u201d he drew out as he stumbled along beside Ty. He swallowed hard as they emerged into the basement. \u201cTy...,\u201d he gasped weakly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Ty growled almost angrily, his knees weak and his hands numb from being without blood for too long. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>Jerking away, Zane turned and fell to his knees to retch violently, too far into the drugs to be embarrassed or concerned. All he could do was try to breathe. Behind him, Ty sagged to his knees again, unable to remain standing.</p><p>He bowed his head and shivered. After a moment he forced himself up again and pulled Zane to his feet with difficulty.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Ty, more than anything,\u201d Zane admitted hoarsely as the elevator came into sight.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes, leaning against Zane and rallying with the unexpected words. He took more of the other man\u2019s weight on himself and practically dragged his gasping partner toward the doors of the service elevator. By the time he managed to get them inside and rising toward what he prayed would be help, Zane was no longer breathing.</p><p>y walked slowly down the sterile hallway of the hospital, watching his feet carefully so as not to think too hard about why he was here. After T traversing what he knew had to be the longest hallway in history, he found the room and stepped into the doorway, unconsciously biting his lip as he looked at the still figure on the bed.</p><p>He swallowed heavily and made his way slowly into the room, stopping at the bedside and looking down. Zane looked awful. His skin\u2014what of it wasn\u2019t mottled with ugly bruises\u2014was an unhealthy gray color under the soft light of the hospital room. Ty fought back the urge to feel sorry for himself as he sat down beside the bed and looked at the myriad of tubes and IVs that attached to Zane\u2019s hands and arms.</p><p>Hopped up, Zane hadn\u2019t realized that he\u2019d torn his hands all to hell on the bricks, and the further abuse to his broken arm had meant surgery to fix it.</p><p>The bandages around his palms and fingers glared white against his dark tan.</p><p>He\u2019d been in the hospital for a week and still looked this bad; like death warmed over. And the clich\u00e9 fit. The overdose had done a real number on him. By the time the EMTs had gotten to them, Zane had been in full cardiac arrest.</p><p>But he was alive, and that was all that Ty cared about. He sat silently, merely watching Zane as he slept. After a while, his vision unfocused and he was simply staring at the hospital blanket that covered Zane\u2019s still body as he sat by his side.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Ty winced at the soft word.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t had a chance to see Zane since they had taken him out of that service elevator. During the past week, no one would let him see his partner until he himself was officially discharged, and he had only just been released himself. They had merely told him that Zane was alive, and left it at that. During the time he\u2019d been confined to his hospital bed, Ty\u2019d had a lot of time to think about what he wanted to say to Zane. Ever aware of the prying ears and eyes around them, though, he bit back the more tender words he might have said. They didn\u2019t feel right on his tongue, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he echoed hollowly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s dark eyes were sunken, but they were open, mostly clear and focused. \u201cHow\u2019re you?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cHorrible,\u201d Ty managed to answer with a weak smile. \u201cThey tell me I\u2019m not allowed to kick your ass yet.\u201d</p><p>One brow slowly edged up in question. \u201cKiss my ass, did you say?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes twinkled and the corners of his mouth turned up slightly.</p><p>Ty glanced over his shoulder quickly and then stood to press a kiss to Zane\u2019s lips. \u201cI thought we\u2019d lost you,\u201d he muttered accusingly.</p><p>Zane brightened a little after the kiss. \u201cI\u2019m too stubborn to die when I have a reason to live,\u201d he murmured, watching Ty reverently.</p><p>\u201cYou damn well better be,\u201d Ty murmured as he sat back down, wringing his hands together as if he wanted to do something else with them.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m gonna beat the living shit out of you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises,\u201d Zane said quietly. \u201cI owe you a hell of a beating, too.\u201d He paused for a moment as they just stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cWanna call it even?\u201d</p><p>Ty made a show of thinking over the offer and then smiled slightly.</p><p>The smile fell slowly, and he looked over Zane seriously. \u201cYou are getting out of here, right?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You are waiting for me, right?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips compressed into a thin line and he looked away, flushing guiltily. Zane tilted his head to the side, and his smile turned slightly sad.</p><p>After everything they\u2019d been through, even after what he\u2019d just said, it appeared that the military mind-set was far too ingrained for Ty to be comfortable admitting what he felt for his lover now that the dire situation had passed. Zane wondered if he even felt anything at all.</p><p>\u201cEither way.\u201d Zane sighed tiredly, letting his eyes close. \u201cLet me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not gonna let me stick around,\u201d Ty said softly as he lowered his head.</p><p>Zane stilled for a long moment, then opened his eyes to see Ty at the bedside, head bowed. \u201c \u2018They\u2019 being the Bureau,\u201d he said, not questioning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty looked back up at him with open desperation, as if he were begging Zane to tell him what to do.</p><p>Pure joy swelled quietly inside Zane. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go,\u201d he realized, lifting his hand with difficulty to brush Ty\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cNot right now,\u201d Ty whispered in something close to outrage. \u201cWhat, you thought I\u2019d just leave your sorry ass after all this?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p> <p>Zane shook his head slowly, smile reappearing. \u201cSorry. Little slow.</p><p>I\u2019ll blame the drugs they gave me to counteract the drugs,\u201d he murmured. He didn\u2019t have to be scared. All of a sudden it was easy to accept that. \u201cYou care about my sorry ass,\u201d he added quietly, turning eyes that spoke volumes on Ty.</p><p>Ty was silent, his knuckles turning white as he clasped his hands together. \u201cI do,\u201d he finally agreed. \u201cAnd stop forgetting it,\u201d he chided gently.</p><p>Rather than replying right away, Zane turned his head fully to the side so he could rest and watch Ty at the same time. He studied the bed hair and the thinner face, dark with stubble. He realized Ty must have come straight here from being released. But to Zane, he was gorgeous. \u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed, then licked his lips. \u201cSo they\u2019re sending you off somewhere?\u201d he asked, back to the \u201cthey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLecture circuit,\u201d Ty answered bitterly. \u201cAgain.\u201d He looked away and then lowered his head, blushing deeply. \u201cThey can\u2019t put me on a case until ...</p> <p>they\u2019re sure I won\u2019t freak out in the dark.\u201d He sighed and closed his eyes, unable to look back up. \u201cThey had to leave me a nightlight,\u201d he admitted sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon and look at me, Ty,\u201d Zane murmured.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t respond, other than to open his eyes. He stared at the thin blanket over Zane\u2019s body for what seemed an eternity before slowly raising his eyes to meet Zane\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brave man,\u201d Zane rasped. \u201cI hope that the next time I\u2019m with you and it\u2019s dark, you\u2019ll let me hold you,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to,\u201d Ty responded in a broken laugh, \u201c \u2019cause all the current evidence points to the fact that I\u2019ll cry like a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Zane murmured without humor, raising his left arm so he could stroke Ty\u2019s cheek gently with shaking fingers. \u201cStill want you.\u201d</p> <p>Ty glanced over his shoulder nervously and then back at Zane guiltily.</p><p>Zane smiled. His eyes flickered to the empty doorway and back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s no one watching.\u201d</p><p>A pained look came over Ty\u2019s face before he looked away again.</p><p>Zane nodded, relaxing some against the pillows. \u201cI understand,\u201d he said gently. He didn\u2019t have the years of habit to break. He lowered his arm and rested it on the bed again. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Ty murmured, unable to look up.</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath caught for a long moment until he forced himself to exhale. There wasn\u2019t anything else to say, then. And nothing else to be done.</p><p>One more time, he\u2019d have to watch Ty walk away, and he couldn\u2019t do anything more about it than last time. \u201cQuick kiss before you go?\u201d he requested, knowing it would be hard if Ty was truly as on edge as he was acting.</p> <p>Ty closed his eyes and shivered. \u201cI do want you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want you to find me, as soon as you\u2019re free,\u201d he murmured as he looked up.</p><p>Zane nodded and watched the battle warring in Ty\u2019s expressive hazel eyes. It hurt more than he would ever have expected. \u201cTake care of yourself,\u201d</p><p>he said, exhaustion breaking past his bold front.</p><p>Ty reached impulsively and smoothed Zane\u2019s hair back from his forehead. He stood, bending over him to press a kiss to his forehead. \u201cWe can still cut and run,\u201d he whispered against the warm skin.</p><p>Swallowing hard, Zane shivered as hope shot through him. Hope for something other than the occasional flyby as they passed each other by while working. He had to try to ignore the twang he felt at the thought of leaving his hard-earned and well-loved job behind.</p><p>\u201cJust say the word,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes, his fingers tightening in Zane\u2019s hair. He was proposing they both give up a job they loved, give up everything either of them knew. \u201cWe can open up a flower shop and sell black-market orchids from the back,\u201d he offered with a slight hitch in his voice.</p><p>Zane smiled at the flash of humor, though he knew it was Ty\u2019s defense mechanism. \u201cJust say the word,\u201d he repeated quietly, though he knew Ty never would, and he wondered what he himself would do if it ever came to that. \u201cGo on. Go, while I\u2019m too drugged to stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I quit now, I couldn\u2019t stay here,\u201d Ty responded almost defensively, as if trying to convince himself to go. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay with you.\u201d</p><p>Calm in the face of Ty\u2019s struggle, Zane nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>Ty moved quickly and pressed a kiss to Zane\u2019s lips. \u201cBe careful, Zane,\u201d he breathed, then stood and swiftly walked away from the hospital bed, not looking back as he disappeared through the door.</p><p>THE motorcycle sped along Interstate 35 under the bright sunlight, skillfully handled by the rider in brown leather and a full-face helmet. The bike moved steadily through the thin traffic. The rider reached out and thumbed a button when the headphone in his helmet beeped for a phone call.</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d he shouted over the roar of the engine.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked and looked from side to side as he gunned the bike to speed up. \u201cWhat do you want, Burns? I\u2019m on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. Five months of Miami earns you three weeks of vacation. How are you, Zane?\u201d</p><p>Even more surprised to be called by name, Zane tilted his head. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he answered cautiously.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you, pray tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d Zane answered slowly.</p><p>\u201cHow is Texas? Sunny?\u201d Burns asked politely.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re in the middle of a blizzard,\u201d Zane deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cWell, your wit is still as sharp as a broken toothpick,\u201d Burns said with a sigh. \u201cVacation is over in four days. I want you here in DC on the fifth.\u201d</p><p>Zane pressed his lips together as he guided the bike off the interstate onto a lesser highway. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to Miami,\u201d Burns said placatingly.</p><p>\u201cMiami\u2019s a cesspool,\u201d Zane muttered, unconsciously repeating a sentiment said to him what seemed like years ago.</p><p>\u201cBe here in five days. The Bureau will pay for transport, if you like.</p><p>Get your head wrapped around the idea of a few easy assignments and a new partner while you\u2019re at it,\u201d Burns instructed.</p><p>Zane\u2019s gut clenched painfully. \u201cI\u2019ve told you. I don\u2019t want a new partner. What happened to my old partner?\u201d</p><p>Burns usually blithely ignored him when he asked about Ty, but now he cleared his throat and said, \u201cThat\u2019s classified. See you in five days, Special Agent Garrett.\u201d And the Assistant Director hung up.</p><p>Zane had to force himself to pay attention to traffic as his stomach roiled. He didn\u2019t want another partner. He only wanted Ty.</p><p>God. Ty. Almost six months had passed, and not a word. Not a message. Nothing but blind hope to keep him going. Work made it easier to forget. But after the second time being injured in Miami this past tour, Zane snapped out of the dangerous, depressive funk and figured out he had better listen to Ty\u2019s request for him to be careful or he\u2019d cut his chances of seeing him again to nil. He put in the vacation and transfer requests, and for the first time in five years, went home to Texas.</p><p>The last three weeks had been full of memories; old and new, good and bad. Ty was always there, on the edge of his periphery, and Zane felt like a part of himself was missing. What were the chances Burns would put him back together with Ty? Zane figured on absolutely none, and that was optimistic. If Zane had been put back in deep cover, then Ty had to have been as well. That was the other man\u2019s specialty, after all, and the classified answer pretty much confirmed it. But he couldn\u2019t help hoping. At least Burns might be willing to tell him how to contact Ty when they spoke in five days.</p><p>The bike sped out of the city and into the flats, giving its rider time to think.</p><p>TY sat at the end of the bar, watching the Orioles get the shit kicked out of them again and drinking a Sam Adams fresh out of the tap. He knew the bartender by name. He knew the waitress by name. He knew the drunk dude throwing darts at the public health poster in the corner by name. He had spent a great deal of time in this bar.</p><p>\u201cWant another basket, sweetie?\u201d Cindy asked him as she leaned against the bar next to him, a tray of dirty glasses and empty beer bottles resting on her hip.</p><p>Ty glanced at her and shook his head, offering a weak smile. He slid the empty basket of chips toward her, and she smiled at him as she took it and went on her way. Ty looked back at the television, watching but not seeing.</p><p>The Orioles were just painful this season. Finally, he drained his beer, setting the empty glass down with a clunk and slapping down a fifty with it.</p><p>He waved goodbye to all the people who thought they knew him and stepped out into the warm night air. He sighed and turned away from the corner where the cabs frequented, walking instead toward his row house near Fell\u2019s Point. It was a long walk, but Ty didn\u2019t mind it. The walk helped quell the part of him that prayed one of the cars racing along the narrow roads would just hit him as he shuffled across the street. Life was no fun anymore.</p><p>The job was no fun anymore. The bad guys kept getting away, and shooting them wasn\u2019t worth the paperwork. He couldn\u2019t even watch baseball without feeling the need to slit his wrists.</p><p>Fucking stupid O\u2019s.</p><p>He had tracked Zane right back to Miami, to an undercover job where Ty couldn\u2019t possibly contact him. They couldn\u2019t have sent him back down there unless he had accepted the assignment, and Ty was left with nothing but to wonder why Zane would do that.</p><p>The cell phone in his back pocket began to vibrate as he walked slowly behind a couple out enjoying the night. Ty growled under his breath and then reached back for it, flipping it open and answering with a negligent,</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop walking,\u201d the voice said on the other end of the call, \u201cand wait for your ride to pick you up.\u201d</p><p>Ty stopped dead in his tracks and swallowed heavily, resisting the urge to look around. \u201cYou\u2019re having me followed?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cOnly when you\u2019re thinking about going AWOL,\u201d Assistant Director Burns answered with a smile in his voice.</p><p>Ty was simmering as a black Yukon Denali pulled up beside the line of parked cars next to the sidewalk and waited for him patiently. \u201cAnd when is that?\u201d he demanded in a growl.</p><p>\u201cMidnight to four a.m.,\u201d Burns returned knowingly. \u201cHow\u2019re the broken fingers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroken,\u201d Ty grunted in answer. \u201cWhy am I being tailed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a new assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSe\u00f1or de la Vega had a nasty plane accident down in the Caribbean,\u201d</p><p>Burns informed him quietly. \u201cSeems the mechanic working on his plane had some broken fingers no one knew about, didn\u2019t get all the nuts and bolts tight enough. Get in the damn car and let it take you home. I want you in DC by noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your new assignments can go fuck yourselves, Dick,\u201d Ty grumbled. \u201cMy fingers hurt. And the important one won\u2019t stand up by itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo hold them all up and call it a flock,\u201d Burns advised in mild amusement.</p><p>Ty snorted. \u201cFlock of birds. That\u2019s funny,\u201d he muttered disconsolately to himself as he stared at the government vehicle stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Burns sighed, his voice taking on the tone of the mentor he had once been. \u201cDon\u2019t toss everything you love out the window, hmm? You\u2019ve tied up your loose ends, and you get to torture your new partner tomorrow.</p><p>Noon. I\u2019ll see you then,\u201d he said before ending the call.</p><p>Ty looked down at the phone as if it had offended him somehow, then up at the agent patiently waiting for him by the open back door of the Yukon.</p><p>Ty\u2019s jaw tightened as he looked up and down the sidewalk. Finally, he sighed and trudged over to the waiting vehicle, sliding into the back wordlessly.</p><p>ZANE ignored Burns\u2019 offer of transport, instead spending a couple more days with his parents before getting on the bike and heading east. He really didn\u2019t care what time he got to DC on the fifth day. Burns hadn\u2019t specified, after all.</p><p>He stopped both nights along the way and tried a lot not to think about what was waiting for him. A new partner.</p><p>It was a few minutes after noon when he pulled into the Bureau lot and showed his identification. Once he parked, he got a hit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. He\u2019d arrived like this last time. Same bike, same leather\u2014different jacket. His mother had insisted he cut his hair, though, so it was trimmed and neat once more. He had a few more scars. He\u2019d not told anyone about those. No one to tell, really, and they\u2019d mostly healed up.</p><p>Wrinkling his nose, Zane dropped the helmet on the seat and clomped his way into the building, grumbling to himself.</p><p>With all his contacts, he\u2019d managed to find out only that Ty had been released from Walter Reed on the day Zane had last seen him, but then he hit a dead end. How it was possible for Ty to just walk out of the hospital and disappear, he didn\u2019t know; agents not on assignment were usually pretty easy to find through the Bureau. He hadn\u2019t gone on the lecture circuit like he\u2019d said he was, that was for certain. The only thing Zane could come up with was that Ty was working something off the books\u2014not even undercover, but serious black-ops stuff\u2014and that meant he wouldn\u2019t be found at all. It had been frustrating as all hell as Zane searched for him. And now here he was, faced with a partner he didn\u2019t want in a job that was swiftly becoming more like work and less like something he enjoyed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGOOD to see you doing well, Special Agent Grady,\u201d the secretary offered insincerely as Ty entered the outer office.</p><p>\u201cGood to see the stick still firmly lodged, Princess,\u201d Ty responded as he walked right by her and waved for her to tell Burns that he was there. She puffed up angrily and jabbed at the intercom to announce him.</p><p>Ty entered the Assistant Director\u2019s office and stopped short. Over the past five or six hours, he had allowed himself to hope that his new partner would really be his old one. That Burns had finally pulled Zane out of that hell in Miami and brought him back to the Special Crimes unit. But now, he saw with a sinking sensation that his new partner was already here, sitting in one of the chairs opposite Burns with a leather portfolio in his lap, taking notes.</p> <p>Holy Jesus, he was taking notes.</p><p>The young man looked up and over his shoulder to study Ty as Burns started talking. \u201cSpecial Agent Grady, thank you for joining us. This is David Reese.\u201d</p><p>The blond man stood, clutching the folder to his chest. Bright green eyes shone through wire-rimmed glasses. \u201cSpecial Agent Grady,\u201d Reese said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Ty remained planted where he was, staring at the kid. He looked to Burns with sheer outrage glinting in his eyes. \u201cWhat the shit is this?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Reese blinked and looked back at Burns, who was smiling. \u201cDavid is a junior at Georgetown. He\u2019s interning with me this summer. Say hello, Ty,\u201d</p><p>the Assistant Director ordered pleasantly.</p><p>Ty stared at him, slightly nonplussed as he looked back at the kid.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he finally muttered apologetically as he stepped closer and took his hand in greeting. \u201cI thought you were my new partner,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Reese muttered as he shook Ty\u2019s hand. \u201cI feel for your new partner, man. He\u2019ll be crapping his pants.\u201d</p><p>Burns snorted.</p> <p>\u201cYeah well, he also won\u2019t look twelve, so he\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Ty huffed in return.</p><p>Reese smiled slightly, but he didn\u2019t appear amused by the crack about his age.</p><p>\u201cDavid, Special Agent Grady here is one of the more unconventional agents you may encounter here at the Bureau. Do not include him in your summaries,\u201d Burns cautioned with a smirk as he leaned back in his chair.</p><p>Reese nodded and smiled wryly. \u201cI should hope not, sir,\u201d he answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019d keep new recruits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d feed them to the military,\u201d Ty grumbled as he went over and flopped down into the empty chair. \u201cSo where is this asshole, anyway?\u201d he asked with frown. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me I\u2019m the one on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you are, although he\u2019s not far behind. Security said he came through a few minutes ago,\u201d Burns said. Then he looked to Reese. \u201cYou see, David, one of the more arduous jobs we have here is figuring out how to gather agents who work effectively together. Special Agent Grady here presents a particularly difficult challenge, as I\u2019m sure you can imagine.\u201d The young man glanced to Ty, obviously agreeing with the sentiment.</p><p>Burns cocked his head when he heard the outer door open and footsteps clomp in. The office door opened and Reese turned curiously to look. Ty was almost afraid to do the same, but curiosity got the better of him.</p><p>Zane Garrett stood totally still just inside the doorway, his eyes already settled intently on Ty.</p> <p>\u201cSpecial Agent Garrett, how lovely of you to join us,\u201d Burns drawled.</p><p>\u201cThis is David Reese, my newest intern. I believe you already know Special Agent Grady.\u201d</p><p>After a short pause, Zane nodded slightly.</p><p>Ty found himself struggling for something to say as he blinked stupidly at Zane. The lack of reaction was disconcerting. Ty had tried every trick in his book, trying to find a way to get in touch with Zane after the medical leave had ended. But an undercover operation trumped even fake family emergencies, and Ty hadn\u2019t been able to get anywhere before his own assignments commenced. He found himself wondering, not for the first time, whether Zane took an assignment he knew would keep him under on purpose, just to keep away from him after the haze of the drugs had cleared.</p><p>\u201cWell, David, it\u2019s time for your next appointment,\u201d Burns said pointedly, ushering the student out the door past Zane. The Assistant Director shut the door behind him and turned to look at the two men. The office was quiet.</p><p>Ty finally swallowed down his shock and looked from Burns to Zane uncertainly. \u201cHey,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Zane glanced to Burns as well, and back to Ty. \u201cHi,\u201d he said quietly, taking in Ty\u2019s features.</p><p>And there seemed to be nothing more to say. Ty finally looked down, unwilling to meet Zane\u2019s unreadable eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Burns said as he moved back to the chair behind his desk.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, if you choose to move from Arlington closer to your new assignment, the Bureau will pay for temporary accommodations until you can get yourself settled in DC. Paperwork\u2019s in the mail,\u201d he told them as he waved his hand through the air in dismissal, though there was the slightest twist of a smile on his lips.</p><p>Zane blinked, surprise and hope emerging in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re ...</p><p>partnering us again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t blow anything up again or kill anyone else, yes,\u201d Burns answered with some amusement as Ty glanced back up at Zane in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ll be working the DC area for now. No undercover work, no big cases until you\u2019re both ... mentally stable,\u201d he said with a wry smirk.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean this is a permanent assignment?\u201d Ty asked, his voice low and slightly hoarse. Burns merely laughed and leaned back in his chair again.</p><p>Zane had to tear his eyes away from Ty. \u201cNo objection,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Burns responded with a smile. \u201cNow get the hell out of my office,\u201d he said as the smile dropped back into his customary scowl. \u201cAnd take a fucking shower,\u201d he ordered. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d</p><p>Zane took an awkward step backward, watching Ty again, and reached behind himself to grasp the doorknob. He pulled open the door and waited. Burns\u2019 lips twitched as he watched, and he shook his head ever so slightly.</p><p>Ty looked back at the Assistant Director uncertainly and then nodded obediently, glancing at Zane as he passed by him out the door. Zane watched him the whole way and then followed, pulling the door shut as they left. He was completely oblivious to the secretary staring at them.</p><p>Ty slowed to a stop and turned to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. He glanced at the secretary and then back at Zane, turning again to keep moving without ever saying anything. After a moment\u2019s pause, Zane blinked and strode after him, out into the hall, catching up at the elevator.</p><p>Ty had his head down, waiting for the doors to open. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d he asked quietly without looking up.</p><p>Zane cast over the five months of hell in Miami. \u201cShitty,\u201d he answered in the same soft tone. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up slightly but didn\u2019t answer. The doors whooshed open, and he stepped inside the elevator car. Zane didn\u2019t hesitate to follow. He punched the button for the parking garage, and the doors slid shut. \u201cI tried to get in touch with you,\u201d Ty finally murmured without looking at Zane. \u201cThey said you were unreachable. You went back to Miami,\u201d he said bitterly, his voice almost accusing.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have much of a choice. It was that or New Mexico,\u201d Zane said. He didn\u2019t try to apologize. \u201cI ... I didn\u2019t know you were looking for me.</p><p>We were buried.\u201d He leaned back against the wall. \u201cI called in a couple times.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t tell me anything about you,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane sideways, really looking at him for the first time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been shot again, haven\u2019t you?\u201d he asked in resignation.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t try to lie. He just let his eyes drop. Ty nodded and looked away, the swirling in his stomach nearly unbearable.</p><p>\u201cDid you get your head on straight?\u201d Zane asked. The elevator stopped and the doors opened.</p><p>Ty stood there, looking out into the parking deck with a sort of distance to his expression that was fairly common lately. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered softly.</p><p>Zane swallowed, hurting. He reached out and blocked the door open and waved Ty through.</p><p>Ty walked past him with his head down again, hands in his pockets as he headed for his car. Suddenly, he stopped and looked up, inhaling deeply.</p><p>\u201cYou did have a choice,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Zane halted in place. He\u2019d considered the other option. Once.</p><p>Fleetingly. \u201cNo,\u201d he said clearly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give up on seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes wandered along the cement ceiling of the parking structure, his back still turned as he considered Zane\u2019s answer. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t worth it to leave,\u201d he finally murmured, as if talking to himself.</p><p>Swallowing on the pain, Zane closed his eyes for a long moment.</p><p>When he spoke, it was a rasp. \u201cWe can still cut and run.\u201d His shoulders tightened. \u201cBut now we don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood there for another moment before turning slowly to look back at Zane. He looked at the leather and the fresh scars, letting his eyes carry over them pointedly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t listen to a damn thing I told you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Zane flinched, and true regret was clear on his face. \u201cNo,\u201d he said miserably. \u201cNot for awhile. I wasn\u2019t....\u201d He huffed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ... there,\u201d he said weakly, waving at his head.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to be there to be careful,\u201d Ty growled in response. \u201cIt\u2019s common fucking sense, Garrett!\u201d he shouted suddenly, his voice echoing through the structure.</p><p>Nervously licking his upper lip, Zane winced and straightened his shoulders. \u201cWhat do you want me to say, Ty?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt won\u2019t change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to say you\u2019re sorry,\u201d Ty demanded stubbornly. \u201cAnd I want you to tell me how pissed you are at me for leaving when I did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so angry I saw red for weeks,\u201d Zane admitted. \u201cEven though I knew there wasn\u2019t a goddamn thing you could do about it,\u201d he went on, voice getting louder as he allowed the emotion to break through. \u201cI was furious with the Bureau for chucking me back into hell, and I was pissed with myself for letting them. For a while, the best thing I could come up with was hoping an injury would land me back in the fucking hospital,\u201d he growled, incensed, his eyes flashing. \u201cI would have done anything. Anything to get back to you. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>Ty exhaled slowly, calming. \u201cBetter,\u201d he said softly with a nod.</p><p>Shaking, Zane took a couple steps toward Ty, set a hand on his chest, and pushed him hard against the concrete pillar behind him. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d he demanded, the fury still clear.</p><p>Ty moved suddenly, shoving Zane away before grabbing his face with both hands and kissing him forcefully, right there in the parking garage.</p><p>Zane reeled back a couple steps as Ty\u2019s weight hit him. He got his balance and grabbed both of Ty\u2019s upper arms, taking those steps forward again and pinning Ty against the wall. It was a gloriously violent kiss that he poured all his anguish and anger into.</p><p>Ty gripped him mindlessly, not even concerned about the possibility of the security cameras catching them as they took out the past five months of frustration on each other. Finally, he shoved at Zane roughly, gasping for breath. When pushed, Zane turned and stalked a few steps away. He stood there, trying to get his breath, and he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry,\u201d he muttered as he dragged a hand through his short hair.</p><p>Ty rested his head back against the concrete wall and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Zane\u2019s emotions played openly across his face. He wasn\u2019t even trying to hide them. He was hurt, he was confused, and he was scared. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>he asked, voice aching. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to move again, to rejoin Ty four strides away.</p><p>\u201cLeaving,\u201d Ty answered as he opened his eyes again.</p><p>The frustration and anger faded as Zane took a good long look at him.</p><p>He looked like hell. He was tan enough that it spoke of time in some exotic location, but the arduous past five months fairly clung to him. His eyes were flat and tired, his face was scruffy, and even though he\u2019d slept, he still looked haggard. Three of the fingers on his right hand were badly broken and bandaged. The smoke of the expensive cigars he smoked was strong enough for Zane to smell without trying.</p><p>Zane considered barking at him for not taking care of himself, but it just wasn\u2019t in him. After so long apart, he didn\u2019t want to hurt anymore.</p><p>Slowly his feet moved, taking him closer to Ty until he stood less than an arm\u2019s length away. Zane couldn\u2019t stifle the sigh, and he resisted the urge to reach out and touch. \u201cI thought you were supposed to get better on convalescent leave,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I had some unfinished business to tend to first,\u201d Ty responded wryly, his voice low and hoarse.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Zane muttered. \u201cWe\u2019re both such a fucking mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worried about you,\u201d Ty admitted.</p><p>Zane sighed and lowered his head, looking up at Ty from under lowered brows. The proximity alone was easing his pain as much as anything.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you come home?\u201d Ty asked, letting the anguish leak through.</p><p>\u201cThe same reason you walked away,\u201d Zane whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c \u2019Cause you didn\u2019t know anything about black-market orchids?\u201d Ty asked weakly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s laugh was choked, but it was still a laugh. \u201cAllergies?\u201d he offered, trying to dip his head to meet Ty\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Ty lifted his chin and made eye contact. \u201cI still drink,\u201d he blurted.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I still smoke illegal Cubans. And I still take barmaids home and fuck them when I start thinking about you too much.\u201d</p><p>The slight humor left Zane\u2019s eyes, replaced with a carefully guarded look. He hadn\u2019t touched a drop. He hadn\u2019t touched a pill. He hadn\u2019t touched a cigarette, because that was what Ty had wanted. And he couldn\u2019t bring himself to touch anyone else. It was the only way he had to stay connected to Ty, to convince himself that Ty might still want him when they finally met again. \u201cIs that supposed to scare me away?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cNeeded you to know,\u201d Ty answered quietly.</p><p>Zane nodded slowly. \u201cAnd what do you need to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still want me around?\u201d Ty asked after a moment of consideration.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said softly, not yet touching like he wanted to. \u201cDo you still want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty breathed, the word barely audible.</p><p>Zane let out a pent-up breath and looked away. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he suggested as he reached for Ty. The sound of one of the elevator doors whooshing shut made Ty jump imperceptibly. Zane jerked his hand back, then he nodded and looked around them; he\u2019d forgotten they were in the goddamn parking garage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to check out a car or get a cab,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m on the bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove my truck,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t figure my new partner would want to drag me home,\u201d he said with a slightly sly smile.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. I wanted to get you on the Valkyrie,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance in hell,\u201d Ty answered instantly. \u201cI got those things out of my system a decade ago.\u201d</p> <p>Zane rolled his eyes and stepped back. \u201cShit, Grady. I gave up drinking, drugs, and smoking for you. I am not giving up my motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned slowly, a hint of the former mischief entering his eyes.</p><p>Zane crossed his arms stubbornly, sulking.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s unbecoming,\u201d Ty murmured as he reached out and took Zane\u2019s elbow. \u201cRide with me,\u201d he suggested with a smirk that faded into a smile. \u201cWe can catch up on the ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Zane gave a put-upon sigh and started to walk alongside him.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re coming back for the Valkyrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, Hoss,\u201d Ty muttered agreeably.</p><p>Zane\u2019s smile was big and silly. \u201cSo. Baltimore, huh? Think I can find any action there?\u201d he asked as Ty led him to an old green and tan Ford Bronco.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ty answered seriously. \u201cWhen the Ravens lose you can find any number of drunken people wandering the streets, looking for mindless physical comfort. And the two times the O\u2019s won last year were pretty exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a Ravens fan?\u201d Zane asked as he opened the passenger side door. He paused as he looked at the passenger seat and the door that he held onto, stilled by a spark of irrational fear that caught him every time. It was why he rode the bike almost exclusively now. Logic be damned, the motorcycle felt safer than a car. \u201cI mean, are you a ... a f-football fan?\u201d he forced out, unconsciously rubbing at his right arm as he made himself get in the truck.</p><p>Ty glanced over as he heard the stutter. \u201cThe Ravens were named for the story by Poe, you know,\u201d he said as he watched Zane. They both had their scars, inside and outside. He could see that now.</p><p>Zane met his eyes and slowly relaxed. \u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet there\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know,\u201d Ty told him with a small, teasing smile.</p><p>The corners of Zane\u2019s mouth turned up. \u201cYeah. There is,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Once they were out on the road, Ty reached over and slid his fingers through Zane\u2019s tentatively. His thumb rubbed absently over the wedding ring Zane still wore, then he squeezed his hand and kept his eyes on the busy road, not mentioning the ring or all the complications their new partnership might entail. Ty took his eyes off the road long enough to look over at Zane and smile crookedly. \u201cIt should be easier to sleep tonight,\u201d he said softly instead.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It will.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
